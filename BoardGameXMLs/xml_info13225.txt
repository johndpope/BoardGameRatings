							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Capcom Crossovers: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This game was created by two fellows this year, it is a home-brewed trading card game based on the Capcom VS. series of video games.&lt;br/&gt; The games uses a deck of cards to recreate accurate battles to that in the video game. It has a flexible combo system that will allow you to create custom combos but also has move attributes, combo types and combo costs that will limit their strength. There are quite a few options you may do on your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may discard a number card to basic attack, throws some face cards down or use some aces to punish your opponent with Super Moves. There is also a tag-team mode (two characters on a team) which allows you to use jokers for tag-team moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game requires a decent amount of strategy considering you may be countered or dodged.. There are over 20+ characters as of right now, each with their own unique abilities, play styles, strengths &amp;amp; weaknesses with more to come as the expansions progress. For a more detailed explanation on how to play this game please review the Rule Book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
