			<description>The title means &amp;quot;Crossword Puzzle Game&amp;quot;, and it matches that description very closely.  [The rules were in German, but I believe I have the gist of it.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is for two players or teams.  There are 2 decks of 60 cards, one red and one blue.  Each has 45 letters and 15 blocks -- which show a checkerboard but stand for the filled-in squares between the words in an actual crossword puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each side shuffles their letter cards and draws a hand of 10 cards.  The first player lays out a word from their hand horizontally, places a block card at either end of the word, and draws back up to 10.  The opponent then places a word vertically, using one of the existing letters as part of it, also capping its end with block cards.  Play continues in this manner, one side doing horizontal words, the other vertical, forming a typical crossword.  Only one word can be done per turn.  A word may be lengthened instead, the block being removed and replaced at the end of the longer word.  If a player cannot play he passes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a side runs out of cards, or neither side can make a new word.  The winner is the one with the most cards played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
