							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death by Nexus</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nexus of the Planes is the still-point between all the varied planes of reality. Here live The Prime Ones &amp;mdash; those that are and have always been, that exist above and beyond the gods. Embodying the Multiverse, in all its inconceivable infinities, The Prime Ones regard the concepts of Law, Neutrality, and Chaos as quaint ideological curiosities no more worthy of serious thought or debate than those of existence versus non-existence. Still, once in every 10^9 years, even the eternally laconic Prime Ones consider the alignments of gods, demons, and even mortals as worthy of casual examination, and perhaps their sporting entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;Death by Nexus is a DCC RPG Tournament adventure based on the character funnel format. This adventure is designed for 9 players, with each player having only 1 level-0 PC. As each PC dies, the  controlling player taps out of the game, and a new player rotates into the game with a brand new PC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
