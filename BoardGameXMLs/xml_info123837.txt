			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Majesty Computer game, inspiration for my conversion to dragonquest rpg, is a fantasy kingdom sim. In it the player creates guilds, temples, inns, marketplaces etc, recruits heroes from these places and set out various rewards to 'persuade' these heroes to explore the lands, battle wandering monsters, and complete quests. The player actually has no direct control over the heroes but rather develops his land to suit them, gives rewards of gold and such. I thought his is rather like the role of the Games Master in a rpg. Here the GM can set up a world and conditions, but rarely has any direct control over the actions of the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secondly, the game fits so well to the dragonquest feel, and especially the guilds and colleges set up. In the computer game your heroes belong to guilds (Warrior, Rogue, Wizard etc) or temples (Fervus, Krypta, Dauros etc). many of these very easily translate to the skill types available in Dragonquest (thief, ranger, troubador etc) and the spell colleges (fire, celestial, lesser summoning etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thirdly, the feel of the computer and epicness of its quests seemed to fit. they way some temples oppose each other, but in other ways guilds and temples compliment each other. Also much to the frustration of the player at times, your heroes just laze around in their guilds, or an inn, or gambling hall or shop, and then occasionally go off and do some adventuring, seem to fit DQ well. In the rpg their is a lot of character 'down-time' where they are paying upkeep fees, guild fees for healers and shapers, weeks of training, adepts sitting at home daring to cast a new spell for the first time etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These three points allowed me to combine the rules set of DQ with the feel of Majesty, so here we are. Enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
