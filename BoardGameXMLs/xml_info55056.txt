			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take your Modern20 campaign where it's never been with Supers20!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This major expansion of the Modern20 rules adds a completely new power system to Modern20, allowing you to design characters from any universe, any genre, any era of comics action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supers20 is designed, like the Modern20 rules it builds on to speed up character creation for players and the game master alike. This supers system has no power points, with powers being entirely feat based, allowing characters to be generated in a fraction of the time they would require in other systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book also features a rich selection of campaign models, along with generic NPCs who have just enough unspent feats and skills unspent for the game master to customize a fully featured supervillain in minutes. Your players will never guess you're using an NPC created on the fly and if they do, they'll be having too much fun to care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether your brand of comics adventuring is the disturbed loner meting out justice as he sees fit on the streets, or the last scion of a doomed world fighting cosmic threats in the deeps of space, Supers20 has what you need!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
