							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Terrible Tale of an Unsettling Tradition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, how lovely. Cousin Albert has arrived at the Hall for a family portrait. The fact that he's been expired for a week so really shouldn't matter, he is of course, part of the family after all. Now the staff are tasked with keeping Albert quite literally on ice until Lord Blackwood returns from safari and the photographer arrives. This shouldn't be a problem at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first Terrible Tale adventure for Monkeyfun Studios' dreadpunk RPG, Bedlam Hall.  Powered by the Apocalypse, players take the terrible role of servants for the Blackwood family who are quite&amp;hellip; different. The family&amp;rsquo;s troubles run the gamut between inconvenient relationships to terror-driven psychoses that can turn bloody and violent. Not quite the best employers to work for, in any sense of the word. Coupled with the house&amp;rsquo;s own peculiarities and a overwhelming need to maintain one&amp;rsquo;s own skeletons in the closet, every member of staff has their hands full to say the least.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you manage to survive the strange happenings and the family&amp;rsquo;s unnatural behavior while still keeping the house under control and your references in order? Play to find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
