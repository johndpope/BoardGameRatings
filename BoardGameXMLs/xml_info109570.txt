			<description>Lamborghini American Challenge (Crazy Cars III is an earlier edition) is a game released in 1993 by Titus Interactive. The game was published for the Super Nintendo, Atari ST, Amiga CD32, Game Boy, PC-DOS and Commodore 64.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is essentially an upgrade from Titus Interactive previous entry in the Crazy Cars series, Crazy Cars III. It adds a two player mode and a few more options, the game's most notable feature is its Jazz Fusion soundtrack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to become the undisputed champion of illegal races in the U.S.A.. To do so, the player must race against a group of computer controlled opponents in a variety of illegal races across the country. The races are divided into three leagues, each one with increasingly harder opponents, and the player needs to regularly upgrade his Lamborghini Diablo in order to keep him above the rest of drivers, by using the money from bets as well as the bonuses obtained when finishing races in the first place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;he races themselves take place in a variety of scenarios (mountain roads, the desert, urban settings) and they include weather conditions such as rain and snow. At the end of each league, and in order to be able to join the next one, the player has to go through a &amp;quot;challenge&amp;quot;, consisting of a timed race in a highway infested with trucks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Lamborghini American Challenge&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
