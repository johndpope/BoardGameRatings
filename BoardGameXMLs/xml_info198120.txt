							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Goblin</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Goblin is a story roleplaying game about dark nobility in a mythic land. The thirteen great goblin tribes have gathered to elect a new leader. To end the suffering of the ages, someone must unite the tribes &amp;mdash; the once-noble blood of the goblins. Flesh-made-whole and all that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But alas, each goblin believes that he or she deserves to be leader. As the saying goes, &amp;ldquo;princes to the last.&amp;rdquo; No goblin wants to serve under the foot of the throne, when so easily he or she can rule as king or queen. But the Fates will cast the final die in this &amp;lsquo;contest&amp;rsquo; to be the true goblin monarch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What the Fates decree is law.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Goblin is a sister game to Lady Winter, set in the land of myth. These are not the snot-nosed goblins of standard fantasy convention, but &amp;lsquo;noble savages.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
