			<description>Bistouris is a game of plastic surgery.&lt;br/&gt;Each player is a patient AND a doctor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in two rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First round, each player roll dice, move on the board and draw cards to create their own (and awful) bodies.&lt;br/&gt;When the body of each player is done, the second round begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the begining of the second round, each player draw a &amp;quot;perfect body&amp;quot; card to know what they need to change on their bodies.&lt;br/&gt;Now players roll dice and move again on the board and try to reach on &amp;quot;surgery&amp;quot; squares to have surgery from other players... but beware... surgical procedures may fail and you end up with a body worse than before and you have twice as much work !!!&lt;br/&gt;Other players bet on the result of the surgery and if it fail, the surgeon must explain what's went wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player who manages to have a perfect body (as his &amp;quot;perfect body&amp;quot; card&amp;quot;) is the winner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
