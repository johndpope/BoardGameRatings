			<description>&amp;quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner (真・女神転生 デビルサマナー) is a Japanese console role-playing game originally released for the Sega Saturn in 1995, and later re-released in a slightly-enhanced port for the PlayStation Portable in 2005. The game was never released in North America, though at one time a release of the Sega Saturn version was planned and later cancelled. Devil Summoner is a spinoff of the Megami Tensei series of games. There have been two sequels to Devil Summoner, including Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army, which was localized into English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original Devil Summoner was the first Megami Tensei title for the Sega Saturn. Abandoning the post-apocalyptic themes of the original series, the story takes place in modern Japan. The player character is an unnamed college student who is attacked by demons along with his girlfriend; they are saved by the timely appearance of a suave demon-hunter named Kyouji. Shortly thereafter, Kyouji is found dead under suspicious circumstances. The protagonist is then trapped inside of a warehouse and murdered by a deranged killer named Sid. Rather than stay dead, the player finds himself in the reanimated body of the slain Kyouji, and escapes from the morgue. With the help of Kyouji's voice, which guides the player from inside his head, the main character joins up with Kyouji's female partner Rei in order to save the life of his girlfriend, who is still in danger.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Shin_Megami_Tensei:_Devil_Summoner,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
