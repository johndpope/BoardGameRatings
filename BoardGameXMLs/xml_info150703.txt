			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are your undead just another monster for adventuring Holy Men to turn their Holy Symbol against? With imagination they can be much more &amp;ndash; a messenger, seer, guide, or plot hook! Ghosts, Specters, Spirits, and other incorporeal creatures have a long and distinguished history in myth and legend filling these roles and more. Adventures can be more interesting when Adventurers have to understand and interact with the spirit, not merely slay it. Ghost Stories is a useful resource and rule book for Games Masters that combines a large number of pre-generated undead characters with the tables for creating unique and challenging undead encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first part of Ghost Stories describes eighty incorporeal creatures, some for outdoors use and some for the dungeon. Every spirit&amp;rsquo;s name, gender, alignment, age and marital status at death, and time/cause of death is given. Each entry also includes the spirit&amp;rsquo;s means to communicate, a short description of their death, and some places and treasures they have knowledge about. These are Ghosts with a history, a purpose, and sometimes an attitude, around which a Games Master can build an encounter, task, quest, or adventuring site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a further aid, the second part of Ghost Stories contains random tables suitable for generating unique incorporeal creatures, and for rolling the essential elements of a spirit&amp;rsquo;s story. The tables can provide the Games Master more incorporeal characters and plot hook ideas to make undead encounters interesting, entertaining, memorable, and integral parts of the campaign. These tables produce one-of-a-kind creatures whose abilities and attacks are unpredictable and challenging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
