			<description>Kampfgruppe Commander is the winner of the prestigious Origins Award. This updates third edition adds two scenarios, a template for vehicle cards, and makes many small tweaks to the system --incorporating ten years of player feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A poorly led Soviet tank brigade uses its entire turn simply to move and fire at an enemy held town. The German commander now seizes his chance. With superior command quality, his Panzers move twice to come out of seemingly nowhere to strike at the Soviet&amp;rsquo;s flank. An exchange fire leaves one Soviet unit broken and other shaken. The Panzers then move out of harms way. The mobile defense prevails!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most WWII rules leave you wondering how the Germans ever won a battle. Usually they fought outnumbered and against opponents with equal or superior equipment. So how did they ever win? The answer lays in their outstanding unit level leadership. Kampfgruppe Commander III places leadership quality at the forefront. Using the game&amp;rsquo;s unique and fast-paced leader activation system, German units simply fight with more options and capabilities than their opponents. And each allied army fights differently with its unique command abilities that develop as the war progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kampfgruppe Commander III recreates all aspects of grand tactical mobile warfare using a scale of Company sized, multi-stand units. Infantry battles are as fast-playing and interesting as tank duels. The game&amp;rsquo;s mechanics are fast and simple, yet full of historical flavor. Small to medium sized games can be played in under two hours, or larger battles involving whole divisions in an evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the 136-page book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Complete Rules.&lt;br/&gt;     Eight scenarios introduce players to the simple, yet unique game mechanics and illustrate basic battle tactics.&lt;br/&gt;     Complete Tables of Organization and Unit Data for Germans, Italians, Americans, British, French, Soviets, and Polish.&lt;br/&gt;     Player Aid Cards and Unit Information Sheets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
