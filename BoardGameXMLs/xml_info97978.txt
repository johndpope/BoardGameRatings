			<description>From Publishers Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic 10 offers a creative way to master basic number combinations. The game helps players understand how different number arrangements can add up to 10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using both the die and playing pieces, players create different Magic 10 combinations. At the same time, players are encouraged to develop reasoning strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brightly colored plastic playing pieces and number templates help players learn basic math skills. Along the way, players attempt to gather as many playing pieces as possible to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
