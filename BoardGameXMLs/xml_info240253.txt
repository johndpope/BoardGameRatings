			<description>Fans of the TV hit Supernatural know that Sam and Dean abide by certain rules to keep themselves safe. One of said rules is keeping innocent people out of harm&amp;rsquo;s way&amp;mdash;but rules were meant to be broken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Winchesters finally got a Supernatural card game, appropriately titled Save Your Souls. It breaks all the rules the brothers strictly obeyed&amp;hellip;or so you thought!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sam and Dean Winchester need your help. Join them on a card game journey to save innocent lives. Ok, well mostly, the goal is to save your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game of chance, you&amp;rsquo;re paired with one of the series&amp;rsquo; iconic hunters, an angel, or even the King of Hell himself. Be careful! You must choose your cards wisely, or you could end up losing your soul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
