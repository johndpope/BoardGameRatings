			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the first games created and released by Apple, Through the Looking Glass is a game of chess in which you control Alice from Charles Lutwidge Dodgson's famous novel. Each round, you take control of the piece you want and apply any of its possible legal moves. Your objective is to capture enough enemy pieces to lead to the enemy's defeat. Your score fluctuates throughout the game and is based on the value of enemy pieces taken versus the value of your own pieces lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
