			<description>The game consists of tiles showing postage stamps. The tiles are shuffled and placed on the table in a grid, leaving some spaces free. Each player gets a secret collector's interest tile, showing which kind of stamps s/he collects. &lt;br/&gt;In a turn, the active player picks up a tile, shows it to everyone and places it facedown in one of the free spaces in the grid. This continues until all tiles have been flipped over. In subsequent turns, a player can either swap two facedown tiles, move a facedown tile to an empty space or flip open a tile, putting it back to where it was. &lt;br/&gt;When a player thinks that there are five stamps of his/her field of interest in a row, s/he flips these open to check. If correct, points are scored. Other players get as many points as &amp;quot;their&amp;quot; tiles are in a row as well. &lt;br/&gt;The player who scored most points after a certain number of rounds is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
