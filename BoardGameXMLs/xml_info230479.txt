			<description>Hind &amp;amp; Seek is a ruleset all about asymmetrical warfare and is aimed at company to battalion sized games, in 6mm or 3mm scale. Larger scales can be used just as easily, from 10mm and 15mm, up to 1/72 scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules are based on the real-life accounts of actual combatants, largely from the books The Bear Went over the Mountain and The Other Side of the Mountain. Care has been taken to make the game feel like a Soviet-Afghan wargame; The Soviets may be able to take lots of tanks and helicopters, but when the enemy is ambushing from hidden positions on high ground, the tanks wont be able to target them and the helicopters wont even know where they are. Tanks will need to back off from areas of high ground in order to get a shot and helicopters will have to spot the hidden ambushers, or rely on information from the ground in order to work out where the Dushman (Enemy) are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end this game is all about asymmetrical warfare and providing the feel and tactics of the period. The game naturally encourages real-life tactics and unit organizations (although example soviet organizations are also provided) and each faction has its own unique tactical choices and challenges to overcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are provided for Infantry (both regular squads and specialist teams like spotters and heavy weapon teams), vehicles (from the humble transport truck to the various BTRs, BMPs, BMD and heavier armor of the soviets.) and helicopters. Vehicle and anti-vehicle rules have been streamlined to be as simple as possible and allow the focus to be on infantry. Rules for suppression, morale and infantry quality are all part of the package. Helicopters and vehicles can transport troops and helicopters can land and take off in-game, or be called in by spotters, provided there are enemy targets around...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games take anywhere from an hour and a half to 2 hours for larger games and a variety of markers are provided with the rules for ease of play. A 6' X 4' or 4' X 4' table is recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
