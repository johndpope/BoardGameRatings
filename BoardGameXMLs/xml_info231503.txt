			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arena is a fast game reproducing gladiators&amp;rsquo; combats. Nine different typologies of gladiator are available. Each gladiator plays with a deck of 15 cards, different for each typology. The combat is divided in turns. In each turn a gladiator plays with 3 action cards, using only 2 of them for trying to hit his adversary or escape from him.&lt;br/&gt;The match is played on a hex grid.&lt;br/&gt;It is possible to reproduce single combats, organize full days of competition and follow the carrier of the gladiators from the beginning to freedom (or death in the arena).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
