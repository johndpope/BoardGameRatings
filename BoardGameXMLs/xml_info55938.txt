			<description>Subtitle: Universal Roleplaying Game Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PlainLabel Game System (or PlainLabel for short), of which Simply Roleplaying! is Volume 1, is built on three concepts we feel essential to any adventure game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first is simplicity. We believe that the whole game process, from creating characters to running adventures, should be easy and fast. It should not take an hour to make a character, nor five minutes to judge a single event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second is flexibility. Though no game system can be everything to everyone, PlainLabel is designed to adapt to a broad range of styles of play &amp;mdash; realistic to cinematic, dark and brooding to light and breezy, detailed to freeform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third is gamemaster creativity. PlainLabel&amp;rsquo;s basic rules are few, clear and uncomplicated. This leaves space for the worldmakers to create new rules and make the judgments which best suit their preferred modes of play. It&amp;rsquo;s all about having fun and keeping it simple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These core rules provide a framework for adventures from the Ancient World to the Far Future and beyond. Expansions will bring worlds of fantasy and magic, cities where superhuman heroes protect the innocent from evildoers, galactic empires filled with new lifeforms and civilizations, and even more amazing locales. There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of adventure to be found in the Real World, too: in a police SWAT team, or as famous crusading reporters, or as occult investigators shining light into the darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
