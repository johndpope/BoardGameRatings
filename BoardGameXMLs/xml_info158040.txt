			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I once (very recently) said, &amp;quot;Give a GM a magic item and they will have a 10 result for a treasure roll, but show a GM how to make a magic item, and they will have as many 10 results as they need.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I figure, why not do both?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is more than just a collection of magic items. I mean yeah, there are 32, with tweaks to modify them, as well as notes, uses, and example miss moves for some, but it also contains advice both on how to make your own, as well as what to subject the players to if they want to make their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you are a new GM, just want more items, have trouble coming up with your own stuff, are strapped for time, and/or have extensive experience with other fantasy role-playing games in which a numerical prefix is enough to qualify an item as magical, this book will give you the resources to help better portray a fantastic world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
