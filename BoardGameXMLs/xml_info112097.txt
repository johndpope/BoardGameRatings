			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;This is an adventure suited for any Dr. Who RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Called Children of the Daleks, it's a crossover between Dr. Who and Alien.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landing for some reason (probably a malfunction of some sort) on the planet Ceres-18, a terra-formed agricultural research station, the Time Lord and companions find themselves in a valley containing extensive farmland.  The only buildings are a cluster of houses, barns and labs some way away.  They find nobody about on their way to the farm.  When they get nearer, they see someone being chased by a Dalek, shouting &amp;quot;Do-Not-Move! You-Will-Be-Exterminated!&amp;quot; etc.  A group of PCs should be able to overpower one Dalek if they surprise it (that happens quite often in the series). They learn that another Dalek is guarding all the other scientists and their families.  After (hopefully) overcoming this one, they can be&lt;br/&gt;informed of what has gone before.  Two days earlier, a small spaceship crash-landed in the now-abandoned terraforming plant.  The colonists were about to investigate when a Dalek ship landed.  This surprised the colonists, as the Daleks have, at this point in their history, suffered major defeats and are in retreat.  The Daleks captured the unarmed colonists, imprisoning all but eight of them.  These were taken away on a hoverplatform to the terraforming plant, as slave-workers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
