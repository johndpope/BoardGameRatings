							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Campaign Atlanta</name>
									
			<description>At the beginning of 1864, the Union was poised to begin its final drive into the deep South. The plan was simple: General William T. Sherman and his three separate armies with over 110,000 men, would advance south, seek and destroy the Confederate Army of Tennessee, and capture the great Confederate city of Atlanta.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, a determined General Joseph E. Johnston was ordered to stop this invasion. Johnston's plan was also simple: fortify and defend each mile of southern territory, inflict ever greater losses on the enemy, and force them into a costly mistake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cleverly using the difficult terrain of northern Georgia, Johnston's plan nearly worked. But after a hard fought campaign, Sherman took Atlanta, dealing a major blow against the Confederacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you can refight the entire 120 mile march to Atlanta, or face the invaders at places like Rocky Face Ridge, Resaca, Kennesaw Mountain, and even Atlanta itself. Your choices will decide the fate of Confederacy. Fight well and bring victory to your chosen side.&lt;br/&gt; The heart of Atlanta  is the campaign system.  At each stage of a campaign, players choose from 2-4 operational decisions that will result in a tactical battle to be played out on an expansive map, providing room for maneuver. The campaign is non-linear, with both offensive and defensive operational options available to each side. Though every scenario may also be played as a stand-alone, the bulk of the scenarios are integrated into the operational/tactical campaigns, providing a high degree of replay value.&lt;br/&gt; 134 stand alone scenarios and 96 campaign scenarios&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 different campaigns for a varied campaign experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historic battles include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Rocky Face Ridge&lt;br/&gt;-Resaca&lt;br/&gt;-Cassville&lt;br/&gt;-New Hope Church&lt;br/&gt;-Pickett's Mill&lt;br/&gt;-Dallas&lt;br/&gt;-Kolb's Farm&lt;br/&gt;-Kennesaw&lt;br/&gt;-Smyrna&lt;br/&gt;-Peachtree Creek&lt;br/&gt;-Ezra Church&lt;br/&gt;-Sunshine Church&lt;br/&gt;-Utoy Creek&lt;br/&gt;-Jonesboro&lt;br/&gt;-Allatoona&lt;br/&gt;-Atlanta&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;What if&amp;quot; battles include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Chattahoochie River Line&lt;br/&gt;-Siege of Atlanta&lt;br/&gt;-Sherman's advance&lt;br/&gt;-meeting engagements&lt;br/&gt;-and many variants of both historical and &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot; scenarios&lt;br/&gt; The largest map yet featured in the CWB series. Over 100 miles in continuous length, that's over 1,300 hexes north to south. More than 500,000 hexes in total!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large maps and inclusive orders of battle offer unlimited possibilities for user-created scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
