			<description>To understand the game Lim you first have to understand Leeyon's Cube Cards. &lt;br/&gt;The Cube Cards are a new game system that lets the players create a 3D world with 2D cards. Because of its unique 3D aspect, It lends itself for a new kind of games, 3D building card games (3D-BCG).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lim is played with Leeyon's Letter Cube Cards. The object of Lim is to score the most points after 10 rounds. Points are scored by connecting the Letter Cube Cards together to form words. By connecting them in a smarter way than your opponent, you score higher points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In every round one player takes the role of the Word Challenger(W.C.). He/She then challenges the Word Defender(W.D.) by calling out a word. The W.D. then has to form the word by using the Letter Cube Cards. After the W.D. is done the W.C. can challenge the defenders play. If the W.C. gets more points he/she can add them to his/her score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the next round the W.C. becomes the W.D. and The W.D. becomes the W.C. The game continues like that until the 10th round is reached. The player with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the round the W.C. keeps score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
