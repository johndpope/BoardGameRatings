							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Herilian Agenda</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard RPGA Network tournament for a team of three to six 5th-level agents (though the serial&amp;rsquo;s challenges and XP rewards are tiered so that the serial can be played by up to six agents of levels 10, 15, or 20 as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Living Spycraft serial is a crossover with the Stargate SG-1 universe and several events and characters derived from the series. The main &amp;ldquo;villain&amp;rdquo; presented here is Diancecht, an original System Lord never seen in the Stargate SG-1 TV show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Herilia is farther from its sun than Earth, making it a world that struggles to reach twilight at full noon. This lack of sunlight is offset by rampant greenhouse gasses, which make it a habitable, but dim, world. The inhabitants have adjusted, over generations, to these conditions, but the agents are likely to find the place slightly more difficult to navigate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On this world, a Goa&amp;rsquo;uld named Diancecht seeded a group of humans of Celtic descent. The Herilians threw off his rule in a bloody rebellion centuries ago, taking advantage of the fact that Diancecht&amp;rsquo;s resources were spread thin at the time due to a particularly bloody war with another System Lord. Diancecht didn&amp;rsquo;t return for over a hundred years, after his affairs were back in order, but by then Herilia had forged its own independence, and the System Lord was unable to conquer the planet by force. Instead, he worked behind the scenes, slowly shaping the society&amp;rsquo;s development in an experiment to see whether a world could be more useful to him if its inhabitants didn&amp;rsquo;t know he was really in charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
