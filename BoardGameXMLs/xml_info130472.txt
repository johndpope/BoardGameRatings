			<description>Dusk - Rise of the Occulites II is the second game in the Rise of the Occulites Saga. The Occulite Tribes have expanded from their small groups of five, to much larger numbers. Over time individuals in these groups have evolved into specialist roles within their Tribe. Each Tribe pushes towards different objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a Stratego-like fog of war to place your characters on a modular map. Each character has an ability which can only be utilised when it is revealed. The game also features the 'Natural Selection Deck' which first appeared in original game in the Saga: Dawn - Rise of the Occulites. You draw your hand of cards from the Natural Selection Deck during the game which you use to activate characters, move, fight, resolve events and activate special Tribal abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revealing your characters at the right time and using the 'Natural Selection Deck', your Tribe's abilities and the features of the map effectively will help you complete your objectives and win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The composition of each Tribe is different and plays differently. The game offers a number of different Objectives of which between 1 and 3 are selected secretly before the game. The winner is the player who completes all his or her objectives first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
