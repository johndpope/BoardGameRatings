			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lion &amp;amp; Dragon is a Medieval Authentic OSR game. Until now, you only thought you were playing &amp;quot;medieval fantasy&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Lion &amp;amp; Dragon, the rules of the original tabletop RPG have been adapted to create a more historically authentic medieval experience, to reflect the grittier and yet more mythic world of a magical medieval Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;L&amp;amp;D includes new rules governing social class and materials on culture to help a GM craft a world that feels closer to the world of the 100-years war or the War of the Roses. It has a grittier and more dangerous feel to reflect the cheapness of life at the time. Also included are sections on medieval economics, law &amp;amp; justice, and chapters with monsters and magical items based on authentic medieval legends. Finally, a completely revamped magic system is based on actual grimoire-magic as the medieval magicians really envisioned it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the creator of Dark Albion, Lion &amp;amp; Dragon will have you discovering real medieval fantasy for the very first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Publisher&amp;rsquo;s note : Lion &amp;amp; Dragon is a complete OSR game in itself. However, even if you prefer to stick with traditional fantasy RPGs featuring dwarves, elves, spellcasters, and the like, L&amp;amp;D can still provide a lot of options that will help you give much flavor to a more usual campain world. For example, the sections on alchemy, herbal medicines, poisons, or law &amp;amp; justice, could be imported in any other fantasy game.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
