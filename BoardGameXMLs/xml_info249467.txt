							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rogue Theory</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any System! Any Setting!&lt;br/&gt;Using Class in Worldbuilding and Adventure Design&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The appeal of the rogue is their reputation as the non-conformists of character classes. Even if they&amp;rsquo;re not outright thieves, they have a reputation for being a bit freewheeling, morally flexible, and willing to do things other characters aren&amp;rsquo;t. They&amp;rsquo;re skill-oriented characters, able to use magic items but not cast spells, employing tact and dirty tricks in combat more than the straight-forward approach of a warrior. They&amp;rsquo;re problem solvers, artisans and engineers, con artists and diplomats. In determining how a wide range of skills function within the setting, how they are learned, and their use impacts culture, politics, and religion, the rogue&amp;rsquo;s abilities sets in motion a ripple effect that impacts nearly every element of worldbuilding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the Class Theory supplements are system-agnostic, this volume will delve more into the perceptions and archetypal personalities of the rogue rather than specific abilities. In places, some broad generalizations will be made. You should adapt the concepts to what best fits the mechanics, setting, and character that you&amp;rsquo;re working with inside the context of your campaign. As an example, while not all systems have classes, the word class will be used generically to represent the actual character element of that name, character archetypes and templates, and other conceptual details that fit the general spirit of the rogue. Because if we&amp;rsquo;re going to be intellectually honest, we need to just admit that everything in tabletop roleplaying, no matter how innovative, unique, and transcendent it may be, with always be compared to the baseline created by the game that started the hobby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Player&lt;br/&gt;This book is not about new abilities, optimizing your character build, or exploiting game mechanics for maximum effect. The intention of this volume is to help you tell your character&amp;rsquo;s story. By the end of this book, you&amp;rsquo;ll see the rogue in relation to the Three Pillars of Fantasy Storytelling, and use the unique features of the archetype to create unique characters, enhance your worldbuilding, and tell unique stories tailored to their roles and abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Gamemaster&lt;br/&gt;By taking a look at the specific strengths and opportunities of the rogue class, you will be able to create truly balanced encounters. You will gain a fresh perspective on how the rogue fits into the Three Pillars of Fantasy Storytelling, so you can work with the player to create a character that fits seamlessly with the setting and your campaign. The way rogue characters can be leveraged to expand your worldbuilding efforts, and can be mined for story hooks, will allow you to have a richer creative experience, and an overall better roleplaying experience for everyone at your table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
