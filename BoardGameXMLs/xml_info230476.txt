			<description>In Falling Stars, players control Luna, a young girl who lives in the peaceful land of Dazzleon. Luna's uncle, Matt, discovers a curious mine and decides to take up residence in Dazzleon to investigate. The mine slowly takes over Matt's mind and he begins to perform evil experiments. Eventually, Matt turns on his pets, changing them all into evil monsters. Realizing her uncle's madness, Luna sets out to save him and prevent the world from suffering dire consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat: Monsters are unleashed upon the world before your very eyes. You cannot fight until you've obtained your pet, Komi. Battles require input to progress. When Komi's time bar fills, he can attack. When the monster's time bar fills, Komi can defend. The strength of the attack depends on the strength of the defense. If the two match, less damage is done. Monsters have attack patterns players can learn and use to compensate. For example, the Red Dog will begin his attack pattern with either Red (strong) or Yellow (fast). In either case (Red or Yellow), the pattern will follow as Yel, Red, Yel, Red, Yel, White. Since the Red Dog's pattern ends with White (mega), it's easy to tell when a new pattern is beginning. You can heal Komi with magic or the more affective Health Potions when Luna's time bar fills. Luna's time bar can be rushed by rotating the RAS (right analog stick). Komi's stats can be boosted through equipped accessories, special items, and experience. Enough experience gains Komi bonus training points for use in Luna's home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_Stars_%28video_game%29 Falling Stars (video game)]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
