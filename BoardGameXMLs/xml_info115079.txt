			<description>OutRank your opponents and be the first person to exhaust their playing hand. OutRank features the five branches of the Military. Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force and Coast Guard.&lt;br/&gt;In OutRank each player is dealt 7 cards, the remaining cards become the draw pile. The first player challenges the player to their left with 1-5 cards of the same rank from their hand. The player answering the challenge can either surrender or try and OutRank each card with a card from their hand of the same suit and higher rank. The answering player may choose to surrender at any time by picking up all cards in play and adding them to their hand. All other players are in a support phase and have the option of supporting a challenge with cards from their hand which have the same rank as cards already in play. If all the challenging cards are answered and there are no other cards being played then the cards in play are removed from the game. The player who was answering becomes the new attacker and play continues clockwise. A game is over when a player has used all of the cards in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
