			<description>Two players go head-to-head in the World Series of Baseball!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a standard deck of playing cards divided into reds and blacks, each player takes control of a team and attempts to out-pitch and out-score the other player by turning over cards representing their Defense or Offense.  In what plays a little like War (injected with hardcore baseball strategy), highest card wins and determines whether the batter gets a hit or is out.  Complete with rules for bunting, sac flys, stealing and more, you'll be a Major League coach in no time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meticulously crafted by a baseball fanatic and his brother while watching their Major League home team lose miserably, this game will leave you cheering, yelling, and having a Grand Slam of a time.  You'll never have to make it out to the ballgame again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Check out the Files section for the full rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
