			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: As you cross over the barrier peeks a large expanse of gold sand meets your gaze. You descend from the cold mountain peaks into sweltering heat and stinging sand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: Do I see any movement?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: Warm winds move the sands, causing them to tumble down the sides of dunes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: Any life we could follow to vegetation or water?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: Hmmmmm....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The word &amp;quot;desert&amp;quot; conjures images of a desolate empty place of wind swept dunes, stinging sands and strange rock formations. It is a common barrier that adventurers must pass in their journeys. However, unlike this desolate empty appearance the desert is actually home to a unique biome full of vibrant, colorful life. To add this unique feel of desert life to the world your friends here at Healing Fireball Publications have created this collection of tables to populate any desert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus, included in this product is a bonus set of foliage tables to add plant life to your desert, as well as animals. All this and it's just 50&amp;cent;. Product is three pages plus a cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
