							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nation Builder</name>
									
			<description>Nation Builder is a game that puts players in the position of administering a small nation that is struggling to survive in the shadow of the world's super powers. The world has been shaken by an economic meltdown. The power void left over has given your nation the ability to grow without the usual pressure caused by the larger powers.  But they will not be idle for long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the challenge is running against the clock. You have a limited time to build up your own country and defend it against the political interference of your fellow gamers, as well as the constant meddling of the super nations of USA, China, Russia, and the European Bloc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Deck-Builder game brings in all the elements of managing Populations, Technology, Military, Social issues, Infrastructure, and Economics.  By the time you have played this game to the end you will have a much deeper understanding of the problems facing real world leaders.  Smaller countries of the world often struggle against the odds to become successful and independent in the face of outside interference. Can you take on the task? It is a difficult balancing act.  One wrong move and the game can be your enemy just as easily as the people sitting next to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
