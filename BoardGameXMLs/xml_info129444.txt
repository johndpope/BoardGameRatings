			<description>Each player chooses a story. Shuffle the 32 cards and place them face down on the table. The oldest player begins the game by looking one of the cards.  If the card is part of his story player takes it and puts it in his book of images. The player may continue his turn until he looks the card not belonging to his story. He shows the card to other and ends his turn. The first player who completed his picture with 8 cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
