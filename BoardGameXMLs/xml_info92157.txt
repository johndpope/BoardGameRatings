			<description>Your flagship has wandered into uncharted space and you've suddenly detected an unknown vessel with its weapons readied and shields raised! Will you be able to survive the encounter?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GalaXism (guh-lax-iz-um) is a starship combat game for 2-6 players that should take about an hour to play. Players control the flagships of ten different races, playing their cards as increases to shields, weapons, defenses, and various other ship statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are laid out around a flagship, each section corresponding to a different side of the ship from forward, aft, starboard, and port. In addition, there's the command deck where the ship is controlled. The upgrade cards have 4 icons each and are shifted up, left, right, and up-right to reveal more icons during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is heavily influenced by Innovation but taken in a different way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have separated the rules from the components to make it easier on me to update the rules. This also makes the download smaller when there are changes to the rules so that you don't have to worry about printing out new components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current Rules: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.lyonesse.info/games/download.php?filename=GalaXism.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.lyonesse.info/games/download.php?filename=GalaXis...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current Components: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.lyonesse.info/games/download.php?filename=GalaXism-Components.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.lyonesse.info/games/download.php?filename=GalaXis...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discussion Thread: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/614464/wip-galaxism-a-quick-print-and-play-design-chall&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/614464/wip-galaxism-a-quick-...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
