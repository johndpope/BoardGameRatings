			<description>A favorite pastime has finally found its way into the ballpark of VPG's Sports Series. High &amp;amp; Tight, from designer Hermann Luttmann, is a simple game of baseball strategy for two players, utilizing teams to the fullest and going head to head in the field, anywhere from basic training to the intensity of the World Series. It is said that every baseball team will win one-third of its games and lose one-third of its games. Now, step onto the field and find out what it takes to win &amp;ldquo;that other one-third&amp;rdquo;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focus on how to best form your team line-up, and battle inning by inning in an effort to emerge victorious! Think you have what it takes to efficiently manage your players, maximizing their specific talents as well as utilize Strategy cards to subtly increase the odds of scoring and preventing runs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manage your team&amp;rsquo;s assets, take advantage of the opportunities, and knock it out of the ballpark on the &amp;ldquo;field of dreams.&amp;rdquo; Step up to the plate with High &amp;amp; Tight ... And let&amp;rsquo;s play ball!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Data:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complexity: 3 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Suitability: 2 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;Scale: Each stand is a player on a team, and each turn represents approximately 5 minutes of real time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    One 8-page, color Game Rules booklet&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    40 color, die-cut 1/2&amp;rdquo; mounted game pieces&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    80 color, die-cut 1/2&amp;rdquo; x 1&amp;rdquo; mounted ballplayer pieces&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    50 Strategy cards&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    8 Team cards&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    2 &amp;quot;Rally Caps&amp;quot; cards&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    One 11&amp;rdquo; x 17&amp;rdquo; color game map&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    One Scoreboard sheet&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Polybag packaging and component storage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
