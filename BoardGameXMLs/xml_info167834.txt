			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Must Escape is a game where you are locked in a room, and must find your way out. However the lights are turned off and you must use the sound your footsteps make and the louder sound you make with the space bar. These send soundwaves traveling out that you can see represented by white lines on the screen. Things are easy at first, but then you will see red lines bouncing back at you denoting danger. It might be a simple stationary trap, or it could be a creature hunting you. But beware, if you can &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; the creature by making noise, that means the creature has heard you too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
