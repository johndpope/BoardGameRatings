			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;眠らぬ金山 (Nemuranu Kinzan) is a 2 player card game with players trying to recover more gold where 'The Goldmine Never Sleeps'. In this game, you will try to get more gold than your opponent by using your 8 cards and deduction skills. The player who earns 7 gold and uses their 'Holiday' before the last day, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can earn gold by 'Mining', or 'Rob' your opponent to sabotage their mining, or use your 'Holiday' to prevent suffering a penalty during the end of the game. Playing your cards at the best timing is crucial to win this game. The rule of this game is very simple and easy to learn even for beginners. It is an easy game to learn but it is a game which is hard to master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guess what your opponent would play and try to play what you want without any sabotage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second edition was updated and revised as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In the first edition there was one Mining Area, but the second edition added three more Mining Areas and amended &amp;quot;the 7th day&amp;quot; in the standard ruleset to &amp;quot;the last day&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;     The effect of &amp;quot;Emergency Call&amp;quot; was changed so that when an opponent plays 'Off-Day', you receive 2 Money instead of placing 2 Money on the Mine.&lt;br/&gt;     The 7-day ruleset in the first edition has been changed to a 5-day ruleset, so descriptions were amended to change 'the 7th day' to 'the last day' or 'later days' in the rules on Off-Day and on Mine Discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's summary&lt;br/&gt;眠らぬ金山は、8枚のカードを駆使して相手と金（きん）を奪い合う心理戦カードゲームです&lt;br/&gt;最終日までに金を先に7つ獲得し、休日を使用したプレイヤーの勝利です&lt;br/&gt;金山から金を奪う「採掘」、採掘を妨害する「盗掘」、使わないと罰金がある「休日」など&amp;hellip;出すタイミングが重要なカードばかりです&lt;br/&gt;ボードゲーム初心者の方でもすぐに理解できるルールで構成されていますが、&lt;br/&gt;相手が出すカードへの疑惑と、自分が通したいカードの思惑がぶつかりあう&lt;br/&gt;やりごたえ十分のとても奥深いボードゲームです&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
