			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dangers That Dwell in a Thousand Shadows&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dead arise. Impossible animals lurk in the sewers. Inhuman forms howl at the moon while cultists chant nonstop in a filthy basement. For those champions who face the darkness, the job just got more interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Monster Hunters 3: The Enemy provides a horde of high-powered horrors. Although designed for GURPS Monster Hunters, these abominations are perfect for any heavy-hitting supernatural setting. The threats presented include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Undead, such as vampires, mummies, and zombies &amp;ndash; plus quick-and-easy rules for handling mobs of the walking dead!&lt;br/&gt;     Beings from beyond our Earthly realm. Skin-changers pursue their warped plans within the wrappings of a violated victim, and angels and demons long to make the world a battlefield. Plus you'll get a way to generate demonic abilities, so each encounter with Hell can be unique!&lt;br/&gt;     Strange slavering monsters, such as chupacabras, albino alligators, and werewolves. Lycanthropy gives pause to even the fearless . . .&lt;br/&gt;     Mortal malcontents who strike against humanity &amp;ndash; cultists, psis, witches, and more. Tremble as mankind destroys itself from within!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All enemies have full GURPS stats, so they're ready to rend. And find tips for heroes who hunt the horrors, perfect to reflect what every informed investigator should know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hero is defined by the caliber of his opposition. With the dire threats of GURPS Monster Hunters 3: The Enemy, the heroes will need all the high-caliber help they can load!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
