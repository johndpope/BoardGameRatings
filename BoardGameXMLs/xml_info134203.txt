			<description>Space adventure, real estate game where players travel around the solar system to control planets, moons and rocket companies. The objective is to have the most property and money at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large monopoly style space game board where each player moves his rocket ship around the outside of the board buying up planets or rocket stations. He then builds rocket fields on his planets and returns to earth to collect more money from the space bank. The game has a three dimensional feel with planets and moons as solid coloured balls on the central area of the playing board. Rocket fields are smaller orange balls place atop of the planets by coloured sticks. Space-o-gram cards are similar to chance cards in monopoly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
