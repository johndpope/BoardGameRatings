			<description>Yes, you are an Alien! All you need to know: Is it a predator or prey? You will send in a spawnling to find out. If it is prey, then this battle will be over quickly. If it is a threat, then caution and strategy may be required to take it down. Either way you will be the last thing standing when the acid blood is done spraying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Alien brings Acid Blood and Spawnlings to Sen So.  If you like causing damage and chasing down your foes, the Alien is perfect for you.  The Alien is a single player set that can be played against any of the Sen So variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sen So game system uses a unique set of octagon cards and card holders. Players have to set (program) actions before their current action is revealed. All players reveal actions together. This provides fast play for even large numbers of players.  Game scoring provides balance and keeps the leaders on their toes. Players are required to choose their weapons and abilities for each battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
