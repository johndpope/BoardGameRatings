			<description>In Symphony No.9, players are the rich nobles of the 18th century. You will be the patron to various different musicians, and in return, you will gain ownership to their works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will take turns taking donation cubes from 6 different musicians. Donation cubes are taken from a career track, which will reveal spaces that change the current reputation of each musician. Each space on the track also represents their remaining life and will die when all cubes are removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then the player who is currently the major patron to each musician will discard donation cubes to acquire a Composition tile from him. Every musician will have a different method of scoring for their Composition tiles. Then adjust the Popularity Ranking of all 6 musicians according to their relative reputation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the final phase of each round, players will blindly donate money to the Royal Concert, and the combined total will decide which musicians are invited to perform. A successful concert will earn money for the patrons of the performers, which is the main source of income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you become the most prosperous patron during the age of musicians? Will you work them to death and hold on to their final masterpiece? Or will you have to sell your belongings to provide for their talents? Enjoy showing off your wealth in the slightly historical game of Symphony No.9.at time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
