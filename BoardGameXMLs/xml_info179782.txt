			<description>Translated from the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;To escape the ongoing threat of Gargamel and his cat Azrael, the Smurfs left their village and moved into the forest.&lt;br/&gt;The players, which get involved in this adventure, have to find the hiding place of a certain number of Smurfs and bring them back to the village. While doing this, they have to cope with Gargamel's magic, Azrael's anger and other trouble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kids game that combines luck of the draw with a little memory challenge.&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of six locations where the Smurfs hide (closed boxes with Smurfs in it), Gargamels castle (where they have to draw cards with negative events), and the Smurf village.&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets one cart that he moves across the board, visiting the different locations for the Smurfs of a certain type. When a player has a Smurf in his cart, he then has to find the matching Smurf (two of each kind in the game), and then move the cart back to the village to collect the Smurfs. First one to collect all the Smurfs on his &amp;quot;mission card&amp;quot; wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
