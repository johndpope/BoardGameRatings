			<description>Sports card game designed to simulate one quarter of a basketball game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are divided into three piles by color. The &amp;quot;Play pile is red, &amp;quot;Free Throws&amp;quot; are white, and &amp;quot;Jump balls&amp;quot; are blue. The first player turns over a &amp;quot;Jump Ball&amp;quot; to determine who starts drawing from the &amp;quot;Play&amp;quot; pile. Players alternate turning over cards until the &amp;quot;Play&amp;quot; pile is exhausted. Points are scored as determined by the cards drawn. This sequence is repeated for four quarters. The player with the highest point total after four quarters is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
