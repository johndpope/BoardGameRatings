			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Filbar Friday brings you FV2 &amp;ndash; Urgoth&amp;rsquo;s Canyon. This area of adventure is a continuation from FV1 â€“ Jeopardy Caverns and picks up where the party left off. If your party discovered the &amp;ldquo;back door&amp;rdquo; this is where it leads. It also offers an opening that flanks Jeopardy Caverns that has a perilous rope bridge to navigate! This area provides multiple smaller adventures and was utilized to get the party from different adventures. Portions of this adventure can be used as fillers in your own campaign. I hope you enjoy it as much as my players did!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 5th Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for an initial to low level group of players.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
