			<description>This game is based on the eponymous character created by writer and illustrator Holly Hobbie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players try to guess their opponents secret wishes as they move around the board. Each player starts the game with two wishes. On their turn, players roll a die and move the corresponding number of spaces. They must then follow the directions for the space on which the marker lands. On spaces, players may ask questions, go to the well, collect pennies from other players, give pennies to other players or exchange wishes. When asking questions, players can ask whether another player has a wish of a given color, one of two wishes of a given color or a specific wish of a given color. Players may ask questions by paying pennies (free on some spaces) as long as they receive &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; for an answer. When a player guesses correctly, he can pick up from the wishing well the number of pennies rolled on a die. Players whose wishes are guessed lose these wishes but have the opportunity of buying more of them until all wishes have been used up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player to hold a secret wish wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box&lt;br/&gt;Join Holly and your friends as you try to guess the secret wishes that are held by the other players.  You'll move around the wishing well, pay a penny and ask a player about a wish.  Every time you guess a wish you can try to empty the well.  Pay close attention and remember what everybody says because the player with the last secret wish is the player who wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
