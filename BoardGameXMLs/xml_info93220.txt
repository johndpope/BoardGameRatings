			<description>WarGames is a 1984 video game developed by Coleco for the ColecoVision.  The game's goal is to defend the United States against nuclear attack, much in the style of a less frantic &amp;quot;Missile Command&amp;quot;.  The principal designer was Coleco staffer Joseph Angiolillo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was directly inspired by MGM's 1983 film &amp;quot;WarGames&amp;quot;, but instead of depicting the film's events, adapts its iconic NORAD scene into playable form.  It is one of a handful of games that feature waging nuclear war, and one of the few without an aim of winning it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;WarGames (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
