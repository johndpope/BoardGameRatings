			<description>Fishfry Deluxe is a fishing dice game using 6 custom laser engraved dice. It is the expanded edition of the original Fishfry (which was sold out) and it includes an extra BONUS die and a nifty pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players have three rolls to catch a fish by rolling a HEAD and a TAIL (worth 10 points together), and various sized BODIES that add to the score of the fish.  The BONUS die adds its value to each fish caught.  Players have to choose which dice to keep and which dice to re-roll on their second and third rolls.  One side of the dice contains a small PANFISH, which is worth only one point, and cannot be re-rolled. However, if a player manages to roll 5 PANFISH, the player proclaims a FISHFRY!, and the other players have to &amp;quot;FRY-UP&amp;quot; their fish. Players often have the choice to push their luck, and try for larger fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a single round game the goal is to catch and score the single largest fish possible, in a tournament players record their score and try for the largest grand total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is light, quick, and easy to learn. Included are rules for one-round games, as well as multiple round fishing tournaments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dice are custom engraved in the USA by Chessex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
