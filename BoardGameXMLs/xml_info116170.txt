			<description>Players lay their cards, add up the values ​​and when there is enough wings, pigs can fly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn, player pick a card and plays against the pig of his choice.&lt;br/&gt;Once a player manages to have enough wings to at least match the weight of the pig, he wins the card and the pig is replaced&lt;br/&gt;Some cards are action cards. They will give bonuses to help you be faster than others, by replaying a wing card, doubling the value of one of them or by decreasing the weight of a pig.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Pig deck is exhausted the game ends and the player with the most pigs is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
