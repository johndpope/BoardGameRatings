			<description>A One-Round Living City Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three weeks ago you responded to a summons for a special mission from the mayor of Ravens Bluff, Lady Amber Lynn Thoden. A communiqu&amp;eacute;, vital to the city&amp;rsquo;s survival had to be taken to Kurth. &amp;ldquo;At all costs,&amp;rdquo; was just one of the phrases which the mayor used in describing the importance of your task. Thus you bolted from the city, boldly charged through the countryside, and made the city to the north in record time. Once there you took the opportunity to rest up and take in some of the sights while waiting for a response which Ravens Bluff&amp;rsquo;s ambassador insisted you wait upon. Once in hand, along with a special Writ of Passage to see the lady mayor upon your arrival, you made your way back to the Living City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choosing not to press your luck, daring bravado was put aside. Instead, you opted for stealth. Thus you now wearily approach the gates of Ravens Bluff in the wee hours of the morning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
