							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ambush Road</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a 48 x 30 inch,Battlemap of a Roadway near ruins, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Taking the mountain road is indeed faster, but bandits live in the ruins near the caldera. Only take the road if you must reach your destination quickly. It will take weeks to circumnavigate the mountains staying on the lowlands, but it&amp;rsquo;s much safer.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;Post-Apocalyptic Survivor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ambush Road includes a single level exterior map of a winding canyon road carved out of the surrounding mountains. There are mountains to the north and south of the road, with a water-filled caldera to the north center and a circular ruin to the northeast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ambush Road can be utilized in modern, post-apocalyptic, or horror games. It could also be used in fantasy games with the ruins from an ancient fallen culture. It can also be an interesting track in a straightaway course or drag racing kind of game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Canyon Run:  Bandits have entrenched themselves in the nearby mountains and taken over a key canyon road that acts as a short cut over a large mountain range. The lowland villagers warn the group of making a run through the canyon and advise going around the mountain range the long way. But the long way around costs vital gasoline; the canyon road is the fastest route to cut through the mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the group goes up to the canyon pass, they have to survive a gauntlet of bandits and traps along the road to get through. The bandits have made their camp in the ruins of an old circular structure, perhaps a lighthouse that stood before the apocalypse. The bandits seem to be excavating the ruins, digging for old food in cans and lantern oil for light at night. The caldera lake is their water source. They also ambush travelers driving through the pass to rob them of their supplies. If the player characters can defeat the bandits, they&amp;rsquo;ll find a cache of food, oil, ammo, and enough water to fill their canteens to get over the mountains easily from the lake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
