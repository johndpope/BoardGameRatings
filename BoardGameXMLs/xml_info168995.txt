			<description>Obsessive Cartographer is a solitaire game for the Tiledeck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Shuffle the tiles face-down.&lt;br/&gt;     Draw one tile and place it face-up on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;You just woke up in a dark room (represented by the tile on the table). You see one to four doorways (spots at the edges of the tile) leading out of the room. This suggests you are in a mappable location. You are obsessed with mapping, and of course have your cartography tools with you. Choose a direction to explore, and try to map all 60 rooms!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;Map the darkness!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     On each turn, choose a doorway to walk through.&lt;br/&gt;     Draw a room (tile), and place it face-up adjacent to that doorway, such that a doorway on the new tile matches with the one through which you just walked. If there are any other adjacent rooms, their doorways or walls must match: You can never have a doorway up against a wall!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game End&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     If the room you drew can&amp;rsquo;t legally fit, you have discovered that you have made a cartographic error, and you go into fits thinking about how you can fix your map!  You lose consciousness, and while you lie on the floor, your mind carefully blocks out the whole experience.&lt;br/&gt;     If, however, you place the 60th room legally, you are quite pleased with yourself, pack up your new completed map, and take a nap.  While you sleep, something gives you a mighty whack on the head and eats your map; you won&amp;rsquo;t remember any of this when you wake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
