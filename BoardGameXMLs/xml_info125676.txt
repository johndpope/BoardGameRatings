			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We printed this home-made board game on the back cover of our seventh issue, playable with pennies and a die, for those long train journeys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What could be more enticing to a mouse than a cup of tea? And what could be more enticing to a cat than a mouse?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In our custom-made board game, you get to be a cat stalking the kitchen for prey, or a mouse, desperate to be the first to make a cuppa tea for yourself and your mouse-spouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This roll-and-move board game was printed in issue 7 (Sep/Oct 2011) of oh comely, a British lifestyle magazine. It was also released on their website in a complete electronic format that can be printed for play. The core game is designed for three to five players, although included are variant rules for two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     One player takes on the role of the cat and aims to capture mice by landing on them and then bringing them back to its owner's pillow. Capturing three mice will win the game for the cat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Other players are the mice and win by making two cups of tea. Each cup of tea requires three ingredients (one milk, one tea, one sugar). Ingredients are randomly determined and rewarded at the end of each round, given to whichever mice have claimed certain territories on the board. Mouse players can trade ingredients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an optional rules, two spaces on the board offer chance cards to players that land on them. There are separate cat and mouse chance cards that provide competitive advantages of various types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
