Will you be the first one to achieve your goal?&lt;br/&gt;Consider your investment decisions carefully, execute takeovers, and make sure you get the biggest share of the market.&lt;br/&gt;Play Magnomania, plan, decide, and win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game in brief:&lt;br/&gt;As a player of Magnomania, you are a Magnus entrepreneur. You travel as an entrepreneur around the gameboard and try to be the first to earn the required number of points in order win. You earn points by taking the biggest market share on a given continent and being 'In Business' internationally. As soon as an entrepreneur (pawn) arrives in a country he can begin a consultancy project. You indicate the stages of your project by a consultant (disc). When a project is completed, you as the entrepreneur are 'In Business' in that country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnomania was developed and produced on the authority of Magnus Management Consultancy (since 2009 call Eurogroup Consulting) by Identity Games International B.V., Rotterdam, the Netherlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
