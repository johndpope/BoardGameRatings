							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Peppa Pig Tumble &amp; Spin</name>
									
			<description>Shuffle the cards and place them face-down, in a circle around the Peppa Pig figurine. The youngest player begins by spinning Peppa as hard as he can. Wait until Peppa comes to a full stop. If she stops by your marker, listen carefully to what Peppa says (If Peppa stops in between two markers, she is talking to the person whose marker she has just passed.):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Peppa says &amp;ldquo;One!&amp;rdquo; - Turn over one of the cards. Call out the friend&amp;rsquo;s name. Is it your friend? then you get to keep the card. Is it one of the other player&amp;rsquo;s friend? Then show the card to the other players and put it back in the circle.&lt;br/&gt;2. &amp;ldquo;Two!&amp;rdquo; You&amp;rsquo;re lucky! You may now look at two cards. Call out the friend&amp;rsquo;s name each time you turn over one of the cards. Is your friend on either of the cards? Then you get to keep that card. If it&amp;rsquo;s one of the other player&amp;rsquo;s friend, then show the card to the other players and put it back in the circle.&lt;br/&gt;3. &amp;ldquo;Close your eyes!&amp;rdquo; Oh no! Now you have to give back one of your cards. Close your eyes while the other players hide it among the cards that are on the table. They must not tell you where they have put it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who can collect all their friend picture cards first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
