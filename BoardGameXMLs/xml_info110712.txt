							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Summer Camp</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob awoke to screams that seemed to come from everywhere. His brain instantly snapped to attention as he sprang from his bed. Throwing open the rickety screen door to his cabin, he stepped outside and scanned the area. Jacob smelled the blood in the air before he saw the bodies.  Some campers lay in bloody, crumpled heaps while others ran screaming in terror chased by emaciated, humanoid figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Zombies&amp;quot;, Jacob thought to himself as he spoke a word of power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do you go when the action starts? To the battle map, of course! If you need a map of a modern structure, you need Modern Floorplans. The Modern Floorplans series from Fabled Environments offers gamers high quality maps in a variety of configurations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Want to draw it out yourself? Use the 8.5x11 map as a guide.&lt;br/&gt;     Want to simply drop the map on the table and play? Use either the 24x36 full map (if you have access to a plotter printer) or print the tiled version on regular paper and assemble a full-size version yourself in a matter of minutes. Both versions are scaled at 1 inch equals 5 feet.&lt;br/&gt;     In addition, each floorplan also comes in versions without room labels and without furniture.&lt;br/&gt;     This flooplan take advantage of both the Layers feature and the Tile Large Page function of Adobe Acrobat X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All maps are created by an architectural drafter using AutoCAD. This gives all of the maps the realistic feel that your players crave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map is your classic summer camp complete with both Counselor and Camper Cabins, Dining Hall/Multi-Purpose Hall and Caretaker's House. In addition, maps detailing the entire camp are included both at 8 &amp;amp;frac;12;&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot; and at 1&amp;quot; scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
