			<description>To play HOT 16 A Game of Dope Rhymes, you and your crew each provide a sample line that everyone needs to rhyme with for 1 bar (or line). Everyone writes 4 lines that rhyme - without seeing what anyone else is writing. Then you perform. How serious you are about the performance aspect is up to you. Sometimes the rhymes are silly and the songs are weird - sometimes it all comes together, and sounds like you're ready for the studio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You perform your cleverly crafted masterpiece in rounds, with each rapper leading for a verse, and the rest following. The rapper who ends the current verse starts the next verse, and so on, until the song is done! Then you get hype!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOT 16 A Game of Dope Rhymes is an old school rap crew party game. It's interactive, cooperative, and requires no musical talent whatsoever (though if you have some musical talent, it sure doesn't hurt).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
