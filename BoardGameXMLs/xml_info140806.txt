							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Way of Ki (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The power of ki lies latent within all things, flowing through mind, body, and spirit alike and able to be seen and harnessed by those with the focus, devotion, and dedication to master themselves and achieve perfect unity and balance. The game describes ki only in terms of the mystic powers manifested by the monk and ninja, and The Way of Ki contains a wealth of options for increasing the variety and flavor of what these classes can do through their mastery of meditative practice and transcendental contemplation. The power of ki, however, is universal, available to anyone with the focus, desire, and discipline to master it, and The Way of Ki allows characters of every class to unleash this power, adding it to or infusing it within their normal class abilities. Unlock the great mysteries and transcend the natural into the sublime. The game touches on these secrets only briefly, in the context of the mystic powers manifested by the monk and ninja. If ki truly represents the extension of the self into communion with the universe and its hidden flows, however, its secrets should be possible for anyone to master with the proper instruction and dedication. By exploring The Way of Ki, now they can!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this 23-page product (21 pages in portrait orientation) you will find 22 general feats, from Composure and Ki Meditation to Sap Ki and Yogic Levitation. For the martially inclined, there are an additional 21 combat feats, including Hadouken, Mighty Kiai, Shattering Strike, and Unyielding Stance. For masters of the mystic arts, there are 16 magical feats including Graceful Calm, Perfected Creation, and Unbounded Conversion. Besides these 59 feats are notes for integrating ki and its use with every class in the game, including vows of discipline and their impact on ki, with special attention paid to expanded options for the the monk, ninja, and samurai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by Jason Nelson with the Legendary Games design team of Clinton Boomer, Matt Goodall, Jim Groves, Rob Lazzaretti, Neil Spicer, Russ Taylor, Greg Vaughan, Timothy Wickham, and Clark Peterson, with fabulous art by Frank Hessefort, The Way of Ki is jam-packed with the kind of amazing rules content you have come to expect from us.
