			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super-hero comic books are rife with the unexpected and the unexplained, the tragic and the glorious, and so too should your super-hero M&amp;amp;M Superlink game session. The Four Color Deck fulfils this role by introducing a new element of play that requires both strategy and tactics, while retaining the touch of randomness and fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Four Color Deck is so named because each of the four traditional comic book print colors has been associated with a type of card that can be incorporated into your game, with cyan representing game mechanics (offering bonuses, penalties, and the like), magenta covering plot elements (dropping twists and turns into the story in true comic book fashion), yellow introducing aspects of the environment (accidents, crowds, and the like), and black indicating detrimental conditions (when bad things happen to good people.) Also included are special cards that add something extra that doesn&amp;rsquo;t fall into one of the areas covered by the four colors, including cards that directly influence and interact with other cards in the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with the brief and easy-to-use rules detailing how the cards are drawn, played, and discarded, you&amp;rsquo;ll also find instructions on how to print and mount the cards, along with empty templates for easily filling in your own creations or adding more cards of the existing types in combinations of your choosing. However, this is just an option for those of you who like to get creative, as eighteen sheets of card combinations are included, each containing twelve cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Print them out, shuffle them up, and get ready for a new layer of fun in your M&amp;amp;M Superlink game, the Four Color Deck way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
