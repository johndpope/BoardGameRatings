							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Last Train Out of Warsaw</name>
									
			<description>Last Train Out Of Warsaw is a short, focused roleplaying game using Matthijs Holter's Archipelago II as a rules engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Set on the eve of the German encirclement of Warsaw in 1939, this game casts players in the roles of some of the passengers on the very last train out of that doomed city. Play progresses through a fixed series of scenes as the train flees the horrors of war towards safety in Romania. The train journey is fraught with incidents both external - a German air attack, a bandit raid, a station full of Poles desperate to get on the train - and internal - each passenger has issues and secrets that will be revealed through play and which may quite literally derail the escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full text of the game, in PDF format, is currently freely downloadable from lulu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
