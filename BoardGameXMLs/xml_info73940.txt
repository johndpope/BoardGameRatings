			<description>(From the introductionary text in the book)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Technogrammaton in the year 2010 is a little ahead&lt;br/&gt;of ours, but not by much. However its technology is far more&lt;br/&gt;advanced due to the world being dominated by the might of a&lt;br/&gt;2200 year old Islamic empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is all due to the failure of a single horse in the year 306 CE. The horse in question was to bear a Roman noble called Constantine away from his lord Galerius. While Constantine was a promising officer, he was a little too promising and Galerius had made a point of keeping him and his father separate. Constantine was a virtual hostage in Galerius&amp;rsquo; court. One night word came to Constantine that his life was in danger and he fled for his father&amp;rsquo;s court. He drove several horses to exhaustion, desperate to escape quickly as leaving was treason, and treason was death. Had he reached his father&amp;rsquo;s camp Constantine would have one day led the&lt;br/&gt;Roman Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He would have taken control of the western Empire and led a conquest of the east that would have made him absolute ruler of a new and stronger empire. He would have also converted to the tiny yet troublesome religion of Christianity, and eventually ordered Rome to adopt it as the state religion. He&lt;br/&gt;would have formed the Nicean councils that ensured&lt;br/&gt;disagreements in the Christian church were managed and settled,&lt;br/&gt;so as to maintain unity in the faith. When Rome eventually fell the faith in this religion would have bound the peoples of Europe together and gave them a commonality they could use to repel the incursions from the east.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, all this was not to be. On the night of his flight,&lt;br/&gt;Constantine rode his third horse just a little too hard. It collapsed on him in full gallop and he was thrown. Landing badly he snapped his neck and died. This is where the story truly begins...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
