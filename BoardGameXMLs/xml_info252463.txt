			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bureau 8 is a Federal investigation branch that deals with the weird and bizzare crimes that other divisions don't have the resources to investigate. While they are centered in Wellstone City, sometimes their investigations take them far and wide throughout the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Belle Valley, Ohio&lt;br/&gt;A man has bought a car. His dream car. But this dream quickly turns to a nightmare as he realizes he got more than he bargained for when picking up that Chevy Master Deluxe at the auction. The car had a stow-away, and for thousands of years, she's laid in wait to get free once again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That time is now and the place is the quiet town of Belle Valley. A string of disappearances, odd crimes, and impossible reports leads the Bureau 8 SALVATION servers to zero in on Belle Valley and dispatch a team. You are on that team and you need to follow protocols to investigate and adjudicate based on your investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's inside?&lt;br/&gt;This 51 page adventure has everything you need to run the adventure in the &amp;AElig;ther System from Silver Gryphon Games. It's a massive sandbox adventure, letting your investigators follow clues as they unravel what's happening, who is involved, and what needs to be done to fix the happenings in Belle Valley, Ohio. This is one of several adventures involving Bureau 8, and this is the first one to take the adventure outside of Wellstone City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With some careful watching of the time, this could be a perfect adventure for running at a convention, and it is right at home around your game table!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximate Run Time: 3-6 hours&lt;br/&gt;Recommended Players: 3-5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
