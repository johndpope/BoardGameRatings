							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darkhorn</name>
									
			<description>From Publisher Catalog:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle horns sound as companies of men, elves and dwarves assemble under the mountain's shadow.  By night-banishing torches, commanders plot their strategies for the coming campaign.  You are invited to join them.  Darkhorn is calling for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     NO WAITING!  A real time system allows all players to give orders to their armies at the same time.  No one has to wait while one person decides what to do.&lt;br/&gt;     MULTI-PLAYER OR SOLITAIRE!  Darkhorn can be played by up to four players, with the computer sitting in when needed.  And if you want a solitaire game, Darkhorn offers that too!.&lt;br/&gt;     PLAY A SHORT GAME...OR AN ENTIRE CAMPAIGN!  The Quick Scenario takes place on one of sixteen maps.  The Campaign Game rages over the nine maps of Darkhorn, with the winning army facing the Final Trial against the evil Darklord!&lt;br/&gt;     BUT THERE'S MORE!  Darkhorn can be changed to suit your taste.  Randomly generated maps make each game a different strategic challenge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
