							<name  sortindex="1">Claire: Extended Cut</name>
									
			<description>Alone, lost, and hunted. The world has quickly become shrouded in darkness. There are unseen threats stalking Claire from the shadows. Aided by her dog and armed only with a flashlight, Claire must conquer her fear and find her comatose mother. However, there are others lost in this dark realm seeking salvation. Claire must decide who she is going to save. With every choice, she&amp;rsquo;ll begin to discover who she really is and whether she deserves to be saved herself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Play as Claire, and explore multiple levels accompanied by your faithful dog, Anubis.&lt;br/&gt;- Use a lighter or a mouse-controlled flashlight, to explore an increasingly dark world.&lt;br/&gt;- Control your fear against a system that increases the scariness of the environment, as panic tightens its grip.&lt;br/&gt;- Stay alert, with items scavenged from the dark corners of the world.&lt;br/&gt;- Find others lost in the darkness. Help and save them or decide to leave them be. The choice is yours to make.&lt;br/&gt;- Experience multiple endings determined by your choices and interactions with the others.&lt;br/&gt;- Multiple difficulty settings include &amp;ldquo;Nightmare Mode&amp;rdquo;, where Claire can literally be scared to death.&lt;br/&gt;- New Game+ allows you to keep your items and ramp up the difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
