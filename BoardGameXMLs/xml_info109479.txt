							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chaos Isle: Survivors</name>
									
			<description>She was born from a cesspool of mutating Virus and Zombi corpses, a toxic pit dug by the Survivors to dump their defeated enemies in. She is the manifestation of Dr. Z's lixir, arisen to exterminate the Survivors and to make the walking dead her immortal slaves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remaining Survivors, the last of the living, finally band together in a last desperate struggle for survival and to rid the Isle of the Virus-Infected Undead once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chaos Isle: Survivors is a 28-card Character Replacement Upgrade for Chaos Isle: Zombi Deck. The deck contains every Character ever made for Chaos Isle, six brand new Characters, and the all-devouring Brood Mother, a sort of anti-hero Character with her own set of rules. All cards have brand new artwork and design. Also included are rules for Outbreak: an entirely new way to play the game using strategic cooperative play, and Split Personality: a new way to enhance Mission-Based game styles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
