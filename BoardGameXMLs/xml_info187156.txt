			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then did the Wise King found a city that remains the envy of all others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not the largest, nor the richest, but by far the most useful, it is the beating heart of the Southern Kingdoms, the jewel of the Wildlands, and the one place no person of lively wits who harbors a love of life and savors intrigue should miss visiting. Such a place is Serenity, where the unsleeping traderoads meet. When one is tired of the City of Secrets, one is tired of striving and zeal and the hunger for coin. -- Imdurl Arhadabad, Sage of Serenity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Serenity, City of Secrets, the latest of many Guidebooks for the Epic High Fantasy setting that is Shaintar. Written by world-famouse Sage of the Forgotten Realms, Ed Greenwood, with additional material and game design by Shaintar's creator, Sean Patrick Fannon, Serenity introduces you to one of the most fascinating - and dangerous - cities in all the Southern Kingdoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full of fascinating characters and a culture steeped in traditions of trade in both hard goods and harder-to-uncover information, the crossroads city of Serenity is a font of endless possibilities and countless dangers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn yet again why Ed Greenwood is a master of character and story within the RPG world, and enjoy his powerful contribution to the epic high fantasy world of Shaintar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
