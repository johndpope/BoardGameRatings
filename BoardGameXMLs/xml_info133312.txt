			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A swedish self-published amateur game; simple and humouristic cardbased race game where the players try to reach goal as fast as possible. Game consists of a deck of cards and a simple race track with two illegal shortcuts. On a turn, the player may first move forward as many spaces as his previously played cards allow him, then he can play card either on himself (to increase movement) or on someone else (to get in their way). during the game, the players can use the shortcuts and ignore certain blocking cards, but if they do, they are &amp;quot;wanted&amp;quot; for one turn and may be the target for cop cards, which causes them to lose one turn and their current movement card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
