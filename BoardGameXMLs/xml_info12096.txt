							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Riskier Was</name>
									
			<description>This game is based on a German TV Show. The TV show Riskier was not very successful.&lt;br/&gt;One player draws a card with 16 words on it. For example 16 different monkeys. But only 11 of those do really exist.&lt;br/&gt;The player next to him says the first word that is right and earns money. Now he can quit and keep the money or go on. If he goes on he gets double the money if he is right again. When he is wrong he looses everything.&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
