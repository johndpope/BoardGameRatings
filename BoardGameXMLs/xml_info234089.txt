			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your mind is software - program it.  Your body is a shell - change it.  Death is a disease - cure it.  Extinction is approaching - fight it.  In Eclipse Phase, the award-winning, post-apocalyptic roleplaying game of transhuman conspiracy and horror, technology allows the re-shaping of bodies and minds, but also creates opportunities for oppression and puts the capability for mass destruction in the hands of everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revised and enlarged for the next evolution, Eclipse Phase, Second Edition introduces exciting, newly enhanced features including a faster character creation system, streamlined resleeving, updated gameplay, and pre-fabbed character teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
