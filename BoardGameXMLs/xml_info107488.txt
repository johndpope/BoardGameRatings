			<description>Head On is an arcade game developed in 1979 by Sega. In this game, players control their cars through the maze, while simultaneously picking up dots and avoiding cars that chase the players. It was an early maze chase game, considered a precursor to the 1980 hit Pac-Man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game received a sequel in the same year titled Head On 2, which also was licensed to Nintendo and released as Head On N. Head On later appeared in the Sega Saturn collection Sega Memorial Selection Vol.1 and in the PlayStation 2 collection Sega Ages Vol. 23. A mobile phone exclusive version titled Sonic's Head On was released exclusively in Japan in 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was ported to the Commodore 64 in 1982, as well as the Commodore VIC-20, Apple II, TI99/4A and Game Boy. Other variations of the formula appeared on the Amiga (as &amp;quot;Car Wars&amp;quot;), MSX (as &amp;quot;Killer Car&amp;quot;) and ZX Spectrum (as &amp;quot;Car Chase&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Head On (arcade game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
