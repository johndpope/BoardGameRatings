			<description>Subtitle: The Scientific Romance Role Playing Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the PDF book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPLETE RULES FOR ADVENTURES IN VICTORIAN AND EDWARDIAN FANTASY AND SCIENCE FICTION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROBABLY the first shareware tabletop RPG, Forgotten Futures has been published on disk and on line since 1993. What you see is what you get: everything that you need to play can be downloaded without charge, although you are asked to pay a registration fee if you find it useful. Registered users are sent the latest release on CD-ROM at least a month before files go on line, and with it additional material such as Victorian and Edwardian fiction, articles and illustrations, advertisements, etc. Currently more than a hundred megabytes of support material are on-line, including worldbooks, adventures, and the novels, articles, and stories on which they are based. The full Forgotten Futures CD-ROM adds more than 300 megabytes of additional background material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all of the core Forgotten Futures RPG material, this PDF is a free download. It contains all of the rules that you&amp;rsquo;ll need to play the game, including many of the optional &amp;ldquo;extras&amp;rdquo; that have been added in various worldbooks and adventures. When you&amp;rsquo;ve taken a look check out one of the online adventures; Taking the Tunnel is a good start, since it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need additional background material. After that try one of the worldbooks and its associated adventures. If you enjoy the game, please register or buy the Forgotten Futures CD-ROM. 10% of the fee is donated to Cancer Research UK; so far over &amp;pound;1700 has been raised for charity from this and related projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.From the back of the printed book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Future's Not What It Used to Be...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A century ago, authors dreamed of futures that never came to pass. Forgotten Futures, The Scientific Romance Role Playing Game, explores these discarded possibilities; the futures that could never have been, and the pasts that might have led to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains the Forgotten Futures rules, period historical background, surveys on dinosaurs, spiritualism, and weird science, an introductory adventure involving Queen Victoria and the Channel Tunnel, and a handy rules summary.,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cover Illustration for the printed version: Martian War-Machine (after Kandinsky) by Ryan L. Johnson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
