			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gale Force Nine&amp;rsquo;s Official DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS Campaign Maps are high-quality single-sided vinyl surfaces that are ideal for tracking the progress of your adventures during their campaigns! These maps lay flat for ease of play and are sold in sturdy polycarbonate tubes for easy storage and transport. The maps may be marked with WET-ERASE markers to temporarily record the paths your heroes travel, make notes about encounters and locations or the modify landscape to suit your own campaign. They also look great on the wall of your game room! The Campaign Maps measure 30&amp;quot; x 42&amp;quot;. All of GF9's Campaign Maps are based on artwork provided by Wizards of the Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While most of the great city-states of Athas are ruled by cruel sorcerer-kings, the free city of Tyr stands apart. The intrigues of Tyr attract many an adventurer looking for fame and glory or to simply survive in the harsh world of DARK SUN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This campaign map of the City of Tyr shows the various districts and landmarks of the great city. Players can keep track of their adventures in the city while DM&amp;rsquo;s can note locations of NPCs, shops, taverns, inns and other important location in their campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
