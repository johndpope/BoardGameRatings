			<description>The goal of this game is to score the highest amount of points in an agreed period of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Family Card Game for 2 Players. Components include 54 Cards including 27 Offense cards and 27 Defense cards, Football Token, Yard Marker, Instructions, Gameboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player draws 4 cards into their hand from their respective deck (person who is currently on offense takes 4 cards from the deck labeled offense, defensive player does the same but from the defensive deck)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a card, places faces down and when ready both reveal the cards and then resolve the play. Afterwards, each player draws a card from their respective deck so they will always have 4 cards at the start of a play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The offensive player has up to 4 cards (or downs) to get a 1st down. Punting is controlled by cards so if the offensive player does not have a punt card, they basically are forced to go for it regardless of field position. This is not Strat-o-Matic, folks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After scoring or turnover on downs, players shuffle all cards back into their respective decks and then exchange decks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
