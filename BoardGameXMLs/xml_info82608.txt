			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although &amp;ldquo;Lock-On: Flaming Cliffs&amp;rdquo; was released as an &amp;quot;unofficial expansion&amp;quot;, it hardly is: after publisher Ubisoft pulled the plug on the project, developer Eagle Dynamics decided to go through with it and developed and published it independantly. As such, due to legal issues, it could not use the &amp;lsquo;official expansion&amp;rsquo; tag.&lt;br/&gt;Lock On: Modern Air Combat had some bug issues and a number of those are addressed in this expansion. &amp;ldquo;Lock On: Flaming Cliffs&amp;rdquo;  enhances the graphics and includes seasonal ground texture (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn) and adjusts and adds to the documentation used in the game. The game features new aircraft skins, new single missions and new military and civilian ground facilities.&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps most importantly, it includes a new plane, the Su-25T as a flyable aircraft. There are new training missions with voice-over instructions and three new campaigns:&lt;br/&gt;In the first, the player flies the newly included Su-25T in some 20 new missions. The player is a Russian pilot &lt;br/&gt;In the second, the player flies the Su-27 in 26 new missions.&lt;br/&gt;And in the third, , the player flies the MiG-29 in 28 new missions.&lt;br/&gt;The player fights in a fictional military confrontation between Georgia and NATO (providing the terrorists with weapons!) versus Russia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
