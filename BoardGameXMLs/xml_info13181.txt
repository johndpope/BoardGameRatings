			<description>Ordjakt is a word-finding game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn a letter is selected by pulling one of the cards at random and looking at the reverse side. Then you select a suit and find enough cards from that suit (all alike) so that each player gets one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each card there are 15 categories. The players' task is to find one word that starts with the selected letter for each category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the box is the text &amp;quot;3:e fr&amp;aring;geserien&amp;quot; (3rd series of questions), so I assume that this game has earlier editions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The publishing year of 1950 is a guess, mostly from the general appearance of the game and the fact that is has categories like &amp;quot;war criminal&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;concentration camp&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was later reimplemented by Nya ordjakt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
