							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Secrets We Keep</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As winter releases its grip on the region surrounding the town of Phlan, secrets are revealed within Glumpen Swamp. Strange landscapes and sigils have been found beneath the mud, and the wildlife around the swamp has become greatly agitated. At times a spectral figure can be seen in the distance, only to disappear upon approach. Can you discover what is happening in the muck and gloom?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 4-hour Adventure for 11th &amp;ndash; 16th Level Characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure premiered at Links Con in Okemos, Michigan in June of 2017. The Secrets We Keep is a stand-alone adventure set in Phlan and Glumpen Swamp, and is best deployed after characters have played CCC-LINKS-01: Champion of the People (as some of those NPCs are used). There are loose hooks to CCC-UCON-01: Blood and Fog but playing that adventure is not necessary for full enjoyment here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure strongly features theatre of mind-style play and a number of riddles &amp;amp; puzzles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
