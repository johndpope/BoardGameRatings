			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Before the canals were filled up they were thoroughly dredged, and yielded forth a sensational array of sawed and split bones of all sizes...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;ndash;H.P. Lovecraft, The Horror at Red Hook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night is coming, and few truly know what secrets the brightly colored masks and costumes worn by revelers during Carnevale may conceal... Terror in Venice is the fifth deluxe expansion for Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game. Agents of good and ancient evils patrol the city's streets. All of them share terrifying secrets, and those secrets sit at the heart of this new theme-driven expansion. With its 165 new cards (three copies each of fifty-five individual cards), Terror in Venice explores the wealth of new conspiracies taking shape during a desperate race to gain control of the city's powerful Relics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terror in Venice expands the game with seven far-reaching conspiracies, explores the themes and mechanisms built around the Day and Night conditions, and introduces new Relics and powerful characters with the Fated keyword. Finally, with its emphasis on conspiracy and secrecy, Terror in Venice introduces a number of Masks, each of which affords a measure of protection to the character who wears it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
