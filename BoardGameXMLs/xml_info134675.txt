			<description>To start the game of Dox, red rings are placed on each of 24 circles on the game board.  These circles are arranged in a 5 x 5 grid, the center space being empty.   Player one starts by removing however many rings from any one straight line he chooses, horizontal or vertical, not diagonal.  He or she may remove one ring, all rings, or any number so long as they are on that straight line.  Player two then removes however many rings he chooses from any straight line.  Players continue taking turns until only one ring is left; the player who takes this ring loses the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is short so continued matches are expected, with losing players starting the next game and points being awarded as follows: five points for winning a game, ten points for winning a second game in succession, fifteen for winning a third in succession, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
