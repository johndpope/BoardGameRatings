							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oath of Blood: A Ravenloft Paladin Archetype</name>
									
			<description>For Vampiric Paladins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a monster, fated and infected by a vile curse that transformed you into a creature of nightmare. By some means&amp;mdash;whether by the lifedraining attack of an elder vampire, an ancient doom laid upon your family, the foul magic of a hateful enemy, or even by seeking immortal power yourself through ancient rites and alchemical formulas&amp;mdash;the curse of vampirism fell upon you. Rather than falling to it completely, however, you called upon the oaths of a paladin's fealty, and swore to use your dark nature in the service of a cause. The divine nature of your oath holds your curse at bay, but you are still infused with the power of darkness. Having already experienced death, you are a lethal creature of the night. Normal emotions have become alien to you. Only cold, gnawing hunger remains. As your power increases, your supernatural nature comes to the fore&amp;mdash;but will your humanity pay the price?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
