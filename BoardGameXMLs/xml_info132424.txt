							<name  sortindex="5">The Beano Card Game</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dandy and Beano Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Promotional game made for Cadbury's, the British chocolate manufacturers. The game is a mix of traditional games like Crazy Eights and Beat Your Neighbour. It utilises characters from Britain's two most popular comics, The Dandy and The Beano.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Object of the Game: To be the first player to get rid of all their cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.    Shuffle the cards and deal five to each player face down. The remaining cards are placed face down.&lt;br/&gt;This is the draw pile. Turn over the top card and place it adjacent to the draw pile. This is the start of the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;2.    Choose a starting player, play follows in a clockwise direction.&lt;br/&gt;3.    The starting player chooses one of their cards and places it face up onto the discard pile. Each card shows a Dandy or Beano character inside a coloured border. The chosen card must show either the same character or the same coloured border as the one below it in the pile. Play then passes to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;4.    Any player who is unable to play a card on their turn must take the top card from the draw pile and add it to their hand. Play then passes to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;5.    When a Roger the Dodger cord is played, the following player must pick up two cards from the draw pile and add them to their hand. Play then passes to the next player. However, a player does not have to pick up two cards if they can also play a Roger the Dodger card on top. In this case, the next player must pick up two cards instead. Play then passes to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;6.    When a Desperate Dan card is played, the following player must miss a turn.&lt;br/&gt;7.    If the draw pile runs out, the discard pile is shuffled and turned face down. The top card is then turned over to restart as in '3'.&lt;br/&gt;8.    The first player to get rid of all their cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
