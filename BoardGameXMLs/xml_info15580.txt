							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jem Rock n Romance Game</name>
									
			<description>This game, based on the 1980's animated TV show (which was later re-imagined in a 2015 live-action feature film), features a 3-D game board and an audio cassette. The object is to collect the most Jem and Jessica heart pieces. On your turn, you roll the die and advance the number of spaces indicated. If you land on a &amp;quot;Jem&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Jessica&amp;quot; space, you take a corresponding heart piece and then test Rio's affections. To do this you take the magnetic Jem or Jessica card and place either side against the magnetic Rio card. If the cards stick together, Rio is attracted to that girl and the player receives another heart. If the cards push apart, Rio is not interested and the player's turn ends. If you land on a guitar space, you must guess the next song that is randomly played on the audio cassette to receive two hearts (for either girl). Rio cards can be draw to help you or hinder your opponent. When a player reaches the Rio space at the end of the track, Rio's affections are tested one final time against either girl. If the cards stick then that girl his his true love, otherwise he likes the other girl. The player who has the most hearts for Rio's true love is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
