							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Characters in the Medieval Market</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you checked out the Medieval Market from DramaScape yet? No? Don't worry, I'll wait...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ok. By now I hope you've checked it out. Awesome, right? And free!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, what happens if your PCs want to visit this masterpiece of mapping? Who's there to greet them at each stall? What will they find there? Are there any plots brewing?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insta-NPCs Crossover: Medieval Market offers eleven different fantasy genre NPCs, each with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    a picture (courtesy of the Terrible Character Portraits Project by Jeff Preston - CC BY 3.0)&lt;br/&gt;    a description (who are they, where are they from, what's their backstory?)&lt;br/&gt;    and a few plots (what are they up to? are they in trouble? how can we get the PCs involved?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first and hopefully not the last of these, offering collections of pre-made NPCs inspired by the Insta-NPCs products (these were inspired by Insta-NPCs #10: Caveat Emptor)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
