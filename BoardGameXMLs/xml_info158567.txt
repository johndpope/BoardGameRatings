							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Domin√≥ Triangular</name>
									
			<description>Domin&amp;oacute; Triangular is a 36-piece set of triangular dominoes with the numbers 0 (blank) to 4; this normally makes a 35-piece set, but a second 0-1-2 was included in the opposite handedness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces are divided as evenly as possible among the players (except in a 2-player game, where 12 are left out). The first three plays are open, but they define a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; of dominoes which must be played to. After that the next two dominoes played (the first of which must be adjacent to the &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;) define a new circle which must be played to, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to play all of their dominoes, or if no one manages this, the player with the smallest total of pips on their remaining dominoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
