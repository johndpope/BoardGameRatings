							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eureka Seven vol. 2: The New Vision</name>
									
			<description>Eureka Seven vol. 2: The New Vision is the prequel to Eureka Seven vol.1: New Wave.  It is set on the same planet, but takes place two years after the incident in Eureka Seven: New Wave and immediately precedes the events of the anime series. Pilots of the giant mechanical humanoids known as LFOs enhanced by the Compac Feedback System (CFS) are experiencing dementia and even dying. The game focuses on the efforts of the main characters to stop the use of the CFS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sumner- A New Wave graduate, and former KLF pilot who went AWOL. He is now a professional Lifter, the name for the riders of jet-powered flying boards. The LFO he uses is the TypeR505 Kai. First appearance: Eureka Seven Episode 45 (Cameo)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ruri- A New Wave graduate whose combat skills are used to create the CFS. Ruri is outraged when she discovers it is a health hazard. She is mostly seen piloting Flestnia. First appearance: Eureka Seven Episode 45 (Cameo)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moondoggie- Moondoggie is a member of Gekkostate and a good friend of Sumner. Lifters use the energy wave phenomena that emanate from below the surface of the planet to gain momentum and stability. Moondoggie has the ability to sense when a big a wave is coming, and is also a pilot. First appearance: Eureka Seven anime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Eureka Seven vol. 2: The New Vision&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay involves a series of battles from first-person perspective in which you avoid the enemy attacks and respond by shooting weapons or closing for a melee attack.  There are also air battles with missiles, but on the whole the game seems more interested in graphics than any complicated gameplay or strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
