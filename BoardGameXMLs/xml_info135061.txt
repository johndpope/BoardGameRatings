							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cellars of Castle Cassoulet</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lords of Soy have made their ancestral seat at Castle Cassoulet for the last 9 generations. In former times it was a magnificent place but since the 7th Bean Baronet of Soy started to dabble in the darkest of the dark arts the family have been reduced to allowing thrill-seekers like you to explore his abandoned cellars and taking 10% of the value of any loot that is brought out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a great little solo adventure written by Sid Orpin for BEAN! The D2 RPG. There are lots of twists and turns and of course horrid Zombeans lurking in the darkness, can you survive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
