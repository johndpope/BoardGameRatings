							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">RalliSport Challenge 2</name>
									
			<description>Rallisport Challenge 2 is the sequel to the platinum hit Rallisport Challenge. This game contains new features such as a cockpit cameras and ability to change car at the last moment. However, stats like total horsepower and number of gears have been eliminated from the car selection screen.&lt;br/&gt;Cars are split up into 5 categories with 2 subcategories each plus &amp;quot;Classic&amp;quot; cars. There are 4 paint schemes on each car and drivers must drive 31, 87, and 149 miles before unlocking a new one. By winning all championships in the career mode, all paint schemes for all cars are unlocked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamers familiar with the original Rallisport Challenge will find this game familiar. There are a few changes however. For example, you no longer need to win every rally to win the level, as this game ranks you on cumulative time. Also there are more restrictions on car usage, with only one, occasionally two, classes of cars available each race. Multiplayer modes allowed for use of multiple Xbox consoles to be connected together to extend local competition to a maximum of sixteen players from the normal four.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;RalliSport Challenge 2,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
