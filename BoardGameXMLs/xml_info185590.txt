							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lonely Lyrakien</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build amazing relationships between your heroes and NPCs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lonely Lyrakien is a charming sprite, a heavenly emissary of Lady Luck, and a companion to heroes. With her former master long lost, she seeks new adventure in the company of those with the courage to overthrow tyranny without and to follow their lucky stars on a journey to discover new lands and new adventures even as they discover the truth hidden in their own hearts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Relationships contains a system for relationships that provides a meaningful progression and story for the significant NPCs your PCs might encounter in the course of a campaign, including secrets to uncover as the relationship progresses, and hurdles for the PC and the NPC to overcome together. Unlike other relationship systems that bottleneck on certain skills, often Diplomacy, Ultimate Relationships allows everyone to progress and reveal the NPC&amp;rsquo;s story at their own rate; it just might take some characters longer than others.&lt;br/&gt;NPC relationships in that Adventure Path as well as others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
