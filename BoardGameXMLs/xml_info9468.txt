			<description>Don't Get Rattled! is a dexterity game where players are trying to collect gold (and overcome a fear of snakes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The snake timer is wound up and players take turns recovering gold that the snake is guarding. This gold is in a plastic dish that triggers the snake to &amp;quot;snap&amp;quot; if it experiences too much movement. If the snake &amp;quot;snaps&amp;quot; during your turn, you cannot make a further attempt to collect a gold piece. The snake is reset and play continues with the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most gold is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
