			<description>An expansion for Star Fleet Battles Captain’s Edition, Star Fleet Battles - Module C6: Lost Empires covers the extinct Paravian and Carnivon empires, presented as their ships and weapons would have been by the time of the General War (except for that annoying extinction thing).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each empire is presented with two alternate histories, although players can ignore both and write their own if they wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Carnivons might have existed as a major empire between the Lyrans and Kzintis, or they might have escaped to the WYN Cluster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Paravians might have survived Gorn attempts to destroy their empire and could have ended up allied to the Romulans (while the ISC became allies of the Gorns). Alternately, they could exist as edge-of-the-map raiders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;260 Pages, 280 die-cut counters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
