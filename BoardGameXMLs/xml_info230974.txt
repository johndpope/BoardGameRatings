			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your homelands are in turmoil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten long years ago, Gorkill the Ruthless and his armies invaded The Empire of Edhen. The kingdom was unprepared for such swift brutality, and the crown was overthrown within days. Princess Elyn, the remaining heir to the throne, barely escaped the carnage thanks to the quick thinking of Sir Erik the Bold, the palace&amp;rsquo;s last-surviving champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 5 years, Sir Erik has been formulating a plan to take back the kingdom, and it&amp;rsquo;s finally time for action. For his gambit to work, he requires the services of four persons with very specialized talents: a warrior stout of heart, a rogue deft in slight-of-hand, an expert underworld explorer, and a sorcerer of immense arcane powers. You are Sir Erik&amp;rsquo;s scribe, gifted with a flair for language; Sir Erik has passed the responsibly for recruiting his team onto you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your research has revealed four individuals who would be perfect for Sir Erik&amp;rsquo;s quest. You now need to convince each of them to join your master&amp;rsquo;s crusade to reclaim the lands of Edhen from the grips of Gorkill. And so you now sit down to write four very important dispatches to four very powerful adventurers&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quill Quest: The Warlord&amp;rsquo;s Downfall is a scenario supplement for use with Quill: A Letter-Writing Roleplaying Game for a Single Player. In Quill Quest, you&amp;rsquo;ll be responsible for writing four letters in an attempt to recruit four adventurers to Sir Erik&amp;rsquo;s cause: Britha the Warrior, Kamron the Rogue, Roinan the Dwarf, and Bartholomew the Wizard. After receiving your letters, will they join your quest? Have your words motivated them to offer additional benefits to the team? Or have your words insulted and enraged them so much that they are driven to sabotage any future letters you&amp;rsquo;ve written?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
