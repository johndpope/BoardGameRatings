			<description>Pocket-Dungeons is print &amp;amp; play competitive dungeon-crawl board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to find exit from the dungeon and escape with more loot collected than any other player has.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be certain obstacles to overcome, such as other players (delvers), deadly monsters (dwellers) and nasty traps that tend to trigger on almost every action in the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning players take turns building dungeon by placing dungeon tiles, dungeon doors and face down tokens (that represent treasures, hazards/traps or dungeon exit). Then each player chooses a unique hero (each with its own features and special skills) and enters the dungeon. During his turn player can move, attack another delver/dweller or make an action (open door, flip token, pickup treasure). Alternatively player can control any dweller if that was spawned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trap and hazard types as well as their outcomes are resolved by dice throwing. Exact hazard or trap is then determined by using according chart, weather it will be poison dart targeting unfortunate delver or gas cloud that spreads all over the dungeon when every character has to pass a check to survive.&lt;br/&gt;Combat outcomes also are resolved by throwing corresponding number of defense and (counter)attack dice depending on character combat abilities and attack/defense types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In case player character was defeated, all the characters loot is dropped and player starts over with next available character. Or spawned dwellers can be controlled instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who managed to escape the dungeon with most loot collected is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
