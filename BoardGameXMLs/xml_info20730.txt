			<description>With 42 wooden rods ( six color groups of seven rods each) you should try to build as high a tower as possible. The color die decides if you have to put new rods on top of the tower or if you can pass the die to the next player without adding rods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with 2 different colored rods placed parallel on the playing surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player rolls the die, if rolls the same color  as one of the rods on top of the tower, he can pass the die to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If he rolls a different color as one of the  two rods on top of the tower, he must place to new, differently colored, rods on top of the tower. These have to be placed at a right angle to the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You continue to play like this clockwise in turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over when the tower collapses. The player who caused the crash loses the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
