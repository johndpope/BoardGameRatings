			<description>A light party game built around intriguing prompts for lively conversation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt three cards from the deck. Cards show 1, 2, or 3 points in the bottom lefthand corner, indicating the depth or gravity of the card. A 1-point card might ask, &amp;quot;What's the worst advice you ever received?&amp;quot; A 2-point card might ask, &amp;quot;Is it okay to cry at work?&amp;quot; A 3-point card might ask, &amp;quot;What happens after we die?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players select one card and play it facedown in the center of the table. The cards are shuffled and revealed, and everyone points to the card they want to discuss (with the caveat that players are not allowed to vote for their own card). Tied votes are resolved through discussion until a player changes their vote and creates a majority.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When your card is selected, you receive the number of points shown on the chosen card. The game ends when the deck is played through, and the player with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
