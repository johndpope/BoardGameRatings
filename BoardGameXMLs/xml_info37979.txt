							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crummy Rummy</name>
									
			<description>The game deck consists of cards with one or two letters each. A round begins with one card in the middle of the table. Players then add cards to the starting letter one at a time so as to produce legitimate words at each step.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are scored by making words that no other player can steal, meaning that no other player can make another word just by adding one card to the beginning or end of it. Points might also be scored by playing your last card, although rules are unclear on this point. They simply say, &amp;quot;Ten points are given to the first player to declare 'Crummy Rummy'&amp;quot; but they do not elaborate on the circumstances under which a player is entitled to so declare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
