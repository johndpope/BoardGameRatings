			<description>The game is huge, about 18 inches wide and 27 inches tall when assembled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea is to use the Magi-Scope dart gun to shoot the spys who will blow up the girl hostage if you miss.&lt;br/&gt;Access to the house is gained by shooting the bomb on the roof which causes the facade panel to fall down exposing the interior. There are two spys hiding behind the pictures on the wall and you can see them if you look through the red Magi-Scope atop the gun. When the upper picture is shot out it releases the master spy who comes down the stairs and will hit the TNT plunger and blow up the hostage if you don't shoot him before he reaches it. An amazing piece of design!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete this sequence correctly, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
