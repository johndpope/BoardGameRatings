			<description>The 13th Age Roleplaying Game supplement to rock your players&amp;rsquo; world.&lt;br/&gt;Kickstarter Great Success!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Never again find yourself stuck for a good Icon Relationship result. Pick from the tables or let the dice decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Better yet, let the dice inspire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM advice on tailoring the Icon Relationship result to the character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hundreds of Icon Relationship results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example: A PC gets hugely important information from an agent of an icon. A clockwork owl tells them how to find a secret door. The door leads to a passage that allows them ambush the foes directly ahead. They can surprise their foes and start the battle with the escalation die already on one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gods with suggested backgrounds for followers, paladins, clerics, and druids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three pantheons: the Bright Gods, the Thirsty Gods, and the Old Gods. Add these gods to your campaign or map their effects to your own gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gods and Icons shows how the servants of the gods lend support to the icons. A 5 or a 6 Icon Relationship roll may bring in all sorts of divine intervention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thirteen new icons. Use them or steal aspects and apply them to your own icons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can use this book with the core icons, as the new icons are similar enough for you to just use the boons and complications from Gods and Icons without changing your existing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet different enough to feel fresh, and give a new spin to a 13th Age Campaign that uses them. A perfect set of icons for a campaign rich in intrigue and mystery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dhampir. A new playable race for a new icon of the undead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Publisher Blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
