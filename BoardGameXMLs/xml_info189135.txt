			<description>Fylgia is a abstract strategy game. The winner is the player with playing pieces left on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player has 5 pieces and the board is 8x5 big. On your turn you can only move one step diagonally. And you can also only strike diagonally. Every time you do a standard move you can change a bonus-counter one step to a max of three. To use your bonus is the only way to move in a straight line, in any direction accept diagonally. And you have to move as many steps as your bonus-counter is on. Before or after such movement your are allowed to do a standard move diagonally. After the movement is done, the bonus-counter is reduced to nil, and you have to start to get new bonus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
