Racing is a hovercraft racing simulator based on the world of A.I.M. 2: Clan Wars game.&lt;br/&gt;Action time: after the events occurring in A.I.M. 2: Clan Wars.&lt;br/&gt;Scene of action: the special tracks constructed by the Network for the races participants on the distant planet Range-4.&lt;br/&gt;For those who could not live without feeling the speed, a roar of engines and the plasma charges tearing the enemy's glider covering, the Network had created race tracks. Familiar, but the changed world with all its beauty is again opened for you. However there is no time to choose the accurate strategy, find the best place for selling goods and capture the enemy clan's base. There is only time to rush forward, avoid the opponent's fire and push away everything on the way. Full throttle! The Network counts every second, and no matter how fast you are, you have to be the first across the finish line to win.&lt;br/&gt;There is no point in saving for new glider and thinking of buying powerful guns. The Network will let you choose any racing vehicle and set of weapons you want, just win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
