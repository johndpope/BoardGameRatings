							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Haunted House (2010)</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over thirty years have passed since your grandfather disappeared without a trace while searching for the magical Urn, a mystery that has hung over the heads of you and your bewildered family for decades. That is, until a mysterious letter arrives that claims to have insight into your grandfather's whereabouts... the return address... the town of Spirit Bay. Now you find yourself following in the footsteps of your grandfather and all that have come before... you have entered the Haunted House, and for better or for worse, embark on a great adventure. The question remains, however, as the shadows draw near... are you afraid of the dark?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
