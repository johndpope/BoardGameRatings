			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are stranded in Africa. Can you find your way back to camp?&lt;br/&gt;You step out of the safari truck to take photos of a giraffe and the vehicle takes off without you. Now you're on your own and a pack of hyenas are coming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Serengeti National Park isn't a safe place. There are lions out here ... lots of lions. You wanted to see animals up close and now you're getting your wish as you try and find your way back to civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an interactive story. Every decision YOU make changes the story. Choose your path wisely if you are going to avoid getting eaten and make it back to your family. Oh, and watch out for the rhino poachers, they're armed and dangerous!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
