							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cupcake Race</name>
									
			<description>Cupcake Race is a simple children's game for 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players 'race' to complete their cupcake first, which involves spinning and moving around the board to the 'PARTY' at the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stops along the way include Mix it, Bake it, Frost it, and Top it, each with a corresponding accessory to add to your cupcake, along with sprinkles of various shapes and colours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contents are of very high quality plastic, with a sturdy game board and box, however the game itself will likely entertain only the youngest players (ages 4+).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Box:&lt;br/&gt;There's a party tonight, and you (and your opponents) have been asked to bring the cupcakes. The Race is on! Be the first player to MIX, BAKE, FROST, and TOP your cupcake by visiting all 4 corners, and collect sprinkles along the way. The first player to reach the party with a completed cupcake and a sprinkle of each color wins the cherry to put on the top! &amp;quot;Mix it, Bake it, Frost it, Top it! So Much Fun, You Just Can't Stop It!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
