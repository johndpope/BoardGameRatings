							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doodle Score</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Find out what&amp;rsquo;s your &amp;ldquo;Doodle Score&amp;rdquo; in 6 x 3 different playing modes! You&amp;rsquo;ve got 6, 12 or 18 seconds to draw a line with your finger. When the time is up, your doodle will be scored depending on the playing mode that you selected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are the playing modes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Most Crossings: draw a doodle that has as many crossings with itself as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Most Regions: draw a doodle that divides the white area into as many separate regions as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Longest Line: draw a line that is as long as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Longest Line, no Crossings: draw a line that is as long as possible, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t cross itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Composite Score: this is a combination of the first three playing modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Small Regions: draw a doodle that divides the white area into many separate regions. All regions should be as small as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doodle Score is OpenFeint enabled, and also uses Game Center on the newer iOS versions. Leader boards and achievements worth 800 points are available on both services. After you played a game, you can always send the result as a challenge to one of your OpenFeint friends. For best results, we recommend that you allow Doodle Score to send you notifications.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
