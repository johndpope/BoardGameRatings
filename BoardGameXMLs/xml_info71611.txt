			<description>Faxanadu is a side-scrolling adventure game and an RPG. It is set in the town of Eolis, situated at the base of the world tree. Your character, (Unnamed) is charged with righting the wrongs of the world, namely finding the cause of the well running dry and the massive flow of monsters throughout the city. The king grants you 1500 Golds and you set out on your way. Throughout the game, you obtain items such as weapons and armor. Defeating enemies grants you experience points and you level up as you play. The game had a unique saving system where you would record &amp;quot;Mantras&amp;quot; received from various Gurus. You can then enter the Mantra the next time you play so that you may continue from that point. &lt;br/&gt;[User Summary]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
