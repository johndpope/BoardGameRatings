			<description>A Swedish board game based on the popular long-running science TV show for children called Hj&amp;auml;rnkontoret (&amp;quot;brain office&amp;quot;). &lt;br/&gt;You throw the dice and move around the outer ring of the board. The space you land on decide what kind of question you will get. The questions are about science, biology, physics and common knowledge, but there are also riddles. If you get the answer right you get pieces of paper that look like money, but they actually represent different amount of brain cells. &lt;br/&gt;When you have enough brain cells you get to enter the paths that go into the middle of the board. On those paths you continue to get questions, but you also get to do challenges. The challenges are things you do with your body, for example you could get a card that says you have 30 seconds to try and wiggle your ears using only the muscles in your head. When you successfully do a challenge you get a star. &lt;br/&gt;When you have gathered 3 stars you are allowed to try and reach the very center of the board. The first one to get there (with the right amount of brain cells AND stars) wins the game. &lt;br/&gt;As a reward the winner of the game gets to perform an experiment from the experiment folder. As an example, the experiment can be to charge a comb with static electricity and then hold it agains a stream of water and see what happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
