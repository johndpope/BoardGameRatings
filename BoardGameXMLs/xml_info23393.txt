			<description>Hero Factory released this collectible card game in the summer of 2006 based on the popular Robotech television series. The game simulates battles between opposing factions, and features all the characters and mechas from the anime. Though not 'collectible' in a traditional sense (all of the cards are the same rarity, sold in pre-constructed 'theme' decks), the game is still fully customizable, with over 250 unique cards planned in the full set for deck construction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 5 different decks currently available, each containing 50 cards with a fixed composition (no randomly inserted cards):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robotech CCG Starter deck&lt;br/&gt;Azonia' Forces Deck&lt;br/&gt;Blue Squadron Deck&lt;br/&gt;Breetai's Forces Deck&lt;br/&gt;The SDF-1 Deck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hero Factory also plans to release two additional decks, the 'Robotech Masters 2-Player Starter' and the 'New Generation 2-Player Starter', early in 2007, but further details beyond that point have not been disclosed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
