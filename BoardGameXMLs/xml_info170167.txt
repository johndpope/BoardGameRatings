			<description>Advanced Title Bout is the next step in the evolution of the classic board game that debuted over thirty years ago as an Avalon Hill/Sports Illustrated board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like its predecessor, Advanced Title Bout is a simulation of the sport of professional boxing; and like the original game, Advanced Title Bout provides the speed, unpredictability and excitement of the fight game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, Advanced Title Bout makes use of over twenty years of additional research and innovation, making the rated fighters the most accurate rendition to date. The newest iteration of the classic boxing board game also includes completely revised tables, as well as new ones to add even more realism and accuracy to the simulation. Fighers are now rated in the prime and past prime of their careers. Normal and fatigue mode across 17 categories!&lt;br/&gt;In Print and for the first time PDF! A new game board design! Still using the same FAC deck idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
