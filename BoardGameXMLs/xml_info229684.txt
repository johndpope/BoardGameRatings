			<description>Card game version of Tjuv och polis (a classic Swedish boardgame).&lt;br/&gt;A simple card game there you try to collect as many of the money-cards you can before a police-card is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You take one card fram the draw-pile and take to the hand. If you have collected at least one thief and money-card in the same color you can either play it and collect the money or wait for more money-cards. But as soon one player draws a police-card you can risk to lose the money-cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player that has collected most money when the last card is taken from the pile is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
