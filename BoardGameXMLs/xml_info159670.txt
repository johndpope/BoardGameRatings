			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After centuries lost in the Warp, the Ardent Crown has returned in a degrading orbit around the world of Solace. This vessel vanished carrying a number of important relics, and in this Deathwatch adventure, a Kill-team has been assembled to board the derelict as it drifts toward the world of Solace, secure the sacred artefacts, and extract from the voidship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the Battle-Brothers are not alone in their ambitions aboard the Ardent Crown. An Eldar Farseer also has designs for a particular relic, and leads an elite team of her allies in her quest to take it back. And while the Eldar are powerful and duplicitous foes, something even more terrible lurks aboard the Ardent Crown, stirring after aeons of cold slumber as footsteps fall once again on the long-abandoned decks. The Battle- Brothers of the Deathwatch must face these enemies, cast them down in the name of the Emperor, and escape the Ardent Crown before it plummets to its demise. The fate of the sector and the honour of the Deathwatch alike hang in the balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally written for use at Gen Con Indy 2013, Binding Contracts, Falling Star, Shedding Light, and Salvaging Solace are adventures for Warhammer 40,000 Roleplaying. The four linked scenarios concern the fate of the Imperial world of Solace. While each adventure stands on its own as a complete module suitable for immediate play, a group that plays all four adventures will spot the connections between the events as they transpire around the hive world of Solace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Binding Contracts, Falling Star, Shedding Light, and Salvaging Solace each include a full adventure, pre-generated characters, and the profiles for any NPCs unique to the adventure. Each is designed to be run with the system for which it was written and requires a copy of the appropriate Core Rulebook to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using all four of these adventures, a GM can create a cohesive event that tells the story of the Fall of Solace from multiple different perspectives, revealing the many factors that contributed to the events slowly over the course of the four individual stories. Because these adventures were originally written for use at a convention, each one includes notes on the time that should be devoted to given sections. If the GM wishes to run one of these adventures in a typical four to six hour convention timeslot, these notes can be useful; if the GM is not under any time restrictions, however, he should feel free to pace the adventure as he sees fit based on the group and other circumstances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
