			<description>This old card game plays similar to Go Fish. There are 10 different kinds of fruit (30 cards - 3 of each type) with a guard for each. The guard with the 3 cards it protects forms a set. The cards are distributed equally amongst the players. On a turn, you may ask any player for a fruit provided that you yourself hold either a fruit or the guard from that set. If the player has the fruit asked for, he must give it up, unless he has the guard of that fruit; for example, if one player asks another for an apple which he has, if he also holds the dog, he may refuse, saying, &amp;quot;My apples are guarded by my dog.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You continue calling for fruit until you call on a person who either doesn't have any or has the guard for that set. Once stopped, all players draw 2 cards from the player to their left. Guards cannot be called away, but since they are frequently passed, their location is often doubtful. When you collect all 4 cards in a set, you lay them down in front of you. The player with the most sets at the end is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
