							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gist: The Game of Dueling Metaphors</name>
									
			<description>This is a twist on Apples to Apples. Deal each player five cards from the OF deck to start the game. Each round, the Decider draws a card from the THE deck. Each other player then plays an OF card and replenishes his hand. Each combination of THE and OF creates a question in the form of, &amp;quot;What is the X of Y?&amp;quot; After everyone has a chance to explain their combination, players predict which combination of THE and OF the Decider will choose, and then the Decider makes his choice. Score for predicting correctly and for playing the chosen OF card. An example might be, &amp;quot;What is THE microwave OF friendship.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
