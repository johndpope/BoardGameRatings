							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">I&#039;ll Plague Both Your Houses (5E)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 5th Edition Mini-Dungeon adventure for 4 level 11 PCs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Underworld houses strange and unpleasant communities, and the ruins of two temple complexes are a perfect example of religious hubris coming before a fall. Two traditions devoted to bloody sacrifi ce and unwilling death - one lawful, one chaotic - found this remote cavern an ideal place to practice their beliefs AND constant, petty one-upmanship, far from interfering good-doers. But a malignantly wicked elf, devoid of distraction from his evil intent, played the followers against each other until all were slaughtered. However, he didn&amp;rsquo;t reckon on some senior members becoming powerful undead intent on wiping him and each other out. He&amp;rsquo;s now stuck in a &amp;ldquo;neutral zone&amp;rdquo;. The PCs walk into this three-way standoff . This encounter is a stiff challenge for the suggested levels. The party will need to set individuals against others to succeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
