			<description>Schwerpuckt is a set of miniature rules for playing large WW2 battles.  Each stand is 1 company, 1&amp;quot;=200 yards, and 1 turn = 30 minutes.  Most mechanics use single die rolls with situational modifiers to speed play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are 20 pages, and cover the usual fire, movement, and morale rules.  Army lists and scenarios will be posted on the Web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.freewebs.com/tommiatkins/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.freewebs.com/tommiatkins/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More info from the Web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World War 2 is a incredibly well supported area as regards wargame rules...... for skirmish or company level rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's out there for Brigade and above? Spearhead? (Rolls around on floor in stitches, gasp! gasp!) Yeah there is a set of rules that reflects reality! Oooh yes please!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's actually needed, is a set of rules that reflects the kind of decisions that a commander at this level takes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is their command attacking or defending, are they dispersed or concentrated? What is the units strengths and weaknesses? The penetration ability of a Sherman easy eight vs a PzKpfw IV's rear plate is NOT on his mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That his light tank battalion are probing towards the objective supported by a Elite mechanized infantry battalion will be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCHWERPUNKT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Schwerepunkte is different to any WW2 miniatures rules in this respect. It takes you to the Divisional HQ and asks you to make the kind of decisions that will spell victory or defeat. Dice are involved, good equipment will help, but it's YOUR actions that will carry or lose the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The usual tommiatkins &amp;quot;one roll of a D6&amp;quot; settles combat, players will be in command of Infantry, Engineers, Artillery, Armour, Signallers,(get those unused radio cars out)and Military police etc. Anti-Aircraft fulfills its true role instead of being &amp;quot;another Anti-tank&amp;quot; unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Schwerpunkt will allow 6 players to fight Arnhem with every unit involved in a full day with time to get totally hammered on cheap red wine afterwards.  Two players can do Arras 1940 to a conclusion in 20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, If your fed up with rolling a hundred dice in FOW, and knowing that if you roll higher than your opponent then you've won, keep your eyes open for Schwerpunkt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what do we have?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heres whats in already:&lt;br/&gt;1) Minefields&lt;br/&gt;2) Signals&lt;br/&gt;3) Military Police &amp;amp; Kommisar's&lt;br/&gt;4) Night Fighting&lt;br/&gt;5) Squadron level air support, Air recon and AAA&lt;br/&gt;6) Harrassing artillery fire &amp;amp; on-call fire missions&lt;br/&gt;7) Bridging and demolition&lt;br/&gt;8) Detached company support units&lt;br/&gt;9) Ambushes approach and surprise fire&lt;br/&gt;10) Combined arms supporting&lt;br/&gt;11) Engineers&lt;br/&gt;12) Formation's (I.E: Concentrated/Dispersed/All Round defense/ Deploying)&lt;br/&gt;13) Airborne assault and Marines&lt;br/&gt;14) Real Reconnaissance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
