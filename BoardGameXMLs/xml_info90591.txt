			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book describes Novacastria - a city reborn from the devastation that was the Daemornia!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the material in this book you can build a Daemornia campaign on Earth, where the forces of humanity are starting to reach out and discover what has happened to their world in the dark decades before. They will be in for some surprises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The material presented is 'human-centric', but Offworlders are present and very active in Novacastria, and GMs should encourage their players to bring such 'new blood' into their campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as the city of Novacastria, the surrounding environs are detailed, and everything you read will have clues and hooks that lead to adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pivotal concept in the material is the relationship between Daemonic magic, and Gurri magic. The Gurri (Australian aboriginals) have an ancient mythology, steeped in magic that appears even older than that of the Daemons, and is likewise rooted in primal energies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not every outcome in this book is set in stone - the various possibilities are described, and the GM and players can chose which path their campaign will take. Will subterfuge and cunning be the order of the day, or will strength-of-arms see the players through? The choice is yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
