							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rogue Companies, Rival Agencies, and Renegade Operations</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This special METAs file update adds details on three organizations entries into the Rogues, Rivals &amp;amp; Renegades series. Each organization features an iconic character in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration. Sample characters range from PL 5 to PL 10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rogue Company Vulcan Energy presents itself as a successful powerhouse corporation built on energy production, but is also invested in popular and news media. The corporation is led by CEO Titus Tate, a charming and ambitious man who is more than willing to let others pay the price for his power lust. This disregard for others has already laid the foundations for catastrophe, unless your heroes can uncover the hidden dangers they represent!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rival Agency Saito Solutions is best known for their heroic Safeguard, an iconic hero in Beacon City(detailed in the Elements of Ruin: The Challengers free supplement from Vigilance Press). What many do not know, however, is their relationship to the villain Backfire, who uses stolen technology to besmirch the good name of Saito Solutions. Their interests in creating new and advanced rescue technology depend on the good deeds of their allies outweighing the evil deeds of their foes in the eyes of their investors. With many military and criminal organizations seeking to weaponize their proprietary rescue technologies, they&amp;rsquo;ll need all the allies they can get!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Renegade Organization Little Sister is a natural outgrowth of internet hacker culture in a world where meta-humans are a fact of life. They are a large but disorganized group of hacktivists who target supervillains (usually). Ostensibly leaderless, their public face is often that of the mysterious Miss Rule, whose cartoon logo and vocal presence online has become emblematic of the group. As a group they may be helpful one day and viciously harmful the next, making them a very tricky organization to try and work with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
