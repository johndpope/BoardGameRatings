			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;You were awfully proud of yourself when you strode into King Torg's chamber with the baby you snatched from Tabriz.  There was a big party and you were the kobold of the hour.  Unfortunately, fame, like a full belly, is fleeting and soon kobolds were stealing babies from all manner of ridiculously dangerous sites; the Never-ending Strawberry Fields, Iowa Jim's Temple of Foreboding, and Bob the God's Happy Fun Park just to name a few.  Most of the kobolds who set out after these babies are never heard from again, but every once in a while one of them gets lucky... like what's his name, the guy who brought back the possessed baby.  (Thems good eatin!  Not that you know this from personal experience mind you but the look on King Torg's face when he gobbled it down was unmistakable!) OR SO YOU THOUGHT!  Unfortunately, possessed babies are... well... possessed and there's a certain demon that's giving King Torg quite a toothache.  Now it's up to you to find the only thing that can save him - The Toothpick of Exorcism!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Solo Adventure for use with the Kobolds Ate My Baby! role-playing game.  You will need a copy of Kobolds Ate My Baby!, some paper, a handful of dice and the ability to read.  Along with the adventure you will find a map of the lands of the Necro-Groundhog for use with BLT! the official Kobolds Ate My Baby! collectable boardgame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BATTLE EVIL UNDEAD RODENTS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EXPERIENCE KOBOLD DENTISTRY!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MASH THE ONE-HEADED ETTIN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BRAVE THE DREADED SWAMP OF BEAUTY!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
