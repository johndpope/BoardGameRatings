Using ancient technologies and forbidden science, the Eidolon and their leader, Hekkador Pharen Cul, seek to destabilize and undermine Helium and other nations, replacing the leadership with their own puppets. Allied with these white-skinned devils are a coalition of Red Martian nobility, Green Martian renegades, and a cadre of bloodthirsty raiders and pathan mercenaries. Throughout this 4 part adventure epic, the heroes will discover and battle their foes across Barsoom, from the streets of cities such as Greater and Lesser Helium, to the decks of mighty airships, to the ruined wastes and dead cities of the Barsoomian wilds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, it includes miniatures rules for using the John Carter of Mars models to recreate desperate battles, as well as the planned ship deck plans in ship to ship encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
