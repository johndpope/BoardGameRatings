							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NHL Hitz Pro</name>
									
			<description>Unlike the previous titles in the series, NHL Hitz Pro has 5-on-5 gameplay instead of the usual 3-on-3 game play with the earlier titles. Despite that fact, however, the game does not include penalty shots, meaning that players will never be awarded any penalty shots during gameplay. It is an arcade-type hockey game and has, as the name suggests, a lot of hard hitting, appealing more often to casual hockey fans than hardcore ones. The cover athlete of the game is Nicklas Lidstr&amp;ouml;m.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike many other hockey video games of the 21st century, NHL Hitz Pro had the IIHF license, enabling it to use the jerseys of the Olympic hockey teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also has many game modes, one of the most popular being the &amp;quot;Pick-Up Hockey&amp;quot; game mode, where the game would turn into either a roller, street, or pond hockey match-up between two amateur teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;NHL Hitz Pro&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
