							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombicide Survivor: Ivy</name>
									
			<description>Not so long ago, Ivy was one of the world's best assassins. Nobody knew her real name, nor where to find her, but every mob boss knew she was a real witch with guns. And then, one day, Ivy vanished. Rumors said she went down in an epic gunfight against the Triads. Or the FBI. Or the bodyguards of an African Warlord. Rumors...&lt;br/&gt;The fact is Ivy retired with a new identity and a new life as a socialite. From charity to jet-set life, she wanted to do a little good and have a good time while she was at it.&lt;br/&gt;Now, with the zombie outbreak, Ivy&amp;rsquo;s dusting off her old skills. Saving lives is a little change of pace, and it does feel good. And well, a head shot is still a head shot right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ivy is a promotional Survivor that was available to those that pledged extra during the Kickstarter campaign.  She may be available in limited quantities at upcoming conventions.  A zombie version (Zombivor) will be available to backers in 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
