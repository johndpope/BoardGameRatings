			<description>From the inside cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TANGLE&lt;br/&gt;The Game of Strategy and Capture&lt;br/&gt;For 2,3 or 4 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Copyright 1964 By SELCHOW &amp;amp; RIGHTER COMPANY, Bay Shore, New York&lt;br/&gt;Made in U.S.A.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Directions for Playing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Tangle is a game of pure skill and strategy, there is absolutely no luck or chance involved. All playing pieces are in full view allowing the players to anticipate each strategic move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1 Playing Board with 93 hexagon (six sided) shapes called Tangle Tiles.&lt;br/&gt;    116 Playing Pieces &amp;ndash; 29 of each color.&lt;br/&gt;    4 Scoring Keys&lt;br/&gt;    4 Storage Trays&lt;br/&gt;    4 Scoring Rims&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object Of Game:&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to have the highest total points when the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How To Score Points:&lt;br/&gt;1. When a player encloses all six sides of a Tangle Tile with his particular color playing pieces, he has captured that tile and scores points.&lt;br/&gt;2. Tangle playing pieces-values:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Only the final piece that completes the surrounding of the Tangle Tile counts toward point value and only if all six sides of the Tangle Tile are surrounded by the same color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Each playing piece has its own point value.&lt;br/&gt;Note: There are six shapes from small to large point values are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, and 5 points.&lt;br/&gt;4. Tangle Tile values:&lt;br/&gt;The Tangle Tiles on the board also have point values, which are added to the value of the final playing piece that completes the surrounding of a Tangle Tile. These values are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Plain Tile &amp;ndash; 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;    Circular Design Tile &amp;ndash; 2 points&lt;br/&gt;    Triangular Design Tile &amp;ndash; 2 points plus double the value of the completing Tangle playing piece.&lt;br/&gt;    Square Design Tile &amp;ndash; 4 points plus double the value of the completing Tangle playing piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Play:&lt;br/&gt;1. Each player&amp;rsquo;s first turn must start with one side of his playing piece touching one of the six sides of the Center Star Tangle Tile.&lt;br/&gt;2. Players alternate turns.&lt;br/&gt;3. All pieces in play must be continuously connected (regardless of color) even when blocking.&lt;br/&gt;4. If a player places a playing piece on the board which does not complete a Tangle Tile his turn ends.&lt;br/&gt;5. A player is entitled to an immediate extra turn for every Tangle Tile he completely surrounds in his own color.&lt;br/&gt;6. Total points are kept on the scoring rim as each Tangle Tile is surrounded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conclusion Of Game:&lt;br/&gt;Play is ended when one player has used all his playing pieces or when one player has reached the total of 50 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner:&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest total of points when the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play For Partners:&lt;br/&gt;Partners sit facing each other. If Green and Blue pieces are on one team, points are scored for that team when tiles are surrounded 1. All in Green, 2. All in Blue, or 3. In Blue and Green.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
