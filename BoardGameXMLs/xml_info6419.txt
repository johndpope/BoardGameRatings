			<description>The board shows a typical stretch of Hollywood West: there's a town at the center with a rail line and a stage line running through it, a badlands in one corner where the outlaws hide out, and an Indian village in another corner. Players take the roles of outlaws, sheriffs, marshals, or gunfighters; round up gangs or posses and then either rob the stage/train/bank/whatever, or chase those that do, or challenge each other to gunfights, based on their profession and location on the board. Gunfights are abstract and are handled by a single roll of the die on a CRT. Outlaws win by stashing away loot, lawmen win by stashing away outlaws, and gunfighters win by reaching a high enough reputation level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
