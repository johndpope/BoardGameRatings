			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mobile Man is an arcade adventure game with ecological overtones. A nearby planet has been turned into a galactic junkyard. Mutants terrorize the population and barrels of radioactive waste cover the landscape. Armed with your trusty Mobileman, you decide to put an end to this and rid the planet of its junk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mobile man is a sidescrolling arcade adventure game. The player must explore tunnels and destroy mutants and barrels. Flowers can be picked up that change the color of the player's shots (mutants are only vulnerable to shots of their own color). Any contact with a monster costs a life, and there is an energy bar that needs to be periodically replenished by visiting food sources. The game also has puzzle elements like walls that can be destroyed or hidden flowers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
