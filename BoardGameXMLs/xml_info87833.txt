			<description>Andretti Racing (also known as Mario Andretti Racing) is a video game that was released in 1994 on the Sega Mega Drive and Genesis. It was an early title in the newly-created EA Sports line, and was developed by Stormfront Studios. The game was produced by famed sports game developer Scott Orr as part of his collaboration with Richard Hilleman in the creation of EA Sports. Race driver Mario Andretti personally guided the development of the AI used by the non-player drivers in stock cars, Indy style open wheel racing, and dirt track racing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's greatest innovation was the presence of different physics and AI for three kinds of racing in one cartridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of Andretti Racing led Orr and Hilleman to work with Stormfront to launch the highly successful NASCAR Racing series, which continues as one of the best-selling franchises in the EA Sports lineup today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second game, also called Andretti Racing, was released for the Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and PC in 1996.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Andretti Racing&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
