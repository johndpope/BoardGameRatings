			<description>44 cards, depicting 7 sets of six animals plus two Hunter Cards. The object is to collect sets of three cards of the same animal.&lt;br/&gt;This visits the same territory as Jungle Thrills but with differences. The main one being that you no longer bag wild animals. The Hunter card in this one is a bad card and should you have it in your hand at the end of the game, it will count against you.&lt;br/&gt;Sponsored by Armand and Michaela Dennis, the most famous wild animal experts on British television.&lt;br/&gt;Here players were still encouraged to shoot wild animals, but now with cameras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
