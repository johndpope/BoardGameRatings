			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first issue of an irregular &amp;lsquo;zine for Crypts and Things, with content compatible with other Old School games based on 1st or Original editions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This small tome contains the following fragments of fear to bring your games to life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Achievements. A short system that sits alongside the experience system to reward characters for things they have done in their adventures, making them memorable events and useful benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Secret of Skull Hill. A short adventure of mystery and otherworldly delights featuring the schemes of an alien parasitic race and their attempts to reunite the body and soul of their host god.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By their Master&amp;rsquo;s Dark Command. The sad and short lives of Sorcerer&amp;rsquo;s apprentices revealed, and the useful things they become after death detailed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exotic Liquid Relief by Neil Shaw. Is your character bored with quaffing bog standard Blackmire&amp;rsquo;s Best whenever they need to regenerate 1d6 Hit Points? Well Neil Shaw provides details of a variety of brews to make your character&amp;rsquo;s life more varied and interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generic Life Events. This table is if you are overwhelmed by the sheer number of Life Event tables in the main rule book or simply after a OGL version you can base your own efforts off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Useful Items of the Kindly Ones. Minor magical items left behind by the gods who used to care about Zarth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things to Find in Great Pots. A short random table for the harried Crypt Keeper for that inevitable moment when the players ask &amp;ldquo;so that pot you mentioned just now, what&amp;rsquo;s in it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tea Party of Doom. A short encounter somewhere in the dark dismal woods with a crazy immortal Alchemist who has been playing with the psychoactive toads and their potential to provide tea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
