			<description>La Bataille de Leipzig 1813 - La Bataille de D&amp;ouml;litz 1813&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battle of Leipzig, fought in 1813, is one of the largest conflicts ever and involved many countries / kingdoms fighting against each other. This included a coalition of Russia, Prussia and Austria committed to defeat France and its allies, forging a domination of Europe that would lead to the Nationalism of Germany. While historians have drawn a myriad of contrary opinions about who were the good guys and bad guys, the battle encircles the city of Leipzig with 500,000 man armies facing each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;La Bataille de D&amp;ouml;litz 1813 occured on October 16h, when forces under G&amp;eacute;n&amp;eacute;ral de Division Kaminieki (Polish) and General Lefol (French) defended the line along  the Pleisse River. The river was murky and swollen from previous weeks of rainfall. Men and horses could cross the river only in a few places. These crossings were at Connewitz and D&amp;ouml;litz. Part of the 26e Polish division defended the intact bridge at D&amp;ouml;litz with its manor house guarding the entrance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the area that Schwarzenberg choose to lead an assault to outflank Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s army. Therefore Schwarzenberg committed substantial Austrian troops to this assault.While outnumbering the French and Polish forces, General der Kavallerie Graf Merveldt&amp;rsquo;s 2nd Army Abteilung found forcing either crossing a major problem. Unable to deploy his artillery because of the swampy ground, his infantry fought a battle of attrition with an enemy in built-up areas or on the other side of a major river.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Merveldt has been assigned one thing however that may assist him in getting across. He has the two army pontoon and two pioneer companies. They can be used to throw a bridge across the Pleisse or repair the bridge at Connewitz. The player will note immediately the differences in the different formations and how each must be managed to achieve success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each 20 minute turn starts with a Command Phase for both sides followed by the French Player sequence and then by the Coalitian Player sequence. The sequence includes movement, cavalry charges, fire and melee. During each, morale plays a decisive role. This is a great one player on one player game but will also accommodate two players on a side also.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original rules have been updated, but not expanded to any extent. The original designers of the La Bataille Series believe the Premier Rules facilitate / expedite the most accurate and competitive play. The new Premier Rules are an update of the original rules but make it easier to find specific topics and includes some user requested rules such as command control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was initially offered as print and play by Marshal Enterprises; it is now removed and available as part of the commercial La Bataille de Leipzig.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scale is standard &amp;quot;La Bat&amp;quot;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     100 meters per hex.&lt;br/&gt;     100 men per infantry strength point/ 50 men per cavalry strength point/ 2 to 4 guns per strength point for artillery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
