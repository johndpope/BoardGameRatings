			<description>designer's website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Another girl gone missing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three in one month, from Threshold alone, with more reports of abductions coming from the outlying farmsteads, and as far away as Verge and Eltan&amp;rsquo;s Spring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Townguard is stretched to its limit, what with the doubling of the patrols, house-to-house searches, and search parties along the Market Way, as well as up and down the Windrush Road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vampires, some say. Goblins, say others. Yet there is no sign of forced entry. No signs of struggle: just an open window and an empty bed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And now the notices, posted on every inn and tavern door, and shouted from every corner of the Market square by the criers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;His Lordship the Baron Sherlane Halaran hereby offers reward to those willing to undertake a mission of utmost urgency. Inquire at Tarnskeep, no later than noontide.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Baron&amp;rsquo;s Favor&amp;rdquo; is a Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons adventure for 2 to 6 player characters of levels 1 - 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first glance, the players may dismiss this as a simple &amp;ldquo;go into the dungeon and rescue the damsel in distress&amp;rdquo; mission -- and that is correct. But there are ten damsels and two dungeons; goblins and kobolds; a wizard and his ogre bodyguards. And a treasure that ended one war millennia ago.... but could well rekindle it in the current age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
