							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chain Of Command: Bloody Bucket</name>
									
			<description>This Pint Sized Campaign for Chain of Command is the first covering the battle of the Bulge.  The action here covers the initial German attack against the US 28th Infantry Division as the 26th Volksgrenadier Division attempt to clear the ground between the Our and Clerf Rivers in preparation for Panzer Lehr&amp;rsquo;s advance on Bastogne.  What followed was three days of epic action which destroyed the German chances of victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six battlefields provide a campaign which sees the Germans attacking and infiltrating to isolate the US defenders, initially with infantry but soon with armoured support while a gallant band of men fight on to the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This classic Pint Sized Campaign is designed to be run using the campaign rules in At the Sharp End and with Chain of Command rules.  Can you break through and open the route to the Meuse and Antwerp, or will you make an heroic stand and halt Hitler&amp;rsquo;s lunatic vision of victory in the West?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thirty-two pages long, this Pint Sized campaign provides the background history to the campaign with situation maps.  Uses period maps to show the location of the actions and then provides a complete campaign with forces for both sides, support options for players to select from and full victory conditions for all six battles and the campaign as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
