							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Osiris Files: Operation Nearscape</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DNA of an astronaut and naval aviator declared MIA in 2006 has been found in a fragment from the Tunguska event of 1908. Is the aviator alive? How could his DNA be involved in the explosion of the Tunguska event, 100 years earlier? Osiris is tasked with learning the answers to these questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black projects, super-science, and conspiracies all play a part in Operation Nearscape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is part of the Osiris Files series and is systemless. It is not a complete adventure, but is a &amp;quot;concept module,&amp;quot; providing ideas and inspiration built around a central conceit to help the GM build an adventure suited to the GM's campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Osiris Files: Operation Nearscape was created as the first of a possible series of similar concept modules. If there is interest, the plot arc conceptualized for the Osiris Files will be released through a series of concept modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Osiris Files series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Osiris Files take place in a world right beside ours. Next door, or perhaps just down the block. People drive cars you would recognize, have jobs you would recognize, and eat food you would recognize. Somewhere, though, there is a shadow world. It might be a world of super spies, super humans, or magic. It might be a world of hidden monsters, ancient threats, or that which man was not meant to know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters inhabit this shadow world. They may pose as accountants, or librarians, or electricians, but they are not. They are not butchers, bakers or candlestick makers. They are something different, something special, and something absolutely dangerous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Osiris Files are not adventures, they are concepts. Each operation provides briefing materials, background and ideas. All the material is systemless, and therefore can be used with any role-playing game system. The core of the adventure and its place in the campaign are left to the GM. There are no maps. There is no conclusion. While the concept provides possible conclusions and ideas as to what is happening, there is no set path to solving a problem. The Osiris Files only provide ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
