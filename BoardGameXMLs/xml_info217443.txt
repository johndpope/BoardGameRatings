							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Journey to the Crystal Keep</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the small duchy of Almethieu dark forces are coming together in an effort to disrupt the pleasant lives of the towns and villages. With the Duke himself falling ill after an attack on the road by a group of lycanthropes, an antidote is needed to keep him from becoming a lycanthrope himself. The only cure in the area to be found is in the magic wellspring of The Crystal Keep. Rumors and mystery surround this keep and most town folk swear that the old wizard who lived there has turned evil along with his Dwarven knights. With time running short, the duke and his advisors offer great reward for the retrieval of a vial of this magical water. Will the party find the cure to save the duke and these lands? Are rumors true about the fate of the wizard and his Dwarves? Only the bravest and most cunning will succeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 6-8 hour adventure for 3-5 1st level characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
