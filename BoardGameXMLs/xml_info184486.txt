							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mars 2143 A.D.</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the twentieth century, humans speculate aliens on Mars called Martians. Never have they thought that one day, they would colonize on the planet itself, find no aliens there, and become the Martians on Mars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the end of the twenty-first century, a number of Mars colonies have developed into neo-metropolises. These neo-metropolises have domes around them to secure an atmosphere for the population. The few colonies left are now specialized in different fields, such as a military base, or cyberoid development and test area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colonists soon grew tiresome of Earth's rule. Why should they pay taxes to governments on Earth if they are now only relying on themselves to survive? The colonies declared independence on 2117 A.D., Earth time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a three year revolution, the United Nations Federation again brought the colonies under control. Unfortunately, the colonies are now bitter, and feel a coldness toward mother Earth. After the United Nations disbanded the rebel groups, the members, now fugitives, reformed and joined high-tech bandits, preying on U.N. and merchant vessels. To this date, conflicts still erupt from several Mars liberal groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
