			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NFL Street 3 is the third title in the Street series. The game takes football to the backyard and offers an over-the-top playing experience, complete with wall jumping backflips and flying tackles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Street 3 is a simplified football game with 7-on-7 play and pared down playbooks, and the core of the game is the Respect the Street career mode. Players create a team from scratch and choose a hometown, then start competing against NFL players and their fictional teams across the country. Winning games earns cash and respect, which will unlock more areas and opponents to face off against.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a number of different game styles that can be played in Career mode, each with unique winning objectives, such as Time Attack, Play Elimination, and Bank. The Gamebreaker mechanic allows players to perform huge combo plays and score big points, but they do not always guarantee points, like in previous titles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A range of other modes are present in Street 3 as well, including exhibition matches, open field showdown, 4-on-4 street play, and online matches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
