			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Borderland Provinces &amp;ldquo;campaign&amp;rdquo; is designed for characters who like to travel across wide regions, and Game Masters who like to run such &amp;ldquo;sandbox&amp;rdquo; campaigns. There are upsides and downsides to running a sandbox campaign rather than one where the characters are presented with a series of clear objectives, all of them roughly designed for the character&amp;rsquo;s current level of experience. A sandbox campaign like the Borderland Provinces requires that the players are able to identify objectives for themselves, or else they may become paralyzed with indecision, looking for the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; place to go. So, on the Game Master&amp;rsquo;s side of the GM screen, it&amp;rsquo;s very important that the characters are presented with lots of choices wherever they go. This &amp;mdash; as any experienced Game Master will immediately note &amp;mdash; makes a lot of work for the Game Master. How do you generate those choices? Do you need to prepare five or six different adventures for each time the characters enter a tavern and start asking questions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a resource for generating journeys, but in doing so it allows you to fill the world with a realistic jumble of objectives, possibilities, opportunities, and motivations for the characters, keeping them from asking, &amp;ldquo;Well, what are we supposed to do?&amp;rdquo; It might take them a bit of practice to switch into the &amp;ldquo;sandbox&amp;rdquo; mentality, but soon they will be asking, &amp;ldquo;Which opportunity do we want to take?&amp;rdquo; And that brings us to the reason for this book, because at that point they&amp;rsquo;re going to need lots of options, and it&amp;rsquo;s your job to produce those options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So we get to the well-known fact about running a sandbox campaign. It&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily more work for the Game Master, but it requires much more improvisation and thinking on your feet than a programmed adventure path does. It&amp;rsquo;s a method used more by experienced Game Masters for this reason, and there are actually some groups of players who feel like it&amp;rsquo;s too unfocused. However, for those who like the feeling of forging their own destinies in a living world, the sandbox style of play in unparalleled. The Lost Lands: Borderland Provinces is designed for that difficult but highly-rewarding type of Game Mastery, and this book is a tool for handling the &amp;ldquo;journeying&amp;rdquo; part of a sandbox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
