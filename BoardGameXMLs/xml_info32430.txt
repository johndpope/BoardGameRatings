							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goblin Invasion: A Djarhun Expansion</name>
									
			<description>Deep within the twisting tunnels of the Underdark, a swirling mass of green skinned goblin folk surge towards the surface world, overrunning the various dwarven strongholds, which have kept them at bay for centuries.  An influential goblin king, wielding unprecedented magic, has managed to unite the various goblin tribes into one mighty force.  The goblins have been led to the surface of Durach, and have poured across the land like a swarm of raging locusts to devour all of civilization.  The proud City of Elidor has beseeched the local Heroes to help halt the advance of these goblins before they manage to gain a foothold in the region.  So begins the Goblin Invasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Goblin Invasion deck is an optional event deck depicting the efforts of the Goblin king to conquer the surface world.  If used, whenever a player is instructed to draw a Durach card, the card may be instead drawn from the Goblin Invasion deck.  Any number of cards can be substituted in this way, until the deck is exhausted.  Once the deck is exhausted, it is assumed the goblin forces have been routed and sent back to the Underdark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion includes...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Hero Cards (10)&lt;br/&gt;- Market Cards (6)&lt;br/&gt;- Treasure Cards (3)&lt;br/&gt;- Quest Cards (97)&lt;br/&gt;- Updated Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Djarhun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
