							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ethermagic for Core Classes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's call it a gateway expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ether is a interuniversal fluid whose sole role is to absorb the awesome energies released by the restless gyrations of the universes it cradles like so much tapioca. Without the ether, the multiverse's components would grind against each other and ultimately be torn to shreds. By random chance, mortal beings can forge a connection with this otherworldly wellspring of power and learn to wield its brutish power; however, as a connection to the ether requires constant effort to strengthen, those who receive their gift and don't follow up with it tend to express an atrophied variant of what could have been.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strange Magic Expanded - Ethermagic for Core Classes is a standalone expansion for Strange Magic 1, and introduces a number of ethermagic-themed character options for the bard, fighter, and wizard base classes. All necessary ethermagic manifestations are reprinted herein, so no additional purchase is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Product Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Cosmic minstrel bard archetype&lt;br/&gt;    Etherblade fighter archetype&lt;br/&gt;    Three wizard arcane schools - ether, gravity, and madness&lt;br/&gt;    Partial reprint of the voidmeld and alteration etherheart manifestations list&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
