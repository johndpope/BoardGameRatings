			<description>From inlay&lt;br/&gt;It's all starting to make sensee... Your best friend's gone to Volccano Island... The Dark Overlord! That's it! The Dark Overlord has kidnapped Beverly and Phil and brought them to this volcano island. 'Cause he's hooked on thermal energy he needs to tap into it constantly to maintain his power.&lt;br/&gt;You know that he knows you're the only one who can foil his plans to take over the Earth. But he thinks he can turn you into duck soup - to make the world his oyster. What he doesn't know is that you're a Quack Fu Master, an avid ultralight flyer, and a whiz with a Neutron Disintegrator.&lt;br/&gt;So take him up on his challenge. And show the Dark Overloard that his treacherous plan isn't all it's quacked up to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
