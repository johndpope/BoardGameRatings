							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Pirate</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The smell of the sea and the wind in your face, the freedom to go where you want and take what you can: that&amp;rsquo;s what being a pirate is all about. Unfortunately, the stories of legendary pirates and buried treasure fail to mention all of the old, dry food, watered-down ale, harsh environments, and ferocious monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yeah, it is not the life for everyone, but some are drawn to the tales and thrill and others never really had a choice. The law won&amp;rsquo;t care one way or another, so grab a cutlass and load your flintlock. Will you carve our your own name in the annals of history, or will you be just another rotting corpse dangling from the gallows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set sail to find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is two separate pdf files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first is a digest-sized, 19 page book laid out like the Dungeon World rulebook. It contains...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The pirate! (Obviously.) Turn the environment against your enemies, venture to islands in search of treasure, then celebrate by blowing it all at the nearest port.&lt;br/&gt;     New equipment like the flintlock pistol, blunderbuss, grenades, flask of grog, and sharkskin armor.&lt;br/&gt;     Eight new magic items: immolate your enemies with the dragonfire blunderbuss, or fold up your ship and carry it around with you!&lt;br/&gt;     Two compendium classes: the dread pirate and sea-shackled. Use your fearsome reputation to dominate the high seas, or swear allegiance to Davy Jones at the cost of your humanity.&lt;br/&gt;     A kind of behind the scenes look at some of the fiction and other content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other is a 2-page, letter-sized character sheet for you to print out and actually use. As with our other playbooks, custom graphics abound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
