			<description>From the Chaosium web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Call of Cthulhu Scenario in the Ozark Mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time stands still in the Ozark Mountains in 1927. Located in southern Missouri, the people who live here feel little need to rush. In-tune with nature, and appreciative of her frightening beauty more than many city dwellers, isolation and dark rites are common. Few towns have discovered civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MISKATONIC UNIVERSITY LIBRARY ASSOCIATION monographs are longer works by one or more authors on a subject of import to Call of Cthulhu roleplayers. On these products the author has also fulfilled the functions of editor and layout artist; we at Chaosium have done little in the way of editorial. We found these works compelling and thought that you would enjoy them. Monographs are digitally reproduced small run publications featuring durable laminated C1S covers and perfect bindings. We do provide a cover illustration. Through the publication of monographs we can offer our most loyal fans more information more easily, and evaluate the potential of these works for eventual release to the wholesale market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
