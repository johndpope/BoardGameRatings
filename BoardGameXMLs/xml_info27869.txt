			<description>A German game.&lt;br/&gt;Players are soccer managers who move their playing pieces around the board after rolling the die.&lt;br/&gt;Goal is to make as much money as possible.&lt;br/&gt;Playing time is agreed upon. Suggested time is in between 90 to 180 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each one starts with 2500000 DM in paper money. This can be used to invest in players (national or international) and stadiums. These can only be bought/sold when landing on the appropriate space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landing on a ball or stadium space means your team is playing a game. If on a ball space or a stadium owned by nobody, the bank pays out the team, looking at the amount and type (national/international) of sportsmen purchased.&lt;br/&gt;If someone does own the stadium 300.000 DM spectator entrance fees are paid by the bank. This is used to pay the visiting team and rent to the owner of the stadium. Some stadiums have a team color and are rented by the managers at the beginning of the game. Until purchased players pay rent to the bank when games are played there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fee must be paid every time the starting space is passed&lt;br/&gt;(monthly expenses). Other spaces (&amp;quot;Draw card&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Pay bonuses&amp;quot;,...) can also cause loss/gain of money. &lt;br/&gt;When landing on a shortcut space you must use it. They get  you faster to the starting space, where dues must be paid, but can generate more money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
