							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NOTB: Mission Little Rock</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The president&amp;rsquo;s mistress has been kidnapped and taken to Little Rock, AR. Your squad of marines has been tasked with finding and rescuing her. The obstacles that face you are numerous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little Rock, AR, is now an alien reserve and no longer under US government control. Little Rock is open to aliens from the far corners of the universe, gangs of humans who find the strangeness of alien rule better than being under government rule, wierd creatures, unusual weather, and the people who kidnapped the mistress are some of the obstacles. Oh, and let&amp;rsquo;s not forget whoever ordered the kidnapping to begin with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mission Little Rock is the first in the Number of the Beast line of adventures from Final Sword Productions. The adventures in this line are fun, one to two night adventure. Some are irreverent, some are serious, and all are hopefully fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
