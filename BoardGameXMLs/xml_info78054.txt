							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Squad Battles: Dien Bien Phu</name>
									
			<description>From the official website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dien Bien Phu conjures up many images for the average wargamer - a bloody, muddy siege, the failure of a colonial empire to hold onto it's possessions in the aftermath of World War II, the Legion Etrangere holding positions to the end, paratroopers dropping into a doomed situation, the list goes on. However, the French Indochina War was much more than that. In the Legion tradition, small outposts and their defense were a fixture throughout the war. There were riverine assaults, a tactic that would bloom in the American War 10+ years later. Aggressive paradrops were a regular feature before the development of the heliborne assault. There were convoys and endless patrols. In this latest edition to the Squad Battles series you will get to experience all of these situations and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
