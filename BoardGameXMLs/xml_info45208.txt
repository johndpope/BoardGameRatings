							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great City</name>
									
			<description>The Blueprints product line offers you old-fashioned blue printed maps for using in your adventures and campaigns. For each map you get a blueprint version and a standard black and white version. The maps are all vector-based so you will get maximum print resolution. Despite their old fashioned appearance each map offers you a degree of customization by using the pdf technology at its best. A small control bar (which will not be printed) on each map allows you to turn on and off the grid, eliminate the room numbers, get the walls filled and don&amp;rsquo;t show doors and furniture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each product features a classic fantasy adventure location: a dungeon, a keep, a temple complex, a thieves&amp;rsquo; guild and so on. You can use these map as reference to build your own adventures or simply take them at hand in case your players go in an unexpected direction during the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Great City is a chain of linked blueprints (seven products, to be exact) that explore a whole fantasy city. Each product, except this one, will feature one city district with the floorplans of its major buildings&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The products can be each easily used as stand-alone products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great City provides you a great map, both contained in one sheet for easy reference and split in six sheets (districts). Each district, or &amp;ldquo;ward&amp;rdquo;, features a main road on its edges. This allows you to easily identify the borders of a ward and easily join the maps to form a 25,5 x 22 inches map. In the future some &amp;ldquo;alternative&amp;rdquo; wards may become available, allowing you to replace one ward you don&amp;rsquo;t want on your city (for example, the city may cease to be a coastal one by simply removing the dock ward and replacing it with another ward).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great City is the crossroads of cultures and people. A highly tolerant city, ruled by a fistful of wise men and women. The city lives of commerce and business; a popular saying tells: &amp;ldquo;You can find everything in the Great City and if you can&amp;rsquo;t find it, well, you&amp;rsquo;ll do soon&amp;rdquo;. The city rises on the coast of the ocean and is overlooked by and ancient castle towering from a small, green hill. The castle, its origin unknown, is now the residence of the Lord of the City. Some great and well-defended gates allow the entrance in the Great City from various points, and a mighty wall encircles the whole city. The city is divided in six different wards: Dock Ward, Trades Ward, Residence Ward, Temple Ward (which also includes the City of the Dead, the cemetery), Castle Ward and Army Ward. Also it is said that a huge dungeon complex lies below the Great City. Someone knows it as The Dungeon Under the Mountain.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
