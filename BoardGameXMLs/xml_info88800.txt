			<description>Contains two games in one box. From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Giftrace: You are Santa Claus and you need to follow the path from the beginning to the end. On your way you leave one gift (a ring in your colour) on each house when you land on a house square or pass it. Score points are given accourding to who is first, second, third and forth to arrive to the end zone. The first person gets 4 points, second gets 3 pts, the third gets 2 pts and the last one gets one point. But, for each gift that you still have remaining (rings on your pawn) you get one minus point for each ring! The person with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sledrace: Each player chooses a pawn and puts it on the sled in the same colour. The rings are not used in this game. The person that looks most like a racing driver starts! You throw the die and move accordingly. When you land on a square with a picture, you immediately follow the instructions on that square, then your turn ends. Please note that if you pass an X you stop right away because you just hit a tree and the rest of your moves in that turn are cancelled! The player on your left goes next. The first person to reach the finish line wins and gets the trophy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
