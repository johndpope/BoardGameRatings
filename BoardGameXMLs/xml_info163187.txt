			<description>Spielbox Add-on 4/2014&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;suitcase with hot goods&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;This special card in celebration of the 20th anniversary is a throwback to the very first prototype in which there were cards with regular and &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; goods. The ownership of &amp;quot;hot goods&amp;quot; had to be avoided, and if you had any, you had to get rid of them quickly. More than 20 years ago, with suitcases full of such &amp;quot;hot goods&amp;quot;, Wolfgang Kramer went on a trip to the publishers and presented his game. In April 1993, that journey ended at AMIGO...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preparation&lt;br/&gt;Before dealing, shuffle the card into the top 20 cards of the deck.&lt;br/&gt;If you draw it, place it face up in front of you and redraw from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;The next time you're forced to take a row, pass the card to the player on your left, who now places it face up in front of himself. Continue doing this until the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, the card scores 10 negative points for the player who has it.&lt;br/&gt;Exception: If that player managed to end the game without having to take a card/row, he/she was a successful smuggler and is rewarded with 10 positive points instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
