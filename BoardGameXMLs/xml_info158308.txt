							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle for Fallujah: New Dawn</name>
									
			<description>From the Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Battle for Fallujah: New Dawn is a simple, single player game simulating the second battle for Fallujah, Iraq. The game begins on day D+1, November 8, 2004. While fighting in Fallujah continued until the end of December, this game portrays the first seven days of battle in which Coalition forces took the most territory and faced the fiercest resistance. This simulation is intended to represent a modern, urban counterinsurgency operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a player, your goal is to clear Fallujah of insurgents while searching the city, block-by-block. Time is of the essence. Meanwhile, you must maintain the political will and support of both the American and Iraqi governments. You will be combating insurgents whose goal is to inflict as many casualties as possible and force American 'infidels' from their city, and eventually, country. The conflict is contained within the city of Fallujah.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
