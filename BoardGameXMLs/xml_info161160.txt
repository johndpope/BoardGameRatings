			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover a mystery of Abbeville church ruins - a remote Nazis outpost located in north France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you would like to know:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Why Nazis took over church ruins?&lt;br/&gt;     What have they built there?&lt;br/&gt;     Is there a connection between glyphs found in Africa, recently discovered parchment of unknown origin and stone plaque located in Abbeville church?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mystery of Abbeville church ruins  provides an excellent starting point for GM to make an interesting game set in WWII (or weird war). It consists of GM&amp;rsquo;s notebook as well as stylized handouts which can be printed and presented to players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note that the supplement is stat free and can be used in any WWII game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The supplement consists of two sections:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Documentation (GM section):&lt;br/&gt;         Church map,&lt;br/&gt;         Location map;&lt;br/&gt;         Device sketch&lt;br/&gt;         and more&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Intel files ( Players handouts):&lt;br/&gt;         Briefing files;&lt;br/&gt;         Intel maps, pictures and sketches.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note that Intel files are sometimes slightly different than material for GM. This is not a mistake - simply secret service couldn't get accurate data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
