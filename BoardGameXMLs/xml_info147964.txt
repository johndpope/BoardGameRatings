							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Smuggler&#039;s Sloop and The Wave Cutter</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a full color floorplan 48 x 20 inch, of Smuggler&amp;rsquo;s Sloop and The Wave Cutter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It comes with Square, Hex and No Ovelays and includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Card version contains twelve, double-sided card tiles. Each over-sized tile is 8&amp;rdquo;x10&amp;rdquo; and printed on sturdy 12 point card stock. The UV coating on the tiles keeps them spill resistant, lets you peel transparent tape on and off them without damaging the tile, and allows you to mark the tiles with dry wipe markers then wipe them clean. As you can see in the images below, the card version has the hex grid overlay on one side and one ship on each side side. We recommend getting the Zip File combo as well (or at least download the PDF Preview) so you can see how the tiles all lay out. The full layout map is not included with the printed card pages to reduce their cost to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: as the one ship is on the back of the other, if you want to use both at the same time in the Printed Card version, you will need to buy two copies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Watch the coast! This sloop has to come out of the continent and return to sea sometime!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes the top deck only of two ships, a smuggler&amp;rsquo;s sloop and a nineteenth century screw-propelled steam ship with three sailing masts called The Wave Cutter. The area around the ship has been left blank for the PDF file to save on ink for printing at home. For the Print on Demand (POD) file, this surrounding area is replaced with water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sloop is intended for use in pirate themed or colonial games. The sloop can be used in any fantasy game that includes cannons as well (it has six cannons on the top deck). The screw-propelled steam ship can be used in a steampunk or Victorian era setting, as its main period of use was the nineteenth century to the early twentieth century. It can be used in a late period pirate game as well, perhaps as a prototype of the new vessel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sloop makes an excellent starting vessel for adventurers in a game focusing on high seas adventure and island exploration. The sloop can travel up rivers and channels to travel inland from the coast. The vessel also includes two dinghies that can be used to travel further inland via small canals and streams or carried overland till needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sloop can be used for a smuggling adventure. The group can be smugglers or they can be privateers trying to stop them. The smugglers are using their mobility to try and evade the privateers. They go inland to escape them and try to chart a path through the island to escape. It is up to the Game Master if there is a route through the island. The privateers may eventually land on the island looking for the smugglers, but prefer to wait by the last river the sloop entered. If the sloop must turn around, they must somehow outrun the privateers or defeat them to get away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The screw-propelled steamer could be a prize as a prototype near the end of the age of piracy. The group can be guards for the vessel on its maiden voyage or pirates out to collect a rare prize. Either way, The Wave Cutter is on a journey to prove it can out perform the older paddle-wheel steam ships. Complications arise when the ship&amp;rsquo;s propeller has a mechanical problem with a calm wind. Here is where the pirate&amp;rsquo;s strike. The player characters need to fix the propeller malfunction and get the ship moving in time or end up fighting the pirates off (or both at the same time!). After the malfunction and fighting off the pirates, The Wave Cutter returns to port. Another adventure idea is that The Wave Cutter is attempting to be the first screw-propelled steamer to cross the Atlantic Ocean and make the transatlantic journey from North America to Europe (or vice versa). They must fight off pirates, propeller malfunctions, and other adversities to make the trip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
