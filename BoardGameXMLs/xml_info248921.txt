			<description>FAST-playing, Quick-thinking, PUG-yelling FUN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frog Pig Pug is a quick, simple to learn, yet challenging puzzle game. Frog Pig Pug is suitable for players as young as six. Borrowing mechanics from the classic card game Set, the game has been updated with fun animal art, new game play, and new rules - it takes 10-15 minutes to play and each game is totally different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Frog Pig Pug is to identify a Proper Unit Group or 'PUG'. Each PUG consists of three cards that are all the same OR all different in their individual traits. There are three traits on every card of Frog Pig Pug: type of animal, color of animal, and number of animals. Six cards are dealt on the table face-up from the deck into the community pool, and each player is dealt one card that only they can utilize. Once a PUG is identified, a player yells &amp;quot;PUG&amp;quot; and gathers the cards in the PUG once confirmed by the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any used community pool cards or cards from the player's hand are replaced and play continues until all the cards from the deck are spent.  The player with the most PUGs wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
