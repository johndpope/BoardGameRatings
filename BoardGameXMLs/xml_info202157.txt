			<description>The Dealer has clawed his way back beyond the thirteen gates to seek his revenge! The table has changed, yet the stakes remain the same: life or death!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in the original Hand of Fate, adventurers explore a dark fantasy world built from collectible cards distributed by a magical dealer in a meta boardgame. Each overturned card reveals a new trial: third-person combat, high-risk high-reward minigames or Tabletop RPG-style decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again, draw your cards, play your hand, and discover your fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KEY FEATURES&lt;br/&gt;A brand new map based meta-game, brimming with exciting new challenges&lt;br/&gt;Adopt new combat styles like dual-wielding, and heft two-handed heavy arms.&lt;br/&gt;Engage new foes united by all-new card suits. Cross swords with the well-trained Imperial forces of the Steel Suit, or strike down the corrupted mutants of Blight.&lt;br/&gt;Team up with companion characters who provide combat support, mini-game perks and who can influence the player's story in unpredictable ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
