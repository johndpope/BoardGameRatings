			<description>This is an abstract, three-player game with chess-like piece movement by Jean du Poel and Historien Spielgalerie. The board is a hex with spaces shown in circles, and each player has 10 pieces: four pawns, two knights, two paladins, one marshal, and one duke. The goal of a player is to get his duke to the center board space at a time when he cannot be attacked by an opposing figure on their next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme is that three dukes are vying to be named the monarch of Germany in the 13th century. The game is designed for three players, making it less common, however it can be played with two as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
