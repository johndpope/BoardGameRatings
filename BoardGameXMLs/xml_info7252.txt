			<description>In the fifteenth century, MAXIMILIAN I to oppose the famous Swiss militia, an army unit with the same characteristics of quality and strength, created the LANDSKNECHT. An elite unit of immense destructive power, which soon had a reputation of invincibility equal to the Swiss experts. Armed with Pikes, Hallebardes, Swords and the most modern throwing weapons, these multicolored hordes fanned out across Europe as a cloud of voracious predators, with no moral or military power having control over them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, the confrontations between rival militias are shown on an absolutely realistic tactical scale (each counter represents a footman or a horseman), also allowing, for players wanting to leave pre-arranged historical orders of battle, to create their own &amp;quot; Company &amp;quot; without the gameplay suffering negative effects.&lt;br/&gt;A rule with several difficulty levels allows to test different types of clashes, from simple skirmishes between dispersed troops up to the great battle featuring three hundred pieces on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game for 2 players from 13 years old onwards. Game duration: from 1 to 8 hours. Difficulty: &amp;bull;&amp;bull; - &amp;bull;&amp;bull;&amp;bull;&amp;bull;&amp;bull;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 introductory scenario, 1 battle scenario (Grandson)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    a map board divided in 5 parts (97.5 x 68.5 cm total)&lt;br/&gt;    4 countersheets in different colours with identical cards/units/markers (each contains 160 counters and 5 cards)&lt;br/&gt;    a 20 page rulebook in Italian, French and German&lt;br/&gt;    3 identical chart/table sheets; each  in Italian, French or German&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(source: translated from the front box and user's description)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
