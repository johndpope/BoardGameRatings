							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Woodsman&#039;s Cabin</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wow! You might not  have heard of such a thing, but now there&amp;rsquo;s a map of the future. It&amp;rsquo;s right here, issue #63, at the Woodsman&amp;rsquo;s Inn. Maps of the past - histories - they&amp;rsquo;re all very well, but now prescient, unaligned folks are tracing the history of the future. It makes sense. Stuff happens one place and astral reverberations shake up everything happening next and ongoing, ad infinitum. If the Godslayer got born here, you think you can even spend one night and not get shook up? Pick up the dice. They&amp;rsquo;ll be heavy. It&amp;rsquo;ll take courage, maybe even a rabbit warrior to mend this world where cause and effect don&amp;rsquo;t even work anymore. Leave if you like. But do you dare?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
