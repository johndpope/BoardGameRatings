							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Against the Grain (A Matter of Honor, Part 2)</name>
									
			<description>website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;After the summer solstice, Jakallans hunker down for the annual food riots. But this year, the clan has a special reason to protect its warehouse. It could be a long and bumpy week&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure set in the world of the Empire of the Petal Throne, using the Gard&amp;aacute;siyal rules. Sequel to A Matter of Honour; it is recommended, but not required, to have played that adventure. All materials provided. Beginners welcome, but this game features adult themes. This is not a monster-bash: strong roleplaying required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Author's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed as a follow-up to A Matter of Honour using the same characters. I don&amp;rsquo;t think this scenario would work as well without the conflicting goals of the group. If other characters are to be used, this scenario may lose a lot of tension without some Sarku worshippers and Dlamelish worshippers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
