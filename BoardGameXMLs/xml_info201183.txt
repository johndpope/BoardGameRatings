							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vampire: The Eternal Struggle â€“ The Sabbat</name>
									
			<description>Sabbat was the largest and last of the expansion sets for the Vampire: The Eternal Struggle trading card game to be released by Wizards of the Coast. It introduced many new rules and Kindred to fully add the Sabbat to the game; previous expansions and the original edition focused on vampires of the Camarilla or Independent clans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as many new Lasombra and Tzimisce vampires, the Sabbat expansion also added antitribu vampires of all Camarilla clans and rules for Sabbat titles, Disciplines, rituals and tactics. Each pack of expansion cards included an update explaining these new rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, a number of non-crypt cards from the original Jyhad/V:TES set were reprinted in this set; many of these were given new art, and in most cases this new art was retained for future sets' reprints of those cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sabbat was the final V:TES set released by Wizards of the Coast. Four years later, White Wolf resumed publication of the game with the Sabbat War set. That set reprinted most (but not all) cards from the Sabbat set, as well as a number of other cards from the original core Jyhad/V:TES set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
