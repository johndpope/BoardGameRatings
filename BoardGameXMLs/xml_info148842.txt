			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster Brief provides a small selection of new, revised, or expanded creatures to be pitted against your players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this product you will find four creatures that are born from or dwell in the darkness. These new monster entries will provide Gamemasters with new foes to spring out of the black upon their heroes when they least expect it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Murderous killing machines, dark stone demons are born from the rocks of Hell where sinners trapped in the ground itself are merged together into new life by the crucible of demonic flame. Eaters in the deep are floating spheres sprouting numerous tentacle-like stalks, each of which ends in a muttering mouth that hungers for flesh. Hook flyers are tiny, stealthy predators that hide in the dark, waiting to swoop upon unsuspecting prey in order to drain their blood. Scourge wraiths are the tormented souls of those who once made their livelihood torturing others and must now stalk the dark, only finding peace in the pain and fear of others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
