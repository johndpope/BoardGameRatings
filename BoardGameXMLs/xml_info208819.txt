							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alla ricerca di Dory: Occhio al tentacolo</name>
									
			<description>A board game based on the Disney/Pixar film Finding Dory.&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a Dory figure and tries to meet his four friends, avoiding the tentacles of the octopus Hank, and go home with them.&lt;br/&gt;The current player spins the spinner and decides to move based on the number or color of the arrow: if the destination square is occupied by another player, the current player moves further.&lt;br/&gt;After the movement, the player flips the coin of the target square and, according to it, he can: meet one of his friends, turn the spinner again, move to a square he likes or rotate Hank tentacles 90 degrees. It is useful to remember what is depicted in the chips, so you better choose whether to move by color or number.&lt;br/&gt;If the spinner lands on octopus Hank, the player rotates 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise: if its tentacles hits one or more figures, they come back to the starting square.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first to meet all 4 Dory friends and returns to the starting square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
