			<description>TALLY HO&lt;br/&gt;(For 2, 3 or 4 Players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;OBJECT: To move a hound into the space occupied by the Fox, thereby capturing him.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fox is placed in center square. Once each turn its movement is dictated by the turning of a card with N/S and/or W/E and the number of squares to be moved.  Player (hound)movement is controlled by a spinner allowing one of: N/S/W/E or diagonal movement, diagonal direction chosen by the player. The 15 square by 15 square board has 20 red squares that allow a player, that ends his/her spinner-controlled movement on one, to move 2 squares in either N/S/W or E, chosen by the player. Fox landing on a hound, hound landing on hound, or hound being directed off the edge of the board results in the hound being returned to the center square and, in the first and third situation just described, lose a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
