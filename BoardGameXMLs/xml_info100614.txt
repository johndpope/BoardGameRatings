			<description>Tobal No. 1​ (トバル ナンバーワン Tobaru Nanbā Wan?) is a fighting game for the PlayStation developed by DreamFactory and published by Square in 1996. The game was DreamFactory's first release, as well as Square's first release on the CD-based console.&lt;br/&gt;Tobal No. 1 marks Square's incursion into the fighting game genre, although an adventure-like quest mode is part of the game. The game's mechanics were designed with the aid of fighter game designer Seiichi Ishii, while all the characters were designed by Akira Toriyama of Dragon Ball fame. The sequel, Tobal 2, was never released in North America and Europe.&lt;br/&gt;Packaged with both the North American and Japanese version of the game was a sampler disc featuring a pre-release demo of Final Fantasy VII and video previews of Final Fantasy Tactics, Bushido Blade, and SaGa Frontier.&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobal_No._1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobal_No._1&lt;/a&gt;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
