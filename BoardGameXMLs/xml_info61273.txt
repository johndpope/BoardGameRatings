			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dainty. Palatable. Non-Constipating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only Game Preparation which is uninjurious to the digestion because of the slow measured absorption of rules and use of a singular icosahedron for resolution. The only Game Preparation of agreeable taste to all palates, and an excellent substitute for Cod-Liver oil. Prescribed by eminent practitioners to lymphatic and scrofulous children; to adolescents for troubles associated with growth, amenorrhoea, etc.; to adults for asthma, syphilis, and female hysteria; and to all ages for chronic bouts of ennui.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heed some of the many verifiable testimonials of those who have employed Passages to a great boon upon their well-being:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-After utilizing Passages for just a few days, eyes become bright, the cheeks glow with colour and life, movements are brisk, and there is a complete absence of weariness and depression, all without risk of splitting one's personality. - Robert Louis Stevenson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Just one phial is akin to a new accelerator that stimulates all round, that wakes you up for a time from the crown of your head to the tip of your great toe, and makes you go two--or even three--to everybody else's one. - Professor Gibberne&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Curative of all things uffish. There are games offered as substitutes which appear as mirror images of Passages but which are dangerous as a bandersnatch-be sure to ask for Passages by name. - Charles Lutwidge Dodgson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-C'est magnifique! - Jules Gabriel Verne&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
