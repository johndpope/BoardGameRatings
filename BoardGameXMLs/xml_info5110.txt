							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">CrossWord: The New York Times Sunday Puzzle Game</name>
									
			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analyze the Sunday crossword clues, try to decide which ones their opponents don't know, then challenge them to fill in those answers.  Go on the offensive with clue selections for your opponent to solve, then be part of the action as the grid fills up, points accumulate, and defensive play takes over.  It's non-stop excitement until the last few open squares, when anyone can come from behind to win CrossWord!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
