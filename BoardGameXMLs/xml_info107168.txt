			<description>CyberStrike is a futuristic 3D combat online game involving team combat between customizable mechs, each of which is controlled by a different player.  Initially exclusive to the GEnie online service, it opened in February 1993, and in 1994 it was offered in stores by Microprose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;CyberStrike&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From back of box (1994 NA DOS):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's kill or be killed. Move or die. Match wits against real players in CyberCity. Collect Power up modules to boost performance on your own personal Cyberpod. The longer you stay alive, the more powerful you become.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four teams of four players each compete for control of precious city squares. Work together or play head-to-head as you strive to blast your enemies out of their pods. Talk to your teammates or taunt your opponents. Strategy, skill and lightning reflexes are the only things that will keep you alive in this deadly world. Cyberstrike -- it's multiplayer virtual reality at its best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
