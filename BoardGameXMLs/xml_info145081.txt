							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mission #0723</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fan-created mission for Orpheus.&lt;br/&gt; From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LOCATION: Spiro's Butcher Shop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EMPLOYER: Lucia Spiro&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TARGET NAME: Antonio Spiro&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spiro's Butcher Shop used to be owned and operated by Antonio and Lucia Spiro. After Antonio Spiro died under *unusual circumstances*, the butcher shop was closed, and Ms. Spiro lived off of her savings and her late husband's modest life insurance policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the last two weeks now, Ms. Spiro has been contacted several times by a Post Life Entity (P.L.E.) claiming to be her late husband. The contact with the P.L.E. have been increasingly violent (see INTEL section), and brings the thought of Ms. Spiro's involvement in her husband's death into the investigation. If it does turn out that she was behind the death, it is up to the crucible handling the investigation to decide whether or not to bring her to the proper authorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
