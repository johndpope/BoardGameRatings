			<description>The game consists of three tracks, laid out by tiles: An inner one that both players use and two outer ones, used by only one player each. At the outset of the game, each player places three pieces on each tile in the two lanes s/he can use. &lt;br/&gt;Afterwards, the players take turns picking up all the pieces from one tile, then moving the pieces onward in the designated direction (the tracks are one-way and form a &amp;quot;round&amp;quot; track for each player, with the middle track being part of both players' tracks). At each tile they pass, they have to drop one piece. In the middle, they can choose which color to drop (if they have both colors in their hand), but when they reach the end of the middle track, the pieces are split up and continue their path in the different outer tracks. &lt;br/&gt;If a tile on the outer tracks ever contains more than six pieces, that tile is removed together with all the pieces on it.&lt;br/&gt;During the game, there are scorings at partially random moments. Each player counts the number of pieces on his or her outer track and gets points accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has less than three tiles in his or her outer track. Then a final scoring is done, with the other player scoring double. The player with most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
