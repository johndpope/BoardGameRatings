			<description>Dennis The Menace (known simply as &amp;quot;Dennis&amp;quot; in the UK) is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System game based on the 1993 movie. A game was also released for the Game Boy. The object is to defeat a burglar who managed to find Dennis' town via the local railroad connection. Stages include Mr. Wilson's house, the great outdoors, a boiler room, and eventually the big boss battle with the burglar himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the actual playing takes place, Dennis has just discovered that he left Mr. Wilson's door unlocked, and a thief has stolen Mr. Wilson's entire coin collection. Dennis must retrieve all of the coins before Mr. Wilson finds out. The object of the game is to collect 6 large coins scattered throughout each level. The same coin-collection game is present throughout the entirety of the game (with the exception of two stages in the first park stage set, wherein Dennis must traverse the park on a wagon led by his dog). After each sixth level, there is a boss stage, followed by a new set of levels. The sets of levels are, in order, Mr. Wilson's House, Park, Boiler Room, Sewers, and finally, Woods. The end of the woods levels, and the subsequent beating of the final boss, marks the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Health is represented by hearts, located at the top-right of the screen. If touched by an enemy, one heart will disappear. Each touch by an enemy removes one heart (as well as temporarily stunning Dennis). Once all of the hearts are gone, the player must restart the level (but retains all main-coins found). Restoring health is a matter of finding the pieces of candy located throughout the levels. Each piece of candy restores 100% of Dennis' health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time is an important factor in Dennis The Menace. There is a clock, located in the top-middle of the screen, that starts at 999 seconds (16.7 minutes) and counts backwards down to 0 seconds. Once the clock is at 0 seconds, there is a game-over, which completely eradicates all work done on a level. The amount of time taken during a level, even after Dennis loses a life, remains the same (if the time is at 456 seconds, and Dennis loses a life, he will restart the level with 456 seconds).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dennis the Menace (video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
