							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 (And More) British-Inspired Street Names</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a GM is designing an urban area, or the players are exploring one, it may be necessary to come up with a name for a previously unnamed street. That is what 100 (And More) British-Inspired Street Names is designed to do. The supplement has two tables; a main table of 100 street names and a supplementary table of 20 street types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement provides 100 base street names that can be randomly generated using the main table, or manually selected, but more can be generated from the notes on many of the names and using the supplementary table. The notes provide details on suitable locations, if they aren't being used randomly, possible alternatives and explanations as to what some of them mean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the 100 base names, alternates and supplementary table are all used, there are thousands of potential street names available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The names have a British flavour, and are based on British street names. The streets should be suitable for settings from medieval to modern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
