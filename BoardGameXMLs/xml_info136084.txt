			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not every weapon has some epic tale of war, love, and loss attached to it. Some weapons&amp;rsquo; stories are folk myths or fairy tales, never written down, and of unknown antiquity. Most of these weapons are as imaginary as the stories themselves. Some, however, indeed exist, and those who might have laughed at the tales of minstrels and old women may have an unpleasant surprise awaiting them. Death&amp;rsquo;s Folly is such a weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Treasures of NeoExodus: Death&amp;rsquo;s Folly is created for use with your NeoExodus: A House Divided campaign setting home gaming for the Pathfinder RPG. The Treasures of NeoExodus series focus on creating unique and interesting magical and mundane items that you can use in your NeoExodus home games that give you more a personal connection to the item. This PDF comes with a background and history of Death&amp;rsquo;s Folly, its special mundane and/or magical qualities plus magic item containing detailed information and blank versions of the cards. Everything you need to incorporate Death&amp;rsquo;s Folly into your character&amp;rsquo;s background and your gaming sessions is here making them even more appealing, special and personal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
