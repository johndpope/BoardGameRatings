							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Koya Rift</name>
									
			<description>Koya Rift is an action-packed platform shooter that is built around circular, adaptive gameplay that emphasizes replay value by challenging the player with procedural content tuned to their skill level. In Koya Rift, the player must enter a hostile planet and destroy an alien race so the planet can be colonized. Each game, the player is dropped off at the surface and must venture into procedurally generated caves, earning upgrades and buying units as he goes along. The difficulty adjusts precisely to the skill of the player over time, providing them with a consistent challenge. The goal of the game is to provide a challenging, yet casual experience that&amp;rsquo;s easy to pick up and put down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Addition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was developed by Zach Kehns (SunnyKatt)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
