			<description>FRIENDO&amp;trade; is a game that challenges your ability to guess how others will react in a given situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For every sitting of a game, one story, along with 5 related questions, is used. This item is known as a &amp;quot;Case 'N Questions&amp;trade;&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Total Score = Points x Friendo Chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of FRIENDO&amp;trade; is to maximize Total Score.  To do that, you must be able to 1)correctly guess how others answer their questions AND 2)partner-up with somebody and correctly guess each other's answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you stay single, (i.e. without a partner), you get no Friendo Chip, and thus, will always have a Total Score of zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is over when either 1)all the answers (20 if there are 4 players) have been guessed or recalled or 2)when, as a result of players going bankrupt of Points, only 3 players are left on the board.  There must be at least 4 players for a game to continue.  Then, whoever has the most Total Score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free online multi player game available at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.friendo.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.friendo.com&lt;/a&gt;.
