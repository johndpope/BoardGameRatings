							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">King of Clubs</name>
									
			<description>The air in the city is electric as the hottest nightclubs host evenings of intense dance competitions. You're the manager of the best new dancers on the scene, ready to show off your team's sweet-sweet moves. Winning at a nightclub will earn your team prestige for the night, and most prestige wins a point. Win five nights of dancing to be crowned the King of Clubs &amp;mdash; but to earn your points, you have to dance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;King of Clubs is a fast-paced card game of sweet-sweet dance moves for 2 or 4 players. In the basic two-player game, each player has a team of dancers valued 1-5. In each round, four of the nine nightclubs (valued 2-7) are revealed, with nightclubs of the same value being paired for a couple's dance. Each player assigns one dancer to each nightclub (two dancers for a couple's dance), then players reveal the values of the dancers with the highest-valued dancer(s) winning the prestige value of the nightclub; the back-up dancer held in hand breaks ties. Whoever wins the most prestige in the round earns a point, and the first player to win five points wins the game. In the four-player team version, each teammate sends a dancer to each nightclub (without consulting one another about who's being sent where), and the highest low-valued dancer in each nightclub wins the prestige; if the lower-valued dancers are tied, then the higher-valued dancers are compared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the advanced game, each player also has a hand of five &amp;quot;move&amp;quot; cards. After revealing dancers in a nightclub, whoever has the lower-valued dancer can play one or more moves on the dancer, as long as he can chain the icons shown on the bottom of the dancer card and the bottom of the move cards. After determining who wins a nightclub, the player draws move cards equal to the &amp;quot;move&amp;quot; number shown on the back-up dancer still in hand, discarding down to five move cards, if needed. In the team version, the symbol on the first move card must be present on both of the team's dancers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
