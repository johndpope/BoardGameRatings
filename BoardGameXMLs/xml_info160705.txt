			<description>Vampires! is an offbeat action puzzle game, filled with vampires, traps, crazy Transylvanian music and fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In short, it&amp;rsquo;s a comedy puzzler where non-glittering drunken bobbleheaded ignorants meet reversed tower defense. Vampires! are a genre mix where strategy, puzzle and action meet fun and frustration. The goal of the game is to guide those bobbleheads through labyrinth and into their crypts while avoiding obstacles, traps and vampire hunters on the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s almost dawn and vampires are returning into their coffins for a well-deserved sleep after a long night. Time is ticking until the dawn and they&amp;rsquo;ve discovered that a bunch of vampire slayers got there first and set up traps! Now it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to use your supernatural powers of tile rotation, garlic-based repellent and spider net slow-down, to help them overcome all obstacles and reach their regular daily rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How does the game play?&lt;br/&gt;Your main objective is to save vampires by leading them safely through the labyrinth and into their crypts. To do so, you can rotate the labyrinth parts to create new paths or use garlic-based repellent and spider-net slowdown to prevent vampires from walking into peril. Many traps are indeed lurking for the poor vampires. Starting with simple ones like pure light, things get more complicated down the road. Mobile wooden stakes, silver gun bullets, hired assassins or crazy garlic sappers wait impatiently to vaporize your vampires once for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you think you&amp;rsquo;ve mastered the game already? Wait! There&amp;rsquo;s more. Each non-tutorial level can be completed with additional objectives to earn silver or even gold status. And rest assured that the gold status will not be easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in the game?&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 65 challenging levels&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Over 12 hours of gameplay on basic mode with a strong replayability factor&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 6 different types of vampires, each with their own behavior&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Various offbeat traps including mobile wooden stakes, rotating mirrors&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Vampire hunters and garlic sappers hot on your track&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 3 degrees of level completion targeted at casual and hardcore players alike&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 4 different environment types&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Special skills of garlic repellent and spider-net slowdown&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Interactive tutorials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
