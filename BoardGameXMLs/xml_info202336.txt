			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gypsy Knights Games is proud to present the fourteenth entry in our line of products dedicated to the starships of Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A successful support vessel with a long service history, the Boyne-class was designed for use by the Royal Navy but was a very successful export even before the ship entered service, eventually serving in national navies, system navies, and defense forces across Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think we have an important role, someone has to keep providing stuff to throw at the bad guys.&amp;rdquo; - Leutnant Hannah Schmidt, Senior supply officer, HFS James Joyce, Wellington c2339 CE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of the United Kingdom&amp;rsquo;s Ministry of Defence&amp;rsquo;s hull procurement program for the planned expansion of the Royal Navy a new class of mid-size replenishment ships were put into service in 2282. A total of twenty of the new Boyne-class replenishment ships were authorized for construction. The lead ship, HMS Boyne had only just been commenced when orders began to be sought from the United States, India, Australia, Russia and France who were all looking at newer, larger replenishment vessels to replace those currently in service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships of Clement Sector 14: Boyne-class Replenishment Ship comes complete with beautiful views of the ship.  The Boyne is presented with full deckplans and statistics to make your use of our product simple, easy and fun. In addition, the ship comes with a set of adventure hooks to get your characters right into the action as well as a short story written by Bradley Warnes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume also includes the Aranui-class Medium Cargo Vessel.  The Aranui is a civilian variant of the Boyne which was licensed originally to Anderson and Felix to provide full maintenance and refit.  As they had a full set of design plans it was decided to produce a civilian version of the Boyne squarely aimed at small merchant shipping companies and wealthier owner/captains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though designed specifically with our Clement Sector setting in mind, these ships could easily be used in any science fiction setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
