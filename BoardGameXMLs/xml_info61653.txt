			<description>&lt;br/&gt;STORY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beloved King Lonelyheart has been murdered, and as he had no heirs to the throne, you and the other royal advisors are squarely out of a job. But fear not! Six candidates are rallying for the position, and the one the people find most favorable will be elected. The question is, which ones will you kiss up to and which ones will you denounce? Your choice in playing will determine how wise (and crafty) you really are. The wisest player will be selected as the new ruler's first advisor and will win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn players will gain inside information on one of the six candidates. Players will then be approached with opportunities to praise or denounce candidates. Players want to praise the candidate they believe will be the winner of the election, and denounce the candidates who they think will lose. At the end of the game, the candidates will be ranked, and the player's score will be based on what they have said about each candidate, along with the candidate's final position. The player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
