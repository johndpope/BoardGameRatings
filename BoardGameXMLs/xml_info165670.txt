			<description>In the not-too-distant future of 20XX A.D., a demonic revolution was beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When her boyfriend gets kidnapped by the queen of a succubus force known as the &amp;lsquo;Sexilicious Seven&amp;rsquo;, Pecan&amp;rsquo;s adventure for love, justice and divine punishment begins!&lt;br/&gt; She transforms into the Buxom and Brave Banzai Pecan, with the strength of &lt;br/&gt;ten-thousand men and the power of a Goddess hell-bent on Justice! Nothing will stand in her way, be it girls dressed in bunny-outfits or crazed-female demons; all shall be punished at the force of her fist! She will stop at nothing until she regains her love and justice!&lt;br/&gt; As her insane adventure carries on, she will dive into madness that would put the average person on the brink of insanity. Does she have the will power to &lt;br/&gt;live up to her title of &amp;lsquo;The Last Hope for the Young Century&amp;rsquo;, or will she end up losing all she&amp;rsquo;s fought for by a sliver?&lt;br/&gt; The legend of a goddess for justice is born, and she&amp;rsquo;s just crazy enough to&lt;br/&gt;go through hell and back to regain what&amp;rsquo;s her own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
