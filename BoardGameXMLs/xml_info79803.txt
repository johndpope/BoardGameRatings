			<description>From the Publisher Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Steel 2 is the highly anticipated sequel of Red Steel, the first title ever announced &amp;amp; entirely designed for the Nintendo Wii.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Steel 2 is a first-person-action-game where you impersonate a lonesome fighter who can fight with his sword and his gun at any time. This sequel sets a new milestone by being exclusively designed for the Wii Motion Plus, greatly increasing the precision of the controls. The game is particularly intuitive: just pick up the controls and experience the strength of the swing of the sword of an expert fighter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight your way through a grand solo campaign taking place in an edgy city in the middle of the desert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Steel 2 brings you the best sword &amp;amp; gun fighting experience you&amp;rsquo;ll ever face on console!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BE THE SWORDMAN&lt;br/&gt;You are a lonesome fighter, a badass with the attitude, a hard man full of mystery. Your goal is to defeat the wicked plans of a Warlord who has set his headquarters in the middle of a strange city.&lt;br/&gt;Face various and increasingly stronger enemies and defeat challenging bosses in epic and intense fights.&lt;br/&gt;Discover the truth about your presence in this mystifying metropolis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMMERSIVE EDGY WESTERN SETTING&lt;br/&gt;Your adventure takes place in a high-tech metropolis located in the middle of the desert, a place where the East meets the West. A modern Wild Wild East.&lt;br/&gt;Visit various places through the city, each with a distinctive style.&lt;br/&gt;Impressive cut scenes let you discover the game&amp;rsquo;s immersive background and environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EXCLUSIVELY DESIGNED FOR THE WII MOTION PLUSTM&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to the Wii Motion Plus (WMP) 1:1 recognition, your sword movements are precisely reproduced within the game. Slice the villains the way you want!&lt;br/&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s more, the WMP measures the power of your swing. The harder you swing the Wiimote, the harder you swing your sword in the game!&lt;br/&gt;Finally the WMP brings a much more precise input, allowing you to accurately aim at your enemies with the Wiimote.&lt;br/&gt;This very intuitive concept makes the game really accessible. However the wide range of difficulty levels allows you to have a very challenging experience if you chose to. Red Steel 2 is the core title for the WMP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CLOSE COMBAT SYSTEM&lt;br/&gt;The first-person-view drives you right to the center of the action and the WMP allows you to immediately feel like a powerful swordmaster and gunslinger.&lt;br/&gt;Fight up to six enemies at the same time and feel free to use your sword or your gun at any time.&lt;br/&gt;The Wii Motion Plus and the improved controls also allow you to master numerous combos with your sword and your gun. You can also trigger impressive and various finish kills on your enemies.&lt;br/&gt;Parry your opponents&amp;rsquo; attacks and deflects their bullets with your sword!&lt;br/&gt;Upgrade and improve your weapons throughout the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
