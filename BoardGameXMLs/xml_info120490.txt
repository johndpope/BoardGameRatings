							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Modern: 101 Occult Events</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 7-page PDF, written by James Maliszewski, is intended to serve several purposes. The simplest use is as a Gamemaster's tool, a way to add mystery to an occult-themed D20 Modern Roleplaying Game campaign. The GM can select a handful of the events offered here and sprinkle them sparingly into his adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another use for the occult events is in conjunction with the Fortean Magnet feat presented in this product. This feat enables a character who possesses it to &amp;quot;bring about&amp;quot; occult events on a limited basis. The events presented here can be used with this feat, since they are wide-ranging and generic enough to fit into most adventures, whatever their subject matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the occult events in this product can serve as examples and inspiration for the GM in creating his own events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
