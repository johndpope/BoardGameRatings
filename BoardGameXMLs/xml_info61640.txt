			<description>Chess&amp;sup3; (ChessCubed) is a three-player take on Chess, set on a hexagonal board.  The concept of three-player chess is nothing new (e.g. 3 Man Chess, Chess for Three, Three Player Chess, Trigon Chess &amp; Checkers, Tri-Chess, Megachess, 3er Schach), and the concept of chess on a hexagonal board is nothing new (e.g. Hexes Chess, Hexagonal Chess, En Garde!, etc.).  Heck, the concept of three-player chess on a hexagonal board isn't even new (e.g. Hexagonal Chess for three), but there are several features of Chess&amp;sup3; that make it stand out:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     It emulates the traditional, two-rank setup with a straight line of powerful pieces protected by a straight line of pawns.&lt;br/&gt;     The hexagonal playfield has an incredible 168 hexes in order to accommodate each player's army.&lt;br/&gt;     Each player has the eight traditional power pieces, plus a champion.  (The champion is the popular bishop/knight compound, but obviously with a hexagonal definition.)&lt;br/&gt;     Each player has ten pawns to protect the nine power pieces from wall to wall.&lt;br/&gt;     It features an angular, but familiar redesign of the pieces, each of which bears a hexagonal base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed to be portable, with a roll-up board, a drawstring bag for each player's pieces, and a courier tube of a case for the whole thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
