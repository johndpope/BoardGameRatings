			<description>In Evas World there are buildings, a car, a tractor &amp;amp; trailer, a swimming pool, trees, a pasture and much, much more. All those things are pictured on 48 discovery cards, items are presented as seen from all possible directions. On the game board with 12 inner squares all those things are pictured when being looked on from above, as you would do from an airplane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your turn you roll and move your marker around the 12 central squares on the board. Then you look at the squares adjacent to the square with your marker and try to imagine how the situation would look if you were standing in the road instead of looking down. Then you take the corresponding pictures from the display of discovery cards. Your left neighbour controls your choice, he can turn over the cards, the correct solution is given on the back. When all discovery cards have been given out, the player with most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
