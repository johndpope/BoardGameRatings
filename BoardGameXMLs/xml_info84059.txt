			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever hear of a golem shuriken? How about a whip-wall whip? Sounds kind of nasty doesn't it? We put the arms back in harms with 50 new magic weapons for use with D20 rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sample:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gauntlet, Sigil&lt;br/&gt;By closing their hand and concentrating for one round, the wearer of a Sigil Gauntlet can cause a symbol to form upon the palm of this gauntlet. In combat, this symbol can then be displayed to a creature or group of creatures and its mystic energies released. The effect is the same as that of a symbol spell (as described in the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Player's Handbook, third edition) as though it were cast by an 15th level cleric. The symbol disappears after its energy has been released. The gauntlet can only form each type of symbol once and will crumble to dust after the last symbol is used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
