			<description>From the publisher website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relics: Armistice League (RAL) is a fantasy football game unlike any other. There is no &amp;lsquo;gaming board&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;grid movement&amp;rsquo; for RAL&amp;hellip;. because RAL is not a board game!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 2&amp;rsquo; by 4&amp;rsquo; board with fluid, free movement measured in inches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game makes use of a card deck that allows the players to boost rolls or scupper the opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must gamble during the 'Play Book' phase to try and steal the initiative. RAL uses an activation point system coupled with an Active-Reactive player status to activate the models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, each turn the players need to try and &amp;lsquo;steal the initiative&amp;rsquo; by betting some of their teams activations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win the bet and you steal the initiative for that turn, lose the bet and you find yourself on the back foot, having to try and react to the opponents moves in the hope you can hold them&amp;nbsp; back long enough to steal the initiative back next turn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Active-Reactive player system brings with it the fluidity of the sports pitch to your gaming table! The players take it in turns to activate a model but being the reactive player means your players on are on the backfoot and the opponent can run run straight past you before you can muster you defences and stop the rush towards your goal zones!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
