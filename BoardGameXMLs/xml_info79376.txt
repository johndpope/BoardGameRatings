			<description>From the publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An all-new sourcebook for Call of Cthulhu and Delta Green, developed by Arc Dream Publishing for publication by Pagan Publishing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delta Green: Targets of Opportunity is a conglomeration of evils, many of them whispered in hints and rumors since the earliest days of Delta Green.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delta Green: Targets of Opportunity includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Cod Island: An inhuman menace rises from the frigid waters of southern Alaska. Three hundred years ago the Haida Indians fought to stamp it out. They failed. Can a handful of Delta Green agents fare any better?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M-EPIC: More than 100 years ago, Canada's Northwest Mounted Police established Division M to investigate unusual deaths in the far north. Over the years the division grew, slowly and quietly, as one after another of its own men died in bizarre attacks and uncanny circumstances. Today, M-EPIC is a top-secret agency with a nationwide charter. Few of its members know of its long history of using supernatural methods to battle the supernatural itself. Even fewer comprehend the terrible consequences that they face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disciples of the Worm: From ancient alchemy to the latest biotech, humanity has always quested for a means to defeat death. For some, fearful of death or desperate to fulfill some mission in life, no price is too high. For Delta Green, a loathsome 20-year-old case still demands an answer to a crucial question: How far will you go to save humanity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The De Monte Clan: Hurricane Katrina was one of the most devastating storms ever to strike the United States. It ravaged New Orleans and left the proud city a flooded wreck. For humanity, Katrina was an unspeakable tragedy. For Delta Green, Katrina was an opportunity. As emergency workers from every state and federal agency descend on the city, the rebuilding of New Orleans is a chance to strike at a long-festering horror. The target is an old and influential family whose people are something other than human, who see New Orleans' plight as an opportunity of their own and who have become quite skilled at destroying merely human enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cult of Transcendence: For centuries a cult ruled by Nyarlathotep, the mind and soul of the Outer Gods, has conspired to rule the world from behind the scenes, spreading its influence into the halls of power. Today its goals are more subtle and sinister than ever, guessed only vaguely even by its loyalest adherents. It may be the deadliest threat Delta Green has ever faced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delta Green: Targets of Opportunity is a hardcover roleplaying game sourcebook written by Adam Scott Glancy, Dennis Detwiller, Greg Stolze, Kenneth Hite, Warren Banks and Shane Ivey, edited by Shane Ivey and Adam Crossingham, and illustrated by Delta Green: Eyes Only artist Todd Shearer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This hardcover edition is a limited edition of 1,000 copies with very limited distribution. A paperback edition will follow roughly six months later for retail distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
