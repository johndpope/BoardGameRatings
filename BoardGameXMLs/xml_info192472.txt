			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fudge on the Fly is a method of character generation that allows games to begin immediately, with only a few moments required for character generation. It does this by allowing players to select their character's skills during play, when the situation arises which calls for them. This has a number of benefits in addition to its speed - most notably it spares players the annoyance of failing to purchase the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; skills. Every skill purchased will be one that proves itself useful during play. The revelation of character skills over the course of play also allows for the same sort of character discovery that is common in books and film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
