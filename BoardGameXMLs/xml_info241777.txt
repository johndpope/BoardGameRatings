			<description>The Santa Monica &amp;ndash; aka Mahonesa &amp;ndash; was the first of a series of 6 frigates of 34 guns, built in the Minorcan port of Mah&amp;oacute;n, and had as her first service the transport of troops of Mallorca. This ship performed various services along the Mediterranean sea, and took part to French Revolutionary Wars until she was captured by the HMS Terpsichore on October 13, 1796 on the Cape of Gata, after a fight of three hours with 21 dead crewmen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ship pack can also be used to represent the Spanish Mahonesa class frigate &amp;ldquo;Ninfa 1795&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ship pack contains a new ship with base, ship card, ship log, and specific deck of maneuver cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
