			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tell better stories using your favorite tabletop roleplaying game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We all know that stories need a beginning, a middle, and an end. Hero goes on quest, hero faces obstacles, hero completes quest. Lovers fall in love, antagonist keeps lovers apart, lovers end up together. Things beyond the protagonist&amp;rsquo;s control change, the protagonist faces adversity, the protagonist learns to adapt and achieves greatness. On that basic structure writers and storytellers throughout the ages have woven variations and created masterpieces. We keep coming back to the same foundations today for one very good reason: those structures are versatile and continue to work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book will help you to leverage basic story structure and use it to your advantage. You&amp;rsquo;ll be able to say what you want while keeping your audience engaged. The three-act structure and its variations will be discussed in detail, along ways this structure can be expanded beyond a single story and into a series or campaign. In the end, you&amp;rsquo;ll have new tools in your storytelling toolbox, along with the knowledge of how and when to use them in your own creative works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
