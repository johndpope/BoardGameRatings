			<description>El joc del m&amp;oacute;n (&amp;quot;The game of the world&amp;quot; in catalan) is a light and quite ironic card game on economic and political influence groups and on their efforts to become more powerful while maintaining some credibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player (in a standard 4 player game) represents two great global influence groups and has three voting cards. The cards have effects on the others' influence groups but also on his own influence groups, in the form of money revenues or expenditures and in the form of credibility gains or losses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A standard game has six voting rounds and before the ballot the players could use their diplomatic skills for negotiating good deals with the other players (but of course, they could be betrayed!). After the six voting rounds the winner is the player with more money and which is, at least, among the first three in credibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
