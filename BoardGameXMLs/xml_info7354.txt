			<description>Bomber recreates in game form the most decisive air battles fought in Europe during WWII. &lt;br/&gt;The game covers the major plane types used in the actual battles and all the key elements of the actual events.&lt;br/&gt;Bomber is basically a two player game although multiple subordinate commanders can be used on both sides.&lt;br/&gt;Different scenarios are provided in the rules in order to allow a great variety of games to be played using the game rules.&lt;br/&gt;THe most important information about the battles are provided in the game cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each hex on the map board is roughly 40 miles long.&lt;br/&gt;Each strength represents 8 to twelve planes( average of 10) in flying condition&lt;br/&gt;Each turn represents half an hour of actual time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in turns.The game turn can not exceed 33.&lt;br/&gt;Each turn is divided into phases which must be performed in a specific order. Some of those phases are further divided into steps:&lt;br/&gt;1)The plane readiness phase&lt;br/&gt;2)The initiative roll phase&lt;br/&gt;3A)The Landing Step&lt;br/&gt;3B)The normal movement step&lt;br/&gt;3C)The take off step&lt;br/&gt;4)The First side combat phase&lt;br/&gt;4A)The air combat step&lt;br/&gt;4B)The Flak combat step&lt;br/&gt;4C)The bombing Combat step&lt;br/&gt;5)The second side movement phase&lt;br/&gt;6)The second side combat phase&lt;br/&gt;7)The turn record phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a game ends after 33 turns have been played.&lt;br/&gt;Victory points that can be gained throughout the game are then counted and the person with the more VP wins.&lt;br/&gt;This occurs only if both players still have units at the end of a phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
