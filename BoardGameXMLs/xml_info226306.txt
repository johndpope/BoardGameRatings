			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you wanted to see what These Stars Are Ours! is all about? Now you can try it before you buy it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These Stars Are Ours is Stellagama Publishing's space-opera setting for the Cepheus Engine Core Rules and other 2D6 OGL SciFi games.  Set in 2260 AD - two years after the Terrans took Keid and forced the Reticulan Empire to capitulate the book it introduces the player characters to the immediate aftermath of the Terran victory in the Terran Liberation War against the mighty Reticulan Empire and its many thralls. For their part, the upstart Terrans, bolstered by their victory against their old masters, now move to become a power to be reckoned with in interstellar affairs. Against this background of espionage, maneuvering, and saber-rattling, and on the new interstellar frontiers, the player characters can forge a destiny of heroes or villains of the new United Terran Republic. The book provides all the astrography and background necessary to set a sci-fi campaign in the exciting times of the 23rd century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Primer to These Stars Are Ours! provides the prospective customer with a taste of the core These Stars Are Ours! book. The Primer contains an overview of this setting, its human and alien empires, the Terran Borderlands, Reticulan (Grey) aliens, a sample world, a sample Patron, and a news dispatch from February 2260 AD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that this publication includes information and a character generation table for Reticulans - Grey Aliens from Zeta 2 Reticuli! Also included are small-craft Flying Saucer stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
