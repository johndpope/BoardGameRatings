			<description>Smart Money Maker is a card game to illustrate the rules of the collaborative consumption. It is based on a simple concept: everyone plays against the problems left behind by the old economy! The objective is to pay for all debts, taxes, loans and make investments to remain in the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have to collaborate: they receive a portfolio of cards that represent the New Economy models as, for example, car or house sharing, recycling, and using free services online. The cards can be traded in for cash when they are used to pay off debts. After the whole deck has been used up, if all of the debts have been paid off by the players, the player who has the most cash wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the many opportunities to collaborate, it's possible that players won&amp;rsquo;t manage to pay off all debts. In that case, the game is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
