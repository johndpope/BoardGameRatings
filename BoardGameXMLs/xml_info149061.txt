			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game about superheroes working together as a team to stop villains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed to recreate 1960s comics: The stories and situations are slightly na&amp;iuml;ve and uncomplicated. Heroes have a single flaw. Nearly all problems can be resolved by beating something up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters and situations may become deeper and more complex as you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We play to revel in the fun and wish-fulfillment of having super powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This hack is based on the Marvel Heroic Roleplaying (MHRP) game designed by Cam Banks and published by Margaret Weiss Productions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this hack is to increase the user-friendliness of MHRP, focusing on teaching the skills needed to play the game in a logical and easy-to-learn way. It&amp;rsquo;s heavily inspired by the work of John Stavropoulos: from both his rules summary sheets for MHRP and his work on increasing the usability of RPGs, generally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Material about evil plans is taken from Monster of the Week by Mike Sands. Material about Keys has been taken from MHRP, The Shadow of Yesterday by Clinton R. Nixon, The Solar System by Eero Tuovinen and the article &amp;lsquo;How to create your own Milestones&amp;rsquo; by Judd Karlman on his Githyanki Diaspora blog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Material about setting up &amp;lsquo;downtime&amp;rsquo; is taken from Primetime Adventures 3 by Matt Wilson. The downtime-encounter scene economy is inspired by Poison'd by D. Vincent Baker. Material about the &amp;lsquo;free and clear&amp;rsquo; phase in crisis points and dice maps are taken from Sorcerer by Ron Edwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
