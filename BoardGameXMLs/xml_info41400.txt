			<description>Huddle is a game played while watching an American football game on television.  Each player's pawn is a football helmet which is placed on the board to indicate a prediction about what will happen on the next play.  At the same time each player wagers chips to the center of board.  Based on the outcome of the play, the chips wagered are taken by one or more of the players.  Play continues until one player has won all the chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: Board, 4 Helmets, Chips, Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
