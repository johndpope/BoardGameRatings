			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awesome Powers is a supplement for the BASH! Ultimate Edition RPG. Inside, you will find new Powers, new Enhancements, new Limitations, and new ideas to incorporate into your BASH! campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chiefly, this product is designed to allow you to create characters with themes, making use of pre-designed powers.  You can use these powers for inspiration, or you can even create your character by rolling for powers at random. As the Awesome Powers library grows, so will the list of available powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume 6 of Awesome Powers deals with powers of a technological nature, both Gadgetry (inventions and gizmos) and Technopathy (the power to control machines with the mind). There are dozens of powers for these Power Suites here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to a plethora of powers, you will also find a greatly expanded equipment list featuring weapons, defensive, and utilitarian equipment ranging from varying types of firearms to pepper spray to heavy ordinance. You can also augment &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; equipment by giving it special Equipment Enhancements, which have been expanded upon greatly here. Equipment Enhancements allow you to make anything from heat seeking explosive arrows to acidic armor piercing boomerangs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only do we have a bunch of gadgets to choose from here, we have included Rules for Inventing (or reverse engineering) new ones during a campaign. We also let the Narrator know how to handle it when a Hero wants to keep new gadgets they acquire during adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gadget Bundle is also introduced in Volume 6, items that have multiple powers all in a single device that shares common properties (like Hits, Soak, Charges, etc). We also included 47 sample Gadget Bundles to get you started! But it is really fun to create your own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume 6 also introduces a new rules concept of &amp;quot;Alterations&amp;quot; as cost-neutral alternative to Limitations and Enhancements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll also find all new Limitations and Enhancements (like Addicting and Friend From Foe),&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a new Disadvantage (Techno-Jynx), and also rules on how to create your own Powers, and Random Character Creation!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume 6 has included a Random Power Generator compiling all powers from Awesome Powers 1-6. So now you can completely create a character without needing to flip through multiple books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the powers presented here explains how to replicate the power described as closely as possible using the existing BASH! Ultimate Edition rules.  In this sixth volume of Awesome Powers, we present to your two themes, or Power Suites, each based on different tropes. Gadgetry Powers and Technopathic Powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
