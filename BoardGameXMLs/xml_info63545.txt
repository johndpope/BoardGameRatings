			<description>Duplicity Survival in the Big Apple&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting from Newark Airport in New Jersey, your first objective is to find the quickest route into Manhattan.  Should you hail a cab?  Head for the Lincoln Tunnel?  Or simply hoof it over the nearest bridge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secondly, after choosing alone of these characters; The Bell-Hop, Actress, Panhandler, Taxi-Driver, Fashion Model, Politician, Stockbroker, or even the loathsome Mugger, you must complete your secret agenda which includes visiting 6 different buildings (landmarks), accumulate $1,000,000 and 5000 credits, thru the building cards obtained while visiting each of these landmarks, and acquire at least one of your character's unique needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally the first player to return to the Newark Airport with all these goals and prove once again that you alone have what it takes to...  SURVIVE in the Big Apple!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
