			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Gumshoe you play a private detective hired to rescue a millionaire's daughter who has been kidnapped. It is a platform game where the player has to search across 10 tower blocks where the gang is hiding out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player must dodge bullets fired by the kidnappers, by moving up and down ladders, lifts and dropping through trapdoors. Also laundry chutes can be used to quickly move between different areas of the building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, as a private investigator, you are concerned about income and expenditure. At the end of each life, a screen is shown with your expenses, including a cost for each bullet fired, and your income, such as a bounty for each enemy killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
