			<description>Juneau-Opoly was designed in 2006 as a fund-raising board game for the Juneau Douglas High School Band Program.  It is played much like Monopoly in that players roll dice to advance around the board and purchase properties.  Properties are named after Juneau, AK businesses and once a player acquires all the businesses in a set he/she may purchase customers to make the business  collect more when other players land on them.  There are also fate and foxfire spaces that force the player to draw a random event card when landed on.  These cards have a variety of effects, such as giving or taking away money.  The game is won when a player manages to bankrupt everyone else.  A player becomes bankrupt when he lands on an owned property that he/she can't pay the owner for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
