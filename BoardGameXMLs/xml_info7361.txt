							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mob Strategy: The Takeover Game</name>
									
			<description>A Chinese-chess-like game in which players try to rub out their opponent's boss. Each type of piece has certain movement limitations. The Valentines (white heart) fight the Diamonds (black, move first). You win by eliminating the opposing Boss or by occupying the opposing warehouse on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bosses (heart, diamond) move one square orthogonally. They may also jump onto their Car (they henceforth move with the Car).&lt;br/&gt;The Punks (pistols) move one square orthogonally or diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;The Hoods (violin cases) move like bishops, diagonally any distance.&lt;br/&gt;The Cars move like rooks, orthogonally any distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No piece can jump over another. A piece is eliminated if a rival piece ends its move on its square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
