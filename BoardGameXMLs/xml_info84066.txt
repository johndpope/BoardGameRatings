							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Modern Magic Items II</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second supplement to be offered in our Buck-A-Batch line for D20 Modern contains a total of FIFTY new magic items with a modern slant. Here even the most mundane everyday objects have been touched by magic- from children's toys to music CDs...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sample:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wizard's Gum (displacement)&lt;br/&gt;Sold only at select and secret stores throughout the world, wizard's gum has become a popular item among modern day adventurers. In addition to a pleasant fruity taste each stick of wizard's gum holds a spell, triggered by the act of chewing. The chewer of this gum is protected as though they were the target of a displacement spell. This spell lasts for 10 minutes after which the effect vanishes and the gum becomes flat and tasteless. Each pack of wizard's gum contains 7 sticks of gum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
