			<description>Explore the Waters of Nereus, a fabulous world with wonderful treasures in its vast seas. You lead a capable and talented crew.  The captain determines the best direction to sail, the pilot and first mate maneuver the ship through the ocean, the purser controls your funds, the scientist performs important research, the merchant buys your treasures, and the boatswain controls the equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 6 rounds. In each round, a round card is flipped, showing how many crew members can be activated during the round. Players simultaneously choose a crew member to use, then, in turn order, perform the action.  As you collect treasures, you can pay off the crew to score victory points, as well as gain additional actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
