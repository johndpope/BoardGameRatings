			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a series of items, events and occurrences that could be found in a haunted, or otherwise creepy, house. Most of them are suitable for any setting or time period, but a few require settings having a technology equivalent to at least the 19th or 20th centuries depending, as they involve technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not every encounter is immediately obvious as being disturbing; some of them will require players to be paying close attention. Others stand out more noticeably. Whether or not any of the encounters have a negative effect is up to the Game Master. The various items tend more to supernatural and cosmic horror than to gory horror, but there are some results involving the latter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are one hundred items which can be chosen randomly using a d100, or required ones can be chosen. They are laid out in a table, with each entry having a name of what type of encounter it is, then details of the encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page of the supplement is the cover, one the front matter and instructions and the remainder is the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An example result is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Candles - Any lit candles in the room suddenly go out, as if blown out by a puff of wind or a draft, yet there are no open windows to account for wind blowing into the room, and no drafts could be felt when the candles blew out. If there is electrical lighting, it may go out in a similar fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
