			<description>Laser Invasion is a multi-genre first-person action game released by Konami for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991. The player takes control of a military operative who pilots an attack helicopter in order to infiltrate various enemy bases and fulfill his mission. The game supports the standard NES controller, as well as the NES Zapper light gun and the LaserScope, a voice-activated headset controller Konami released for the NES that was compatible with all light gun games released for the system. The American version of the game featured a rebate for the LaserScope in the instruction booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is composed of four missions with three different playing styles. Before each mission begins, the player will receive a mission briefing from their commanding officer, who will explain the player's next mission objective. In all of the game's missions (with the exception of Mission 3, which takes place entirely in the air), the player must land their helicopter into enemy heliports and then infiltrate the enemy bases in order to fulfill a certain objective. After fulfilling their mission, the player must escape from the enemy's base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can adjust the game's sounds, controls, and their number of lives in the option menu before starting the game. The game's gun shooting segments can be played with the Zapper or the LaserScope. When the player loses all of their lives, they will be given five chances to continue where they left off. The player can also gain extra lives by reaching certain scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Laser Invasion&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
