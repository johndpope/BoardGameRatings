			<description>Style Savvy: Trendsetters is a fashion store management simulation game which primarily involves selecting clothing pieces for customers as per their needs. The game's city is accessed from an ever-expanding map, allowing players to access their apartment, purchase new clothes and accessories, change their hairstyle and makeup, purchase new furniture, access their store, participate in competitions and access various locales with the purpose of activating certain events between characters. One addition to this sequel is the introduction of men's fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also makes use of various 3DS features. An in-game screenshot function[4] is supported, allowing players to take photos of a scene from the top screen at any time, saving the image as a 3D screenshot. These screenshots can then be exported to the SD card. AR Photo Op is an additional mode which utilises the ? AR card packaged with the system to take augmented reality photographs using characters and props from the game. The Nintendo Network allows players to connect to the Fashion Plaza, where one can create and access others' Web Shops. A player's Web Shop allows them to customise a store front and create three outfits to sell to others, garnering additional money in-game. StreetPass is utilised to exchange Stylist Cards, which contains personalised information about your character and offers a link to the player's Web Shop. Using the Nintendo 3DS wireless local play, players can compete with up to three others in a Wireless Fashion Show which pits players against one another to create an outfit that best matches a particular theme or style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_Savvy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_Savvy&lt;/a&gt;:_Trendsetters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
