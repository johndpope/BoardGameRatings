			<description>The game consists of two ivory colored 'Soccer dice'. One is printed with red text, and the other is printed with green text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dice with red text is used for 'playing' the game, and its six faces are marked:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Pass&lt;br/&gt;    Dribble&lt;br/&gt;    Off side&lt;br/&gt;    Hand Ball&lt;br/&gt;    Shoot&lt;br/&gt;    Shoot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dice with green text is used for 'shooting' at goal and its faces are marked:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Saved&lt;br/&gt;    Re-Bound&lt;br/&gt;    Over Bar&lt;br/&gt;    Wide&lt;br/&gt;    Goal &lt;br/&gt;    Goal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player whose turn it is rolls the first dice.  If they roll a 'pass', or 'dribble', the dice is rolled again.  If they roll a 'shoot', the second dice is rolled to determine the result.  If they roll a 'Hand Ball', or 'Off Side', play passes to the other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When rolling the second dice, a 'Re-Bound' gives the player another shot at goal.  Otherwise play passes to the other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to Socca Dice, albeit with different die faces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
