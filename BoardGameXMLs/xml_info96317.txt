							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeon Shift</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;You awaken in a dimly-lit room with no memory of how you came to be here.  As you groggily rise to your feet, you notice a sword, a scroll, a rope, and a lock pick have been laid out next to you.  Dazed and confused, you pluck the scroll off the ground, hoping it will explain things.  No such luck.  It appears to be a magic scroll, used for summoning a wolf spirit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You hear a clattering behind you, and the hairs on the back of your neck prickle.  You turn to see a crazed-looking goblin shuffling towards you with a rusty scimitar in its hands.  Quickly, you snatch up the sword.  The goblin lunges at you.  You clumsily block its attack, then thrust forward and impale the foam-mouthed creature.  It slumps to the ground, dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have no idea how you got here or why you are here.  But you have a few tools at your disposal, and you are going to find a way out.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Shift is a print-and-play solo dungeon-crawling card game.  The player begins the game with four cards from the Equipment deck and must use those cards to overcome the various challenges presented by the Rooms, Monsters, and Traps in the Obstacle deck.  Cross chasms, pick locks, disarms traps, and fight monsters, all the while hoping to not run out of equipment as you try to escape from the dungeon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have drawn all the cards in the Obstacle deck, you win.  You may also complete a Victory condition presented by the Obstacle cards, but be warned, these Victory conditions are extremely difficult.  If you run out of Equipment or become &amp;quot;stuck&amp;quot; with no way to advance, you lose!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While expanding on the concepts of Dream Shift, Dungeon Shift is not simply a re-themed version of the first game in the Shift series.  It adds introduces new concepts and further explores the potential of the Shift design space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
