			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battlelogs: GRELs is a supplement for Heavy Gear D6, detailing the &amp;quot;clone troopers&amp;quot; of the Heavy Gear setting - the Genetically Recombined Experimental Legionnaires. Feared by their enemies and scorned by their masters, GRELs are at the forefront of the New Earth Commonwealth's attempts to subjugate all of human space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But all is not well within their ranks. On Terra Nova alone, GRELs are often in open revolt against their human officers, as they become something they were never intended to be: individulal beings with their own unique personalities. Similar &amp;quot;errors&amp;quot; among Earth-controlled GRELs have led to a series of atrocities, as the NEC refuses to recognize the genie they have released....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
