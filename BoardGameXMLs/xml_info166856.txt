			<description>The players have to move their 4 cars from the &amp;quot;Start/Ziel&amp;quot; space to the turning cycle of their color and back again, while observing the traffic rules. The first player who gets this done, wins the game. Players who violate the traffic rules have to pay a fine, if they do this frequently, they have to play a penalty round with one car. Movement is determined by a die. A Special die determines some advantages, like bringing a new car into play, move the traffic cops or turn the traffic lights. &lt;br/&gt;On some spaces the players have to answer questions about the traffic rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
