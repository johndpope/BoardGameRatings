			<description>From the back of the adventure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dear Carol,I'm real glad you're visiting this summer.  There's this cute guy named Keith I want you to meet.  He's Burt's best friend and it would be great if we could go out together and stuff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Want to see Jackson Jammer and Van Helsing at the amphitheater?  Keith says he can get tickets easy.  It'll be AWESOME! Burt thinks Jammer is the best guitarist in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But remember not to say anything to my folks.  Those weird concert murders have got them all worked up.  Like I'm so sure some vampire is going to bite us on the necks in front of 2,000 people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, get down here soon.  It's going to be INTENSE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;XXXXXXXXX&lt;br/&gt;OOOOOOOOO&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luv ya,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vicki&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;P.S. You're not scared, are you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn up the volume: you've just tuned in &amp;quot;Death On Tour,&amp;quot; another terrifying adventure for use with the CHILL role-playing game system.  Inside, you'll find character cards, maps, background information, and all of the plot encounters you'll need for hours of horrifying fun. Be sure to look for other fine products from PACESETTER, Ltd.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
