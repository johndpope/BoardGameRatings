			<description>Publisher's Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Race to Florida!  The United States is on RED ALERT!  Red Skull is threatening to spread his infamous dust of death all over the country.  All the states, except Alaska and Hawaii, are at risk.  It's up to you, the Avengers and Force Works, to get to Florida as quickly as you can and put an end to Red Skull's deadly plan.  Remember, Kang and his temporal duplicates are out there to prevent you from accomplishing your mission!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Avengers was published as part of the Marvel Comics Super Heroes Game Book, and the board is a double-page spread of the book which is laid flat to play.  It is a roll-and-move game where players must move four markers (one at a time) in a numbered sequence from state to state on a map of the United States, starting in Washington and ending in Florida.  Some states contain instruction to move forward or back or lose or gain a turn.  If a player lands on a state occupied by another player's token, they must move back five spaces.  First player to reach Florida with all five tokens wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
