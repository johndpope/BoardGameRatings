			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ghostly halls of Limbo are an eternal mystery, even to those who dwell here. Some of the doors you know. They lead to the rooms of your friends, domains like your own which have been sculpted by their personalities, revealing secrets you wish you never knew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meeting in the waiting room is much less embarrassing. But even that grows old. Listening to the same stories over and over again, reading the same magazines, watching the same shows on a television that only seems to receive reruns from twenty years ago. The magazines are equally old, and never hint at current events. A new face would be a blessing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which is why you prowl the halls, looking for a way out of Limbo . . . a door your Mentor has forgotten to lock, or a passage leading to one of those Outer Planes you&amp;rsquo;ve heard so much about. Paradise sounds like a nice place to visit, if for no other reason than to break up the monotony.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was in the halls that you first saw the pimply youth. He wore a black t-shirt with the words, Horror Haven written on it in blood red. His face and torso were marred by gaping wounds, but the young man didn&amp;rsquo;t seem bothered by his disfigurement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You guided him to the waiting room, where your so called soul-mates sat on overstuffed chairs. You never could believe this sorry crew was cosmically linked to you. By the time you reached the waiting room, Paulie had grown faintly translucent. His ectoplasm trailed after him like a wake of smoke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paulie turned out to be a typical teenager, obsessed with horror movies and gory special effects. It was all he could talk about. The others gathered around him, as curious to meet a newcomer as you were. They bombarded him with questions about sports and world events. Your soul-mates always did have trouble letting go of their earthly obsessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tunnel of light opened beneath Paulie, sucking him into its maw. The last shreds of his ectoplasmic body ripped from him, and you saw the spark of his lifeforce spinning into the vortex, dwindling on its way back to Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What new form of flesh would Paulie find himself plunged into? Would he be a bathing beauty reclining in the sun of some Hawaiian beach? Or would he be a crab scuttling across the sand? Having met him, the latter seemed most likely. You shuddered, knowing your fate was just as repulsive. You needed more Karma to escape this cycle of rebirth, and that meant setting things right on earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A boy killed by a character from a movie. Surely an evil, supernatural force was loose in the world. It presented you a definite opportunity to gain some Karma, and thereby avoid Paulie&amp;rsquo;s fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tunnel of light remained open, beckoning. A hint, perhaps, from your reclusive Mentor? To find out, all you had to do was make a ghostly vow and step into the tunnel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
