							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">YUM: Realtime Icecream</name>
									
			<description>YUM is a real-time pattern recognition game where players use an identical startup deck of round cards of different ice cream flavors and must build the proper ice cream cones, in a central location. Once a player believes a cone is complete he selects the cone card and flips it along with all his used ice cream cards. Players can clock-out for additional points once they feel that their remaining ice cream cards can't build more cones, leaving the last player without bonus points. Players verify their cones and discard all incorrect cone cards. All ice cream cards are used again and more rounds are played until the deck of cones is depleated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
