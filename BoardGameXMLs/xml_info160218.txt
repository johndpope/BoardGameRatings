			<description>Rise 2: Resurrection is a computer game developed by Mirage Media and published by Acclaim Entertainment in 1996. The game is a sequel to Rise of the Robots, and improves on the first game's graphics, rendering and animation; hits now give off metal scraps and electrical arcs progressively run over the bodies of damaged robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike its predecessor, Resurrection allows the players to control any robot, both in one and two-player mode. Also, players can choose from 256 different palette rotations for each robot. There are five different types of projectiles available to each robot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a far broader fighting experience than its predecessor. Each robot has its own original moves, Mortal Kombat-inspired death moves, the ability to steal and use a defeated robot projectile, and a devastating super move that can be used when the power bar is full, similar to other fighting games of the time. The game also features a combo counter system, named Chaos. The controls are standard for a fighting game, and non-humano&amp;iuml;d robots adapt their moves to the punch/kick model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In one-player mode the player faces each robot in its own rendered and raytraced stage, while two-player mode allows the player to either choose the stage or to leave it at random. Each stage is graphically tuned to its corresponding robot, and some stages feature traps that players can use to gain an advantage against their opponent. The traps also tend to match their owner robot's characteristics: as the stage for Steppenwolf, the gun-wielding robot, features a trap that fires bullets, and the stage for Vandal, the saw-wielding robot, features a trap with a saw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Rise 2: Resurrection&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
