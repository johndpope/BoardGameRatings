							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jam Doodle</name>
									
			<description>One part art, one part communication. For two or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: To describe a drawing composed of basic figures accurately enough that your partner can draw it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Need: Paper and pencil for each player. A small sketch pad works better than 8.5 x 11, but any paper will do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two roles in Jam Doodle: creator/describer and drawer. During the game, you will take turns swapping roles. When you're the describer, choose a doodle and begin describing it to your partner. When you're the drawer, try to draw your partner's doodle as accurately as possible from the description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When both of you agree that you're done, turn around and compare the doodle to the copy that was just drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* If the copy is an accurate duplication of the original, then you've accomplished your goal. It's okay if the copy is drawn to a different scale, as long as the ratios between the objects are accurate.&lt;br/&gt;    * If the copy differs from the original, then take some time to discuss where it differs, why it differs, and what information could have made it come out differently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you're done, swap roles and start again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several variants to the basic rules are available on the website as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download the rules here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/92/jam-doodle&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/92/jam-doodle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
