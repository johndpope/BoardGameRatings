			<description>Freely translated from the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Sune and Sophie has taught their friends how to allure somebody and today they have arranged a competition of that art. Everyone wants to be in it. They have written down the names of the students and given them a score based on how easy or difficult it is to allure them. In order to succeed in their competition you have to play your allure cards cleverly, because then you get the chance to allure some of the most advanced girls/boys and than means extra points.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is fairly easy and quite creative:&lt;br/&gt;Cards worth different amounts of points are placed on the squares of the board. Your job is to move your piece to the squares that hold the highest points. Because, whatever square you land on, you get the card that is placed there (and its value is added to your score).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tricky part is the way you move your piece. See, there is no die, so you move by playing your 4 &amp;quot;move cards&amp;quot; in a particular order that you decided before the round started. You don't know the order of the other players' &amp;quot;move cards&amp;quot; until they are actually played, so it's tricky to plan ahead how you should move in order to get the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game consists of 7 rounds. After that, the player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
