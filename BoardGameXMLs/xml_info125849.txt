			<description>You and your friends thought it would be fun to go on a little backwoods camping trip. You&amp;rsquo;d heard the rumors about missing campers, but thought it was just stories to frighten  tourists. Then, when you found the hidden side trail, you just couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist a good hike. Now, you&amp;rsquo;re running for your lives and you know the stories are true.  &lt;br/&gt;   You can hear some of your friends screaming in the distance, but you have no idea where you are. You just want to find your way out, to escape this place. But those screams, how can you leave your friends behind? Suddenly, you notice the woods around you have gone quiet. Something&amp;rsquo;s not right. &lt;br/&gt;   As you realize you&amp;rsquo;re not alone, you also remember something one of your friends said- &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a reason it&amp;rsquo;s the road less traveled!&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hillbilly Hell is a semi-cooperative game of Horror, Survival, Rescue, and Escape for 1-3 Players. In Hillbilly  Hell, you play as a group of lost Hikers that have stumbled into the path of a family of inbred cannibal rednecks. Players must look for a way out while helping one another (if they choose to) survive being hunted for sport, food, or worse. The player  whose  Hikers can survive or escape, and gain the most Survival Points along the way, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
