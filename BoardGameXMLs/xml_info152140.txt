			<description>A tree killed his granny and now he is out for revenge. Meet Jack Lumber, the superhuman lumberjack who hates trees, loves animals, and hates trees. Did we say that twice? The guy really hates trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use the supernatural powers of Jack Lumber to massacre the forest in this time-warping line-drawing log-slicing pun-filled lumberjacking mashup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hike the trails of Flapjack Forest, trudge through The Loggers Bog, and ascend Widowmaker&amp;rsquo;s Peak chopping down every pine, oak, and maple that stands between you and the tree that killed your sweet old granny. But be careful about where you swing your axe we love the creatures of the forest. Watch your cabin fill up with spunky forest critters that insist on crashing at your place after you have destroyed their woodland homes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight the forest and make Granny proud!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
