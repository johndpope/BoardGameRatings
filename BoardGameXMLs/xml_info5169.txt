			<description>This Sorcerer's Cave type adventure boardgame sees each player starting from a different corner of the board. Tiles are placed on the board as it is explored; initially each player is looking for the rooms containing their equipment (Key, allowing teleportation between various points, Weapon and Armour). On the way they encounter Monsters to defeat. Once they have found their equipment players make their way to the center of the board to challenge the Dragon; defeating him wins the game. Players can have combat with each other if they land on the same space and can barter items with each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success is dependent on your rooms turning up somewhere near you early on in the game. There is a limited amount of decision making re the routes and which is the best way to put tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components are quite attractive and sturdy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a Story Booklet and a leaflet explaining how the Invalay board system will be used in subsequent games; unfortunately this game, the company and the system all appear to have sunk without trace!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
