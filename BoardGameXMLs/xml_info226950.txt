			<description>Each player has 25 cards. The game consists of 2 halfs (f. e. 2 x 15 minutes). After the first half all cards are returned to the hand of the players. The player who scores the most goals wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 5 goalkeeper-cards of each player are shuffled and placed topdown in 2 stacks on the spaces 1 (goal) of the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 20 fieldplayer-cards of each player are shuffled and 10 cards are placed topdown on the spaces 2-11 on each side of the gamebord. The other 10 cards (reserve) get on the hand of each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting player (chosen randomly) turns over one of his cards on spaces 7-11 the board. The now revealed card requires a reaction (turning of a card) of an chosen opponent (straight or diagonal ahead).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two cards are compared and the inferior one is placed beside the game board to build a new stack of reserve cards.&lt;br/&gt;The superior card is moved to the space of the inferior card and may continue to attack another opponent card. If a attacking card is countered by a defending card, both cards are removed from the board and the opponent player gets his opening turn to attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before each opening turn, the player places reserve cards he choses from his hand onto the free spaces on his half of the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are summarized on each side of the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
