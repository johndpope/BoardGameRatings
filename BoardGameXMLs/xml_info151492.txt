			<description>THE STORY:&lt;br/&gt;You've awakened in an abandoned building with no idea of who you are. There are others with you, also missing their memory. Writings on the wall by those left here before you say that there is no way out, except by being the last. It also says no one here is entirely human, that your true natures will soon begin to reveal themselves. You're not sure about this whole &amp;quot;not human&amp;quot; thing. All you do know is that you plan on being the last one standing, whatever you are!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE GAME:&lt;br/&gt;What Are You!? is a combat and deduction game where players secretly assume the role of one of ten different monsters. They will then use cards and power up tokens to attack each other while also attempting to uncover their opponents' true natures, and thus their ultimate weaknesses. The player that can outlast the others wins the game and becomes King (or Queen) of all monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
