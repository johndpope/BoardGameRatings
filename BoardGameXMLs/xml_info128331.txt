							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">StarCluster 2 Robot Design Guide</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The StarCluster 2 Robot Design Guide features a flexible, component-based system for creating robots for your StarCluster 2 game. The Guide allows you to select brains, torsos, manipulators, locomotors, surfaces, senses, and skill programs for your robot. Sentient (self-aware) robots can be created and used for player characters or NPCs. Some robot brains are self-programming, learning skills by doing, as any player character does. There are also abberations, glitches in the programming, which can make each robor unique. Robots can look totally humanoid or utterly bizarre as you choose. Robot parts can be used as prosthetics to replace damged, destroyed, or worn out limbs, and robots can house the soul of a humanoid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are taking the gloves off now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Newly updated, with new components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
