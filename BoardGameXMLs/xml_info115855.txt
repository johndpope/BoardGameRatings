			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game works like Monopoly, but is a rather poor implementation: the game doesn't show a game board. Besides that, houses and hotels can't be sold back to the bank. And the user interface also has issues (besides the lack of a board) like when you want to buy houses, in that sub screen your series aren't mentioned, so you'll either have to keep notes, or rely on your memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay only possible for 1 player, against 1 computer opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game got some bad reviews, but was commercially sold in the UK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
