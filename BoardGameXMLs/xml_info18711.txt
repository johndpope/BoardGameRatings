							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Piquet: Anchor of Faith</name>
									
			<description>Anchor of Faith warfare in the seventeenth century.  At the beginning of the seventeenth century armies deployed in large units comprising many thousands of men. Firepower, while important, was still subordinate to shock of contact and the use of pole arm weapons. The period can be characterized: - The introduction of smaller formations, reduction in the use of pike and increased reliance on firepower and the development of linear tactics. Anchor of Faith allows the gamer to recreate the battles and tactics of this colorful period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anchor of Faith covers warfare in Europe and the fringe nations in the Middle East and Asia. The supplement introduces new rule mechanisms, formation types and army generation tables particular to the period 1600 to 1690. It combines the main rules that allow battles to be played at a regimental scale, and a sub set of rules, the Twelve Apostles, for fighting smaller actions with units typically representing a few companies of infantry or troops of cavalry. The latter being particularly useful for fighting large English Civil War skirmishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anchor of Faith includes a range of new formations definitions including tercios, Swedish brigade, deep line, caracole cavalry, commanded shot, galloper cavalry and war wagons. New period rule mechanisms are introduced to mirror both the abilities and shortcomings of the troops of this era. New rules include revised pursuit rules, morale points by command and new fire rules to reflect the low effect of musketry and the importance of  &amp;lsquo;push of pike&amp;rsquo; in deciding the outcome of engagements.  Many of the new ideas and mechanisms can be used in other Piquet periods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Piquet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
