			<description>Clumond, a portmanteau of &amp;quot;clubs&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;diamonds&amp;quot;, is a trick-taking game based on Ninety-Nine. In both games, a player has three cards whose suits encode the number of tricks needed to score a successful hand. This is called the &amp;quot;bid&amp;quot;. Clumond's major twist is that the bid cards are not selected at the beginning of the hand -- they are whatever cards remain after all tricks have been played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
