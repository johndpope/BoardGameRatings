							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horda Zombi</name>
									
			<description>Horda Zombi is a two-player card game, where players are both defending against a horde of zombies, trying to avoid to get eaten. Each player has a customized deck of 40 cards. As zombies attack a player, they discard cards from his deck. When a player can no longer draw more cards, he is eaten by the zombies, and another player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn has three phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Defense phase: In the defense phase, the player can use their weapons. Each weapon comes with a limited ammunition supply; each time you shoot, the player has to remove a bullet. If a weapon is out of ammunition it can not be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this period you you can play cards from your hand, activate items and host zombies in your locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Regroup phase: The player gets new energy and readies his items and locations, making them available to use once again. The players also have to draw one card from their deck - and they lose the game if they cannot draw.&lt;br/&gt;     Deployment phase: The player can play cards and use their items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
