			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Entry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         This RPG item was a submission to the #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge.  It was developed by three different designers in a randomized, anonymous fashion.  For details, and for information on how the versions are structured, see the series RPGGeek entry here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015. All of the entries are available here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Winners and Everything&lt;br/&gt;Entry #1553; Stage One: Jonathan Hansen; Stage Two: Eva Schiffer and Alan De Smet; Stage Three: Josh Crowe&lt;br/&gt;Stage One and Two Title: Saturday Morning Heroes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2014 nature scientists genetically modified papayas to resist a strain of papaya blight and save the papaya industry. No one could have imagined the hideous side effects. The first effect was that many of the papayas grew to enormous size and absorbed tons of atmospheric CO2. This CO2 reservoir ended global warming trends, if they ever existed in the first place. The second, and even more shocking, effect was that people born to consumers of the papayas often developed superpowers. I mean these things are complicated and the earth did pass through the tail of a radioactive comet that night when all cactuses became sentient. But most people are pretty sure it&amp;rsquo;s the papayas. When will people learn?&lt;br/&gt;While most of those developing super powers led the lives of normal, law abiding citizens 0.1% turned towards lives of crime (as high as 0.3% in some groups of minorities). Thus the US department of homeland security was forced to put together teams of super powered people to deal with these threats. Threats not just to safety and property, but threats to the American way of life itself.  &lt;br/&gt;You are heroes because you are on this team.  And you fight people who are villains because they dare oppose America and the American way of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
