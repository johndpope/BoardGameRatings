			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A nightmare weapon from the old wars has returned!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the ancient conflicts that caused the final collapse of human civilization, these bear sized military bio-weapons continue to wreak havoc into the new era. Encountered as wild predators or armored sentinels for high tech enclaves, Spikers are murderous foes and a serious challenge to any excavation team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed and written by Danny Seedhouse, the Spiker is our 9th free Creature of the Apocalypse. This brute comes in both a wild and armored variant with the wild specimen often exhibiting extra mutations, while the armored version comes equipped with a rich assortment of randomly determined back-mounted relic firepower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crafted to confront mid to high rank characters, these freaky, unpredictable monsters bring some serious firepower to the table, and can dish out the sort of ranged attack abilities that normally only player characters enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 6 page PDF and includes a full page image of cover art for use as a player handout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
