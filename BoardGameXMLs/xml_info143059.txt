			<description>Looksley the rabbit needs your assistance to finish the story he&amp;rsquo;s writing. Guide him through a world based on famous fairy tales and folk stories from around the globe, helping him to gather inspiration by finding hidden items along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this unique take on hidden picture games, you&amp;rsquo;ll move the Nintendo DSi system to change your view of various 3-D dioramas. Peer deeply into the scene as you shift the system, watching as layers within the diorama move to reveal previously unseen letters and objects. As you collect these letters and objects, you&amp;rsquo;ll meet new characters and spell words that will open additional stages with more sets of hidden items to find. Particular stages contain secret pictures, offering your observation skills an even greater test.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scour each scene&amp;rsquo;s incredible depth and detail as you lend Looksley a hand in completing his masterpiece. Players of all ages will love this visual puzzle challenge and be amazed to see that even the same spot can look different from another angle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
