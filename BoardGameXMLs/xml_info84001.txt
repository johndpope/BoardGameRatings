			<description>The Flintstones: Surprise at Dinosaur Peak is a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System and is the second licensed game based on the 1960s Flintstones television series. The game, like the original The Flintstones: The Rescue of Dino &amp;amp; Hoppy, was created and published by Taito. This game was never released in Japan unlike its prequel. It was released only to Blockbuster Video  in August 1994. In this game, the player can play as both Fred and Barney, and they both have different attacks and abilities; in the original, the only playable character is Fred. It is known to be the second rarest commercially-released licensed title for the NES (behind Stadium Events) and copies on eBay rarely go below $150 USD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Flintstones: Surprise at Dinosaur Peak,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
