			<description>A humorous game published in InQuest #150, cover date October 2007.  Players choose their team, which is really their pawn, all of which are based on classic gaming icons; example HeroKlutz referring to HeroClix.  The player then works to overcome various challenges at the carnival, defeat other players, and collect three pieces that will make up the &amp;quot;Ultimate Weapon,&amp;quot; which leads to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
