			<description>Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve bested the strongest demons, the deepest of dungeons, and the most maniacal of masters. Now, it is time to set aside your sword or staff and settle back into a life of retirement. But what does one do with all of this wealth and treasure? Why not establish a demesne of your very own. Rule from your own castle, establish a local political foothold, or even accumulate far greater wealth in taxes and fees.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This solo adventure is intended for any character of any level with 10,000 or more gold pieces. If your character does not have enough money, create a backstory of a dead relative leaving their estate of 10,000 gold to you. You will need the Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls rules to play, and this solo is written primarily using 5th edition rules. However, you should not have any problem using other editions with this solo. In situations where problems may arise, the application of good sense and judgment reign supreme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;This solitaire adventure is available as a free download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
