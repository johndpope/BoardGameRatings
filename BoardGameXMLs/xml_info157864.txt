Passionate RPG gamers gathered to create an open and freely available game. You will have no surprises of premium content which will limit your gameplay or unbalance the game. There are no limitations in skills, ranks, abilities, items you can gain with your free account. There are no time limits or additional constraints. Donations are gladly accepted. Servers and bandwidth are provided by sponsors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the present state of development, PlaneShift is not a complete game, but it has all the functionalities needed to be enjoyable to play, including combat, magic, crafting, and quests. The game is still under heavy development, so you may easily find bugs, glitches and missing features. Our model is to keep the game open for the public, so you can give feedback on the features you want us to develop and you can shape the future of the game. PlaneShift is anyway enjoyable and has hundreds of active players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
