							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alvin and the Chipmunks</name>
									
			<description>Alvin and the Chipmunks is a video game based on the film of the same name. The game was released on December 4, 2007 and was the first release by video game company Brash Entertainment. It follows The Chipmunks as they play their way from small venues (such as a high school prom and a civic center) to massive crowds at Burning Munk and ultimately Rockathonapalooza. The soundtrack features 40 popular songs, including &amp;quot;All the Small Things&amp;quot; by Blink-182, &amp;quot;It's Tricky&amp;quot; by Run-D.M.C., and &amp;quot;Heartbreak Hotel&amp;quot; by Elvis Presley. The gameplay itself is similar to other rhythm games such as Rock Band and Guitar Hero. Jason Lee reprise his role as David Seville in the cutscenes while Ross Bagdasarian Jr. and Janice Karman reprise their roles from the 1980's-2000's cartoons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks (video game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
