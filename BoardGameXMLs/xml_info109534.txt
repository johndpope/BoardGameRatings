			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About Hero Lab&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At its core, Hero Lab is an incredibly versatile engine, designed to accommodate just about any system the RPG industry can come up with. It's flexible enough to adapt to any roleplaying game on the market, and expansive enough to keep up with the most intricate of rules systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hero Lab presents a wealth of highly detailed information in a manner that is easy to navigate and intuitive to use. Through the use of adaptive summary panels, all the inter-dependencies of your character are readily visible. Mouse-sensitive help keeps all the details at your disposal without cluttering up the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hero Lab manages the complex inter-connections of your character automatically and transparently, so you&amp;rsquo;re free to experiment. As you make changes to your character, Hero Lab automatically applies appropriate bonuses, penalties, and modifiers, immediately showing you the results of those changes. Don&amp;rsquo;t like what your changes did? Try something different. Similarly, if you step outside of the defined rules for the game, the validation engine will automatically alert you to the situation, telling you where the problem lies. The validation engine alerts you to the error without directly enforcing correct behavior - this allows you to ignore the error, making it easy to accomodate house rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters aren't just about numbers and choices, however. Every character is a story in the telling &amp;ndash; how they came to be, who they are, and their hopes for the future. With an innovative journaling option, Hero Lab gives you the ability to track key events in your character's life, and the comprehensive In-Play mode allows you to easily manage your character during the game, from applying temporary effects (from spells, abilities, etc.) to tracking limited use items (such as arrows, potions and the like), to activating special abilities (such as Barbarian Rage).&lt;br/&gt;Games Supported&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hero Lab allows you to create, manage and evolve characters for the following game systems:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Pathfinder Roleplaying Game (Paizo Publishing)&lt;br/&gt;    * Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds, 2nd and 3rd editions (Green Ronin Publishing)&lt;br/&gt;    * d20 System SRD 3.5 (Wizards of the Coast)&lt;br/&gt;    * World of Darkness (White Wolf Publishing)&lt;br/&gt;    * 4th Edition D&amp;amp;D (included with the Authoring Kit - Wizards of the Coast)&lt;br/&gt;    * Savage Worlds (included with the Authoring Kit - Pinnacle Entertainment Group)&lt;br/&gt;    * Authoring Kit (create your own games using Hero Lab's powerful scripting engine)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support for additional game systems will be added in the following months, under license from their publishers.&lt;br/&gt;Data Files&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hero Lab can be tailored to the needs of virtually any game system. All of the facets of a given game system are encapsulated by a set of data files, spanning the core game mechanics to the validation rules, and even the visual presentation of Hero Lab&amp;rsquo;s display.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you purchase Hero Lab, it comes &amp;ldquo;bundled&amp;rdquo; with one game system of your choice (from the list above). Access to additional data files can be purchased for a nominal charge. The list of supported games can be found here.&lt;br/&gt;Editing Tools&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hero Lab offers a powerful Editor within each system which allows users to customize existing data files and create new data files. This Editor makes it possible for users to create a huge variety of custom content, or to simply make minor adjustments to accommodate house rules.&lt;br/&gt;GM Support&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hero Lab can help GMs as well as players - it now includes hundreds of stock heroes, which can be imported as &amp;quot;instant NPCs&amp;quot; for use in your games. Once you've imported the NPCs into Hero Lab, you can manage combat and noncombat encounters in the Tactical Console.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out of combat, the Tactical Console displays skill information for all heroes. In combat, it shows attack information, as well as important saving throws and other statistics. You can apply damage or status conditions to any hero with the click of a button.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
