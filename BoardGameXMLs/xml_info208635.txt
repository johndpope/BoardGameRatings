			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Old Ones&amp;rsquo; armies have invaded and it&amp;rsquo;s up to your and your friends to push them back! Create a team of heroes to defend the Eternia Crystals. Then jump into the action yourself to finish them off! Level up, collect loot, and more on your quest to defeat the Old Ones and save Etheria. Play by yourself or with up to three friends in 4-player online co-op.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you explore Etheria you&amp;rsquo;ll find the ground littered with valuable relics, armor, and deadly weapons. Combine their stats and passives together to create your own unique hero builds. Then fuse together the pieces you don&amp;rsquo;t need to level up and enhance your favorite items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equip Skill Spheres to further customize your Heroes&amp;rsquo; defenses, abilities, and stats. Small and medium Skill Spheres allow you to boost the stats on your heroes. Large Skill Spheres will grant you customized attributes and skills. Uber Skill Spheres will completely change the way your defenses or abilities work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are hundreds of pets just waiting to be discovered in Etheria. After hatching your new companion, you can level them up by taking them into battle! With the right evolution materials your pets can finally reach their true potential, gaining higher stats and activatable abilities that can wreak havoc on your foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
