			<description>The hare and tortoise are staging a series of races!  This an asymmetric 2 player climbing race game using the Decktet system.  Even though the players must shed the same amount of cards, the Hare is given much more to use (and is more free to use them) at the start of the game, but the Tortoise will slowly and steadily build up her hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card play like climbing games is in response to the opponent's plays, but it is also constrained because the players must always connect their plays with their developing race tracks.  The winner with the best record after four races is the champion badger!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full rules may be found on wiki.decktet.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
