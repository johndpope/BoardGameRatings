			<description>Board &amp;amp; Pieces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A decorated board with a line, and 3 or 4 sets of 4 different sizes of disk-shaped pieces are used for 2 or 3 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players place pieces on the line of the board. Smaller pieces can be placed on bigger pieces. The same sized pieces cannot be on top of each other. Pieces that are placed on the board, both by itself, and piled-up, are called stacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all the pieces are placed on the board, the Game starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player in turn take either of the following actions. No pass is allowed:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a) Take all the pieces in the same colors placed at the top of all the stacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;b) Relocate stacks: Take one of the stacks and place the pieces all together on top of the other stacks on the board. Stacks can also be moved partially: A part of a stack, a piece or multiple pieces from the top of stacks can be taken and placed on top of the other stacks. Pieces can only be placed on top of bigger sized pieces here. Also, pieces can only be relocated on higher stacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is finished when all the pieces on the board are taken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who took that last piece is the winner in the set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner gains the number of the pieces that he/she took from the board in the turn as his/her score in the set. All the other players score 0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the game is the player who gained the highest score when all the sets are finished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
