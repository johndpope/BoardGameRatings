			<description>Author's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's walk through an example of programming a complete game, including machine language.  We'll make it a simple one: &amp;quot;Bagels,&amp;quot; a guessing game that has appeared under other names, including the commercially packaged game, Master Mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We'll make this one simple, with few frills.  We could do it entirely in BASIC, of course; we're using machine language for the practice and for the thrill of seeing the answers come up instantly.  You can judge for yourself whether or not machine language handles the job more efficiently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Bagel Break was written by Jim Butterfield and published as type-in source code in Compute! Issue 39, August 1983.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program was further elaborated in Bagel Break, Part 2, written by Jim Butterfield and published as type-in source code in Compute! Issue 40, September 1983.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program was enhanced by converting additional portions into machine language in Bagel Break, Part 3, written by Jim Butterfield and published as type-in source code in Compute! Issue 41, October 1983.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
