			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vile Kurosh held the massive and bloodied bone over his head for a moment, muttering dark invocations to even darker deities, and then began to grow. As his form lurched and shifted into something much larger, the bone snapped, showering his golden hair with viscera and marrow. As the bones fell away from his hands, he looked down upon the field of battle, a being twice his normal height.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visceromancy has been called the magic of the flesh. This little known art is not for the squeamish or faint of heart. Those who practice it must be skilled with their hands as well as their minds. Visceromancy allows an individual to mend torn flesh, reattach lost limbs, and to tap into the latent power of a creature's organs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most visceromancers are outcasts living on the fringe of society practicing their art in secret. They are commonly known as butchers and their art outlawed in most kingdoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many such spellcasters have discovered the need to keep thieves and similar lowlifes on their payroll. They need these degenerates to help them with the local law enforcement as well as to help acquire fresh bodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore this dark art in this 6-page mini-PDF expansion to the classic award-nominated book of necromantic magics. This booklet explores two aspects of the art of visceromancy - the art of using the organs of one's foes to manifest unusual magical abilities or to enhance existing spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
