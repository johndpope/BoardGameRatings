			<description>This is a trivia game about knowing or  mostly estimating facts from animal  behaviour and facts of all kind of animality. The game includes 100 cards with 100 Questions and answers (on the back side) and four clips in four colours used as player markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have to estimate facts and behaviours of all kind of animality. There are always 10 different possible answers. Theres a clip for each player to mark their answers on the card. Each spot with an answer can only be taken by one player. When all players made their estimations the card is flipped to the backside with the answer. The player with the correct answer or is closest to it gets the card. If theres a tie the next question/card is worth two cards (the old tied card and the next new card).&lt;br/&gt;The first player with 7 cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
