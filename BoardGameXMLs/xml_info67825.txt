			<description>Decipher was an entry in the 2005 About.com Deduction Game Design Competition. It only uses a standard deck of cards and 6 tokens (pennies, gamecounters, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Can you crack the code in time? In Decipher, you must figure out your opponent's hidden code before they figure out yours. It requires logic, deduction, and strategic cardplay.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game players try to crack the hidden three-card code of their opponent by playing one, two or three cards in front of the hidden code. Your opponent will show you whether your guess was correct or not. If you made a correct guess, you know that you only know half of the truth: was the suit correct or the rank of the card? That's for you to find out before you run out of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
