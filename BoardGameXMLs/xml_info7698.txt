							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zoo Quest</name>
									
			<description>Zoo Quest is set in Africa and based on the UK television* show of the same name, and came out either in the 1950s or 1960s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete at gathering a prize-winning collection of animals, then returning home with their animals via the one international airport on the map. The types of winning collections (and the collection size limits) vary based on the number of players. Easily collected animals offer a smaller bonus than rarer beasts. Event cards and co-location both dictate whether a player successfully captures an animal for his collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a single game, the first player to complete a collection will almost always end up with the most money even with the smallest award -able bonus. However, a series of games can be played which raises the importance of the value of one's collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may travel slowly on foot within a territory, and more quickly all over the board by plane. The more distant the target location, the more expensive the flight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animals may also be sold prior to the end of the game to gain working capital. This is necessary in some cases when a player spends his money flying across the board for a prize animal, only to have another player in the same location draw a &amp;quot;capture&amp;quot; card first from the event card deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the most part, the game is also educational. Each animal card offers background on the particular animal. One exception is the humorous &amp;quot;Lesser-Spotted Swamp Dragon&amp;quot; card added in for a bit of humor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     David Attenborough's TV program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
