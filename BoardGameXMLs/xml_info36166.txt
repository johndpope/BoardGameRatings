			<description>&amp;ldquo;Players are Royal Dukes using political, religious and military influence to gain the most economic control of a disputed region.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 10x10 hex map with 20 Settlements marked on the board. Players draw counters out of a cup and place them on empty squares. The counters are affiliated with one or two types of influence: Religious, Political, and Military. Control of Settlements is established by having the most counters of one type surrounding a settlement. The game ends when there are no empty spaces left on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
