							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great War of Magellan</name>
									
			<description>From cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vast and desolate galaxy of Richard Hatch&amp;rsquo;s new epic Sci-Fi saga, The Great War of Magellan is meticulously captured in this innovative new role playing game produced by DGA Games. The story is incredibly deep and offers a myriad of possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the heart of the Great Magellanic Cloud, an epic war has raged for Millennia. Eons ago the ancients evolved beyond war and self destruction. But they disappeared- a legacy lost - as their descendants turned the cloud into an anvil of chaos and devastation. Some say all hope is lost. But there are whispers of the ancients return... The return of the Trader Clans and one man&amp;rsquo;s journey through hell may reveal the keys to humanity&amp;rsquo;s salvation and the end of the deadly Dru-ack - a race of energy vampires genetically engineered by the nihilistic Nephilim.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything you need to play, GM, and create adventures for the Great War of Magellan is contained in this book. Also included is an interactive CD-Rom containing the full cinematic trailer, a treasure trove of ship and star station maps you can print out yourself, and other computer-driven GM aides that make game mastering a snap!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
