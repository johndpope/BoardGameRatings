							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rubovia Around the Castle Game</name>
									
			<description>Rubovia was a children's television series and this game relates to the characters in the show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RULES:&lt;br/&gt;1. Each player chooses a coloured pawn.&lt;br/&gt;2. To decide who goes first each player turns the spinner. The highest scorer goes first, next one on the left and so on in a clockwise direction.&lt;br/&gt;3. Each taking his turn, the players move along the track from the START by the number of spaces shown by the spinner.&lt;br/&gt;4. When a player stops on a YELLOW or ORANGE square, he must obey the instructions in the panel beside the square.&lt;br/&gt;5. If a player spins a number which takes him to a square already occupied by another player, that player must leave the square and go back three spaces.&lt;br/&gt;6. The player to reach the FINISH first is the winner. He must spin the exact number needed to arrive and must keep spinning in his turn, until he does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information supplied by Telegoons&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
