							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guild Ball: Fisherman Starter Set</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fisherman play style is all about movement and raw goal-scoring potential. They are dominant in the early game and can easily draw one or two goals ahead very quickly. However, mid to late game they need to be wary, especially if they lose a player or two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They excel at movement and kicking the ball - they are practically all about offense. Their combo play revolves around (re)positioning and exploitation of space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whilst not entirely equipped with raw damage soaking defence, they instead have far subtler defensive options that focus much more on space control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They call it the beautiful game for a reason. When the Fishermen take to the pitch, the crowd holds its breath, waiting for that sublime moment of skill; the perfectly measured pass, the volley that ricochets off the goal, the poetry in motion that is a team operating in perfect harmony.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing with the Fishermen's Guild is like mastering the use of a surgical tool. With lightening speed and a penchant for subterfuge, the opposition are left baffled by the wide range of tricks available to a Fishermen's Guild team. With a superstar captain in Shark, a striker beyond compare in Angel, and the mysterious machinations of Siren, Fishermen players can leave their lumbering opponents grasping at air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set provides you with all you need to start playing the Fisherman&amp;rsquo;s Guild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
