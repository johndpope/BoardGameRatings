							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Haunted Manor House</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 1&amp;quot;=5' battle map of a haunted or abandoned manor house.  It could is set in a generic era so that it can be used in a wider range of genres such as fantasy, modern, or something set in the victorian era.  This map could be a house used by a lesser vampire in a Vampire or Ravenloft game, or it could be a house inhabited by a lich, or multiple ghosts.  There are plenty of possibilities!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five different versions of this map, covering 3 different floors.  Other features include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     25&amp;quot;x15&amp;quot; in size.  This is smaller than previous releases, but consider that area doubled as there is a second floor above the first, and an optional basement as well, for a total of 57.5&amp;quot;x40&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;     Abandoned version - An abandoned version of the house is included where all furnishings have been removed and the sense of decay is greater as a result.  There are both day and night versions of the abandoned manor house.&lt;br/&gt;     Inhabited version - A fully furnished version is included, with both night and day maps included.  Though the house does have furnishings, that doesn't mean the house wasn't abandoned by its owners.  Who knows what the undead tenants may have done to scare them off!  Of course, with the night maps, the candelabras are lit, so someone is definitely home.&lt;br/&gt;     Black and White version - There is also a printer friendly black and white version included.&lt;br/&gt;     Included map key to help you understand the command center better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
