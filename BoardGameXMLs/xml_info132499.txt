							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Body Thieves</name>
									
			<description>This set expands the Malifaux universe by adding the Body Thieves crew. This unit includes McMourning (leader), Flesh Construct, Sebastian, 2 nurses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 'good' doctor (McMourning) is very offensively focused, rivaling the offensive punch of Lady Justice and Lilith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though not as versatile as Nicodem, McMourning remains very capable of summoning &amp;quot;frankenstein&amp;quot; themed minions; typically starting with a crew of numerous &amp;quot;little&amp;quot; minions (e.g.: Canine Remains and/or Necropunks) which provide materials to &amp;quot;stitch up&amp;quot; bigger abominations (Flesh Constructs or the rare Rogue Necromancy)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the other Resurrectionists, McMourning doesn't suffer when facing non-living/ undead forces; able to collect &amp;quot;body parts&amp;quot; from a number of sources thanks to his abilities. He is impressively mobile, allowing him to swiftly switch between savage slayer to supportive summoner with some decent speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generally he wants to be just behind the front line where he can apply pressure and aid his own crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: It is recommended to purchase this crew together with the Canine Remains, so that McMourning can evolve these low-cost minions into more expensive and deadly creatures (such as the Flesh Construct)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
