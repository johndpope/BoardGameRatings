			<description>This is a smart pack of cards that includes multiple games in one. Each card shows a number, with different symbols and colours to denote how that number can be achieved. For example, the card for 18 shows a red heart (the game's symbol for 2) and a yellow cat (the symbol for 9), a red and yellow pattern, and eighteen dots arranged in a 2x9 grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New games playable with the pack appear regularly on the website. The base game is a game that helps to learn multiplication tables while playing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
