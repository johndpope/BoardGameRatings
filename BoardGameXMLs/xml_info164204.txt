			<description>This Means War! Is a turn based strategy card game where two to four players battle for supremacy as their city goes to war with neighboring cities. The goal is to either reduce your opponent&amp;rsquo;s city to zero or build your city up to 50. Each player takes turns playing cards to either destroy their opponent&amp;rsquo;s city or empower themselves. Players share a common Deck of Orders cards and take turns playing them, giving them distinct advantages and strategies. This makes the game very easy for players who are just learning, and a tactical challenge for more experienced players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
