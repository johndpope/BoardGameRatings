			<description>See-It? Slam-It! is a fast-paced family card game where players must shout out a word associated with a picture. There are three picture cards showing at all times. A letter card is flipped over and players race to spot something on any one of the cards beginning with that letter. See something!?! Then slam your hand down fast on the card before someone else spots a match. For example, the three picture cards shown are of pears, a cactus, and a shark jumping out of a pail. You flip over the letter card and it's a &amp;quot;P&amp;quot;. Now slam your hand quick on one of the picture cards and make a connection to the letter, &amp;quot;P&amp;quot;. You could slam the cactus and say, &amp;quot;prickly&amp;quot;! BAM! There you go! You saw it, you slammed it. Now you know how to play See-It? Slam It! Get ready for a fun game of speed and observation! Description from Amazon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
