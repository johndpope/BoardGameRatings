			<description>The players move their pawns around the board. Movement is determined by a die. Each player controls two character cards (one male and one female) with different relation factors and special abilities. If the relation factors of the two cards complement each other, the player gets money, when he gets on a space &amp;quot;Beziehung&amp;quot;. If not, he loses money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On some spaces the players can buy or sell oil wells or draw event-cards. If a player gets on a space &amp;quot;Zentrum der Macht&amp;quot; he gets the corresponding card, which grants special advantages. The player keeps the card till he loses it or another player takes it. If a player gets on a character-space for a character he doesn't own, he has to swap the character for his own card of the same gender with the owner of that character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to own $ 3000000 wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
