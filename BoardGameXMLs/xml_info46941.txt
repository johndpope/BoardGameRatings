			<description>Mary Penny Lane game based on a pub game from Liverpool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses two pieces that are wooden squares with two threads through them. At the ends of the threads are wooden pieces with a number. The pieces move like that in other Wittig game like Ranina or Mein Kleiner Frosch will zum Teich. But unlike those games, rather than basing the movement on dice rolls, this game is based on blind bids using coins by the players. The game works best when played by two players and a host, and the winner takes all the coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
