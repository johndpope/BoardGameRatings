			<description>In this roll-to-move game, players are competing to get the best possible jobs. The first player to get a combination of jobs that pays $3,000 per month, without exceeding 200 working hours, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play: On a player's turn they roll the dice and move the appropriate number of spots around the board. The player then picks up the job card corresponding to the spot they landed on, and place the card in front of them. The player then records the amount of hours worked, and earns the income from the job. It is then the next player's turn. This repeats until one player has accumulated enough jobs to earn $3,000 per month, without exceeding 200 working hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player gets a new job card that would put them over 200 hours worked, they need to either discard the card, or replace one of their other job cards with the new card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, after rolling their dice but before moving, a player can try to gamble to try and steal someone else's job. If the player decides to gamble, they re-roll the dice and attempt to get the same result. For example, if the die roll of the their first roll was 8, then they would try to re-roll the dice to get 8 again. If they are successful, they can take any job card from any other player. If they are not successful, then they must pay a penalty fee to the &amp;quot;Employment Pot&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules suggest that any penalty paid to the &amp;quot;Employment Pot&amp;quot; should be paid with real money, and the winner of the game gets to keep any money in the &amp;quot;Employment Pot.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
