			<description>Script is the third of the small box games published by Pseudon and is noted with &amp;quot;#3&amp;quot; on the spine, and it is a word game. The game consists of a set of letter tiles each with a number, as in Scrabble. The unique thing about the game is that over the course of the game players must come up with 20 words each beginning with a different letter of the alphabet, and all the words must be different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
