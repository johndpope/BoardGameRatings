			<description>In this game, each player wears a vinyl headband which holds two cards. The cards form a two-digit number, and the object of the game is to guess the number on your head. This is done by calling out numbers and having the other players tell you &amp;quot;high&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;low,&amp;quot; with the information being tracked on a vinyl board. A round is won by the first person to guess their number, and the first person to win three rounds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
