			<description>It's been 6 months since Dubai was wiped off the map by a cataclysmic sandstorm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the world's most fantastical city, Dubai is now its most opulent ruin. Ravaged by cataclysmic sandstorms, the city lies buried, reclaimed by the desert. Abandoned, it has become a no-man's-land for refugees and outlaws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While most people fled the now-barren wasteland, U.S. Army Colonel John Konrad and the 33rd Infantry remained behind to protect those incapable of escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unable to contact anyone in Dubai, the world believed Konrad and his team dead, until they picked up a weak distress signal. As Captain Walker, you and your squad of Delta Operators infiltrate the treacherous region to locate survivors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There, you and your men will experience madness - A world shattered by the failings of great men. You will face an enemy you were never trained to fight - Fellow soldiers prepared to accept the consequences of their actions. You will walk a line - That razor-thin edge separating your mission from your duty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no escape from Dubai. It is the end - of honor and duty - when the storm has stripped you to the bone and only The Line remains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
