			<description>Implementing a deck of cards, some dice and a pocketful of loose change, take control of a Zombie Horde and work to overrun a Survivor Safehouse before you are exterminated!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The solo player divides a standard playing card deck into face cards and number cards, dealing relevant cards into piles representing the Survivors and their Safehouse, Items, and Zombies.  The player, as the Zombies, then attacks the Survivors in an attempt to wear their numbers down until no Survivors remain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a game of chance and skill, and very portable.  Check out the files section for the full extended rules, a quick-reference printable version (which folds up to fit in your pack of cards), and an extraneous (but helpful) flowchart of gameplay (because flowcharts make the world a better place.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relatively recently added: Alternate card faces for all numbered cards representing both items and zombies, as well as zombified jacks, queens, kings, aces and jokers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
