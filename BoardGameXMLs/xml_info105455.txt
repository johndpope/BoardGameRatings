			<description>The Birds and the Bees II: Antics was a computer game released for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. Boris the Bee was kidnapped by a group of anti-social Chavs and his cousin Barnabee must rescue him. The player must travel through an underground ant complex; which has four different entrances into the above-ground world. Ants must be avoided; as they force the player to lose strength. Pollen must be accessed through flowers in order to gain lost strength. The general arrangement of the game is a maze; flowers will remove barriers elsewhere in the complex. The individual screens are also self-contained mazes. Each screen may have more than one exit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Birds and the Bees II: Antics&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
