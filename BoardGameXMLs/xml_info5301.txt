							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1876 Centennial Baseball</name>
									
			<description>A unique game based on the early (c. 1860-1890) days of baseball. Games can be played with generic players or with the ratings for the 1876 National League.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is simple, with each player rolling a die, applying individual player modifiers for the pitcher and batter, and then consulting a chart to arrive at an outcome of the at bat. If a &amp;quot;hit ball&amp;quot; results, then another die roll comparison is made between the batter/runner and the fielder the ball is hit to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some cases, a play will be resolved after consulting a card that also describes an event in 19th century baseball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components are of high quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
