			<description>Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who Farted?  Combining fun with improving your memory, Monster Fart is a unique and intuitive game that is NOT vulgar.  Yes, now you no longer have to Fart around by yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster Fart is actually 3 Games in 1!  Hold your nose while you and these cute 3D Monsters go through the Main Game of Stinky, Toxic, Nuclear and Fatal, which have a total of 40 levels to test even the strongest nose. If your nose can&amp;rsquo;t handle all the stink of the main game, move on to the Fart Tournament which is a 60 second memory Fart contest.  If all that stink has given you brain damage, click on &amp;ldquo;Free Fart&amp;rdquo; which lets you make your favorite Monsters Fart anyway you like!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster Fart is fun by yourself or with friends and family. Perfect for ages 4 and up.  Monster Fart not only helps your memory and concentration but will keep you busy figuring out, Who Farted?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
