			<description>Brain To Go is a series of games developed by game designers and neuroscientists in which players challenge their episodic memory, that is, their memory of recent personal events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Gans sch&amp;ouml;n verd&amp;auml;chtig, players need to identify a burglar hiding in a crowd. What did the culprit look like? What color were their clothes? And what animal accomplices did they have? Number cards from 1-6 lie on the table, with a suspect card next to each number. Players look at these cards, then turn them face down. On a turn, a player rolls the two dice: one showing a number, the other a characteristic of a burglar card. If the player can identify the correct item on the correct burglar card, they claim that card as a reward, then put a new card in its place. Whoever collects the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
