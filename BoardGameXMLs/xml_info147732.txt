			<description>Muzicando is a card game about the rainbow colors and about musical instruments and notes. The deck consist of 56 cards 8 for each color of the rainbow. 7 cards have the musical notes from DO to TI and the eighth card is a representing a special personality like one of the followings:&lt;br/&gt;Guido d'Arezzo, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Franz Liszt, Ludwig van Beethoven, Frederic Francois Chopin, Johann Sebastian Bach and Niccolo Paganini.&lt;br/&gt;Guido d'Arezzo was a music theorist of the Medieval era. He is regarded as the inventor of modern musical notation (staff notation) that replaced neumatic notation and thus he is the most powerfull card in the game causing all the players to skip a turn when played giving an aditional turn to the one who played it. The other personalities are some of the best composers of clasical music and when played are causing some players to skip a turn,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal in this game is to be the first to get rid of all the cards. The mechanism to get rid of them is to put them on the table in turns in some ways that depends of an auction made in the first phase of the game. The players can bid for on of the 4 ways to display the cards on the table. These are  Sarabanda, Glissando, Parada and Muzicando.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
