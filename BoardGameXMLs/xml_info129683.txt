			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sanctuary has fallen and the characters are on the run from Edward Russo and his army of the Living Dead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Facing a grueling battle against a seemingly endless wave of Ragers that broke through the defenses of the UniMed safe zone, the characters were forced to make difficult choices as it became obvious that there weren't enough resources to evacuate every resident from Sanctuary. A place that was supposed to give safety and security turned out to be a final tomb for far too many.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the road once again, the group needed a plan to gather enough supplies and fuel to make it to the Federal Government's Citizen Relocation Zone in Colorado. With Abrams tanks in the newly minted convoy, they hit the nearby military base- the exact base the characters raided to rescue Samantha and Selina from the outlaw raiders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
