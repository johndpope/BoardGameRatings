			<description>This is a strategy game for 2-8 racers.  The game aims to tell the &amp;quot;story&amp;quot; of Le Mans in 4 sets of races (rounds).  There are 246 cards that tell the store of the race and allow the players to move their cars along the track.  Each racer also has an endurance and various penalties can show up that will reduce their endurance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You collect cards on your turn (6 cards max in your hand) and try to collect 3-5 cards from the same family; this will give you a bonus in your move or give you additional endurance to last longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also play on teams, with drivers on the same team, taking a team counter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are in both French and English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games was published in conjunction with the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
