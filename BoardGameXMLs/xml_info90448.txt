							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">WWF WrestleMania 2000</name>
									
			<description>WWF WrestleMania 2000 is a professional wrestling video game released in 1999 on the Nintendo 64 (N64) console. It was based on the World Wrestling Federation's annual pay-per-view, WrestleMania. The game was released at the height of the WWF's Attitude Era, and marked the start of THQ's relationship with the WWF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was succeeded by WWF No Mercy in 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its Japanese counterpart was Virtual Pro Wrestling 2: Ōdō Keishō.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WrestleMania 2000 used the engine previously seen in WCW/nWo Revenge. More than 50 WWF wrestlers were included in the game, and, with the exception of existing superstars' move sets, all of them could be edited to the player's liking. Using the same system, the Create-a-Wrestler mode was extensive. The player was able to create a highly detailed wrestler, and there was an extensive library of wrestling moves. Usual WWF modes such as Royal Rumble and King of the Ring modes were included, along with a pay-per-view mode, enabling the player to either recreate or create unique PPVs with TV-style features. Players could also create up to ten belts and then put them on the line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story mode placed the player on the long road to WWF glory. Starting out as a rookie, the player would gradually work his way up the ladder and earn opportunities to gain various WWF titles, win various tournaments, be challenged by various wrestlers and ultimately main-event at WrestleMania 2000. Although the story mode was long and extensive in the amount of matches it pitted the player in, there were no branching story lines and if the player lost a match it was recorded as a loss in their win-loss record. In fact, wrestlers were expected to defend each title in Pay-Per-View events. For example, if you held the European Championship, Intercontinental Championship, WWF Tag Team Championship, and the WWF Title, the player would have to fight four fights in one pay-per-view, something that would be unrealistic in real-life. There were often feuds at different parts in the storyline, occasionally with one wrestler calling out another wrestler in the middle of the ring. Also, feuding wrestlers would often interrupt matches, helping the opponent. However, the season continues whether or not you win or lose your matches. If the player progresses through a winning season with a created wrestler and then starts a new season as a new created wrestler, the first character will still be used in season mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;WWF Wrestlemania 2000,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
