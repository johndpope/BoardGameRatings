			<description>War Inc. Battle Zone delivers hard hitting combat action to you in a free to play, online multiplayer, session-based shooter game, where you will compete with your friends and other players in real time, action packed team vs. team ground combat. All for Free! You can take it slow and easy, or rock as hard as you want to!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War Inc. Battle Zone is set in a world where Mercenary and Paramilitary Commando Units rule the day. Some had said that 2012 wasn't the end of the world, but it damn near might as well have been. The global economic chaos that started in 2008 had run rampant for almost 4 years. National fortunes were squandered and lost. International trade turned into international hostility and deprivation. A number of Nations disintegrated into anarchy and civil war as all out conflict broke out between various Nations. International corporate powers emerged with in different countries, demanding controls and powers from spineless government officials and a bad situation simply got worse. Death, Famine, Pestilence, and War spread as if the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse had actually been released from the Gates of Hell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Onto this stage of conflict and chaos there emerged a growing need for Mercenary Units and Paramilitary Command Units who could execute orders and carry out fast assignments for governments and corporations, allowing the employers plausible deniability as well as the ability to say that they were in no way involved with certain &amp;ldquo;Black Operations&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Pirate Like Undertakings&amp;rdquo;. The new age of the Mercenary had dawned and with it, ruthless Men and Women took on combat and bloody warfare for assets, money, and power. Units and Unions were formed and broken as Clan like structures and Shadow Organizations emerged to be major players in the events that played out on the Global Stage. In War Inc. Battle Zone you are a member of one of these Units. Can you survive? Can you win? Can you take your game to the top?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;This is a free 3rd person shooter, where you can earn gold and XP while playing. You start with 1 'kit' (for instance: sniper) and can purchase new equipment, weapons, abilities and looks (even your ingame head) by spending gold or in the store. Earning gold however, is a labour intensive job and of course it's much faster to spend real dollars on the gear. Prices range from a few dollars to dozens of bucks for 1 complete kit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
