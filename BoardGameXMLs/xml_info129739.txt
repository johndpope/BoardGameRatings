			<description>Object: The object of the game is to travel from Pasedena, through the many challenges of life as a genius, and ultimately arrive in the Nomination Zone, where you might just win as Emmy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Begin: Play &amp;quot;Rock, paper Scissors, Lizard, Spock&amp;quot; to determine who goes first (scissors cut paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons spock, spock vaporizes rock, rock crushes scissors). Each player takes a turnspinning the wheel and moving forward the number of spaces the spinner lands on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning The Game: The first player to reach the Emmy nomination zone wins the game and has bragging rights for one year. They must attend all parties and pose for red-carpet photos. There are no guarantees that the funniest player will win the game, or that the winner will win again next time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
