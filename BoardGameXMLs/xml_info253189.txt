							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Supervillain: This Galaxy Is Mine! â€“ Henchmen expansion</name>
									
			<description>I love minions. They are indispensable cogs in the machine of my villainous ambitions. But in fact, they aren&amp;rsquo;t too smart. You have to watch the minions all the time &amp;ndash; otherwise they would screw-up everything. I got really tired and sick of this. I wish I had loyal assistants able to chasten the minions, twist the Asteroids&amp;rsquo; tails, and bring me coffee in bed... well, perhaps, that&amp;rsquo;s not necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But in our Galaxy everybody having a head on the shoulders fancies himself a Villain. Where to find quick-witted servants? Luckily, the League of Villains has come to aid just in time. They have assembled a Portal to another dimension inhabited by best Henchmen in the universe and vowed to open it once per season. I hope they are not lying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, all I can do now is wait! And rig the Portal with explosives, of course. To prevent other Villains from laying hands on what is rightfully mine!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Henchmen are head and shoulders above ordinary Minions. In the hands of a skilled Villain, each Henchman is able to reverse the course of the intergalactic battle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the beginning of the game, you shuffle Unstable Portal card with the Domination deck &amp;ndash; together with Secret Facilities. Sooner or later, some player draws Unstable Portal card from the Domination deck. When this finally happens, each Villain takes a Henchman card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Henchman card includes three abilities to choose from. You can play any of those &amp;ndash; but only one. Then the Henchman card is put to the Henchmen discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two upper abilities of a Henchman card are played strictly in accordance with the Minion Ops rules. Furthermore, this is considered playing Minion Ops. Therefore, during your turn, you may either play one of the two upper Henchman&amp;rsquo;s abilities or a regular Minion Ops. And of course, any number of Swift Minion Ops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As for the lower ability on a Henchman card &amp;mdash; it is played as Swift Minion Ops. It's much weaker than any of the two upper abilities, yet comes handy sometimes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
