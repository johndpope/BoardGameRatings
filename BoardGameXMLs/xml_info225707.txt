							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stages of Power: Marlowe and Shakespeare, 1592</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is October 1592. Christopher Marlowe, the most accomplished playwright in London, has written The Massacre at Paris for his company, the Lord Admiral&amp;rsquo;s Men. Bubonic plague has hit outlying parishes, forcing theaters to close and postponing the season. Ordinarily, the Rose Theatre would debut Marlowe&amp;rsquo;s work, but its subject&amp;mdash;the St. Bartholomew Day&amp;rsquo;s Massacre&amp;mdash;is unpleasant and might inflame hostilities against Catholics and their sympathizers, such as merchants on whom trade depends. A new company, the Lord Strange&amp;rsquo;s Men, boasts a young writer, William Shakespeare, who is said to have several barnburners in the queue. A competition is called to decide which company will reopen the theaters. Who will most effectively represent the nation&amp;rsquo;s ideals and energies, its humor and grandeur? One troupe will gain supremacy, primarily for literary but also for cultural, religious, and political reasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
