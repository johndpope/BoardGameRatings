			<description>Ostesibly a 3-handed analog of Camelot, this game bares some resemblance to Cam in that it has a single goal each player must protect. Additionally the board is markedly different than any game in the Camelot family and uses hexagons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a three-handed pure abstract. Each player protects a single goal space from both opponents. In spite of the name, this game is a three-handed version of Cam, not Camelot in that the first first to enter a goal wins and so ends the game. Often this means that a player can block one but not both opponents. Hence these games can end suddenly and kingmaking can be involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
