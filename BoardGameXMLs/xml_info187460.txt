							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reapers</name>
									
			<description>Reapers is a role-playing game for 3-8 people, but it is recommended for groups of 4-5 players.  This game is entirely GMless and relies heavily on narration and cooperation between players.  All you need to play is a deck of tarot cards (or regular playing cards, jokers removed) and a notecard for each player to write down information about their character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your friends play Reapers: individuals who have discovered that they possess a unique ability to sense each other&amp;rsquo;s emotional states and help one another by projecting their own skills or guidance onto another Reaper in need.  You will narrate a story of individuals facing their own obstacles and fears, and, together, you will find that the strength and support of your friends can help you overcome anything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
