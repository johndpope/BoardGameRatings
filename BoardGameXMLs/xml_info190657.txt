			<description>Rise and Fall is based in the first millennium BC, and features four playable civilizations: Persia, Greece, Egypt, and Rome. The game includes over eighty civilization-unique military units, as well as eight &amp;quot;hero&amp;quot; units&amp;mdash;of which only one may be purchased during a game. In Rise and Fall, there are two campaigns: one follows the conquests of Alexander the Great; and the other, the fictional liberation of Egypt by Cleopatra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Rise and Fall: Civilizations at War&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
