							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NBA Street</name>
									
			<description>NBA Street is a basketball video game developed by EA Canada. It was released in 2001 for the PlayStation 2 and in 2002 for the GameCube. It combines the talent and big names of the NBA with the attitude and atmosphere of streetball. NBA Street was followed by NBA Street Vol. 2, NBA Street V3, and NBA Street Homecourt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NBA Street consisted of three-on-three basketball games. Asides from the basic structure of basketball, players try to collect trick points, which are scored through the use of almost every basketball game maneuver such as faking out defenders, shot blocking, diving for the ball, and dunking. If a team fills a special meter through flashy and effective gameplay, they get to perform a Gamebreaker, which is a special shot that not only adds to their score, but it subtracts an amount from their opponents' score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single player options included a user-created player touring famous American locations, picking up teammates from NBA rosters along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay could be considered an &amp;quot;arcade&amp;quot; style of basketball in that it is not a true simulation, similar to the NBA Jam series. For instance, in-game players were able to jump high enough to grab three-point shots mid-arc (goaltending is permitted and is often used as a defensive strategy). Games on the default setting are scored not by traditional standards, as two-point field goals are worth one point, while made shots behind the three-point line rewarded two points. Instead of a time limit, the first team to score a predetermined amount of points were deemed the winner. However, variant options existed, such as matches based on trick points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;NBA Street&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
