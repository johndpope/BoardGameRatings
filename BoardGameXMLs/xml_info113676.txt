			<description>In Bring Me Sandwiches!! the world finds itself at the mercy of a ruthless alien invader with only one weakness: his love for sandwiches! In this unique puzzle-platform hybrid players take control of timid fast food worker Jimmy Nugget, who unexpectedly encounters the hungry alien while taking out the trash. Jimmy must satisfy the invader&amp;rsquo;s immense interstellar appetite by traversing across obstacle-filled environments and making sandwiches from anything within reach, including garbage, appliances, and even pedestrians!&lt;br/&gt;     Along the way Jimmy will be on the look-out for special menu requests that take the form of scavenger hunts, and even alien technology that can power up his sandwiches! Bring Me Sandwiches!! features over two dozen challenging stages, customizable tilt and digital button control options, and completely crazy-unique gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
