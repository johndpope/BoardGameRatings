							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City Life</name>
									
			<description>City Life continues the very long tradition of city-building and construction and management games, that was originally started by Utopia from developer Don Daglow and Will Wright's SimCity series by allowing the player to customize their urban city's roads, buildings, finances, ordinances and much more. City Life utilizes a three dimensional game engine in displaying cities, and also includes the requirement to satisfy six different socioeconomic groups within the city, an essential part of gameplay. The six groups include the Elites, Suits, Radical Chics, Fringe, Blue collars and Have-Nots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;City Life 2008&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
