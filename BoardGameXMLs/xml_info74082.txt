							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Treasure Island Dizzy</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Treasure Island Dizzy was the second game in the Dizzy series, and is the sequel to Dizzy - The Ultimate Cartoon Adventure. The game was developed by the Oliver Twins with graphics being designed by Neil Adamson and music by David Whittaker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is quite different from its predecessor, with a new inventory system and improved animations. The game notably contains fewer enemies than the previous title. It is more centred around inventory based problem solving. The aim of the game is to solve various puzzles in order to obtain a boat so that Dizzy can return to his friends and family, the Yolkfolk. To do this Dizzy must journey through haunted mines, tree villages, as well as underwater. The game also features a subquest (albeit one essential to completing the game) in which thirty gold coins must be collected. Such subquests were found in many of the sequels.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Treasure_Island_Dizzy,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
