			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Z.H.P. presents the story of the Unlosing Ranger and his quest to save the world from Darkdeath Evilman. After accidentally being hit by a car on his way to defeat DarkDeath Evilman, Unlosing Ranger passes his powers on to a naive everyman who himself promptly is defeated by DarkDeath. Rather than dying, he is transported to an alternate Earth (Bizarro Earth) where the spirit of Unlosing Ranger guides him through quests and dungeons so that he may level up sufficiently to return to Earth and defeat Darkdeath Evilman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
