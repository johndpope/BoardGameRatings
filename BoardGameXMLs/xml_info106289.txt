			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revenge is sweet when it's the life of your lover at stake...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the vile sorceror, Hexa&amp;auml;, had tortured your beloved partner to near death, you awake the magic of your grandfather's talisman to summon the forces of light to help you defeat the sorceror and find a life-saving antidote. You are Ikuro and you are the only one who can commit the necessary deeds - live off your wits, live off your instinct but most of all, live off your sacred love for Yuri.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the ancient talisman transforms you into a beautiful bee, such beauty is darkened by the burning passion to hurt, maim and destroy Hexa&amp;auml; and his evil army of insects and wildlife. Your insect bite is deadly... but are you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Superb horizontally scrolling shoot'em-up.&lt;br/&gt;     Gameplay over 5 fantastic worlds.&lt;br/&gt;     Incredibly Large end of level guardians.&lt;br/&gt;     Power-up with missiles, bombs, automated clones... the list is almost endless.&lt;br/&gt;     Simultaneous two player action!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apidya - A genuinely mind-blowing experience!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
