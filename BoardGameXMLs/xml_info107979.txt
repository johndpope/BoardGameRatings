							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Manga Party</name>
									
			<description>Manga Party comes with two copies of 26 cards (one with red back, one with beige) that each feature a scene drawn manga-style; it's up to the players to bring the party!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up the game, the 26 beige cards are laid face-up on the table. Three red-backed &amp;quot;mime&amp;quot; cards are shuffled with the 26 red-backed scene cards to form a deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, the active player draws the top card from the deck, then acts out a scene, complete with whatever thoughts, cries, declarations, etc. best fit the word bubble or thought bubble on the card. The other players race to identify which beige card matches the scene being acted out. Each player can choose only one card, and no card can be chosen more than once. If the correct card is chosen, the guesser scores the beige card and the actor keeps the red card; otherwise both scene cards are removed from the game and the actor takes the &amp;quot;Malus&amp;quot; card (whether from the table or another player).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player draws a Mime card, he discards it, draws the next card, and acts out the scene but without any dialogue or sounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when either two beige cards remain on the table or after the third Mime card has been resolved. Players scores one point per card collected, with the holder of the Malus card losing one point. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
