			<description>&amp;quot;Jason! I know you're there!&amp;quot; Hector's voice echoed across the valley. &amp;quot;You can hide behind your goblins and skeletons, but I know you're there, and I am coming for you!&amp;quot; He knew Jason could hear him, and he knew that his arch-enemy could not resist such a challenge. But how would he respond?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The answer wasn't long in coming. A huge boulder sailed across the valley and smashed into the ground just short of Hector's forces. One of his men went down screaming, hit by a sliver of rock. So Jason had a cyclops in his army, did he? Hector looked over to his minotaurs, roaring and waving their battleaxes. They would make short work of a cyclops, and then his ogres would begin the slaughter. He gave the hand signals for his line of mighty beasts to advance. This would be a day to remember!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If he had noticed the shadow that flitted over him, he might have looked up and seen Jason's roc beginning its dive on his forces...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythfire is a 2-player wargame of mythical beasts, mostly from Greek mythology. Players choose their armies from an array of creatures with varying abilities, then fight to the death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
