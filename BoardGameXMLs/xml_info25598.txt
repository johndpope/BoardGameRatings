							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stagecoach</name>
									
			<description>The players are Pony Express riders.  They are competing against the Stagecoach Line in order to obtain a contract to carry gold shipments from the small western towns to Carson City.  The players and the Stagecoach all start from the same point and move along the various trails trying to be the first to reach a town and collect the gold to take to Carson City.  If the Stagecoach reaches a town first it will pick up the gold and the Pony Express riders will have to try to get to the next town before the Stagecoach.  The winner will be the first player to collect three gold shipments and get them to Carson City before the Stagecoach arrives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
