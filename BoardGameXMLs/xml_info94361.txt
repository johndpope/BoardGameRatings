			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;McGuire - an investment and expansion strategy game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;McGuire is a variation of Acquire by Sid Sackson. It is a classic board game stock market game where businesses are created by laying tiles on a board, then shares are bought. When businesses merge, one is acquired by the other, and majority stock holders get bonuses. Early in the game you want your business to be acquired when you are majority stock holder, and late in the game you want to be majority stock holder of the largest businesses, all the while managing your cash flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The iOS version McGuire is by Andrew Williams and Smuggly Systems Intergalactic.&lt;br/&gt;It is single player vs. 3 computer players and does support Game Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
