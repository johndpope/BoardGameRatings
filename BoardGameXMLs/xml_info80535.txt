			<description>From the Publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the nature of machines to break down and malfunction. The GhÅ«l Collective is seeking experienced scavengers to undertake a mission of great importance to an old military base in the Northern reaches of California to retrieve some technical components. Do you have what it takes to salvage pre-Exodus technology from an unknown military installation? It is recommended to have at least one character with Technical skill in this scenario. Seeds of Memory is an Exodus OPS campaign scenario for 4 to 6 characters of 2nd to 5th level and can easily be adapted to other post-apocalytic settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario has been updated from the original to reflex the new Experience system used in the Exodus OPS campaign. OPS players that have already played this scenario, cannot re-play it, or gain any benefits from the changes within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
