			<description>Paranoia is a game of tiles fast-paced and furious. And that happens because there are no turns. As in a discussion without a moderator, where no one respects the word and all speak at once, in Paranoia all play at once. But, in the middle of this whirlpool, there are rules that everyone must respect and give the game a fair balance between the noise and reflection, between order and chaos ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initially, all players receive 10 hexagonal tiles and they must put them in their stand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to be the first to play all your pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
