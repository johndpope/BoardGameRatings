							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">La Chasse au Mammouth</name>
									
			<description>La Chasse au Mammouth (=Hunt for Mammoths) was published in the Swiss gaming zine &amp;quot;AHA/Der Schwarze Peter&amp;quot; #88/4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows a glacier with 6 mammoth trails and several human trails crossing them. Player camps, weapon directory, and storehouses are also on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to 2 Mammoth herds (4 at the start of the game) enter the board every turn and travel along their trails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 20 tribesmen and 5 x 5 weapons of 5 different types. The well armed tribesmen go out to hunt some mammoths, which are needed to feed the population. The weapons used to kill a mammoth are removed from the game, that is they represent more a consumable arrow than an bow, that can be used all the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every second turn, it is checked to see how many tribesmen can be fed  (with half a mammoth per man).  Men who are not fed are flipped over and all their abilities are halved for the next turn. Subsequent non-feeding will result in the elimination of the men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While hunting mammoths is relatively easy at the start of the game, it gets harder and harder, because players must manufacture new weapons and pitfalls and thus only some of the men can be used for hunting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends, when the first player has lost all tribesmen. Winner is the player who has the most surviving men on the board at that time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
