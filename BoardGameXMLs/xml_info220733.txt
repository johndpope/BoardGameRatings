							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Raven</name>
									
			<description>A classic trick-taking, bid-making card game for contemplative players. This medieval-themed game combines elements of collusion, misdirection, risk taking and deduction. Successful players must manage the tension and uncertainty surrounding 4 Specialists, including the powerful Raven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with 56 suited cards &amp;mdash; Shields, Swords, Axes, and Waters numbered 1 (low) to 14 (high) and 4 special cards (specialists).  Each hand features a different trump suit.  Players must sacrifice cards from their hands to bid the number of tricks they will take.  Each suit conveys a bid value:  0, 1, 2, or 3.  The suit (not the rank) of the cards chosen determines how many tricks the player must take. Score 1 point per trick taken, plus a bonus for an exact bid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specialists are:  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Raven &amp;mdash;  the highest trump&lt;br/&gt;        Wolf &amp;mdash; the highest non-trump&lt;br/&gt;        Shaman &amp;mdash; a half-step higher than the card it immediately follows&lt;br/&gt;        Dwarf &amp;mdash; the lowest card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player tries to take (win) the exact number of tricks bid.  Deception and collusion are allowed and include saying:  how many tricks you bid; what cards you hold; that you want a particular trick; that you won&amp;rsquo;t take a trick; and lying about any or all of these things.  You can say what you like, but you cannot show your cards before you play them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card play mechanics are typical for the trick-taking family of games: The player left of the dealer leads.  Play proceeds clockwise.  A player who can follow suit must either (1) follow suit or (2) play a specialist. A player who cannot follow suit may play any card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points after 8 hands wins. In case of a tie, the player (of those tied) who earned the most bonuses is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
