It is inspired by saturday morning cartoons featuring fantasy characters as well as the same superhero ethos that inspired 4C itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Foresee Alpha features a very large expanded character creation, expanded combat, and rules for a variety of odd or awesome thngs needed to run a light touch but superheroic fantasy game - traps, monsters, vehicles, ranged and melee items, quite a bit of useful text and inspiration and several additions to the basic 4C approach including social status modifiers for Repute, a Fame statistic, an Anti-Magic statistic, Shadow elemental effects and many new powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also features a complete set of Magic options including High Sorcery, Chaos Magic, Wild Magic effect based on Fortune use, Schools of Magic which reflect the classical idea of a Wizard learning spells, Black Magic and Witches &amp;amp; Warlocks who can Grant people's Wishes much as in the classic 1960s television series or in many works of fiction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is left open for YOU to create but there is a lot of built-in information ready to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
