							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Galactic Attack</name>
									
			<description>Bagged game.  From the bag cover:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You are the Commander of the United States Space Forces Galactic Fleet.  Recent intelligence reports state that the enemy have deployed an armada in a nearby solar system.  Your mission is to push back the advancing fleets and repel the enemy forces.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A low-complexity game of ship-to-ship combat and planet occupation between identical forces approaching each other from opposite ends of a map representing a star system.  The map has a square grid superimposed, and movement is orthogonal.  On a turn, a player rolls two dice and may make as many moves with any number of ships as he wishes, up to the total value of the two dice, but not to exceed the value of one of the dice in the movement of any, single ship.  Unit types are troopers, fighters, transports, and mines.  Fighters automatically eliminate troop ships; fighter vs. fighter is determined by high roller.  Troops are carried by troopships, and may be dropped on planets; combat on planets is resolved as with fighters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two sheets combine to form a 22&amp;quot;x16&amp;quot; mapboard.  121 thin counters are perforated for separation.  Two dice are also included.  A limited set of advanced rules are also provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
