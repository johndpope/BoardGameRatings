			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As we begin a new century, many of us are looking back to a period that ended as the last century began. Viewed through goggles of brass and leather, the Victorian period can look like a lost golden age - a time of excitement and adventure, opportunity and possibility. Writers, artists, film-makers (and gamers) have all revisited the speculative fiction of that period, mining it for ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steampunk writers and artists have taken the worlds of Jules Verne, H.G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs (among others) and created new works based on the tropes and themes that these authors used, but viewed through modern eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the FATE system (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.faterpg.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.faterpg.com&lt;/a&gt;). This supplement contains additional rules to tailor the game to the steampunk genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as the rules, this book also contains a history of the steampunk genre of fiction, the early science fiction works that inspired them and an exploration of their influence on today's society. This genre is about looking as honestly as possible at one of the most important periods in the history of our species. Hopefully, this will help you, the GM, to create worlds that celebrate the best aspects of our Victorian ancestors while not shying away from the worst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you don't want to use this game, the information will be useful for any tabletop campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note: some artwork depicts partial nudity, if you are offended by this do not buy this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
