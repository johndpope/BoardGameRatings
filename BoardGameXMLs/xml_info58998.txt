			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A FREE Adventure for 5th-Level Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The village of Belleron lies west of the Harrowdeep and east of the Bitter Peaks. When the giants warred with the dramojh, they fought a great battle near the village. Many heroes among the giants fell in the struggle, and they were buried in stone barrows nearby. The villagers of Belleron, overjoyed at their liberation, swore an oath to watch over these graves and let none disturb them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year the people of Belleron have renewed this promise to keep the graves safe from robbers. They perform a ritual to swear on oath upon an object called the oathsphere, a metal orb scribed with runes of vigilance, fidelity, and debt. This sphere remains within the main barrow and serves as a potent symbol of the village&amp;rsquo;s oath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, that oath has been broken. A treacherous harrid and the villainous Order of the Broken Blade broke into the burial mound and stole the item. With the barrows violated and their oath broken, the villagers are doomed unless someone can recover the oathsphere and repair the pact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure, which debuted as a tournament at Gen Con Indy 2004, is designed for 5th-level characters using the Monte Cook&amp;rsquo;s Arcana Unearthed variant player&amp;rsquo;s handbook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Run The Severed Oath at a convention, as a demo game, or as a one-shot for your gaming group. The free 25-page downloadable file contains the adventure plus battle sheets for the DM and six optional pregenerated characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available for download here: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.montecook.com/cgi-bin/page.cgi?otherd20_thestuff_81&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.montecook.com/cgi-bin/page.cgi?otherd20_thestuff_...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
