			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Kickstarter Page:Project: Dark is an umbrella term for one endeavor that encompasses several game worlds in the same style: stealth-adventure games for tabletop roleplaying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the way, I've cultivated a few different worlds to explore. This fundraising campaign starts with one of them &amp;mdash; the core, fantastical game world of Dark &amp;mdash; and expands out to include other settings, if you like. They all use the same main game rules and emphasize the same focus on stealth and intrigue but each world puts that central play activity into different contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays wonderfully with even just a single player and a gamemaster (GM). With one or two players, it feels like an infiltration game about sneaking into forbidden places and capturing loot or secrets. With more players &amp;mdash; I play it with up to 4, plus a GM &amp;mdash; it sometimes feels more like a fantastical heist, with lots of moving parts and a delicate balance between plans and opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark adventures can take the form of detailed environments, with pre-written conversations to overhear, or they can be randomly built by the GM as you play, using dice to inform the environment and determine the threats to the players' characters. The Dark text contains complete guidelines on both kinds of play &amp;mdash; and I look forward to offering complete and detailed adventures for the game(s) throughout the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The worlds of Project: Dark are built to emphasize the dramatic and gameplay potential in playing thieves, spies, intruders, and trespassers in perilous worlds. Some adventures are about petty thievery &amp;mdash; but sometimes this is a game about revolutionary skullduggery, internecine intrigue, shadowing enemies, and changing the world. Will your tales be gritty sagas of street-level survival or sordid crime epics about nefarious antiheroes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
