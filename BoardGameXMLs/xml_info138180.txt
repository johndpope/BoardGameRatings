			<description>SQUAR3 (pronounced &amp;quot;Square&amp;quot;) is a small but complex tactical tile laying game for two to four players. The players take turn placing square tiles on a 3x3 grid that forms the game board. Each tile has a point value and will influence all adjacent tiles. The players also place gems on top of these tiles to claim them for the final scoring. Some of the tiles have special actions that the player claiming that tile can use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SQUAR3 is similar to games like Isis &amp;amp; Osiris or Go as the placement of tiles and player pieces is crucial for scoring the most points. A further depth of play stems from the orientation of each tile, the layering of tiles and the management of the actions available to each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games of SQUAR3 can last for only a couple of turns or up to 30 min and can be quite mind-burning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
