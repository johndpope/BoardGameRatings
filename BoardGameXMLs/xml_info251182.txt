							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Path of Peril</name>
									
			<description>Blurb from back of book:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Can you unravel the clues and solve the mystery of The Path of Peril?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The famous explorer, Edmund Mallory, has been foully murdered, and the legendary Bloodstone, which he acquired under mysterious circumstances on his last travels, is missing. All that remains are the scattered fragments of the explorer's diary, his personal notebook and most of the contents of his ransacked study. An almost unsolvable mystery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And yet it seems that the explorer himself expected to meet a violent end and prepared the way for YOU to track down his murderer and recover the Bloodstone. Unfortunately the clues he laid have become scattered in the turmoil of his terrible death. All the information you need is there, ingeniously hidden in both text and pictures, and each strand of the mystery unravels to reveal the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But are YOU sharp enough to crack it? Can YOU complete the task you have been set? The Path of Peril awaits you. Do YOU dare take up the challenge?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
