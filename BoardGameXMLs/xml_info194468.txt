			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlock Your Potential!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A warrior spends hours on the training ground, sparring with others or hacking at combat dummies, building up his strength. Elsewhere, an aspiring ninja runs a gauntlet of nasty traps, attempting to make it through as quickly as possible, and without being hit, to improve her agility and reflexes, while a wizard pores over ancient tomes, memorizing facts and quizzing himself on them to improve his knowledge. A monk meditates under a waterfall, to better learn to block out distractions, and a bard decides to drop by a tavern and see if he can&amp;rsquo;t make a few friends, just so he&amp;rsquo;s not rusty at the upcoming banquet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of these characters are conditioning themselves. They are training, in one way or another to improve their abilities. And the more that they train, the better they will be. But training isn&amp;rsquo;t something you can just finish. It is a constant process, and must be maintained, or else muscles, memory, and even social skills can fade and become soft. In the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, the only way for a character to improve themselves is through killing things and gaining experience, and no amount of training or practice will truly matter. This book presents 32 new feats that allow characters to gain conditioning pools, acquiring points for regular training, and then spending those points to perform incredible feats, or gaining passive bonuses based on how many points they have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
