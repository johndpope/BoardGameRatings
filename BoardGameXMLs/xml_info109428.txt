							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Witch Hunter</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The witch hunter is a new 20-level base class designed for use with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. It is a warrior class that specializes in finding and defeating evil spellcasters (and spell-using monsters) and fixing the problems such creatures cause. Though witch hunters are able combatants against any foes, they excel when facing enemies that draw much of their power from cursing, draining, and charming their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witch hunters are warriors who have trained themselves to recognize, oppose, and sometimes even undo the effects of magic, especially witchcraft. Much of their power comes from an unshakeable conviction that magic powers cannot overcome the willpower of someone trained to confront such forces without fear or hesitation. A witch hunter is powered by devotion to the idea that free will and normal mortal existence are as powerful and precious as the mystic powers of mages and priests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
