			<description>The object of the game is to move by a throw of the dice and get all four of your men to the &amp;quot;Coin Store&amp;quot; first for the highest extra bonus on coin values (collected via &amp;quot;Coin Cards&amp;quot; accumulated on the way there). Your men may only move into play with a roll of a one on one of the dice. If more than one man is in play, the roll may be split with each man moving the number of spaces on one die. If doubles are thrown the player gets another roll. A man can only enter the &amp;quot;Coin Store&amp;quot; with an exact number. If more than one man is in play, the roll can be split to allow a man to enter with the exact number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest total of values (plus the bonus), as indicated on the &amp;quot;Coin Cards&amp;quot; held by each player at the end of the game is the winner. All players must finish because lesser bonuses are awarded for both second and third place and the player who finishes first may not necessarily finish with the highest total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
