							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Airfix Dogfighter</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Bomb the garden, smash the crockery, slam the door on your enemy, turn out the lights - do anything in your power to destroy and survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take the side of the Axis or Allies and bring your model plane to life in bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens and more. With 17 authentic WWII planes to choose from and online warfare with up to 8 players, Airfix Dogfighter delivers the kind of fun mere plastic and glue could only dream! &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aircraft depicted are (or were at the time of release) available from Airfix as 1:72 scale model kits, and are depicted more or less in scale with the house interiors in which the game takes place. In game controls and physics are decidedly arcade, as are weapon &amp;amp; repair pickups. In game modes are single-player campaign, online multiplayer, house designer, and paint room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
