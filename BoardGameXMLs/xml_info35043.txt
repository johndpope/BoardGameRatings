			<description>This game is a re-creation of prairie life in South Dakota.  Each player chooses an animal from one of five groups (Waterfowl, Upland Game, Small Mammal, Big Game, and Predator) and tries to make it around the board, facing hazards along the way.  After they have completed a lap, they switch to an animal from another group and go again, until they have completed the game with all five animal groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
