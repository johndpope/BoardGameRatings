			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 10 thick wooden tiles with the front and back of each tile having one of five patterns (suits). Each tile has different patterns on the front and back, and no two tiles are alike.  Thus, each pattern appears four times.  So, for example, each of the four tiles showing the rose pattern has a different one of the remaining four patterns on the reverse side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tiles are randomly placed on the table on their sides on so that each player sees exactly one of the two patterned faces of each tile (the players sit across from each other). The first player rotates one tile 90 degrees so that it is standing up.  Next, the other player topples it either towards or away from herself (she chooses) so that one of the two patterned sides is now face up.  She then puts the tile into a pile on the side of the table so that the revealed patterned side remains face up.  After completing these steps, the players reverse roles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to build a complete 2-D tile pyramid, with four tiles in the bottom layer, three tiles in the second layer, two tiles in the third layer and one tile on top. When building on the second or higher layers, a tile can only be placed if it matches the face up pattern of one of the tiles it is being placed on.  The pyramid can be built in any order (e.g., work on the second layer can begin before the bottom layer is completed).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may not communicate verbally or otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
