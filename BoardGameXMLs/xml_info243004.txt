			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ivar and Alotonia Petrovna desperately wanted a child.  After many years of trying, they resorted to building a child of snow each year in the winter months.  After many years, their wish for a child was granted when their snow child came to life.  Ivar and Alotonia named her Snegurochka, or Snow Maiden.  She grew to be a beautiful young woman and wished to fall in love.  But because of her nature, she was unable to feel love.  Now, the Hag Baba Lysaga has promised the Snow Maiden a chance to feel love.  And she has the perfect prince in mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
