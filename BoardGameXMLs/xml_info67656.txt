			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trapdoor lifts upward to reveal a vaulted chamber lined with ten stone sarcophagi, each carved with a humanoid figure and engraved with dust-caked runes. A ten-foot statue of a vulture-like humanoid stands in an alcove halfway down the left wall. The statue has enormous wings and talons tipped with obsidian. -- Discover the Crypt of the Plague-Bringers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Under the Mountain is a massive dungeon complex extending endlessly below the ground. In a remote past, ancient evil beings dwelled in the area. Now, the remaining of these mysterious evil beings have seized the dungeons and filled it with deadly traps and monsters. Also, many known villains have established their strongholds in the depths of The Dungeon Under the Mountain. Nobody knows why this dungeon is filled by danger, but nobody cares, since this dungeon is the most prized adventure ground of the world. However be warned, adventurers, your life will be not easy here and dozens of self-calling heroes never returned from The Dungeon Under the Mountain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first of a series of products detailing the rooms in the massive Dungeon Under the Mountain environment. This is Room 40, Level 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains one room or one dungeon-based encounter. All the rooms featured here are taken from one of The Dungeon Under the Mountain products, although these products are not necessary, since the encounter can be adapted without effort to any existing dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
