			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I've got stats and skills and this or that special rule, but... Who in the world am I? Who are the rest of you? And who's that..?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character: More or Less Promising Olde Worlde Adventurers is a tool designed to support development of characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On just one page it provides 216 table entries arranged across six columns, for use individually or in various combinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entries cover aspects of appearance, personality and behaviour, plus approach and current circumstances with regard to occupation, as well as origin geographically and socially, physical and psychological nature and explicit and implicit relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is compatible with various genres and systems and suitable for use in roleplaying and beyond. It can be used to inspire and detail characters, even at the table in the course of games - and not least to find out who it is the party has just bumped into...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three pages are arranged for ease of use on screen or printed, the key features in two variant layouts. The tool includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     216 table entries arranged in six columns and six rows, all on one page&lt;br/&gt;     six categories - characteristic, situation, occupation, origin, nature and connection&lt;br/&gt;     a compact diceless number generator for the specific range used&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It complements Character: Odds &amp; Ends Found on the Olde Worlde Adventurer, which lists various possible possessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
