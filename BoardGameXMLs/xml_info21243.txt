							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deduction</name>
									
			<description>A game of logic and elimination played with a standard piecepack.  Deduce the missing tile by asking the other players about what tiles they have hidden in their hands. The questions a player can ask are limited by the suit and number value on a drawn coin. Part of the game is inventing a effective way to record the information you have gained.  This game is very similar to Sleuth by Sid Sackson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
