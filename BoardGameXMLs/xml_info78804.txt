			<description>&amp;quot;Trek Trivia is a trivia game about the Star Trek TV series, written in Turbo Pascal 5.0 for MS-DOS, published by Apogee Software (now 3D Realms).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trek Trivia was distributed as shareware. It consists of ten volumes (named Volume 1 to 10), with only the first volume distributed as shareware, and the rest available commercially. Each volume has 100 multiple choice questions related to Star Trek.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Star Trek copyright holder Paramount found out Apogee was making money on their property, they offered Apogee a license to the game idea. Apogee did not accept the offer, as the license would have cost more than what Apogee was making on the game. Therefore, Apogee discontinued the game, and they no longer retain any copyright or control over on it.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Trek Trivia,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
