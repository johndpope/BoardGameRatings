							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scooby-doo! Monster Mystery Game</name>
									
			<description>Produced for McDonald's Corp. for give-a-way in Happy Meals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I comes with a board, playing pieces and a unique die roller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes turns moving across the board.  There are 10  'monster discs' (out of 12) on spaces on the board.  Each of these has a hidden message that you must 'decode' by looking at it through the red moon.  Once you've landed on it you must follow the instructions on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to collect as many of these as possible.  They also contain a hidden amount of points.  First one to the end also earns bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all plays have reached the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
