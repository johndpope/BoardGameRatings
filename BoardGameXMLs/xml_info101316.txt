							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Oldenhaller Contract</name>
									
			<description>2008 scenario competition finalist for second edition of WFRP run by Fantasy Flight Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although The Oldenhaller Contract has been designed with beginners in mind some experienced role-players will also find it interesting and possibly useful as an introduction to the rules - and hopefully fun to play as well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternatively this scenario could be run as part of the &amp;quot;Paths of the Damned&amp;quot; Campaign - the third book of which takes part in the city of Nuln. However this will require some juggling, as this scenario is set several years before the events detailed in that book. The scenario will act as a sideline from the campaign proper, and allow the Players to better get to know the City and make some important contacts which may prove very helpful, especially as this scenario and Paths of the Damned share many key None Player Characters (NPCs) and locations in common.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
