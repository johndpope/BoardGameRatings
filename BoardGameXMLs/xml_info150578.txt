			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cooperative game based on various SF-themed anime TV shows. Players are pilots of various space craft and try to destroy the Dead Star before the enemy invades their base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 12x3 square gridded board. All players line up their crafts to the left, and the enemy crafts are lined up on the board's right. Players are dealt 5 cards each of which they choose 3 to play face down. When all have chosen, players turn their cards face up and the players execute their cards in order of speed on the cards. Players who end up having the same speed are blocked and their turns are skipped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all players have done, dice are rolled to determine what the enemy crafts do (attack or move). If the players manage to reach the far end of the game board, they win. If all players are killed, or the enemy reaches the left of the game board, the players lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also comes with optional difficulity rules, and one of them include a traitor mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
