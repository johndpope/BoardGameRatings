							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Matching Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The Matching Card Game is a card game designed for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card deck consists of 27 picture cards.  The cards are divided up by 9 scenes of 3 different cards each.  The 3 cards of each scene form a larger picture scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to be the first player to collect all 3 cards of a scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each player is dealt 3 cards, and the remaining pile becomes the stock.  The dealer draws a card from the stock, and then passes one of their cards to the left, so they are only left with 3 cards.  The next player then chooses a card to discard to the next player, etc.  The last player discards their card to a discard pile, and then the dealer starts the next round by drawing the top card from the stock again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until a player collects all 3 cards from a scene, and displays it on the table, winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game closely resembles a Children's Card game called My Ship Sails played with a traditional deck(s) of cards, but players try to match suits in that game instead of picture scenes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was included in a 6 pack of Children's Card Games by Bicycle Playing Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
