			<description>(From the website) Gavin Birnbaum's third release in the 'bouncy ball' Cubiko series sees the cubes adopting cat, mouse and cheese characters which can 'snap' together via magnets. Crafted by the designer, the game takes place on a wooden platform that represents a cheese factory. The factory has 4 zones and at the centre is the larder wherein lies the prize, a cube of cheese. The first mouse to 'nibble' (attach via the magnets) the cheese wins. You'll need a steady hand and nerves of steel to out manoeuvre the cats and you'll need good hand and eye co-ordination to make that winning shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
