							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Palace of Ahmad Sahir</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 4 PCs of Level 6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ahmad Sahir was a wizard of great renown, known for his devotion to Matan, Nar, and Shem, the three goddesses of divination and oases. After rescuing the goddesses from an unscrupulous sultan who bound them with foul magic, Sahir was gifted with a desert oasis. He commissioned a small palace to be built and devoted his life to the goddesses. Seeking revenge, the sultan cursed Sahir and when the wizard succumbed to madness, the goddesses withdrew from him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sahir began to believe he must bind the goddesses as the sultan did to regain their blessings. He began sacrificing his servants and using their blood in his evil rite, but he needed royal blood to complete it. He invited Jamila Amire, his cousin and a princess, to visit him. Amire accepted the invitation and has not been seen since. Now her father has sent the PCs to investigate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
