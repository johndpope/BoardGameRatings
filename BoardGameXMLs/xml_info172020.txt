			<description>Freak Show Shuffle is a quick card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a series of timed rounds, trade cards from your hand face-down to other players.  At the end of the game, you'll score points by collecting as many copies of a specific circus &amp;quot;attraction&amp;quot; card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are special cards too: the &amp;quot;Ringmaster&amp;quot; is a wildcard used as any type of circus attraction card you want to increase your score.  There are also &amp;quot;Freaks!&amp;quot; in the deck, which detract from your score unless you shoot the moon with the &amp;quot;Talker&amp;quot; card. The Talker makes all your Freaks! count as attractions and add to your score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
