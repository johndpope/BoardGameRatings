			<description>A children's game, involving adding and subtracting 2 numbers, rolled on two spinners, from 1-10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turn to flick the two spinners, producing two numbers. The player can the place a bee on the sum of the numbers (adding), or the difference of the numbers (subtracting the low number from the high). In the case of a double, the player gets an extra turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is filled with numbers from 0 to 20, and the first player to make a complete line from one side to the other has won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since some numbers are harder to come by than others, there is some skill in choosing the right path. There is also some skill in using numbers that can potentially give you more than one way to continue, as well as blocking your opponents path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
