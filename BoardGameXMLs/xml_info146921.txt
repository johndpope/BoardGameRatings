							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Secrets of the Empire: Naishou Province</name>
									
			<description>Subtitle: 2013 Gencon RPG, Note that the &amp;quot;Secrets of the Empire&amp;quot; titling appears on the title page, but not the cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary: Location guide and convention adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Weclome to Naishou Province, our latest supplement for the Legend of the Five Rings RPG, 4th Edition. Our goal with this product is to provide GMs and players with a complete setting in which to set their adventures. Naishou Province is a single, unaligned province of the Empire, described in as much detail as possible, from its august Imperial Governor to the smallest of its villages. The contents are also designed to tie in with our upcoming product Secrets of the Empire, which focuses on factions which have received only light treatment in L5R 4th Edition up until now: the Minor Clans, Imperial samurai, ronin, and the Brotherhood of Shinsei. Although a copy of that book is not required to make use of this product, the two complement each other very easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;There will always be a need for heroes&amp;quot; - Shinsei&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a forgotten corner of the Emerald Empire, the Naishou province is a hotbed of intrigue and mystery. Once called by a local poet &amp;quot;the province of secrets,&amp;quot; Naishou is a minor and out-of-the-way location that has rarely if ever impacted the awareness of anyone of great importance. Even those of the Imperial families who find themselves consigned to the region are of little significance in the grand scheme of things. But obscurity is not something that comes without costs, as those who hide in the shadows of the Empire seek out such places to hatch their plots and advance their sinister agendas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the province of secrets, it pays to watch one's back at all times....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
