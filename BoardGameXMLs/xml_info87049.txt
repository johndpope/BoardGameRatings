			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Billy is back in the second game of the Billy la Banlieue series. This time he must phone his fiance before she runs away with his rival, Ricky le T&amp;ecirc;tard. Problem is, all the phones require an access code, and Ricky has sent some of his friend to prevent Billy from making his call.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though a side-scrolling arcade game like its predecessor, the adventure elements have been toned down. Instead of having to look for specific items to get rid of enemy characters, they must be fought in a beat'em up sequence. The player must monitor Billy's energy (it can be replenished by buying chewing gum at distributors) and money (used in phones and arcade games). There are videogame cabinets scattered around, each with a different minigame. Success in these games earns Billy money and parts of the code needed to use the phones and complete the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
