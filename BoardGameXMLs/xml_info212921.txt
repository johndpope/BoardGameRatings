			<description>TRBO is a fast paced, racing, miniatures board game for 2-4 players. Playing in about 30 &amp;ndash; 45 minutes, players in TRBO select a unique motorcycle club and race to either outpace their competitors or demolish their competition completely using weapons and dirty tricks. Inspired by retro boards games and cart racing video games of the 16-bit era, TRBO is a lighthearted and quick to play game with an incredibly low learning curve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In TRBO each player takes control of a motorcycle club composed of 3 biker types: light, medium, and heavy. While each biker has different attack and health values based on their size, all bikes are capable of moving at the same speed. It is up to the player to decide what&amp;rsquo;s the best strategy for each member of their club.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move by rolling 3 custom movement dice. They can attribute any of the rolled results to any of their bikers. around the straight race track board is a number of special spaces that allow players to either get an immediate boost, which lets them roll a custom boost die, or pick up Tune-Up cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tune-Up cards can buff a player's attack, give them special abilities, or disrupt their opponent's turns with a few nasty 'Take-That' type instant play cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of TRBO is the player with the last active biker club on the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
