			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only puzzle which gives you the answer first and defies you to accomplish it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll the ball to &amp;quot;START&amp;quot;. Close the lid and there on top is the answer! Keep the lid closed and, following the arrows, merely roll the ball from &amp;quot;START&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;FINISH&amp;quot;. You have two minutes to do it. FRUSTRATED?? Then take a peek...take as many peeks as you feel necessary. You start with 100 points, and each time you take a peek, it costs you 10 points! If you can't get the ball to &amp;quot;FINISH&amp;quot; within two minutes, you score ZERO. Highest score wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
