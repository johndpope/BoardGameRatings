			<description>Pilots of Gallaxia is a sci-fi space rescue adventure set in the Gallaxia and Oyrigin movie universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play in the first rescue mission is simplified to give new players ease of access. Pilots start with two ships and claim trade spaces between planets on their way to rescuing their scientist. Completed trade routes speed pilots back to their home hangar as they play fuel cards to be the first one home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unique elements of the game include a press-your-luck mechanic for drawing new cards, randomized prism-jump risk, free vortex travel and a battle system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The more complex variant introduces the use of Durriken mercenaries, endurance routes that block other players and a Darkstorm card that clears the board and removes effects. A new deck of Captain&amp;rsquo;s Cards is also added and rewards player-pilots for fully completing the press-your-luck card draw with &amp;lsquo;take-that&amp;rsquo; moments. Lastly, the infamous Durriken Staring Contest is a way to resolve Durriken battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
