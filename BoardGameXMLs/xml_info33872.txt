			<description>From the author:  The stuffed animals, toy trucks, and action figures of your childhood did more for you than you remember.  They were your guardians, advocates, and friends, putting their lives on the line for you.  Do you have what it takes to be a toy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players receive two Characteristic cards (Agile, Faithful, Sad, Smart, and so on) from the included deck.  Each player then picks a toy that bets fits their Characteristics.  Players then collaboratively decide on a setting (back seat of the car, under the bed, etc.) and a source of conflict (older brother, dog, etc.), then the game begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player, acting as Narrator, creates challenges for the players who then must stave off the conflict and vie to become the favorite toy.  Players that don't do well become &amp;quot;lost toys&amp;quot; and are removed from the game.  The last (or most popular) toy wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
