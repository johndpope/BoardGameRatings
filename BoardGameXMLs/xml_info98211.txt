			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Red Baron meets the Blue Max in an aerial dogfight all over the screen. You can take on an opponent in a 2-player dogfight, or more exciting yet, it's you against the computer in a 1-player battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-Player Spitfire&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and the enemy air ace are engaged in an aerial dogfight up in the sky high above the earth. Try to shoot your opponent down and score a point before he sends you spiraling to the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Red Baron is in the lower left corner of the screen. The Blue Max is in the lower right corner. A control tower sits between them on the landing field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spitfire planes fly using the same principles as real airplanes. In order to fly, a plane must always be moving. The Spitfire planes are always moving forward. You have control over the &amp;quot;elevators,&amp;quot; or what makes the plane move up and down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Pushing the hand controller forward and back will cause the plane to move up and down RELATIVE to the plane. Keep this in mind when your plane is upside down!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Top Secret Battle Hints. The Spitfire planes have the ability to wrap around the screen. That means that if a plane flies off one edge of the screen, it will wrap around and appear on the opposite side of the screen flying in the same direction. This can be used as an advantage to sneak up on your opponent. The planes can also be made to fly completely off the top and side edges of the screen. This is akin to flying in the clouds. Although the planes cannot be seen, they can still fire and be hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1-player Spitfire&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You, the Blue Max, have engaged the Red Baron in a fierce battle, only the Red Baron is being controlled by the computer! Can you shoot the Red Baron down before the computer homes in on you and sends you spiraling to earth?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Top Secret Battle Hints. Remember that the Red Baron is computer controlled. The more you hit the Red Baron and score against him, the better he will get. His aim gets sharper and he homes in on you faster. The more Red Baron hits you and scores against you, the more cocky and confident he gets and his accuracy and timing slip!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
