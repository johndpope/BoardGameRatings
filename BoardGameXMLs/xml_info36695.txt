			<description>&amp;quot;Players are Drug Traffickers smuggling cocaine shipments from Columbia into the US. Victory: The first player to accumulate $50,000,000 wins.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a single track that is thirty spaces long, representing the journey from Columbia to the United States. Each player receives three pawns representing Trucks, Planes, and Boats. There are also three pawns (land, air, sea) for the US forces and three pawns for Central American forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Money is earned by getting pawns to the United States space at the end of the board. If a player's pawn lands on a government pawn, it is considered captured and must be removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
