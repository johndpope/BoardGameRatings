							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">American Nomad</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;America's a big place, and you've walked or drove across it all. You've spent time in the city; sure, you may even have a (rarely visited) house somewhere. But your real home are the places in between: the sleepy little towns that hide dark secrets, the farms bought out by the big conglomerates, the mountain logging camps run by corrupt overseers, the forgotten desert prisons in need of a revolution. For you, America is in the details, and America needs a protector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You arrive in a needy town in the dusty red light of the setting sun, and have an almost supernatural ability to find trouble. It doesn't matter if you're on the road for knowledge, for peace of mind, or because you're running from prosecution for a crime you didn't commit, once trouble finds you, you become a hero one more time. You can't help it. You never strike first, never respond with raw force when reason and quiet words will suffice, but once your tormentors cross the line.... you are an unstoppable, righteous champion, who always fights for peace and always protects helpless innocents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
