							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stresz</name>
									
			<description>Stresz is a strategic game which consists simply of pushing the opponents 4 marbles into the center square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn players roll the dice. The number rolled represents the amount of squares that the player can use to move his marbles. Only 1 base color is permitted to move per dice roll. To his choice, the player can move as he pleases the 2 marbles (if possible) of the same base color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player can push more than 1 marble.&lt;br/&gt;A player cannot push his own marbles directly. He has to do it by pushing the opponents marbles(s) on his own.&lt;br/&gt;A marble moved cannot end up on the same square it started its turn on, unless it has pushed one of the opponent's marbles before ending on this square.&lt;br/&gt;The center square is made up of 4 distinctive squares. A marble has to be pushed to make a move in the center square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a marble is pushed in the center square, this marble is considered taken and cannot be used or moved directly. To take out a marble from the center square, one of the opponent's marbles will have to be pushed against it in order to push it out of the center square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
