			<description>Up until the liberation of Anvers, the harbor of Marseille played a fundamental role in providing supplies to the allies on the west front.&lt;br/&gt;It seems logical and interesting to add a fourth player to relive the landing of Provence, the liberation of the Mediterranean harbors and the chasing of the German army in the Vosges.&lt;br/&gt;To do so, you must destroy (try, at least) the 11th Panzer Division, also known as the Ghost division. &lt;br/&gt;You will have to craftily plan when to ask for help from the FFI, prevent the retreat of Heeresgruppe G from the Southwest of France and secure the borders with Italy and Spain.&lt;br/&gt;Will you be able to quell the last German  attacks like Wacht am Rhein and Nordwind?&lt;br/&gt;And under the command of the SHAEF and general Eisenhower, will you free the Alsace region or cross the Rhine?&lt;br/&gt;And of course, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to provide your troops with POL, ammo and food!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amateurs study tactics; professionals study logistics.&lt;br/&gt;Omar Bradley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
