			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Enjoy hours of fun! Use these playing cards to play the exciting action game, or a number of other card games! Use the cards to build images as fast as you can in the Mega Memo Game or make a fun puzzle!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box contains two sizes of cards: one 16-card set that is 90mm x 125mm (approximately 3-3/8 x 4-3/4), and one 52-card &amp;quot;bridge-size&amp;quot; deck (63mm x 88mm) split into two packets. The large cards are two-sided -- one side has a portion of a larger picture, while the other side has portraits of the various characters from the Pixar movie &amp;quot;Brave&amp;quot;, along with assorted numbers and symbols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the standard suit and number markings on the smaller deck, some of the cards have other symbols on them, such as a bow, a sword, a kettle, etc. These symbols are used in the &amp;quot;Action Game&amp;quot;, which is a mix of Fluxx and Uno.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Mega Memo Game&amp;quot; uses both the large and small cards. The large cards are placed in the middle of the table with the main picture side up. The smaller cards are all dealt out to the players. The top large card is turned over revealing the character portrait and perhaps a number and/or symbol. The players race to see who can match these revealed items with pictures and/or symbols and/or numbers using the smaller cards in their hands. The first to do so claims the large card. The player with the most large cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The large cards can also be turned over and put together puzzle-fashion to make a group shot of the main characters from the movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And finally, the smaller cards can be used to play any regular card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
