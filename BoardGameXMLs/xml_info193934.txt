			<description>The Cat Herding Card Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This simple, fast-paced, simultaneous play card game is all about balancing speed and perception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players race to be the first to round up 150 cats (points).There are 60 cards with point values ranging from 5-75 in increments of 5. Players try to collect 4 cards of equal value to earn that many points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All gameplay is simultaneous. The 60 cards are divided evenly among all players so that each player has their own draw pile. At the shout of &amp;quot;Get 'Em&amp;quot; all players quickly draw 4 cards. Players can only hold 4 cards at a time. Players can put cards face up on the table, one at a time. Players can pick up cards, one at a time, Either from their draw pile or any face up card on the table. The first player to have 4 cards with matching point values in hand shouts out &amp;quot;Got 'Em&amp;quot; and scores points equal to the number on the 4 cards. Then all the cards are shuffled and redistributed and a new round begins. The first player to accumulate 150 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
