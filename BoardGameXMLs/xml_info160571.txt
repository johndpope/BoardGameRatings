			<description>Bridge-It was one of the first games produced for the Amstrad CPC to coincide with the system's release in 1984. Published by Amsoft, it was one of 50 launch titles produced to be sold at the same time as the CPC464. In the game, you take control of an unnamed character that must cross bridges, which can be raised and lowered, in order to get from his house to the other end of the town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Later on, Amstrad gave this game away free with all new Amstrad CPC computers sold as part of a ten-game software bundle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bridge-It&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
