			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the time of the Romans monsters and gods shared the world of men. As time went by men cleared the ancient forests and created great cities. Men continue to grow in numbers while the mythical creatures of the forest, meadow, mountain and stream slowly dwindle to extinction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are one of the mythical races of ancient Europe, and must somehow survive the uprising of mankind. If you can eke out an existence until the land is covered with men then you have succeeded in your task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take a race from the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Trolls&lt;br/&gt;     Vampires&lt;br/&gt;     Dwarves&lt;br/&gt;     Goblins&lt;br/&gt;     Werewolves&lt;br/&gt;     Gnomes&lt;br/&gt;     Pixies&lt;br/&gt;     Elves&lt;br/&gt;     Giants&lt;br/&gt;     Fairies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a free Print-n-Play boardgame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players each take a type of monster, and start in a favored terrain.  Each monster has a special ability, such as Hide, Kill, Teleport, Magic, Befriend, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you must play at least one card.  Some are mandatory, such as the growth of human population, while others are optional, such as use your Special Ability or grow your own monster population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to find some havens in Europe where you can dwell in peace without humans destroying you.  Sending the men against your opponents is a common tactic: the less of them, the better for you.  But if there are too many humans, your plan may backfire as they then may expand into your territories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
