			<description>from back cover:&lt;br/&gt;THe theft of an obscure diary from the Metropolitan Meuseum of Art. A series of unsolved disappearances in Chinatown. A ghostly apparition in a Chinese restaurant. Are these unrelated incidents, or are they segments of a greater whole?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attacks by the Silver Samurai and Si Fan assassins provide some clues to the heroes, who are drawn into the maelstrom of gang activity spreading through Chinatown in New York City. The exotic backdrop of Chinese culture sets the stage for a whilrwind introduction to the underground populated by tongs and ganglords. A search for the Celestial One becomes a matter of life and death for the heroes, who well may not live to see the Imperial Dawn...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have played &amp;quot;After Midnight&amp;quot;[geekdo still needs this one], you can continue the excitement with &amp;quot;Night Moves.&amp;quot; Even if you haven't used the previous adventure in this trilogy, you can still jump in with both feet using hte alternate beginning provided. And, either way, be sure to finish the fun with &amp;quot;Night Life&amp;quot;, the third and final installment coming later this year!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
