			<description>A Tales from the Void Story&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Penal Prison 35xv6 Deimos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Alarm went off like it always did at 5.30am galactic time, but for Matt Hodges, once Corporal Matt Hodges of the HarpTec Marines, today was different.  Today, in exactly three hours, he would be standing in the rec area facing the firing squad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For crimes against the Corporations you have been sent to Military prison to await execution. As that fateful day arrives and you prepare to meet the firing squad a Colonel in the 2nd Penal Battalion offers you a choice, sign on the dotted line and join the worst bunch of criminals in the Universe, doing the jobs that are deemed either to dangerous, illegal or dirty for corporate troops or, get full of lead and buried in the latrines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you sign your own death certificate the Colonel grins, a grin that matches those of the Deaths Heads on his Lapels. &amp;quot;Welcome to The Zombie Squad.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
