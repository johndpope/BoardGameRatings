			<description>(From the box - translated from Norwegian)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Se hva jeg kan! (See what I can!) is a trivia game for the smallest children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many things which needs to be learned and set in systems. Here the children learn of concepts, language, spelling, rhymes, numbers, seasons, weekdays and colours in a fun way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed for children who has not started school yet, and prepares the child for the concepts that is used in school. Some questions may be easy for your child, but the game also contributes to the child getting conscious of it's knowledge and the concepts it is based on, and gives a experience of mastering. The game demands an adult to participate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
