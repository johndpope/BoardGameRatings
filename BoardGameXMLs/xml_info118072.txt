							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Incredible Courage at Austerlitz: Pratzen</name>
									
			<description>Incredible Courage at Austerlitz - Pratzen adds the fight for the Pratzen Heights to the southern part of the fighting at Telnitz, in the Austerlitz battle.  The game adds (16) 11 x 17 map sheets to the 5 for Telnitz and encompasses the area from Sokolnitz Castle up to the area where Napoleon and the Imperial Guard started the battle around The Zurlan Hill.  The fighting forces added include the remaining 2 divisions of the French IV Corps, Imperial Guard, Grenadier Division, and I Corps.  These forces easily managed to defeat the Russian 3rd, 4th, and 5th Columns, and the Russian Imperial Guard.  This is the game where Guard meets Guard.  The Russian Guard is surely larger than the French, play this game to see how the French managed to defeat the Russians and send them routing away in what would end in the Coalition force being destroyed.  Initial copies of Pratzen will contain replacement maps for Telnitz and a replacement scenario card at no extra cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last, and next, game in the set of 3 is Incredible Courage at Austerlitz - Santon and is due to be released in the middle of 2012.  It will complete the set with the inclusion of General Bagration's command and the V French Corps and the Cavarly Reserve commanded by Marshall's Lannes and Murat.  There are (6) 11 x 17 map sections to complete the northern part of this immense battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game will showcase the map feature data of Rick Barber and have a considerable amount of detail for a 100m per hex battlefield definition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also has some nice game system features such as variable combat strengths and a fairly easy to learn game system set of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
