							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gambit</name>
									
			<description>Gambit is an abstract strategy game in the trappings of a war game. Players use jets, ships, amphibious vehicles, and rockets to seize an enemy goal square or eliminate their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map for at least one printing is a bit of a curiosity. In it, the cover of the box shows a 10x10 board with alternating green and blue squares. The instructions note that the land squares are green and the sea squares are blue. However, the actual map provided is 10x16, has only black and white print on yellow paper, and uses the letters &amp;quot;L&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; to designate land and sea spaces. It would appear that the designer assumed he would be able to print color boards, but then had to fall back to a simpler black and white drawing printed on yellow paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
