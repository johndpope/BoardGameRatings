			<description>Springe (Two-Fisted Bluff) is a two-player game designed for play with a Shibumi set.  It uses a 4&amp;times;4-holed board, and balls in three colors (white, black, and red).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim: Make a full line (orthogonal or diagonal) of your color on a level, or get 9 of your balls on the board, or place the top piece of the pyramid, or (if both players run out of balls to play) have more of your balls in play than your opponent and more of yours than neutral balls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules: The 4&amp;times;4 board starts empty. Each player (White and Black) starts with his 16 balls, and 8 of the red neutral balls. Keep this supply of 24 balls hidden from your opponent at all times during the game. Use an opaque container (e.g. the Shibumi bag) to receive rejected balls over the course of the game. It should be able to hold all 48 balls, just in case. Never look in this reject bag during the game.&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, hide any one or two balls total from your supply into your two hands. Each hand now has zero or one ball in it. Now present your closed fists to your opponent. Your opponent must sit still (no leaning and peeking), then touch one of your fists. Put the ball in this hand (if any) on the growing pyramid. Put the other hand (without looking!) into the reject bag, and release the ball (if any). Always do this, even if the other hand is empty, in order to keep your opponent guessing as to which balls you have left. If you run out of balls before your opponent, simply pass each turn until the game is over: You will still select which hand your opponent gets to play each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
