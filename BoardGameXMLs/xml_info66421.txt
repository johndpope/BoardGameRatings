			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Making lists is not a new activity in the world of RPGs. Just open up a few books or computer files to see this in action. Of course, no list can encompass everything. Myths, legends and even the stories of today have bits you can steal for your own game.&lt;br/&gt;So, why even write this list? This is a response to those who have said they have trouble envisioning adventures for PCs with god-like levels of power. Such difficulties are understandable. The threat of being broke and not having shelter or looking for the &amp;ldquo;MacGuffin&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t important because the wants and needs of humans differ from those of gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
