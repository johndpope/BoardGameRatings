							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Epic Funhouse</name>
									
			<description>Epic Funhouse is an interlocking suite of solitaire games representing a trip through a fun house with stops in six rooms. The rooms are designed to be played together in order, especially since the setup for each is affected by how you play the previous game. However, with a little ingenuity, each game can also be played separately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
