			<description>For everyone who enjoyed all the battles in GRINGO, as well as any gamer who is looking for small, interesting, unusual and fast-playing battles of any era, here is a module that provides all of that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles with the Gringos fills in most of the blanks - the important battles we had to leave out - for our coverage of The Mexican War. And, in addition to providing the usual rules clarifications and updates, we have added a rule for using Skirmishers that will be usable in all games in the GBACW system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it's the battles that make the game, and we have four half-map engagements that are each different, each with its own, unusual terrain, each with a set of problems facing both players. And each battle takes only a couple of hours, as well as being very playable solitaire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Palo Alto: May 8, 1846. The opening battle of the war, what looks to be a straightforward Napoleonic battle line special but ends up nothing of the sort, thanks to Ringgold's &amp;quot;flying artillery&amp;quot;, grass fires, and a cast of most unusual characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resaca de la Palma: May 9, 1846. A numerically superior Mexican force in an extremely strong defensive position, mostly hidden from the incoming Americans. One of the most unusual battlefields in gaming, the scenario is given a variety of gaming possibilities as well as two-player hidden deployment.&lt;br/&gt; Contreras: August 20, 1847. An assumedly unassailable and unapproachable Mexican position is trumped by some great scouting work by a young Robert E. Lee, resulting in a Mexican rout. But it did not have to happen that way. Maybe Santa Anna will use his reserves to negate the American attack. Maybe it will turn out completely differently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Puebla: May 5, 1862. A venture into another way, for the battle that resulted in the well-known Mexican holiday, Cinco de Mayo. A strong division of veteran French soldiers, fighting for the Emperor Maximilian, attack a nicely-defended Mexican position right outside this important, of-fought-over city. Cavalry charges, assaults on forts, and a rather prescient use of trenches result in a nicely balanced game. &lt;br/&gt;Components&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two 33&amp;quot;x22&amp;quot; mapsheets (each with 2 battles) &lt;br/&gt;One sheet of counters &lt;br/&gt;Battle Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need GRINGO to play the battles herein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
