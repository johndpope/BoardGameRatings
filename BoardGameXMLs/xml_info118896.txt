			<description>This game is based on the anime Ikki Tousen (一騎当千 Ikkitōsen, lit. &amp;quot;Strength of a Thousand&amp;quot;), known in North America as Battle Vixens, also a manga series written and illustrated by Yuji Shiozaki, based on the classic Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The series revolves around an all-out turf war in the Kanto region of Japan where fighters known as Tōshi (闘士), meaning &amp;quot;fighting soldier,&amp;quot; from seven schools battle for supremacy. The story centers on Hakufu Sonsaku, a fighter who transfers to Nanyo Academy, one of the seven schools involved in the turf war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This second video game in the series is entitled Ikki Tousen: Eloquent Fist (一騎当千 Eloquent Fist Ikkitōsen Erokuento Fisuto) and was developed by Tamsoft for the PlayStation Portable and released on October 2, 2008 by Marvelous Entertainment. The game is a hybrid between fighting and adventure, and it features 15 Ikki Tousen heroines and a new character named Kanpei, the Japanese counterpart of Guan Ping and the protagonist of the game. New characters include Motoku Sousou (Dragon Potent Unlocked), Teni, Koumei Shokatsuryo, Gentoku Ryubi, Genpou Saji, and Shishi Ouin, along with EX-Hakufu (Dragon Potent Unlock) and EX-Ryubi (Shining Dragon). Eloquent Fist omits the presence of Ukitsu, and new finishing maneuvers and altered movesets have either been buffed, or have been nerfed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Battle Vixens&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
