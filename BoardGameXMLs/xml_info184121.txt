			<description>From the company web site...&lt;br/&gt;Since its inception in 2003 Twenty/20 cricket has gained in popularity making it an important part of the modern game, batting, bowling &amp;amp; fielding techniques have become more evident in the longer versions of the game as more &amp;amp; more T20 games are played year on year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty20 cricket is currently the shortest version of the game with scores in excess of 200 possible on the (mainly) batsman friendly wickets used for this format of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty20 cricket emulates to reproduce the excitement &amp;amp; tension that draws such big crowds to the real thing, within this game are four batting grids for different types of wickets. Along with four batting &amp;amp; four bowling grades plus a few other charts that will enable the user to replay a full game in around 30-45 minutes when the rules have been mastered, this will ensure a statistically accurate scorecard with a wealth of stats (strike rates, economy rates etc.) and hopefully a nail-biting finish to boot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rating players is a simple task &amp;amp; although the grades are in themselves quite basic they will reproduce roughly what is achieved in real life (a T20 batsman's strike rate is regarded as a more valuable asset than his average and a bowlers economy is his main &amp;tilde;weapon&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes the following Ratings:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ICC World T20 (2014)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Friends Life domestic T20 (2013).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big Bash league 2013-14&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Indian Premier League 2014&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Champions League 2013&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Caribbean Premier League 2013&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played mainly with 2d6 and a d10, which is used occasionally.  Batters score runs by rolling a die and moving up a grid, different ones are based on the condition of the wicket.  Their starting point on the grid is based on their letter grade.  Certain points of the grid will then reference the bowler's grade - you roll a d10 to determine if the batter is out or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
