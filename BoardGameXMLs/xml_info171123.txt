			<description>Tour time, space and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this Regeneration Edition of Monopoly, people and places are all up for grabs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This brand new Regeneration Edition of Doctor Who Monopoly lands on Earth just as the Twelfth Doctor takes to the TARDIS console for the first time. Relive the final days of the Eleventh Doctor, his adventure with the Tenth Doctor and the War Doctor, his quest for the truth about the Impossible Girl and all the excitement of a Regeneration and a new body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With beautifully crafted special tokens and customised U.N.I.T and TARDIS cards this is the perfect companion piece to the thrills and spills of Season 8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to buy and trade properties to collect rent from your fellow players. In this edition the properties are people that the Doctor has met, planets, and locations featured on the show. To win you try to keep your money whilst trying to bankrupt everyone else, as when you are bankrupt you are out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
