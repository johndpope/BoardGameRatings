			<description>Imagine you are a dog. You've got a nice big lawn to play on. You have some sausages to eat, and a bone to chew on. You have even picked out a couple of comfy spots where the grass is a bit longer. Perhaps after lunch you might take a little nap.&lt;br/&gt;It's great being a dog!&lt;br/&gt;Now imagine there is another dog sniffing about on your lawn. It looks like this other dog might want to muscle in on your territory. Oh No! Now it has sat down in one of your comfy spots! This is war.&lt;br/&gt;But how on earth could you, a humble dog, show the intruder that this lawn is yours, and yours alone?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take control of the lawn by weeing in strategic positions. Use your wee to claim ownership of bones, sausages and comfy spots, and ensure that in the end you dominate the lawn, so the other dog will clear off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
