							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Army Ants RPG Legacy Edition (5th Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve just stepped into a world populated by military ants who defend their hill and queen from unending menace. The Great Field harbors ladybugs who operate a massive intelligence network, spiders who dabble in sorcery, potato bugs who wield the martial arts and mystical practices that defy natural laws; it has a wasp empire forcing its tyrannical grip upon those in its shadow; centipede overlords rule from underground cities where gladiator pits set insect against insect; garter snakes of incredible wisdom hide in its far reaches, primeval lizards prowl its lost wilds, ancient artifacts lie hidden in its distant ruins, and cybernetic anomalies hard-wire innovative technologies into their carapaces, boosting their natural abilities. Fleas roam the countryside, picking through the scraps of the unending war and forging mechanical oddities. It has mosquito mercenaries and a fallen fly kingdom. It has a trashcan city, a desolate sandbox, and a deadly fire pit. It has a deep well with hidden secrets. Its rain storms presage incredible floods, and its winter turns the Back Yard into a barren waste. It&amp;rsquo;s a crazy place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
