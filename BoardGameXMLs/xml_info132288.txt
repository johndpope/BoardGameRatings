			<description>A box of 60 very sturdy cards each featuring a number from 0 to 9 inclusive. The game is aimed at pre-schoolers and are designed to be attractive to young minds. There are numerous games suggested, mostly having a parent to act as referee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, the parent lays out 10 cards, one of each number. Then she asks the players in turn to point to two cards that add up to 7. If the child is right, he or she gets a point. After the playxers have all had a turn, the parent can choose a different number like 5 for instance, and so on. First to get, say, three points, wins. This sort of game can easily be made more difficult by choosing three cards that add up to a number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nearly all the games feature counting and the recognition of numbers. The publisher has made a very good job of making the cards as nice and hard-wearing as they are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
