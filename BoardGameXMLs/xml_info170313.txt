							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Troll Cave</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entrance was blocked by a huge rock and however we tried we couldn&amp;rsquo;t move it. We really had to try and find another way in to save the poor lad that the trolls had captured earlier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two or more trolls are harassing the villages and farms in the area and someone have to try and stop them. This is the perfect map for a one nights gaming session. And where does the underground river lead?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pdf is in letter format and consists of three different versions of the map, two coloured and one black and white. One of the coloured maps and the black and white version has a grid attached to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
