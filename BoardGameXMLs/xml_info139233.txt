							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fistful of Fantasy Number Two</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;From the author of the &amp;rsquo;100&amp;prime; series of Adventure Seeds books, a new, shorter form source of inspiration for Games Masters. They might be adventures, non-player-characters, monsters, places&amp;hellip; all ready to be dropped into your fantasy campaign, regardless of system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this booklet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Wand for the Everyman: What if the power to smite could be put in the hands of every peasant with a steady aim, without decades of study and the power of the blood?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kingdom of the Blind: The Witch Queen keeps her people in check by literally keeping them in the dark. What does she do with all those eyes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wulfkin: There are more ways to become a shapeshifter than by being bit. What kind of person would call that curse onto themselves?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Living Word: A desert temple, guarded by a mummy. Not everything is necessarily as straightforward as it seems though&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life &amp;amp; Limb: The city is the most secure in the world but it takes power and daring to keep it that way, sometimes at the cost of its poor and vulnerable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
