			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Cromagh judges goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears by the same standards he applies to everyone else: Are they stronger than Cromagh? And, if so, does that mean Cromagh will need help carrying their treasure when he loots their corpses?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;-Cromagh, Half-Orc Mercenary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cromagh's Guide to Goblinoids is a new (and sometimes cynical) look at goblinoid races for fantasy-based d20 System games. It is full of new feats, equipment, magic items, and prestige classes, including the goblin trapsmith, the hobgoblin kickfighter, and the bugbear scout. While Cromagh's Guide to Goblinoids discusses the philosophies, mythologies, and lifestyles of the three goblinoid races, the focus of the book is actually on providing interesting new options for both GMs and players. In addition to rules for creating goblinoid characters, players will find feats ideally suited to the goblinoids, along with equipment specifically designed to compliment the unique abilities of goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears. And GMs will find handy suggestions for simple but effective goblinoid tactics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let Cromagh the barbarian be your guide to the world of goblinoids: goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears. With years of experience under his belt, Cromagh is just the right half-orc to introduce players and GMs alike to the strange and fascinating cultures of the goblinoid races, from the militaristic hobgoblins and their ruthless warlords, to the vicious goblins and their society of scavenging. And this being Cromagh's accounts of his experiences with goblinoids, readers get not only the facts about goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears, but Cromagh's commentaries on what makes the goblinoid races so &amp;quot;unique.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All in all, Cromagh's Guide to Goblinoids is handy reference for anyone who will ever encounter a goblinoid, play a goblinoid, or run an encounter with goblinoids&amp;mdash;which should be just about everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
