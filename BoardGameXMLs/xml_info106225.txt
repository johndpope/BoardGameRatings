			<description>Computer Football Strategy (also known as Football Strategy) is a computer game that simulates the National Football League from a strategic point of view. It was developed for the Commodore 64 and the Atari 8-bit family computer systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic choice of teams span from the 1966 Green Bay Packers (the winners of Super Bowl I) to the 1982 Washington Redskins (the winners of Super Bowl XVII - the most recent Super Bowl as of the game's release). The game uses a top-down perspective in order to properly simulate the football field. The game shows the football field as a small, thin strip divided into ten-yard lines. Four basic graphics (the blue players playing the role as the defense and the black players playing the role as the offense) are considered to be &amp;quot;simulated American football players.&amp;quot; A notable criticism of the game is that having X's and O's would have been more realistic (because coaches use these in real-life football to write playbooks for the team players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty different plays can be called from the line of scrimmage with ten different outcomes depending on the defensive alignment. The display shows a minimal coverage of the action; with no movement by either the quarterback or the wide receivers. A complete lack of &amp;quot;hurry-up&amp;quot; offenses means that each pass takes 15 seconds of game time to complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Computer Football Strategy&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Winning isn't everything. It's the only thing!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt; - Vince Lombardi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sixteen years before becoming a Sports Illustrated Game, the magazine had this to say: &amp;quot;The best football game ever invented is Football Strategy, an honest-to-Pete challenge to the man who knows he would have been a great pro quarterback if only he had the chance.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt; - Sports Illustrated Magazine, December 11, 1961&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you can play this great Football Game on your home computer! Avalon Hill is proud to add Computer Football Strategy to its realistic line of Sports Illustrated games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action is animated on a large, scrolling football field. Watch as the quarterback drops back to pass, and as the defensive players move on the intended receiver. You have numerous offensive and defensive formations to choose from as a detailed time clock steadily ticks away. This is truly Football's Best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It's the next best thing to being out on the Gridiron itself.&amp;quot; say many ex-pros who now content themselves recapturing former heroics over the game of Football Strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a computer simulation of the Football Strategy board game. You pit your skills against the computer, or a live opponent. You are both the offense and defense play caller in this all-skill strategy game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
