			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breaking the Ice - A roleplaying game of intimate differences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go on a Date Tonight!  Breaking the Ice is a two player role-playing game.  Play a pair of characters going  out on their first three dates.  Explore what it's like to fumble through those first impressions, feel the spark of attraction and discover common ground that will (hopefully) bring your&lt;br/&gt;characters together.  And do this from a slightly different viewpoint than your own...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playtest version of the game was distributed freely on the internet 2004-05.  The rules are presented in HTML and PDF format, with a provided character sheet.  The playtest version varies from the final, published version primarily in formatting, copyediting, and clarifications.  The playtest version is somewhat less flexible in character creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
