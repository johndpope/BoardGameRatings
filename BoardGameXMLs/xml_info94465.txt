			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wily &amp;amp; Right no Rockboard: That&amp;rsquo;s Paradise is a Monopoly-style party game set in the Mega Man universe. Players can choose to play as one of five characters: Dr. Light, Dr. Wily, Dr. Cossack, Roll, or Kalinka. They then travel around the board purchasing property that they land on. If they land on an opponent&amp;rsquo;s property, they must pay that player the required rent. Owning a chain of adjacent properties increases the rent for all of those spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RockBoard differs from Monopoly in that players can purchase a lab on a piece of property currently owned by another player. If they do, the rent is split between the two parties. Labs can be upgraded by board events or landing on the property again, and they can also be bought by other players at any time for a marked up price. There is also a &amp;ldquo;Robot Transform&amp;rdquo; square that turns a player into a Robot Master for a period of time, during which they have special abilities. The winning conditions include reaching a required amount of money, labs, or property.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
