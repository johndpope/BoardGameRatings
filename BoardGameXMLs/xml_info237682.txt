			<description>Scopa meets deck-building, and tradition meets the modern spirit in Scopinion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts the game with the same card deck. The cards are numbered from 0 to 7 and have negative spades. The goal is to enhance your deck with better numerical cards, to neutralize your 14 spades with hearts, and above all to buy target cards as they provide victory points. The player with the most victory points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scopinion includes simple rules for beginners and extended rules for expert gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
