							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Berlinspiel</name>
									
			<description>The game is played on a map of Berlin. Each player has to reach several tourist destinations by bus (move 3 points), taxi (move a number of points determined by random card drawing) or subway (move to any other subway stop). After each move a new destination card can be uncovered. If this card shows &amp;quot;end of game&amp;quot;, the game ends with the next player reaching a destination. Then points are counted that are obtained by reaching the destination; whoever has most points, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
