			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Tannenberg 4 is a wargame about the Russian offensive into East&lt;br/&gt;Prussia 1914, later known as The Battle of Tannenberg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What You Need To Play&lt;br/&gt;1 hex map tile&lt;br/&gt;3 army tiles&lt;br/&gt;dice&lt;br/&gt;turn counter token (optional, not included)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(This game is also available as a VASSAL module.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Map Tile&lt;br/&gt;The map on the map tile shows part of East Prussia. On the&lt;br/&gt;map is that it has a grid of hexagons ('hexes'). There&lt;br/&gt;are railroads in some hexes. One hex (Konigsberg) also has a fort.&lt;br/&gt;On the map tile is also printed the Combat Results Table&lt;br/&gt;(CRT) used to resolve combat (see below) and a turn track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Army Tiles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player (the &amp;quot;Russian Player&amp;quot;) plays the attacker, controlling the two tiles representing the Russian 1st and 2nd armies. The other (&amp;quot;German&amp;quot;) player plays the defender, controlling the third tile, representing the German 8th army. Each army tile has two numbers printed on it. The one to the left is the combat power of that army. The one to the right is the movement allowance of the unit,&lt;br/&gt;which is 1 (one) for all armies. In the rest of these rules, the army tiles are refered to simply as &amp;quot;units&amp;quot;. A unit, as long as it is in the game, is always in (only) one hex on the map. Two units are adjacent to&lt;br/&gt;each other if they occupy hexes that are adjacent (that is if they share a common border). Two units may never occupy the same hex. The Russian units are enemy units to the German unit and vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory&lt;br/&gt;If only one player has (an) unit(s) remaining on the map, then that player wins immediately. Otherwise, after 10 turns the Russian player wins if there is a Russian army in the fort (Konigsberg). If the Russian player did not win the German player wins (there can be no draw).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the 4 Tile Contest:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/383408&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/383408&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freely available: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3170712#3170712&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3170712#3170712&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Added under a Creative Commons Attribution licence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
