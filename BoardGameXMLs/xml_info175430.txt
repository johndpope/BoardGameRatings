			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Capital Edition is designed to help you enjoy Washington, D.C. before and after you visit.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capital Edition is a roll-and-move trivia game designed to teach players about Washington, D.C.  Players start at the beginning of a track printed around the outer edge of the board.  On each turn, they roll the die and move along the track, landing on one of many types of spaces.  On a monument space, the player gains the trophy card for that monument.  A Metro space allows a player to move to any other Metro space.  A Tourmobile space allows movement to any monument, but the player must answer a question from a Challenge card to win a trophy card.  On a challenge space, the player draws a challenge card and asks another player the question.  On an incorrect answer, that player must return a trophy card to the board.  On a take a card space, the player must choose a card and answer the question to continue.  There are also roll again and lose a turn spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players' turns end in one of four ways--answering a question incorrectly, answering three consecutive questions correctly, winning a trophy card or landing on a &amp;quot;lose a turn&amp;quot; square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players continue to circle the board until one player collects trophy cards for all four monuments, winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
