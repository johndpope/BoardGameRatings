							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">My 5 Pets</name>
									
			<description>There are 5 pet shops in the game, each offering a specific pet (dogs, cats, rabbits, parrots and chameleons). Players are trying to amass the largest collection of pets by claiming pets from the pet shops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over a several rounds, each of which goes through the following 4 phases:&lt;br/&gt;1. Supply - The pet shops randomly gains new pets.&lt;br/&gt;2. Donation - The players each donate a new born pet to the respective pet shop.&lt;br/&gt;3. Claim - The players attempt to claim older pets that the pet shops are giving away by bidding. Pet shops give away older pets to the first customer that wants them. However if more than one customer wants to claim the same pet, they will decide to keep the pet to avoid a confrontation. However, if one of the claimants can provide a more conducive shelter for the pet, he will be given the pet during a confrontation. This phase will recur until all the pets in the shops are given away or the players all decide to stop claiming pets.&lt;br/&gt;4. Birth - The players' pets give birth to new born pets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues through the 4 phases in each round recurrently until the deck runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, players tally the number of pets they have as well as check who has the most shelters for each type of the pet. The player with the most shelters for each type of pet takes a penalty(loses some pets) as they are deemed to have too many shelters and thus insufficient space for the pets to live comfortably. The players with the most pets for each pet type gains a bonus (gains more pets of that type). After applying the penalties and bonuses, the player with the most pets win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
