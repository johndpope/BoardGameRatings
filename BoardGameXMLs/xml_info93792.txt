			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2002, and the Third Heroic Age finally seems to be winding down. The past decade has been a boom time for superhuman activity, and it has left the world somewhat different from the one the players are used to. But now, fewer new superheroes are appearing each month, and the supervillains seem to be quieting down and going into more lucrative and less splashy areas. A few of the more iconic figures like Avatar and Shade are still active, but there seem to be more heroes leaving the timeline every week.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, some believe it's merely a breather. Superhuman activity has never been more intense than in the last ten years...the previous two Heroic Ages were mere flashes in the pan compared to this. Some experts believe it would take more than the normal &amp;quot;winding down&amp;quot; forces to stop the current wave of superhuman activity, and that it's only a matter of months before things heat up again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All in all, it's an interesting time to be a superhuman. &lt;br/&gt;And you know what they say about living in interesting times....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern Knights is presented in two parts. The first presents a simple cinematic roleplaying system perfect for any four color setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the Toolkit system you can create virtually any power seen in comics past and present without spending hours hunched over the calculator balancing out an arbitrary point system. Modern Knights character generation is entirely concept based, allowing you to create the character you envision rather than having to compromise with the game mechanics. The innovative sliding damage scale allows vastly differential power levels without an increase in complexity or dice rolls. Physical powerhouses can walk alongside high skilled normals and ancient mystics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second part of the book presents Knights World, our official setting for Modern Knights. The Knightsworld setting is designed to be usable as either a &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; superhero universe or as a radically changing world where the old concepts are getting turned on their heads. It all depends on how the Referee and players want it to go. Hence, there are a lot of old familiar elements...government agencies, supervillain societies, global conquerors, a long tradition of superheroing, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Knightsworld is designed to function under the base Modern Knights rules, there are a few unique mechanics, notably in the realms of magickal and psychic powers. These are intended to show beginning Referees interested in creating their own worlds how the rules can be modified to fit a new setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KnightsWorld comes fully stocked with heroes, villains, interstellar bad guys and super-powered presidents. A developed history provides ample hooks to hang your own thoughts and ideas on, making the universe your own. Welcome to KnightsWorld. Here's your cape. There's the villain. You know what to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
