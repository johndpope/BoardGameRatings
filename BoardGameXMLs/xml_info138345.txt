			<description>Earthsiege 2 is a mecha-style vehicle simulation game developed by Dynamix, produced by Frank Evers (NYPH), and released in 1995. Earthsiege 2 is set the Earthsiege universe, which contains its predecessors Earthsiege (1994) and Battledrome (1995), as well as action game Hunter Hunted (1996), strategy games MissionForce: CyberStorm (1997) and Cyberstorm 2: Corporate Wars (1998), simulation Starsiege (1999), and first-person shooters Starsiege: Tribes (1999), Tribes 2 (2001), Tribes: Vengeance (2004) and Tribes: Ascend (2012).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a simulation, Earthsiege 2 gives players the opportunity to pilot massive bipedal war machines known as HERCULANs (Humaniform-Emulation Roboticized Combat Unit with Leg-Articulated Navigation) (or 'HERCs' for short). Set in the 26th or 27th century, Earthsiege 2 features advanced weapons and technology for waging war. Earthsiege 2 takes place across North America, South America, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, and the moon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earthsiege 2 features a more advanced engine than Earthsiege, increasing the game's maximum resolution to 640*480. Additionally, the game features much more detailed terrain than its predecessor. Earthsiege 2 has 3D rolling terrain rather than the flat landscape of Earthsiege. Furthermore, video briefings and debriefings, along with included squadmate voices, add to the atmosphere of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Earthsiege 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
