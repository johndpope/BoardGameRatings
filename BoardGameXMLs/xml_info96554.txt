			<description>In Roman antiquity this game was known as Alea, meaning 'gambling', but came to be called tabula, 'board' or 'table', since it was played on a board.  Tabula is the gambling game of which the Emperor Claudius was most fond. Around the year 50, Claudius wrote a history of the game of Tabula which, unfortunately, has not survived. His imperial carriage was equipped with an alveus, a Tabula playing board, so that he could play while travelling. Tabula is also the game which was primarily responsible for the gambling mania which swept Rome prior to its being declared illegal under the Republic. The fine for gambling at any other time except the Saturnalia was four times the stakes, although this law was only weakly and sporadically enforced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: The equipment for Tabula is the same as in backgammon except that each player has three dice instead of two. &lt;br/&gt;All checkers start off the board. Both players enter their fifteen checkers into the same starting table and move them around the board in the same direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: The object of the game is to move all of your checkers to the finishing table and then bear them off. The first player to bear off all his checkers wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
