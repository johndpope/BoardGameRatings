			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many Dungeon Masters want to create their own adventures and campaigns out of their vast imaginations. Devising adventures of excitement and fantastic worlds for your D&amp;amp;D games is the most rewarding part of being a Dungeon Master. Are you one of those DM's?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then you already know that even a creative DM can use inspiration once in a while. You've tried adapting pre-made adventures, and it helps... but you do so much work, and in the end, it just isn't as satisfying as making your own adventure from scratch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As any baker will tell you, &amp;quot;every lump of dough needs a little yeast.&amp;quot; Enter the Dungeon Kit! This book contains four seed-rooms for adventure locations; heavily detailed descriptions of the core room with all the details, ideas for more rooms, specific suggestions for monsters, treasures, traps, hazards, magic, and encounters, and plenty of inspiration for adventures. Place the rooms into your existing dungeons, use them in new creations, or use the room's components in entirely different ways!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's Inside...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Temple of the White Oak - A temple, naturally shaped inside a living tree, and home to a very special idol. Plenty of natural defenses, magic, monsters, and treasures to work with.&lt;br/&gt;     The Anvil of Haerda-Kraeg - Lost for centuries, this artifact has the power to bring peace to the dwarves and may yield an even greater treasure for those with open eyes.&lt;br/&gt;     Cesspools of Rhakiran - Worlds of adventure are littered with the ruins of once-great civilizations. One of the most unlikely concerns of the once advanced Rhakjirans was always their sewers. Their waste-management systems were astounding works of art and function, considering their purpose, but what a horrifying place they have become since the city of Rhakjiran has perished in the wake of moral and civil degeneration...&lt;br/&gt;     Gallerie of Dangerous Creatures - Wizards are always attempting to improve learning, but any old sage can write a book. Just as strong as their urge for gathering knowledge, is their urge to one-up their former teachers and fellow spell-casters...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
