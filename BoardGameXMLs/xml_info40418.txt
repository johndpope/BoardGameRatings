			<description>From the back:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember playing boardgames like Candyland?  You were an innocent kid with a dumb hair cut wishing so &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; you were playing something else like &amp;quot;Super Colossal Master of All Elementary Schools or Ruler of All the Fudgesicles in the Freezer!&amp;quot;  Your super strength allowing you to flick your opponent across the orange shag carpet?  Well... Your wishes have come true.  With The Wild Wigout Comix Gameboards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Land o' Sugar was one of seven crazy art boardgames produced by Scairy Hairy Toys, San Fransisco in the early to mid-1990s.  Each was created by a local underground artist and each was handmade, silk-screened and extremely limited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Land o' Sugar takes the player into the wonderful world of sugar.  The game requires one pound of hard round candies to play.  It came with a brightly colored silk-screened boardgame with a pinwheel pixie spinner and three mutant sugar eating game pieces. The object of the game was to get to the end without passing out from an over-indulgence of sugar or throwing up.  The game was created by illustrator David Fremont best known for his strange comics and silk-screened concert posters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
