			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring a bit of the exotic to your game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether your character's in the market for anamnesis alloy that remembers both its original, cold-forged shape and a secondary shape (so you can have two weapons in one), or distilled anathema, the alchemical sample of the desire to kill (so you can slay a hated racial enemy)&amp;mdash;this product has it covered. It focuses on bringing you new special materials that do not render the existing special materials useless and versatile power components, which alter or augment a spell's normal effects in new and interesting ways, it adds a bit more spice to a spellcaster's life. In addition, a number of these items affect the spells generated by magical items or alter the very nature of an item operates so that it become more than just a spell in a box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
