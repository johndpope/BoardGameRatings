							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">An Infamous Traffic: Prize Token Upgrade Deck</name>
									
			<description>Hollandspiel began using a small deck of cards for the &amp;quot;Prizes&amp;quot; tokens in their An Infamous Traffic game. This deck of cards replaces those tokens.  The thematic and often wryly humorous period illustrations chosen by Mr. Wehrle greatly enhance the game experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This upgrade kit is available for customers who purchased the game previously, before the cards were included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you purchased An Infamous Traffic after 02/20/2018, you don't need to purchase this upgrade as it's included with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
