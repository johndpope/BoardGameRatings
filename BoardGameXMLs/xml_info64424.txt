			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chunky Dungeons&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WorldWorks Games is proud to bring you Chunky Dungeons 1.5&amp;quot; with over 55 unique items. This landmark release represents the perfect solution for 1.5-inch based miniatures. Chunky Dungeons is the ultimate dungeoncrawl solution for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chunky Dungeons incorporates WorldWorks latest creation the &amp;quot;Pro Masterboard TM&amp;quot;. The new &amp;quot;Pro Masterboard TM&amp;quot; design allows you to &amp;quot;build as you play&amp;quot; only laying out walls and ground tiles as your players see them. Perhaps the most incredible element of the Pro Masterboard is the ability to &amp;quot;place and stick&amp;quot; your models making them unmovable even with the most forceful table bumping. Using the techniques described in detail within Chunky Dungeons you can literally flip your design upside down and not a single corridor or floor tile will move out of place! BELIEVE IT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the first time in 3-D cardstock we also bring you the added element of CURVED WALLS! With a surprisingly simple and speedy building process you'll be constructing incredible curved dungeons with ease. From a castle towers, dungeon wells or to the most mind-bending of curvy rooms and corridors the possibilities are truly endless!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add to this incredible system a flood of dungeon props with the meticulous and expertly crafted texture work WorldWorks has become famous for and you have one dungeon that's hard to beat!
