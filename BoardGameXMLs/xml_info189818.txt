							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Nucleus Roleplay System (Version 5)</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nucleus Roleplay System is the primary rules book for the Nucleus Modifiable Game System (both titles are used apparently interchangeably).  The system is designed to be a generic, universal rules system that is utilized with genre supplements to establish a campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the system have Basic Attributes (Agility, Deftness, Endurance, Intelligence, Might, Perception, and Presence).  Attributes have Values ranging from -30 to 30, with an &amp;quot;average&amp;quot; person having a zero score.  Attribute Values are purchased from a Proficiency Points pool.  A number of Derived Attributes are calculated from Basic Attributes, most of them relating to combat.  Characters have a Derived Attribute called Overall Life Points which are analogous to hit points in other systems.  Characters also have Traits (negative and positive).  Most opposed actions and combat elements use either a modified percentile roll (D100) or a type of action table that determines how many and which type of dice to roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
