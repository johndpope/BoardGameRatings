							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ruins of Trostenhal: Feast Hall</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago the Dwarves of Trostenhal were famous throughout the Fourteen Kingdoms as smiths, weaponmasters and runemages. People travelled to the grand hold of Trostenhal and the trade made the Dwarves wealthy and respected. What happened to ruin this is unclear - the scribes still struggle to piece together the accounts - but what is clear is that a huge cataclysm shook the mountain and destroyed Trostenhal, allowing the ice and frost to claim the ruined hold for it's own. Now only rubble and snow fill the lonely corridors, and perhaps the ghosts of those that lived and died there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A printable battlemap compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl game. The map can be used as a standalone battlemap, or combined with the rest of the Trostenhal set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A 20 x 20 map depicting the frozen Feast Hall of a ruined Dwarven hold. The stone tables and benches are still set with plates and pitchers, whilst a huge crack has ripped through the kitchen area and the Hall. Barrels and columns have fallen, as has part of the wall to reveal the caverns beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
