			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game combines two different genres: puzzle &amp;amp; rhythm. You take on the role of an up and coming break dancer who is trying to make a name for him/herself. You must dance well enough that you scare off the &amp;quot;beatniks&amp;quot;. Gameplay is designed so that the player must push the face buttons in time with the rhythmic flowing colored orbs. When the player successfully matches the rhythm, they are given the opportunity to remove some of the &amp;quot;beatniks&amp;quot;. This is the puzzle portion of the game. The &amp;quot;beatniks&amp;quot; surround the player's character and are represented by colored icons. You can get rid of them when you shoot out a matching colored icon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 6 character levels in the tournament. There is the option to play single-player, local or online co-op or versus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
