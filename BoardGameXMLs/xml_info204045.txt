			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight amazing pregenerated characters ready to explore new worlds!  &lt;br/&gt; Planetary Heroes is our latest set of 8 fully fleshed-out, ready-to-play pregenerated characters, created specifically to shine in the Legendary Planet Adventure Path. Featuring classic races and classes, as well as characters using the brand-new playable races in the Legendary Planet Player's Guide, these characters make ideal allies, rivals, cohorts, contacts, or even replacement PCs for any campaign roving into worlds not their own! Authors Neil Spicer and Jeff Provine proudly present:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Spinser Zayne, auttaine fighter/gunslinger&lt;br/&gt;    Floreisley Avergreen, chlorvian sorcerer&lt;br/&gt;    Kanor Delfina, tretharri cleric of Nimsharu&lt;br/&gt;    Girrun Snik, zvarr rogue&lt;br/&gt;    Rhydis Kolmainsus, human bloodrager&lt;br/&gt;    Tialua Re'Duoth, elf oracle of life&lt;br/&gt;    Kato Njalembe, human psychic&lt;br/&gt;    and last but not least, the devious but brilliant Omik &amp;quot;The Clever&amp;quot; Jetruk, dwarf alchemist (chirurgeon)/gunslinger (musket master)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built using the 20-point-buy method and with scaling notes for 15-point builds, these characters are not just piles of statistics. Each one is as much about story as combat, with robust links built in to each other as well as to the Legendary Planet Adventure Path, though every one easily stands on its own in any setting where heroes hail from far-flung worlds or face foes bringing doom from the falling skies. The crunch for every character more than measures up to its incredible flavor text, though, and when it&amp;rsquo;s time to throw down in combat none of these Planetary Heroes will be stepping to the sidelines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character includes a detailed backstory, roleplaying tips, special equipment, and links to the published campaign, including a campaign trait selection from the Legendary Planet Adventure Path player&amp;rsquo;s guide. Each also lists detailed level advancement information for their first few levels, with further suggestions for developing the character's long-term mechanical build. We haven't even mentioned the fantastic character portraits courtesy or the included foldable paper miniatures for every character!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
