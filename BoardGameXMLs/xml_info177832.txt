							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Planetary Champion Advanced Class</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Answer the call of duty!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protect your people, protect your world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defy WARSTAR and rebuff star-pirate incursions with the strength of both conviction and your strong arms. Become a Planetary Champion, a breed of hero powerful enough to be truthfully called a one man army! Planetary Champions are psionic superwarriors who are taught to unlock their true potential, and are empowered by their planet's ruling body to dispense justice, and to lead the world' defenses in times of crisis. Unbelievably confident and often tactically brilliant, Planetary Champions tend toward (justified) arrogance. Their self-assurance is the source of their powers. Morale-fed super abilities draw strength from the Champion's courage and conviction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many worlds have their own Champions and each is as unique as the world that created them. Some worlds dispense with conventional militaries entirely, depending on either one lone and incredibly powerful Planetary Champion or a small team of dedicated heroes. Other worlds place a Planetary Champion near the top of their world's military hieachy, allowing these legendary warriors to command armadas and vast hordes of conventional troopers. No matter if they fight alone or with a legion at their back, a Planetary Champion's courage never wavers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
