			<description>A football related target game. The target has 3 holes in it and a goal. The idea is to get the football into one of these scoring areas. You get 5 points if you get it past the goalkeeper, and 10, 15 and 20 respectively for the circular holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mode of getting the ball to the target is to use the footballer provided. His leg is attached to a spring so you can lever it backwards and then let go. If you are lucky, you might score some points. I expect a lot of practice is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The target says '50 UP' so I assume the first player to score 50 points, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
