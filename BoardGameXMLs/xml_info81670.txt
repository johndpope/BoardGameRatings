							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Myth: Roleplaying in the Lands of Mythic Fantasy</name>
									
			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The task of creating a roleplaying game is one thing, creating one in 24 hours is a task in itself. Trying to get clip art and everything else together to is a feat of pure madness. This is my attempt to make such a game. I thought back to my childhood long and hard, searching for ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the first thirty minutes of my looking for ideas I stumbled upon the Brothers Grimm book of fairy tales. I thought for a moment, its been done. Move on. But then after sitting there I said to myself what makes fairy tales and things like mythology so interesting?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After brainstorming for a short time I realized fairy tales, mythology and pulp heroes all have one thing in common. All the characters in these stories are usually larger than life and that's why people like them so much. They were flawed heroes who always over come the odds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will I succeed? Not going to be sure until this is done and people grab a copy and start to read. Welcome to the world of Mythica.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
