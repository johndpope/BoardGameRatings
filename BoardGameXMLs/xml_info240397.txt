							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fours</name>
									
			<description>Fours is a modern interpretation of the ancient Sumerian game The Royal Game of Ur.  While inspired by that game, the rules have been simplified allowing for an easy-to-learn game that still has elements of chance with a need for strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the original game, Fours is a race to move checkers through a course.  Opponents can knock each other off the course, but there are 'safe' spaces.  The 'fours' theme is evident throughout the game - dice yield a result of 1, 2, 3, or 4.  Safe spaces occur every 4 spaces. Each player has four checkers to run through the course.  A roll of 4 allows a player an extra roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most unique design elements of the game is the portability.  The game 'board' is actually a fabric game mat with a rubberized backing.  This allows it to conveniently fold and pack into a small pouch easily carried in a purse, backpack, or briefcase.  Unlike modern recreations of the game, a large, bulky wooden board is not required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
