The goal of the game is to win over the opponents by killing all the others cards by maneuvering his call girls with the limits and abilities dictated by the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a role (the pimp) managing each and every point his girls, divided between escort, street hookers and young hopefuls, each with her own peculiarities, parcel and final proceeds in the event of a knockout, and... subsequent sale of organs.&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a deck of cards, includes events (situations and accidents) and power-ups (health points and improvements). The goal is to defeat the opponent &amp;quot;pimp&amp;quot;, maneuvering his call girls with the limits and abilities dictated by the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two levels to play Squillo.
