							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shaman King: Power of Spirit</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game features the characters of the popular manga series, Shaman King as they fight for the chance to be the Shaman King, a shaman able to do whatever he likes. They each have their own reasons for doing so whether these reasons be benevolent or malicious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes control of Yoh, moving him around on a simulated board at first, then fighting his enemies in an arcade style fighter. This is one of the only games that molds these two game genres in such a way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
