			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Camp Til It Hurts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What more could a kid ask for than a fun-filled summer at good ol' Camp Fusketotulee? After all, Camp Fusko has everything you could ever want for an adventure packed vacation - a private lake, diving dock, canoes, archery, ropes course, volleyball pit, weenie roasts, endless hiking trails and the best s'mores in all of Minnesota. Oh sure, there's the mosquitos, but besides them and a homicidal axe-wielding serial killer named Crazy Ivan who's trying to chop everyone into itsy bitsy pieces, camp couldn't be better. In fact, it's so much fun you'll have to talk your mom and dad into letting you come back next year. If you're still alive, that is...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's Inside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summer Camp Nightmare is a complete adventure for Horror Rules, the Simply Horrible RPG, a horror comedy game of ridiculous proportions. This 38pg supplement is packed with everything you need to play, including Bad Guys, Cast, backstory, artwork, maps, Plot Pushers and enough Sequel Suggestions and Plot Twists to turn it into five adventures instead of one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
