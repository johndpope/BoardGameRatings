			<description>From the developer's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Money is a fast-paced and addictive card game based on the original tabletop Eurogame release by Reiner Knizia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start the game with six bills of random currency. Your goal is to concentrate your reserves into just two or three types of currency before the game ends. To do so, you must spend the money you already have. It takes money to make Money!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though Money is one of Reiner Knizia's deepest (and richest) card games, it's all been carefully fit into this iPhone release. Recolored bills make it easy to read your currency. Simple gestures allow you to examine your own hand and the bids of your opponents. Everything is animated, for a colorful play experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, six different AIs, each with their own personality, help make every game unique. You can slowly discover the AIs' strategies to improve your chances of winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Money is the first release in RPGnet's MobileEuroCard series, all of which share common gestures and animations, making it easy to dive into any game as soon as you've learned your first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
