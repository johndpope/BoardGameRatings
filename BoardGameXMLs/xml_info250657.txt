			<description>Each player has 3 frogs, he has to get from the starting spaces of their color at the bottom of the game board to the destinations of the same color at the top. Movement is determined with one die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the roll of a &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, a frog may advance from it's colored starting space to the firs green space of his race track. From there the frogs advance according to the numbers rolled. If a player rolls a &amp;quot;6&amp;quot; he may roll a second time. If a frog moves over one of the three picture strips the player may roll again, and has to move the same frog a second time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a frog lands on the 1st or 3rd picture strip it may only advance again at the roll of a &amp;quot;5&amp;quot;.
