							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Modern Armored Conflicts: 1970s</name>
									
			<description>M.A.C. (Modern Armored Conflicts) is a tactical land-combat simulation that covers (at least initially) the 1970s Central&lt;br/&gt;Front with the US, USSR, UK, and FRG forces well represented. The game scale is 3 minutes/turn, 250m per hex. The 'standard' unit is the Platoon, but individual squads, sections, or vehicles may be used as well (these are called 'Elements' in the game). The goal of the game design is to allow a game with up to 1 (or possibly 2) Battalions on each side but keep a sufficient level of detail that each major-caliber round fired is accounted for. The maps provided are based upon real locations in the Northern / Central German theatre covered by the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic counter represents a Platoon; each platoon has a number of Strength Points equal to the number of squads or&lt;br/&gt;vehicles in that platoon. The game system allows one to account for each major-caliber round fired without requiring&lt;br/&gt;the tedious book-keeping that often occurs in such detailed-level games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME CONTENTS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 x Rules Manual (~50 pages), 12 x Color Cardstock Reference Sheets, 10 x full-color Map Sheets (each 11&amp;quot; x 17&amp;quot;) (some&lt;br/&gt;maps are geomorphic, some are stand-alone), 2 x Ten-Sided Die, 1 x CD-ROM with &amp;gt; 200 user-printable Unit Data-Record&lt;br/&gt;Sheets / off-board Artillery Record Sheets / and Bonus Materials, 2 x 1/2&amp;quot; Counter Sheets (560 counters total), 12&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios included with guidelines on how to create your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
