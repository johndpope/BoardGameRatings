			<description>A Changing Landscapes game for piecepack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once upon a time, four civil engineers decided to hike up and down a famous mountain range in France. Unfortunately, they were better engineers than they were hikers, so they tried to make the adventure more interesting by terra-forming the rough mountainous ground into gently sloping paths. Using shovels, pickaxes and dynamite, the engineers slowly turned the mountain range into a beautifully sculpted landscape. Now, you can recapture the glory of those original engineers as they struggled to conquer the mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trail-blaze a path and be the first to hike your way to the top of your own mountain peak. In the basic version of this game, no player can attempt to climb his peak until all peaks are visible. Once all four peaks are visible, players hike toward their particular peak. The winner is the first player who reaches his peak during his hike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
