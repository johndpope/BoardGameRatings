			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Star Mage is a playbook for the Dungeon World roleplaying game, and the fifth of my Mage Revised series. The Mage is one of the most popular playbooks I have ever written, but it has its flaws - the class is too open ended, and is generally capable of solving problems on a larger scope than any other class can really confront. My solution was to pare down the class into multiple different classes, each built around a single Spell Focus. This class is a reimagining of a Mage with Spell Focus: The Clock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Star Mage lets you play as a creature from beyond the stars, with the strange and magical powers that come from your bizarre nature. You manipulate space with ease, creating small holes in the fabric of space. Reaching or leaping through these holes gives you unparalleled mobility and reach, which you can also grant to your allies. As you grow stronger, your abilities only get more and more bizarre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
