			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game works best with a lot of players in a casual atmosphere.  If you want a tighter story with fewer plot elements, you could have only about five players.  If you want a more chaotic story with a lot of people getting eaten by sharks and some plot elements that get dropped partway through the game, you could play with up to ten players.  These players do not need to know anything about roleplaying games or sharks.  However, if they don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about roleplaying games, it would be helpful to know something about improv theater or some other type of collaborative storytelling.  This game is appropriate for all ages.  There is no math.  You will also need some index cards or small pieces of paper and something to write with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action resolution uses a humorous implementation of a game similar to &amp;quot;rock-paper-scissors&amp;quot;.  This game went through only two stages in the competition but was considered &amp;quot;completed&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
