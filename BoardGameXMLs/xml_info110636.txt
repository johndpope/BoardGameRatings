			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though they each come from different backgrounds and though they each pursue their own methods, the famous warriors of the Dust Tactics: Allies Hero Pack all share a talent for wiping out Axis units. (Action Jackson and Johnny One-Eye were previously released in a limited manner through FFG's Game Night Kits.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action Jackson drops onto the battlefield as a British paratrooper, armored in a high-tech ASOCOM battle suit and equipped with two 60W Phaser Guns. Phaser technology may still be new, but when it all comes together, Action Jackson can blast through even the heaviest Axis walkers in a single instant. Meanwhile, The Priest prefers to operate up close and personal, where he's a sly expert with his dynamite charges, and Johnny One-Eye may not be the first badass to walk the Dust Tactics battlefields, but he's the first Hero with the skill to prove it. His Badass skill means he's not the type of guy who likes running out of ammunition while Axis forces close in around him. Johnny One-Eye and any squad he joins gain unlimited uses of their limited ammunition weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
