			<description>In the series of quiz games from DIDACTO, we, of course, had to include science. The modern era has been marked by scientific discoveries, and we must understand its main components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game will let you penetrate the world of geniuses and their inventions. Once immersed, not in Archimedes' bathtub, but in a fascinating universe in which you might perhaps be brought to exclaim &amp;quot;Eureka!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Translation from the instruction package)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Eur&amp;ecirc;ka!&amp;quot; is a game in which multiple players compete in trying to complete more of the 13 numbered sets of 4 cards than any other player. Every card contains several (around 5-10) trivia questions. After having distributed the cards evenly among players, gameplay starts. On his turn, a player will ask for a particular card of a set of which he has at least one other card. Its owner will ask the first question on the card - should that card ever be asked again, the second question will be asked, and so forth. Whenever a player answers correctly, the card is transferred to him; whenever a player completes a series or wrongfully answers a question, it becomes the next player in clockwise order's turn. The game ends either after all sets are completed, or after a set time deadline, to the players' choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions vary in difficulty, as some of them can easily be answered by any 6th grader while some others require an acute knowledge of particular disciplines. Mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, computer science and biology are all disciplines that this game addresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Description by BGG user jgag)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
