			<description>Years after the confinement of Azhi Dahaka (Zahhak) by Fereydun in Mount Damavand, the evil Deevs who were the commanders in the army of darkness led by Azhi Dahaka rose again in different parts of the ancient lands of Khunirath and rebelled against the humans who were celebrating the victory of the army of light. Each Deev formed a colony of its own and continued on bringing suffering to the human race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hitasp, the Golden Crown, who possessed numerous deadly magical skills, was among these Deevs and was seeking to build up its empire in the rocky lands of Faranbagh in Hara Berezaiti. Siavoshgard, the legendary village that had been the home of many Pahlavans was raided by Hitasp and his followers and in the battle, Garshasp&amp;rsquo;s brother, Oroxia, was killed while defending his ancestral home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Garshasp, the monster slayer and a grand son of Jamshid, starts out pursuing revenge for his brother&amp;rsquo;s blood by a journey towards the Hitasp's stronghold only to find out that something much more important has been taken in the raid of Siavoshgard and Garshasp&amp;rsquo;s bravery is to play a big role in the destiny of the world...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Garshasp: The Monster Slayer&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
