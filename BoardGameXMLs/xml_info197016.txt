							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Boatman&#039;s Dog</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Boatman&amp;rsquo;s Dog is a modest establishment along an underutilized trade route, but renowned for its cuisine. The proprietor and chef Angus Thickheel, a halfling, produces amazing dishes in his common room without formal training or even a kitchen. With simple tools, fresh ingredients and an almost supernatural ability to blend spices, Angus creates dishes that locals travel miles to taste.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Dog&amp;quot;, as the locals call it, used to be packed in the evenings with farmers and merchants jamming themselves into its small common room in order to sample that evening&amp;rsquo;s fare. Thickheel serves it directly from the stone fireplace that warms the room, with a bit of showmanship and flair. The Dog has a friendly rivalry with another nearby inn, The Coin. The Coin is a much more lavish inn with plenty of amenities but didn&amp;rsquo;t used to be as popular with the locals as Angus&amp;rsquo;s establishment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But lately, other than the nightly feast that takes place in the common room, The Dog rarely has any customers. Recently, the few boarders that Angus does get have gone missing. The rural inhabitants of the land surrounding the inn begin to whisper rumors about The Dog. Could Angus&amp;rsquo;s secret be the use of &amp;quot;unsavory&amp;quot; ingredients?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a party of 1st level adventurers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
