			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring on the Bad Guys!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Icons Adversaries is a collection of foes, fiends, and foils for use with 'Icons Superpowered Roleplaying, offering dozens of villain characters ready to use in your own Icons games. In its pages you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Masterminds! Powerful master villains able to challenge a whole team of heroes or serve as foes for major story arcs, from Rex Mundi, the self-styled king of the world, to the time-traveling Tempus Khan and the psionic Ultra-Mind! &lt;br/&gt;    Diabolic Duos! Villain team-ups like the mad love of Harlequin and Columbina, the rough-and-tumble Lasso and Buck Bronco, or Fire and Ice, the acrobatic Thermo-Couple.&lt;br/&gt;    Villainous Variety! You'll find all kinds of other villains to suit different roles and backgrounds, from alien threats like Karnifex to mystic menaces like Dirge, from mutated mercenaries like Tarpit, to martial artists like Hooded Cobra, and more. Chances are, you'll find a villain (or several!) to suit your needs. &lt;br/&gt;    Adventures! Each villain comes with ideas and possible adventures, meaning this book alone contains potentially hundreds of stories for your heroes!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Icons Adversaries also offers numerous examples of powers, qualities, and character creation in action, which you can use to inspire and create your own characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
