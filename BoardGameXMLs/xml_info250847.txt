			<description>A Cudgel-Level Scenario&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This morning brigands set upon you as you prepared breakfast. Still half-asleep, and not expecting such an assault in these relatively civilised lands you were unable to put up much of a fight. Fortunately these were good folk as far as brigands go, and their leader even complained to you how unhappy he was that this was the way he was forced to make a living. Apparently he was the illegitimate son of a Kaiinese noble, disinherited through ill fortune. They even left you your clothes and weapons, though nothing else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
