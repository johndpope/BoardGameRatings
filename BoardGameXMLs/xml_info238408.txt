			<description>Lords of the Motleyverse is set in the fantasy world of Krahgen where a dark prophecy has begun to unfold. The world&amp;rsquo;s mightiest heroes, sinister villains and mercenaries have all mobilized and are searching for magical relics that have the power to stop or advance the looming events. Krahgen is entering perilous times and it is going to take a coalition of heroes to save the world from the incoming threats. &lt;br/&gt;Lords of the Motleyverse is a 2-4 player, tactical, miniatures and dice skirmish game where players control squads of unique characters fighting for supremacy over treacherous battlefields. Every faction has a distinctive play style and every hero and villain is loaded with its own set of potent abilities. The game has ten built in scenarios and three different modes of play: Slaughter Box, King of the Arena and a Campaign mode. The object of the game is simple, destroy your opponents, collect relics, and be the last faction remaining on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat system is built around rolling dice and creating attack sequences from the results. The attacking player rolls five dice and lines them up from left to right to create an attack sequence and the defending player must match the dice facings in the exact order that the dice are arranged, in three rolls or less. Each unblocked facing on the dice inflicts damage and most importantly determines the direction which enemy models are pushed. Learning to optimize your dice combinations and utilizing the layout of the board is the key to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a randomized activation order that tends to create high risk, high reward situations and continuously opens fresh avenues for new tactics and strategies. The arena is full of danger and players must pay heed to the terrain itself. Mobile saw blades, pits, spikes and man eating Skull Columns litter the field and have the capability to inflict massive amounts of damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lords of the Motleyverse is a dynamic game of conflict and perseverance, packed full of action and mayhem, and designed to excel at casual and tournament play alike. The unpredictable activation order, specialized character abilities, vicious terrain features and ever changing circumstances guarantee that no game is ever the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
