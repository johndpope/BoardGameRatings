			<description>From the box...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adult Jigsaw Crossword Puzzle Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WUPS! is a game wherein some words of Anglo Saxon origin may be formed which are considered slang or vulgarisms.  While it is the object of the game not to form such words, it frequently happens.  These words may refer to body parts or body functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comprises a box containing a shelf with a round hole in it and a 36-piece jigsaw puzzle.  The jigsaw puzzle has sixty four letter words on it in a crossword puzzle grid.  Some of the words are repeats.  The same sixty words are on each side of the puzzle and the puzzle is cut so that the words are divided in half.  Many of the edge pieces may be interchanged and all of the interior pieces are interchangeable. The corner pieces are unique.  As players take turns reassembling the puzzle with pieces chosen at random, some embarrassing words may be formed.  The winner is the player who makes the fewest &amp;quot;naughty&amp;quot; words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
