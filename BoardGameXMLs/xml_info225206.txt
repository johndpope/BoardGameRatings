							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">VIXIV: The Game of Survival</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VIXIV is a strategic card game based on ecology and the people who manage it. You are new interns with the Department of Wildlife Management. Tasked with maintaining a specific area, you must create a thriving ecosystem while simultaneously thwarting your peers as you compete for limited space and the coveted attention of professional mentors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have built your map and draw your cards, you begin laying out your species and building your ecosystem. As the game progresses, your species will grow and thrive, earning you points and hopefully the attention of a mentor. Be warned though, everything can change with frightening speed. In just a few moments you may find yourself combating wildfires, succumbing to disease, or butting heads with your rivals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things quickly grow competitive as free space shrinks and your peers force your hand with actions capable of affecting the entire board. If you stay dedicated to your goals and you may wind up leading the group. Stay too focused though, and you may find yourself falling behind as the changes overwhelm your carefully laid plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
