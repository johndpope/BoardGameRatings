							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BOMB SQUAD</name>
									
			<description>Bomb Squad is a co-operative card game for two players.  Each player has a rack of five cards.  The cards have information on both sides.  The back side, which is only visible to the player, shows an X or O.  The front side, which is visible only to the other player, shows a number between one and five in one of five colors.  The goal of the game is to complete a grid of 25 cards - one of each number in each color - without using more than three cards that show an X on the back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, your options are (1) spend a clue token to give your partner a hint; (2) play a card from your rack; or (3) discard a card from your partner's rack.  Whenever you play a card or have one of your cards discarded by your partner, you must draw a new card to replace it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until (1) the deck runs out (at which time each player gets one final turn); (2) someone tries to play an unplayable card (thereby losing the game); or (3) the players complete their grid of 25 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
