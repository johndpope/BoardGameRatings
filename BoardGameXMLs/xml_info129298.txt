			<description>From the editors notes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a catalogue of some of the real characters being played&lt;br/&gt;today in Shadowrun, by people all over the world. Many of these characters are also in use on the ShadowTK role-playing mailing list. With this in mind, when using these characters as NPCs in your own campaign, be as true as possible to their original intent. In other words, be nice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These characters are intended to be very high powered players in the Sixth World. The increased Attributes x1.5 Optional Rule was used in a number of cases, and one character even has Delta-grade cyberware. There are also some &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; spells and a new house rule regarding how contacts get gear and information. This optional rules and spells will all be explained at the end of the chapter. In addition, all bonuses have all ready been added to statistics and skills, unless otherwise noted. If you still can&amp;rsquo;t find something, contact the individual who created the character via e-mail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And again, a special thanks to all those who contributed to this catalogue. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been able to do it without you (obviously). Some of you people are very sick... ;-) I may have changed something about your character, but I tried to keep with the original spirit of the character. And in some case, I exaggerated the personality traits to try and make the character more interesting and different. Not to mention in almost every case I made the character stronger. In some cases, what seem like mistakes (such as a wrong birthplace) was deliberate deception. In other words, Counselor and friends got it wrong, and they don&amp;rsquo;t know any better. In almost all cases their &amp;quot;errors&amp;quot; have been addressed in the Notes: section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A very special thanks to Mike, Dave, and Scott. We&amp;rsquo;ve burned a lot of karma on each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
