			<description>Cluck... Cluck... Quick! There are six hard boiled eggs to eat but only 5 cups on the table! Anything goes - well almost. The aim is to get your egg into the cup using chop sticks. No easy task. Who will be quick with their hands and not left holding the last egg and which of you will be the most skillful?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the aid of two sticks try to quickly position your eggs in one egg cup.  At each turn a player is eliminated because it lacks a egg cup at the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;Be quick at the end, there will be more than one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;5 Wooden Egg Cups&lt;br/&gt;6 Wooden Eggs&lt;br/&gt;12 Wooden Sticks&lt;br/&gt;Game Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
