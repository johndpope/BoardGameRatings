							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Corner Kick!</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developed over four years by the Father and Son team of Bob and Jeff Wiltrout, &amp;quot;Corner Kick!&amp;quot; is an innovative yet elegantly simple and straightforward game that produces not only games equal to the energy and excitement of the real thing, but even the elements of tactics and strategy that give it depth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules have been extensively play tested and enjoyed at Conventions such as HistoriCon and Cold Wars for years, and they are now ready for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the basic rules, there are extensive Designer's Notes which help explain the theories applied, and show how the actual tricks--some dirty!--of the game apply to the table top as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playable with miniatures in several scales now available from a growing list of providers, the rules come with the full particulars of how to build your own &amp;quot;Pitch,&amp;quot; Movement Sticks, and other accessories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two card stock Goal Cages for self assembly are provided with the book to start you off, as well as Team Rosters and a form for a play-by-play Game Record to note Stoppages and major events--a unique permanent history of your games and good times! A set of color Deflection Templates are included as well for determining where wild shots go, ricochets off the Goal frames, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a &amp;quot;Cheat Sheet&amp;quot; holding some 90% of all that's needed to play the game without having constantly to reference the rulebook. The 8.5&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot; book itself is 62 pages, with three of full color photos of games and miniatures. Figure and other resources are provided to help fans of the &amp;quot;The Beautiful Game&amp;quot; get started immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To quote from Bob Wiltrout's Introduction, &amp;quot;In our experience, people who play this game once play it again and again. In three years of play-testing, nobody has ever played Corner Kick and walked away saying, &amp;ldquo;This just doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like soccer.&amp;rdquo; And I&amp;rsquo;m betting you won&amp;rsquo;t be the first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re going to enjoy this!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
