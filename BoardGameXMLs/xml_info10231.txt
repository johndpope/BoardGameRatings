			<description>In this Roll and Move game, players use Looney Tunes characters molded in play dough as player pieces. They may use game components to smush their player pieces to successfully deal with challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to stretch to the &amp;quot;That's all folks!&amp;quot; space wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box&lt;br/&gt;It's a wacky race around the world of Looney Tunes.  Mold your favorite Looney Tunes character in colorful smush 'em dough and you're off.  But watch out, there are Acme devices waiting to smush you, a door to slide under, instant Martians to bowl over and the Tasmanian devil is waiting to twist you.  Be first to stretch to the 'That's all Folks' winning space and you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
