			<description>A murder mystery dinner-style party game in which each player is assigned a role and players try to find out who the murderer is. Each player has his/her own information booklet, and five game rounds are spent discussing clues and inconsistencies until players vote on who to accuse of the murder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cognac, France, in 1938: The ladies and gentlemen have left the property for the weekend. The remaining employees are jumping at the chance to have a pompous dinner. Butler, cook, assistant cook, gardener, chambermaid and nanny - everyone is preparing for the occasion when a murder is discovered and the killer has to be found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
