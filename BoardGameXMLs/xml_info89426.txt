							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Penguins of Madagascar: Return to the Habitat</name>
									
			<description>An elite strike force with unmatched commando skills!  The Penguins of Madagascar have a mission, to get back to their habitat before the Zoo opens.  Help Rico, Kowalski, Private and Skipper get back to the Habitat and WIN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For anyone who love the Penguins, this simple game is for you.  You play one of the four Penguins of Madagascar and your goal is to reach your habitat base as fast as you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game curve is fast as it is geared to a younger generation, though is can be enjoyed by any age.  Ostensibly, this is a simple roll-and-move game, but the added aspects of the magnets in the board and the pieces adds an interesting variability not seen in many games.  The idea is a simple one: get to home base.  The difference is that there are several &amp;quot;turning&amp;quot; points on the board that alters you path of direction.  Either you move ahead, jump forward, or are send backwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall a game that can be played and enjoyed by all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
