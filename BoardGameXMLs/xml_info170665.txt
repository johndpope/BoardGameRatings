							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The New World: A Colonial 4x Game</name>
									
			<description>The year is 1600. You've been appointed Governor of a small struggling settlement in the New World with instructions to explore and settle these new lands for the Glory of your King and country. However, your nation is not alone in these new lands. For your colony to survive you will have to bargain with the powerful Native tribes and deal with your Nation's enemies who also have settlements here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New World is a 4x tile laying game for 3-4 players set in Colonial North America. Players can either play the French, English, Spanish, or Dutch with the goal of building your empire and collecting Glory for the Crown. Since each game will feature random exploration by laying tiles, no two games will play the same. &lt;br/&gt;You will win this game by exploring, building your settlements by claiming and purchasing land from the Native tribes, and eventually coming into conflict with your country's competitors in the New World. All this will build up Glory Points in the name of your King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays quickly with each player on their turn having a choice of a single action from either:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Exploring: Paying to launch expeditions to place tiles, claim/purchase land, and placing influence markers (representing traders and missionaries) in the hopes of Allying and trading with the tribes.&lt;br/&gt;2) Economic Turn: Building up your Colony by creating new settlements, building Forts, repairing settlements that were damaged, maintaining troops, and collecting wealth from taxes and trade &lt;br/&gt;3) War: Eventually you will have to deal with the enemies of your King here in the The New World. If you choose this action this is where you will raise your armies and send them across the frontiers. Be forewarned though. War is not cheap. You will need a strong economy to wage successful war. There is only so much that the Crown can do to help your fledgling colony.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New World is buffed by a large Event deck that brings out the historical events of the times. It also serves to pace the game by having Events that represent the Peace Treaties that ended the big European Wars that spilled over into North America. Whenever a Peace Event is drawn, there will be a few turns of truce and Glory Points will be awarded based on the number of Settlements, the number of claimed territories, and by your Alliances with the Native Tribes. Once 3 Peace Events are drawn the game will be over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is rather unique by it's Exploration/Tile laying mechanic, it's quick engaging turns, it's streamlined easy rules including a nice combat resolution, the ability to bounce back from a disaster, and and a unique, more historical, representation of the native tribes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
