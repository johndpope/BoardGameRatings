			<description>Quoted from the cover: &amp;quot;A Stock Exchange Board Game.  The authentic game about REAL companies quoted on the International Stock Exchange, London&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a monopoly style game but trading in shares, using actual share prices over a 52 week period.  The rule book consists of 4 small pages.  Then there is a larger 8 page booklet of actual share prices. Finally there is a 46 page booklet describing the companies referred to in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the game seems to be to introduce players to share trading and encourage them to use the Daily Telegraph for their real-life trading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though nicely produced, counters for moving round the board are not included and there is no guidance on how many players are expected to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
