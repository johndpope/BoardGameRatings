			<description>Game Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number of players: 3&amp;ndash;5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game: The first player to have his color disk atop the majority of trilithons in play is the winner. That would be 2 trilithons in a 3 player game, 3 in a 4 player game etc..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment: The game board. The neutral (grey) figure. One Trilathon per player. The entire card deck.&lt;br/&gt;Each player will need:&lt;br/&gt;A player figure. 10 corresponding colored bars. Enough corresponding colored disks to top the majority of trilithons in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever has the most bars of any color has sway over a trilithon. Each player began with a trilithon because they had more bars of their own color than anyone else.&lt;br/&gt;If at any time a player has more of an opponent's color bars than any other player, he/she replaces that player's color disk with his/her own atop a trilithon.&lt;br/&gt;When ever one player has his/her disks atop the majority of trilithons that player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
