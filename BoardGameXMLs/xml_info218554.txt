			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the near future, many envisioned a time where machines would integrate themselves increasingly into society. The lines between man and machine would blur. This division, as many expected, occurred as machines became more and more human. The eventual fear arose when they would become so human as to confuse when humanity ended and machine began. As machines evolved into becoming more human, humanity itself, could discover itself being pushed aside, first by the lack to need to exist, and finally, by force. The dystopian vision people believed would occur often ended with machines rising up to take the next step in the evolutionary ladder above us. Thankfully, this vision proved wrong, but not in the way imagined...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fan-made adaptation of the media franchise is based on the d20 Modern rules system, but also incorporates contents from Cyberpunk 2020.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
