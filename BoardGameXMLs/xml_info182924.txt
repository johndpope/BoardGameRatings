			<description>Treeker: The Lost Glasses is a first-person adventure game, with puzzle and platform elements. In the game, the player needs to use a pair of glasses in order to see mysterious objects left behind by some sort of ancient civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Across the centuries, pirates and treasure hunters mysteriously appear with a pair of uncanny glasses. But suddenly as they are revealed, they disappear from sight leaving no hint of what that object truly is. They must be the same glasses, in different times, but you are the only one to realize that, and travel in search for this treasure, to unfold its secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use the lens to advance in the game, and discover the secrets of these forgotten islands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
