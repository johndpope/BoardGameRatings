			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is written for exactly two players, one of which is designated the game master.  The GM controls &amp;quot;The Girlfriend&amp;quot; and other aspects of play, while the sole player controls &amp;quot;The Boy&amp;quot;, who is defined as &amp;quot;a pretty run of the mill schmuck&amp;quot; who is completely unable to understand his girlfriend.  Even when she's trying to be blunt.  Characters have Stats (Attributes), but they are not similar.  The Boy has Suspicion and Health, the Girlfriend has Hopelessness and Conspicuousness.  These have values that are randomly generated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
