			<description>Simple but interesting word game that includes bluffing, based on traditional students word games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players consecutively add letters (from a small selection) to one of three frames, creating fragments of words...or do they?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because you can add a letter without knowing a word that actually contains the created fragment. As long as the next player doesn't challenge the fragment, you are save.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players score a point for successfully adding the last letter that fits into a frame and for winning a challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The challenge: Choose one of the frames and ask the previous player to name a word that contains the respective fragment (in the exact order of the letters). If he can, he wins a point. If he can't, you win a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends in a &amp;quot;best of three&amp;quot;, that means, whoever scores the second point, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
