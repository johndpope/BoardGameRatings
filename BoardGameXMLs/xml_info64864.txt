			<description>&amp;quot;RPG-like card game for 2 players, based on [Lloyd] Krasner's Superhero Slugfest Card Combat rules.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each player gets one deck. A deck represents a party of adventurers, all its members, and all of their special abilities. A party has 6 Members. A deck has 60 cards.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each hero is represented by 10 cards: Five of these are Character cards. The five character cards have a Force value and the name of the hero. The other five are Ability cards. The five ability cards have a Force modifier and the name of the hero which belongs to.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players fight a series of battles through card play. To win the game you must kill or wound all 10 of your opponent's heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This free, online rules set describes the components that you will need to create in order to play.
