			<description>Intro from the rulebook.  The playing board represents a farmyard.  It is playtime in the farmyard for the animals and they are all coming in from the fields to play together.  The hens only want to play with the other hens, the ducks with the other ducks and so on.  But Old Macdonald is busy working in the farmyard and keeps leaving his buckets in the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary. The object of the game is to be the first player to gather his or her 4 animals to play together in a square formation.  Each animal starts on a separate side of the board and is moved across the farmyard (in the form of a grid) by rolling the dice.  When a six is rolled, Old Macdonald and his buckets can be placed in the way of the other players' animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
