			<description>The entire deck is dealt out and one person is left holding the chair. A 10 point card that can only be played if it's the last card in your hand. Players take turns rolling the die, which has 4 colored music notes on it and 2 black notes. When rolled you may play a music card of the specific color from your hand and then take the action written on the card. Some cards allow you to steal a card or give a card away or make everyone shuffle their cards around the circle. In the 21+ version of the game each card also has a drink ability which may allow you to give a drink or even make everyone take a drink. Designed to be played with many people this game can take up to 10 players and is a quick fast paced party game. The game continues and players hand sizes decrease the elusive chair becomes easier to spot but only one person will end the game with it. The question remains will it be played for points or will it be stuck in someones hand for negative points?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
