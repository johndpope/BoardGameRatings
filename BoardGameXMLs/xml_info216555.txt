			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game where you insult your friends&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 10 cards and 5 lives. The object of the game is to use your cards to create hilarious insults that score damage points that remove the &amp;quot;lives&amp;quot; from your opponents. The last player left with lives wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has two words are phrases on it and an associated point value with each one. Play proceeds clockwise starting with the player left of the dealer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the player can either play an insult on anyone at the table OR exchange any amount of cards from their hand for new cards. An insult is 4 or more cards that when read aloud, form a complete sentence that insults another player. Example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOUR JACKED, BUCK-TOOTHED GRANDFATHER LIKES TO SPOON WITH A NEUROTIC, TINY CHICKEN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player lays down the cards that forms their insult, points to a player they are insulting, and reads the sentence aloud. You imply the punctuation with how you speak the sentence. So say it like you mean it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You then total the points on the read side of each card in the insult (upper right corner).&lt;br/&gt;If this total is 5 or more, the insulted player loses 1 life.&lt;br/&gt;If the total is 10 or more, the insulted player loses 2 lives&lt;br/&gt;If the total is 15 or more, the insulted player loses 3 lives, AND the insulting player takes one of the lost lives and adds it to their own lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are &amp;quot;Reversal&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Redirect&amp;quot; cards that the insulted player can play to deflect an insult. The insulting player can play a &amp;quot;BOOM&amp;quot; card at the end of their insult to make it unreversable and unredirectable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Argle Bargle is a casual game, but it takes more than luck to best your opponents. It requires creativity and strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no dirty or offensive words in this version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
