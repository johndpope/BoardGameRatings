			<description>&amp;quot;I Love Katamari (塊魂モバイル Katamari Damashii Mobairu, lit. &amp;quot;Clump Spirit Mobile&amp;quot;) is a third-person puzzle-action video game published by Namco for the iOS. It is a continuation of the Katamari Damacy series of games. It was released worldwide in the App Store on December 14, 2008. In this game, the King of the Cosmos instructs the game's protagonist &amp;mdash; the Prince &amp;mdash; to gather as many objects as possible to grow a highly-adhesive ball called a Katamari large enough so that he can pick up special objects to bring to the King so that he can regain his memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is identical to that of Katamari Damacy, where the player rolls a highly-adhesive ball called a Katamari, collecting various objects of increasing size until it becomes large enough to transform into a star. The game utilizes the specialized technology from the iPhone and iPod Touch in which players tilt the device to move the Katamari across the playing field. I Love Katamari received mixed reviews. While it has been praised for its game presentation, it has also been criticized for performance and control issues. The performance and control issues were improved in an update, but not entirely fixed.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, I Love Katamari , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
