			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stupid, wild, hedonistic, and chaotic; goblins are everything man wishes to move beyond. While man can be said to constantly advance and move upwards and forwards, goblins are akin to pigs - content to wallow in mud and filth. Nature was not kind to goblins; they breed like rabbits, have lifespans slightly above a small dog, and explode when exposed to sunlight. Nevertheless, goblins can always be found on the fringes of society, surviving on the cast-off refuse of mankind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ancient pact keeps goblins from getting too much underfoot. One night a year humans lock their doors, board up their windows, and allow the goblins to run amok with no consequence. This wild night is the highlight of a goblin&amp;rsquo;s year, and each crew spends the months leading up to it picking the perfect location, planning glorious acts of recklessness, and scheming to seize the most choice of treasures from the world of man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night has fallen. The Van is in perfect running condition, or as good as a van built by goblins can be. The world stretches before you, young goblins. Run wild!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
