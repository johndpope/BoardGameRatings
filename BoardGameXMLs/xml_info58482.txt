			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ms. Rush's latest game for The Brewery is InTERRORgation: A Little Game about Big Questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movie aficionados and crime show fans understand this: the Interrogation is one of the greatest tropes in drama. Notable movies with interrogations are Usual Suspects, Payback, Marathon Man and just about any Hitchcock film. When on television, they can be seen in the Prisoner, Columbo, nearly every episode of Law and Order, and just about any other crime drama. In these and other media, the forms of interrogation are familiar, such as the classic scene (of late-night, hard-boiled fame) including a table, a chair, an overhead light bulb, and cigarettes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;InTERRORgation contains rules and ideas for role playing sessions designed to unnerve players as they play the roles of suspects. The players use interrogation scenes and flashbacks to determine the past as they struggle through the present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;InTERRORgation is a &amp;quot;shot,&amp;quot; a small game with the rules you need to play and all the nonsense stripped away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;InTERRORgation comes in an unique format. It's difficult to describe -- you just have to see it to believe it. Think manilla envelopes, torn and forgotten documents you find in waste bins... you get the picture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
