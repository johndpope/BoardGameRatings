			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1822 &amp;mdash; Singapore, a young trading hub is undergoing urban redevelopment better known as the Jackson Plan. Settlers from different ethnic backgrounds have brought their beliefs and culture to this new land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legends &amp;amp; Lore is a competitive horror mystery board game based on true stories passed down by generations. You play the role of an investigator searching for clues to solve paranormal cases. The clock starts ticking once the night claims its first victim. You will require all the knowledge you have gleamed from your investigation to hunt down this legendary horror before the darkness overwhelms you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During every round of the game, players place investigation tokens on various locations to investigate them. Depending on the location being investigated, players may gain clues, hunt cards (improve one's own attributes), find the Authority token (becoming the starting player for following round), or pick up case files. Solving cases result in rewards and, more importantly, valor points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the first &amp;quot;Untimely Revelations&amp;quot; case card is revealed, the Horror Track is triggered; at the start of every subsequent round, it moves up one space. When the Horror Track reaches 7, the game ends and the player with the highest Valor score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
