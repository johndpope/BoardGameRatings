			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;In Pocket Odyssey players assume the roles of legendary heroes embarking on epic quests, defeating monsters, finding loot and pretty much anything the players mind can imagine. One of the players is chosen at the beginning of the game to be &amp;ldquo;the storyteller&amp;rdquo;, they use innovative quest building cards to help them create a quest for the other players on the fly. Each of the other players assume the role of a single hero, they get to create who that hero is and then how that hero interacts in the storytellers world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pocket Odyssey is designed to be portable, the first micro RPG ever, measuring 1in. thick, 3.5in. tall and 5.5in. wide, this game will quite literally fit in your pocket (the Collector's Edition is in a larger box).
