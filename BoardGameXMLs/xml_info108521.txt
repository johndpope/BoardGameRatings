							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ESPN Speed World</name>
									
			<description>ESPN Speed World is a Super NES and Sega Genesis video game. The cover art has the sponsors and the manufacturers of the race cars airbrushed out due to licensing concerns. While they use the 1969 Ford Fairlane racing chassis, it is impossible to make out which vehicles belong to either the Chevrolet, Ford, or the now-defunct Pontiac brand name.  There are not even decals to remind the player that these are NASCAR Cup Series vehicles.  This also had the side effect of attracting gamers who are interested in cars in general, not just fans of stock car racing.  The title screen of the video game was partially inspired by the 1993 running of the First Union 400 racing event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game involves the player controlling NASCAR Winston Cup stock cars as they do laps around various oval tracks, road courses, and superspeedways that are based on the actual NASCAR circuits of the 1990s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All stock cars in the game have the capability to go up to 200 miles per hour (approximately 322 kilometers per hour). The object of the game is to get as close to first place as possible. This game uses Dr. Jerry Punch and an interactive pit crew to simulate the feeling of racing during the 1993 Winston Cup season Like in most racing games, being in the top positions gives the player more points than being in the bottom positions. Stock cars can be customized with a choice of colors and styles.  The real-life drivers of this era are missing because the game only has an ESPN license and not an official NASCAR license&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;ESPN Speed World&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
