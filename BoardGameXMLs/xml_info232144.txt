			<description>&amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t lose hope. Without hope, then you have nothing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the hit novel, After Everyone&amp;rsquo;s Dead, this game pits a team of heroes against a hoard of zombies. Choose your side in the fight, a hero trying to get to the safe house or a zombie trying to turn all humans into flesh eating zombies like themselves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever want to take out a hoard of your friends who turned into zombies?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever find yourself as a zombie trying to kill your friends?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In After Everyone&amp;rsquo;s Dead the game, now you can!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two teams, one human one zombie battle against each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Customize the board however you want! With thousands of board layout combinations, every game is a new adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play on a small layout with a few friends for a short fun game, or a larger layout for a more open experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use weapons like guns, hammers, and rockets to take out your enemies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be careful though because a human might switch teams if they die, turning into a blood thirsty zombie!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, the humans must get the key and make their way to the safe house. For the Zombies to win all they have to do is eat every human brain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So do you have what it takes to survive a zombie outbreak? Or do you have what it takes to devour your friends?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
