Now you can explore your inner architect in the comfort of your palm of the hand. No more winds, pets, or family members to destroy your creations!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With more than two decks of cards and unlimited time, you can compete with people around the world (online score submission will be added in the future versions) for now &amp;mdash; top ranking with screenshots available now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beautifully designed game, with accurate physic rules and an undo feature to give you a chance to correct small mistakes not to ruin an entire tower you&amp;rsquo;ve spent hours to build.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
