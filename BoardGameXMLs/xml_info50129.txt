							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orcslayer</name>
									
			<description>Six young warriors -- sent to do the work of thousands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generations ago, the orc-hordes swarmed east into the peaceful kingdom of Caithness. Now they're coming back. Last time, it took an army to stop them. This time, your lord is sending you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orcslayer is the first combat adventure for Man to Man. It's both a combat game and a roleplaying adventure. Nine linked combat scenarios are divided by roleplaying &amp;quot;interludes&amp;quot; -- a whole new concept in adventure supplements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orcslayer also includes the NPC Reaction Table from GURPS; random encounters; four new maps (double-sided Castle Keep, Castle Wall that can be duplicated to completely surround the Keep, and Cavern); and 15 pre-generated NPCs of several different races. The book is suitable for three-hole punching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orcslayer is set in the fantasy kingdom of Caithness -- which can become part of any GM's game-world. Further adventures will use the same background, allowing the adventure to continue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But first, you must survive Orcslayer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
