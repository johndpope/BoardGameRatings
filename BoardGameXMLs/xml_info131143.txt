			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In 1882, the first of the colonists came here with Sir William Atherkell, through the portals he had discovered. None of them knew what they were getting into. They didn&amp;rsquo;t know they were crossing into a land of terror, wonder, and magic.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In 1883, those same colonists were witness to a force that tore the sky and shook the earth. Sir Atherkell was never seen again. The portals closed forever. They were trapped here. Then the Grimm and the Fair Ones came, and life changed forever.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The colony split into seven nations, each one with its own agenda, each one believing it knew how to protect us from the faeries. Each one with a different perspective on the world. The fragile peace has lasted to this day, though it has been strained even at the best of times.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You have been sent to Ellsborne because a new discovery has changed everything. The Cauldron has the power to bring people back from the dead. But they come back changed, altered by their experience.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Your job is to act as your nation&amp;rsquo;s diplomats, warriors, scouts, and scientists. You are here to make a name for yourself. And maybe, just maybe, your discoveries will save us all from the slavering maws of the Grimm and the machinations of the Fair Ones.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Godspeed, ladies and gentlemen. May you find whatever it is you are looking for.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Beyond the Ӕther! This is an experimental theater game being run in the Pacific Northwest. Glad you could join us!&lt;br/&gt;This is a game where you are the actor, the writer, and the audience all at the same time. You take on the role of a character in Ellsborne, a fictional town deep in the wilds of another world. You create the character to play, create the story you want to tell, and share it with your fellow players.&lt;br/&gt;This rulebook will guide you through the &amp;ldquo;stage directions&amp;rdquo; of the game, including the way to engage in safe combat with another character if you so choose. It is important that you read this rulebook in its entirety, so that you can understand how to help your fellow players create their stories. There are other books which are available on beyondtheaether.com which will help you find your particular story inspiration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
