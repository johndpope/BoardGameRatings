			<description>Designer's Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A while ago I released a PWYW product called Execution Corner, it was a small site with personality. It was meant, like my micro-adventures, to be easily dropped into a campaign if the GM needed something to throw at the players as they traveled. Possum Stop is in that same vein. It's a in between place that folks can stop at, ride through or pick up an adventure or two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a simple three structure location with a home of a potato farmer, a small tavern and a odd shrine dedicated to the possum god.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Possum Stop is a tiny location that is halfway from here-to-there. It features the Calugula Tavern, Borden&amp;rsquo;s Farm and the Possum Chapel. Folks stop here to get water for their horses, ale for themselves and occasional ask for the blessing from the nocturnal nature god, Posimium the Possum God.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Micro Location, published by Tim Shorts on his Patreon page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
