			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play this game as a zombie apocalypse survivor, seeking out supplies to survive, or as match against other players.   A first person shooter, you start with a handgun and box of bullets, but can craft items or just pick them up from houses.   You die often and can re-spawn easily.   The game has crude graphics, typical controls, and basic action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 'game' is controversial since it was put together from pieces of the UnitZ developer kit under the Unity Engine.  While FieldZ and Day Survival Begins did not make it past the Greenlight process, Uncrowded did and was sold as a cheap regular game on Steam.  This called into question the use of these developer kits and the entire Steamlight selection process for indie game developers.  Also, since developers make money on any card sold on Steam, selling the game cheaply and depending on the cards as a revenue stream has supported what is commonly seen as a Unity ripoff given legitimacy by Steam publication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
