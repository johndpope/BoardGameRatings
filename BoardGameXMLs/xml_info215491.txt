							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vow of Honor Roleplaying Game Quick Start Rules</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uphold your vows to the Tenets of Honor and become a paragon of justice in a broken, cruel world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick Start format: this three page Quick Start has everything you need to get started right away, including character creation and gameplay rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Sasara, your home, is broken and depraved. Despots rule over isolated city-states, indifferent to the suffering and squalor of the people. In the shadows of the enigmatic Ruins &amp;ndash; the last vestiges of a prosperous era long forgotten &amp;ndash; the vile terrorize the innocent few without fear of retribution. Until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are an Arbiter, protector of all that is good in Sasara. Only as you embody the Tenets of Honor will you be empowered to protect the weak, avenge the victims of the wicked, and unlock the knowledge of the ancient Forebears to usher in a new age of peace. Will you take the Vow of Honor? Will you do what is necessary to save your home?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vow of Honor is a tabletop roleplaying game focusing on the Arbiters of Fasann: icons of justice sworn to the Tenets of Honor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primary Design Focus: Playing morally obligated characters in a world that makes moral obligations exceedingly difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why play Vow of Honor? It&amp;rsquo;s a game designed specifically for one reason: to play skilled warrior judges sworn to a strict honor code in a world full of dishonor. The system is fast and flexible, the setting is unique and supported by the rules, and playing as an Arbiter is an often resonating experience. You get to be a hero (fallen or not), and the game supports and encourages that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting Highlights: Extremely distant dystopia focusing on humans living on the remnants of an artificial planet that has malfunctioned and decayed over thousands of years. The Arbiters emerged as the counter to a culture of brutal pragmatism and dishonor, surviving in the shadow of the Forebear Ruins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;System Focus: characters gain strength through a combination of skill and adherence to their code of Honor. The gameplay integrates with the narrative, guides character action, and creates morally charged scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
