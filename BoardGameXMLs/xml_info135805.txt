							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trig</name>
									
			<description>Trig is the root form of a suite of three games collectively entitled The Summer-House Floor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a centrifugal connection game played on the Colour A and Colour B pathways of a regular, 127-cell hex-hex board coloured non-contiguously in Colour A, Colour B and Colour C (Colour C at the corners), with a single black cell - known as the Pillar - at its centre. The board is empty at start of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two players, Black and White, take turns occupying with pieces of their own colour exactly one vacant cell which must be adjacent to the Pillar and/or to at least one occupied cell.  If a placement completes an equilateral triangle of any size whose other two vertices are friendly pieces already in place AND whose centre is occupied by an enemy piece, the latter is removed from the board and replaced with one of the mover's own colour. (Where a placement enables multiple captures just one of these must be chosen, and 'cascade' capture is never permitted.) Victory is achieved by completing a continuous string of one's own pieces which, however circuitously, links the Pillar to the edge of the board or forms a loop enclosing the Pillar somewhere within it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although demonstrably not undrawable, Trig has never produced a draw in actual play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
