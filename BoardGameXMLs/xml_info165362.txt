							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Weeping Crater</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rain rises out of the Weeping Crater and falls upon the land along the rim. Lush farms there feed the Elven Commonwealth. It&amp;rsquo;s a friendly area. Elves and non-elves live here, not as equals, but, at least, side by side. Don&amp;rsquo;t venture down the crater, though. It&amp;rsquo;s not safe. Wait for maps. If you can&amp;rsquo;t wait, cartographer Amyian is on the job right now and you could join her. She&amp;rsquo;s got a whole entourage &amp;ndash; adjunct artists as well as lots of adventurers sturdy enough to brave the unknowns down below. Join her if she&amp;rsquo;ll have you. A few words of caution, though. There&amp;rsquo;s trouble brewing between the Elven Supremacists and the lesser nationals in the rimlands. And there&amp;rsquo;s a young necromancer to keep sights on. Don&amp;rsquo;t take him lightly. So, caution, all around. But check out the lake. Rumor says the beach is Ulgdish spirits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
