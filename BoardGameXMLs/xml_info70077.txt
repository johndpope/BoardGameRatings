							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 More Calamitous Curses</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;100 More Calamitous Curses follows the original 100 Calamitous Curses product with 100 new unusual and interesting curses the Castles &amp;amp; Crusades Castle Keeper can use in his campaign. These can be bestowed upon player characters through mischance and misfortune or used by player character clerics and wizards on hapless non-player enemies. While designed for use with Castles &amp;amp; Crusades, the curses are easily adapted to any fantasy role-playing game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few of these curses are of the immediately deadly sort, save perhaps to 1st level characters; they are all designed to fall within the parameters set by the bestow curse spell, the reverse of the remove curse spell which is useable as a 3rd level clerical spell or 4th level wizard spell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for removing curses and details for including cursed scrolls in treasure troves are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
