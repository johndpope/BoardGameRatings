			<description>Dwarves in Trouble is an easy and dynamic non- collectible card game. The participants play the role of dwarf treasure seekers who decided to pay a visit at a dragon&amp;rsquo;s den while the dragon was away. They managed to get inside. Unfortunately, while they were plundering the treasure, the dragon return unexpectedly. Certainly, it will not be polite towards anybody caught stealing its possessions. It is a common knowledge that dwarfs tend to be greedy and it would be considered a dishonour to simply throw away the precious stuff. For that reason you need get rid of the treasure in a clever way&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to dispose of the gold completely or to have the fewest Gold coins the moment the Dragon arrives. As we know, dragons have the sixth sense that helps them localise gold and valuables. The dragon will focus on the most greedy treasure hunters. The arrival of the beast will cause such a confusion that only one dwarf will be able to escape and others will be burnt to ashes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three kinds of cards in the deck:&lt;br/&gt;dwarf cards- the ones you play in your round (a coin symbol),&lt;br/&gt;counteraction &amp;ndash; the ones you play to respond to other players cards&amp;rsquo; effects (a shield icon), dragon&amp;rsquo;s card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has its own name (usually a dwarf quotation) and a graphic symbol of its effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game setup&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the cards carefully. Put the Dragon card at the bottom of the Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player collects 20 gold coins and draws 4 cards from the top of the Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place the remaining gold next to the Deck. From now on it is called the Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The person who is most generous starts the game. Continue playing your turns clockwise. At the beginning of his or her turn each player draws a number of cards so they have a total of 4 cards in their hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In their turns the players can:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    play any number of cards and resolve its effects,&lt;br/&gt;    discard any number of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Important: the amount of gold and number of cards is known to all the players during the whole game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
