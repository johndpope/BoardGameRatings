			<description>CFOTD is a light and humorous board game where you play an office worker during the zombie apocalypse.  Maneuver your token through an office building besieged by the armies of the undead to be the first to rescue the CEO and lead him safely to the exit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players also control their own zombie that they use to hamper and hinder other players and event cards can help you, hinder you, or give you helpful items to help you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on zombie B-movie cliches CFOTD brings the campiness of low budget movies into the office.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
