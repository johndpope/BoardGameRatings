							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation Crouching Dragon</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operation Crouching Dragon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the South China Sea lie a group of very tiny islands, some of which are under water at high tide.  The British call them the Spratlys and marked them on charts only because they were a hazard to navigation.  They were never of much use to anyone until oil was discovered underneath them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In A.D. 2000, five nations (China, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand) claim the islands, five nations have assigned them names, five nations have sent survey parties and military units to secure their claims, five nations have made arrangements with oil companies for their exploitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your team is hired by one oil giant to spy out what the competition is up to.  Easy as pie, right?  In the middle of your mission, however, you make a discovery that is infinitely more important to your long-term survival...you discover what your patron is up to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operation Crouching Dragon takes the players to a minute island in the middle of the South China Sea, where forces from five nations claim the region's oil reserves.  It's a situation so tense, the slightest spark could touch off a war, and the team is dropped right in the middle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The module includes a 32-page booklet, nautical maps of the region and deck plans of an occupation barge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
