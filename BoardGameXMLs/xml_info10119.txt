			<description>Each player starts with 10 points.  The game features cards with questions/topics like &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; in any foreign language, countries of the British Empire, fads, and holes.  The first player draws a card and answers the question or says an item in that category. Then the second player answers the same question. When a player gives an incorrect, duplicate, or unacceptable answer, that player loses one point. The second player draws a card and a new round starts.If a player has lost all his/her 10 points, the game ends. The player with the most points left, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
