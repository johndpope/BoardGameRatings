			<description>Widget is a fast, easy-to-play, card game that asks players to make crazy, silly, funny, weird, unusual or otherwise great sentences out of the words they have in their hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The person who creates the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; sentence, as judged by the other players, wins.  Special cards that allow players to switch cards around along with other special rules add an element of strategy to the game, making it easy to learn but different and exciting every time you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The words and the illustrations have been carefully selected such that it makes Widget a family-friendly game that also works as a good party game for adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
