			<description>In All Tricks, No Treats you and your friends, brothers and sisters plus that one annoying neighborhood kid that always tags along have just finished divvying all of the good candy and you are down to those last terrible &amp;quot;treats&amp;quot;. Stuff like pretzels, toothbrushes, stale candy corn and the dreaded rock. You want to get as little of that junk as possible!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All Tricks, No Treats is an abstract card laying game for two to four weary trick or treaters. Players take turns placing &amp;quot;treats&amp;quot; cards in a way to minimize the crappy &amp;quot;treats&amp;quot; they will get stuck with which is determined by one of the cards they have selected from their hands and not placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
