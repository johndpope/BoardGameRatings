			<description>Air Combat 1960 - 2000&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Missile Threat is a simple yet comprehensive modern air combat game, covering every major air conflict from 1960 to 2000, and designed for use with miniature aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Missile Threat is aimed at providing a realistic air environment and short games of less than 2 hours (including preparation).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What does Missile Threat offer?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Simple yet accurate mechanics: Missiles actually track aircraft in-game, forcing you to conduct defensive breaks or last-ditch missile defenses.&lt;br/&gt;     Fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, ground forces, naval vessels and air defenses all play an important role&lt;br/&gt;     Stats for over 250 different aircraft&lt;br/&gt;     11 Conflicts covered: Vietnam, Arab-Israeli wars (Six-Day, Yom Kippur and 1982 Lebanon war covered), Indo-Pakistani Wars, South African Border War, Ogaden War, Iran-Iraq War, Falklands, 1991 Gulf War, Bosnia / Kosovo, Eritrean-Ethiopian War, and the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis as a bonus conflict. Many of the longer conflicts are split into periods for more accuracy as units and tactics evolve.&lt;br/&gt;     Each conflict has a tailor-made aircraft and ordnance list for each faction, as well as accurate options for ground assets like SAM sites and AAA.&lt;br/&gt;     Flight plan &amp;quot;bidding&amp;quot; system: Players must write a flight plan before the game starts, indicating when aircraft will enter and leave the game. Will you try to get your ground attack aircraft in before the enemy fighters arrive? or wait until later? Will you send your fighters in early because you know the enemy will try to get their bombing done early?&lt;br/&gt;     Complete air environment: Ground assets like AAA, SAM sites and various radars are an important aspect of the game, allowing weapons like the AGM-88 HARM to have a use and for SEAD flights to have a purpose.&lt;br/&gt;     Pilots can be shot down, wounded, captured by enemy ground forces, picked up by on-call SAR helicopters, or make their way back to friendly lines on foot. Rescuing downed pilots is important for victory.&lt;br/&gt;     4 Mission types to fly: Combat Air Patrol, Strike, Combat Search and Rescue, and Close Air Support. CAS missions will see an active land battle being fought while you attempt to support friendlies.&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed yet simple rules for Naval Vessels and Submarines. Naval Vessels can launch and recover helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, and could potentially be caught unprepared for combat...&lt;br/&gt;     Forward Air Controllers, Recon, AWACS, AEW and Anti-Submarine Warfare aircraft all have a purpose in-game Campaign System provided so each game can have an effect on the next: Wiped out all the enemy SAM sites? I guess you won't need to focus on SEAD as much any more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Missile Threat is the culmination of 8 months of research and play-testing. Markers are provided for the various missiles, ground assets and ground forces, as well as naval vessel markers for the Falklands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
