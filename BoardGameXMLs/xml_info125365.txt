							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cliff Face &amp; Cave Entrance</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A steep cliff face has formed here where part of a mountain side broke away in a landslide. This among other things revealed a cave long hidden in the ground. The newly minted cliff face has since been further eroded and smoothed by wind and weather. Very little of the material moved by the landslide remains today. Only a little sand and gravel have piled up in the cave entrance and below it. The power of wind and water formed a few ledges as well, which provide footholds for anyone wanting to climb up to the cave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climbers are advised to take great care as these ledges provide only treacherous support. The rock crumbles easily when too much pressure is put on it. And it might not be long before these last rocky outcroppings join the rubble at the ground. The same can be said about the top of the cliff face. Although it is covered by a thin screen of dirt and grass in mots places the edges are still prone to break away at any rash footstep. Someone looking down from the top might find something else much more disconcerting anyway. As a number of large claw marks in the rock are clearly visible from the higher ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
