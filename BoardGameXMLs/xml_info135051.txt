			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stone &amp;amp; Wood is a role-playing game set in the Land of Stephen Donaldson&amp;rsquo;s Chronicles of Thomas Covenant series. The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever are a series of fantasy novels of tremendous scope and a psychological depth never before attempted. Written by Stephen R. Donaldson (who later authored the Gap series of science fiction novels) the Chronicles reveal the existence of another Earth, and recount the otherworldly adventures and struggles of a human from our Earth, Thomas Covenant. All of the action in the First Chronicles and much of the Second takes place in the Land, a rich and diverse mountain-hemmed region where a powerful Enemy named Lord Foul the Despiser attempts to destroy or enslave the free people of the Land. These folk live in harmony with the Land through the dedication to its inherent Earthpower - magic that can be evoked through a long and painstaking devotion to stone, wood, water or even animals such as the mighty Ranyhyn horses. Led by the tiny but determined Council of Lords from their great keep of Revelstone they attempt to preserve the beauty of the Land against the remorseless armies of the Despiser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
