							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sensitive</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sensitive is a master of awareness and understanding; someone able to drink in all the sensations of a spring day and know a storm is coming, glance at a friendly face and sense the ill-intent it hides, or contemplate her own actions to reveal subconscious motivations. Sensitives are often religious or philosophical figures, often offering words of wisdom and guidance to those who wish to better themselves. Others are quiet contemplatives who seek on self-awareness, while a few put their perceptions to work delving into the urges and motivations of criminals and monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, it would be a mistake to think of all sensitives as &amp;ldquo;kind souls,&amp;rdquo; or to think that awareness of the thoughts and pains of others somehow ensures their motives are always pure. Some of those who find themselves in tune with the universe around them use that awareness to better manipulate and incapacitate others for their own ends. Sensitive villains can be tragic figures so troubled by the pain of others that they wish to control the world to bring peace (or in more extreme cases just put the world out of its misery), evil mesmerists who have learned to read signs of weakness as a form of power, or even bright-eyed madmen who can&amp;rsquo;t distinguish between their real insights and the voices of delusion talking in their heads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included in this 19 page book are three new archetypes: the ESPer, profiler, and volur. In addition, you'll find complete rules for Psychic Abilities - mental &amp;quot;tricks&amp;quot; that allow characters to do things that violate the normal rules of the world around them, and that are common in fantastic modern-era adventure stories. Finally, we discuss how Psychic Abilities differ from Psionics, how they interact with each other, and give some advice on ways to incorporate both into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
