			<description>Object:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To score the most points by connecting letters and forming words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A d6 (optional: a light and a dark d6)&lt;br/&gt;Score pad and a pencil&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mount the board and the bit sheet on cardstock. Cut out the three colored triangles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player chooses a triangle, and rolls the dice (if you have one die, roll &amp;quot;light&amp;quot; and then &amp;quot;dark&amp;quot;). Find the number from your light roll across the top of the board, and the number from your dark roll down the left side of the board. The nine letters in the square where they meet are your choices for your starting letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place one corner of your triangle on one of the letters in your starting square. Rotate the triangle around so that its second corner touches a letter. Using that letter as a pivot point, rotate your triangle around the next letter, and so on, forming a word. The word is scored as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 letter words = 4 points&lt;br/&gt;3 letter words = 9 points&lt;br/&gt;4 letter words = 16 points&lt;br/&gt;5 letter words = 25 points&lt;br/&gt;6 letter words = 36 points&lt;br/&gt;[etc.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second player rolls the dice (or die) and begins their word with a letter in the corresponding square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player cannot make a word of at least two letters, they pass, and their score for that round is zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The person with the most points after 10 rounds is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created by indigopotter for Reprint's contest, February 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
