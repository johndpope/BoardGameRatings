			<description>A children's game set in the universe of the 2011 live action/CGI animated television series &amp;quot;Mia and me&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 36 cards with 4 symbols from the world of Centopia on each card. The cards are placed face up on the table. The same symbols are also printed on three dice. For each possible die roll combination there are exactly three correct cards. As soon as the active player has rolled the dice, all players simultaneously search for the corresponding cards. When a player has found such a card, he/she marks it with their player chit. When all three cards have been marked, players who have marked a correct card get to keep that card. Player chits on incorrect cards get removed from the game for the next round. The first player to collect 8 or more cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
