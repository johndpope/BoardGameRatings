			<description>This is a vintage game from 1932. The object of the game is for players to pull a number out of a bag and then match the number with numbers in a game book which lists different actions that must then be accomplished in order to score points. (some of the tasks that might be chosen are to &amp;quot;Sing a song and then have the rest of the players join in with the chorus&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Have your eyes blindfolded and kiss the one you are with.&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
