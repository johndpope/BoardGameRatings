							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ultimate Battle of the Sexes</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this minigame collection it's up to the player to settle the eternal battle of the sexes. Do men have superior parking skills but lack multitasking abilities? Are all women shopping maniacs but completely hopeless when given the almighty barbeque tongs? In The Ultimate Battle of the Sexes the player is able to banish these gender stereotypes forever or find the grain of truth in them. The idea is that men and women compete against each other in disciplines which are typical for their gender. The game can be played alone but is meant to be played as a party game in a mixed group of friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
