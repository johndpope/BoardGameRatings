							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anima Tactics: Raziel Nk-X</name>
									
			<description>The ultimate killing machine, the most powerful necromantic weapon ever created&amp;hellip; After a decade of investigation and iteration, the researchers at Black Sun have been able to develop the Raziel Nk-X, the zenith of all their experiments. With unequaled skills and powers, nothing in the world is able to face this fearsome new model of undead knight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutral Black Sun Warrior Undead Optional Leader - Lv. 60+&lt;br/&gt; At 5 | Dm 8 | Df 8 | Ar 4 | LP: 20| Re 10 | Mo 6/10 | AP 2/4&lt;br/&gt; Influence: 2 Uncontrollable: 9+&lt;br/&gt; Availability: Raziel Nk-X's are not unique, and you may include 1 for every 300 levels available to your Party.&lt;br/&gt; Unstoppable: A NK-X that reaches 0 LP or less is not eliminated from the game, instead it becomes unstoppable. While in unstoppable state the Nk-X is immune to damage and applies a -2 modifiers to its Attack (however it is still vulnerable to effects and negative states). At the start of each recovery phase roll a die. With a 3+ the Nk-X is removed form the game. If the Nk-X ends the game with 0 LP it counts as a casualty for Victory Points.&lt;br/&gt; Raxxor Zero: Whenever the Nk-X kills an enemy unit it recovers one LP for each 5 levels the killed unit was worth. For example, a lvl 35 enemy would make the Nk-X recover 7 LP. This ability allows the NK-X to leave the unstoppable state.&lt;br/&gt; Dead Eyes: The Razael Nk-X gets +1 to Seek rolls.&lt;br/&gt; o - Exterminator Claw (Ki, Attack)&lt;br/&gt; -4 Damage. This Attack can only be used after the Raziel Nk-X resolves a successful Basic Attack or Basic Charge. This Attack is not affected by the Raxxor Zero ability.&lt;br/&gt; ooo - Nova (Magic, Attack)&lt;br/&gt; This Attack effects all units within 2 inches of the Raziel Nk-X.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;RAZIEL NK-X Modifications&lt;br/&gt; A Raziel Nk-X may be given up to two of the following upgrades, increasing their base Level by the amount noted.&lt;br/&gt; &amp;bull;Dual Raxxors Level: +5&lt;br/&gt; The Raziel Nk-X's Exterminator Claw no longer suffers -4 damage, and benefits from the Raxxor Zero Ability.&lt;br/&gt; &amp;bull;Indestructable Level: +5&lt;br/&gt; The Raziel Nk-X gains +10 Life Points, +1 Armor, and the Damage Resistance rule.&lt;br/&gt; &amp;bull;Spectral Body Level: +10&lt;br/&gt; At the End of each Maintenance Phase roll a die. On a 6+ the Raziel Nk-X is intangible until the end of the turn.&lt;br/&gt; CROSSRAIKER&lt;br/&gt; A Raziel NK-X can be upgraded to a Crossraiker, choosing one of the options below. Additionally this gives the Raziel-NkX +5 Levels, makes it a Leader, and removes the Uncontrollable ability from them.&lt;br/&gt; Anubis: Anubis is a Controller and has 2 Guidance points.&lt;br/&gt; Thanatos: Thanatos Attack is increased to 6 and it gains Critical Mastery.&lt;br/&gt; Pluto:Pluto recoverys one additional Action Point per turn. If Pluto's attacks deal damage, the target suffers Blind Lvl 2 Effect 15.&lt;br/&gt; Osiris: While Osiris is Unstoppable it doesn't apply the -2 Attack modifier and is only removed from the game on a roll of 5+ at the beginning of the Upkeep Phase.&lt;br/&gt; Hermes: Hermes gains the Initiative ability, and its speed is increased to 12/16.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
