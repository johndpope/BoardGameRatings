			<description>Fortunes is a trick taking tarot game where the Major Arcana can change the rules for a hand. Its based on a fantasy world where they literal gamble with their fates using this game. If you are losing a hand and you can't follow suit you could use a Major Arcana card to switch the hand from high to low and make your partner win the trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the north and south players lead a trick the low card wins, and when the east or west players lead a trick the high card wins. Following suit is necessary and the Major Aracana cards switch high tricks to low ones or visa versa unless Major Arcana was what led the trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team gets points for each trick they win and the team with the most points at the end of a hand wins that hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
