							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">VIPs</name>
									
			<description>This early game from publisher/retailer Heidelberger has 5 sets of tiles showing portraits of VIPs. There are men on one side, women on the other, you choose which side to play at the start. The faces are divided into three strips like a photo-fit, and players use chips to move them around to form the best pictures. Players then score points by selecting which sections look best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game appears to work best as a tactical 2 player game, and the hand drawn portraits look good, recognizable as famous people, but it doesn't seem to be a successful result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
