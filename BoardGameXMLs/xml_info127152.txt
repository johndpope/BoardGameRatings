			<description>A game in the tradition of Happy Families but this has sets in varying numbers of cards. I expect parents saw an educational value in the game and they were right to do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 9 sets in all, each giving examples of a type of measure. The sets range from 3 cards to 7 cards. In your turn, you may ask any other player for a card in one set but you must have at least one card from that set in your hand. If you complete a set, lay it in front of you. When all the sets have been collected, the plasyer who has most in front of him, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nine sets are:&lt;br/&gt;Cubic Measure&lt;br/&gt;Troy Weight&lt;br/&gt;Apothecaries' Weight&lt;br/&gt;Dry Measure&lt;br/&gt;Measure of Time&lt;br/&gt;Long Measure&lt;br/&gt;Square Measure&lt;br/&gt;Avoirdupois Weight&lt;br/&gt;Money Table&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
