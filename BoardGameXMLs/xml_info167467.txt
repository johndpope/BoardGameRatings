							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Exploits</name>
									
			<description>Exploits is a card game where players try to hack each others servers.  The game's main mechanic focuses on combining an exploit and payload to effectively attack your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a set of servers behind a firewall, as the game progresses, the firewalls grow and develop vulnerabilities.  Players take turns looking at firewalls to protect themselves and find vulnerabilities with their opponents decks. Players then attack an opponents server with their own payload and exploit, and the vulnerability in their opponents firewall. Other cards allow for DDos, botnets distributing spam, and other abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
