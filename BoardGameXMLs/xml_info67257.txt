							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Masked Men and Mystery Women</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the depression of the thirties, they were dark avengers who patrolled the night streets, twin .45s blazing leaden justice to those whom the law could not touch.  In the forties they were the shining symbols of hope in a world growing ever darker under the threat of tyranny. In the fifties, they kept America safe from the red menace while upholding our morals and values. In the sixties, they fought subversives and hippies. In the seventies, it was pushers and politicians. In every era they have come forth; masked men and mystery women who hide their true identities behind a mask of justice to battle the myriad threats to the American way of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now see the heroes and heroines of AC Comics as they appeared in the golden age of vigilantes, and follow their careers through the decades.  Thrill to their early triumphs! Gasp at their insidious villains! Marvel at their logic and super-science.  This all new sourcebook for Superbabes, the Femforce RPG details many of the existing AC characters as they appeared in the Golden Age of comics, as well as introducing write ups fro many of the other characters of the era. Also included are the unbelievable villains of the period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
