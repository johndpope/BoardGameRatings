							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Seven Families of Capetiens</name>
									
			<description>Seven Families of Capetiens is an educational card game about the history and genealogy of French royalty of the Capetien dynasty. The game comes with 55 playing cards, a rules card, a pamphlet on the history of the various Capetien family members, and a genealogical chart of those individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players have two decks of cards at their disposal: 42 people cards and 42 castle cards. The Bastille destruction card is included among the  caslte cards and allows the person who draws to nullify a castle laid down by an opponent. The latter is then unable to reunite the corresponding family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to win a player must, in their entirety, reunite a greater number as families as his opponents.&lt;br/&gt;In addition a preliminary condition must be met: before beginning to reunite a family, you must have acquired a castle in which they have resided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
