			<description>Chess in the Twilight Zone. From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This game consists of two parallel planes of existence. On one plane we have a typical chessboard; on the other plane (Dimension X) we have a board inhabited by strange trans-dimensional chess pieces in the form of snakes, spiders and crabs.  These creatures can leave Dimension X, and also return&lt;br/&gt;to it...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules of the game are simple. The goal is to checkmate your opponent's king. You start with 2 chess boards next to each other. On one board, you play a normal chess game, making 1 move per turn. On the other board each player has 3 short range pieces - creatures with strange powers - that may only move in Dimension X and only attack in our dimension. Each player, during his or her turn, also either moves one of the Dimension X creatures on the second board, crosses between dimensions, or attacks with a creature in our dimension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a most unusual 3D chess variant that quite literally adds a whole other level of tactics and strategy to chess, with a twist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
