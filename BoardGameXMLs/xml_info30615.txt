			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Storm the walls of Rome, lay siege to Jerusalem!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Siege and Conquest is a rules expansion and source book for Warhammer Ancient Battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout history, Sieges have decided the fates of nations. From the earliest Biblical times through the Roman period, the Crusades, the 100 Years War and into the age of gunpowder, peoples defended their walls from invaders looking for Conquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cities have held out against invaders for years by stubborn resistance, others have fallen purely at the hand of a traitor or exchange of coin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featured within this book are the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SIEGE&lt;br/&gt;A historical overview and full rules for siege warfare through the Biblical, Classical and Medieval Eras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The siege section of this book allows you to recreate a full siege campaign using a series of 10 scenarios, or as many wargamers prefer, the option to just move to the final deciding assault!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By using the WAB points system, the besieger can create openings in the wall or undermine the fortification, whilst the besieged can attempt to shore up their beleaguered defences!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will allow you to complete a siege game in a couple of hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONQUEST&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios and pitched battle variants as well as inspirational material for using terrain and weather in games, ideas for multiplayer games and developing your own campaigns of Siege and Conquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are exciting new rules for fighting in settlements such as villages and cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These add a new level of tactical play on the tabletop in your games of Warhammer Ancient Battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A full colour section is included showing a range of fortifications across the ages, armies deployed for battle and explanations of the rules in action!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besiege Constantinople, command Viking Raiders or defend the city of Troy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the enemy are at the gates and your walls are crumbling, will your army hold?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Warhammer Ancient Battles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
