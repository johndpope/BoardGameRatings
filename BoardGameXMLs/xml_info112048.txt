			<description>There are many things to find from Panamaland to the little hut beside the river, and players must be lucky three times to move and win the game. Players start with their tiger at the hut, the bear stands on any Panama card. The active player rolls the die. Now he needs to find two more cards identical to the one the bear stands on. If he is lucky, the are already there face up, otherwise the player may turn over up to three cards to find the necessary motives. If he has found them, he may move his tiger as many spots as he has rolled, otherwise the tiger stays in place. The player to be the first to get back to the hut beside the river wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
