							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carolus. Great Northern War</name>
									
			<description>Designer summary: Carolus. Great Northern War is a Card Driven game focusing on the events of the war between Sweden, led by young king Karl XII and coalition of her enemies: Russia (led by Pyotr, later known as Peter the Great) Saxony (led by Augustus der Starke - the Strong) and Denmark (led by Frederik IVth). The war has also spread to initially neutral Poland, which became a battleground for involved powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In history, the Coalition has lost three major battles in the first year of the war. But the war continued, even despite early Danish withdrawal and Saxon surrender, which followed six years later. Carolus, who was also able to put his own king on Polish throne in the meantime, faced his last active enemy - Russia. His failed attempt at taking Moscow became the pivotal event and a milestone in Northern European history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will be able to recreate those events or find their own alternative strategies to win the Great Northern War themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is currently in development, first bits will be hopefully shown at Essen Spiel 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
