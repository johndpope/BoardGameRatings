			<description>In English, the title means something like 'Oddballs' or 'Weirdos'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;44 Cards&lt;br/&gt;There are 22 Matching Pairs and the backs of each card are marked as traditional dominoes so you get two games for your money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to collect matching pairs. A matched pair consists of the top half of a character and a bottom half of the same character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your turn, you can either ask a player for a card that you would like, or you can tell a player a card that you would like to get rid off. When your appeal fails, the next player plays. Completed matches are set aside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The obvious end is that the winner is the one who collected the most pairs but the rules suggest that you could create 'oddballs', i.e. the wrong lower half with the wrong upper half. The one who creates the best oddball (as judged by laughter, I guess), wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The backs of the cards each feature a different domino piece so Dominoes can be played with the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
