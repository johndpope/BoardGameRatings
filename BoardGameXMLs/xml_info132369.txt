			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;King's Table - The Legend of Ragnarok is a video game version of the viking board game, Hnefatafl, also known as King's Table.  King's Table consists of two unequal sides, with the Forces of Valhalla, who set up in the middle of the board, attempting to move a slow-moving Odin to a board corner, while the Forces of Darkness, who set up on every board edge, try to capture Odin.  Both sides exclusively use (aside from Odin) soldier pieces ('Einherjar' or 'Giants' in the game) that move like a Rook in chess, and take opposing pieces by moving such that the opposing piece is trapped directly between two of the moving player's pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to a recreation of Hnefatfl, the game includes a campaign of sorts, called 'Ragnarok', played against increasingly difficult opponents.  Ragnarok differs from basic King's Table by allowing each player to replace four of their basic soldiers with unique pieces chosen from a list of six.  While the pieces available to each side are functionally identical, they are named relative to the side that they are on, (Tyr, Thor and so on for Valhalla; Loki, Garm and so on for Darkness).  The object of moving Odin to a board corner remains the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
