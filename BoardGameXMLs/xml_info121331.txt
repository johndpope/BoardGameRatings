			<description>(This game is currently in prototype phase)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Constructing robots in a fully automated factory is quite a simple job, really. To be honest, it is such a bore that your abilities are hardly even challenged as the head of the robot assembly. Thus you make a bet with the other overseers at the robot assembly line: who can build the best robots the quickest? The loser will buy lunch oil for everyone. There IS the faint chance of someone falling down from the conveyor belts and getting scrapped. Fortunately, those unfortunate robots can be accounted for as collateral damage...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Robot Factory, players guide their robots in a maze-like factory floor, using conveyor belts that keep moving every turn. Players operate their construction robots by playing programming cards, in an effort to collect parts for the most advanced robots as required by the given assembly instructions. Once a player has enough parts for assembly, they assemble the robots in the assembly lines and are awarded Victory Points. However, the players&amp;rsquo; construction robots may be pushed off the board, and they only have a limited number of &amp;ldquo;lives&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; CPU's &amp;ndash; to reboot themselves after falling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You want to gather all the parts, but so does everyone else. Keep your processor cool and tires on the belt! And Be Aware, this game will knock your Robo Block Off!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robot Factory features a pushable grid of tiles that makes the board change every player turn (similar mechanic in Labyrinth). The game packs an hour of fun game-play full of surprises, as players try to push each other off the board and new emerging tiles cause logistical challenges!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
