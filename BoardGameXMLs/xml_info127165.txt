							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dam It!</name>
									
			<description>Players take the role of a beaver family trying to dam the river before any of their neighbors can do so.  The first to dam the river wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this fast paced, family friendly card game, players build their dam by using big log cards to build the base layer of their dam.  Then they can add in some twig filler by playing twig filler cards.  Finally it can be topped off with mud by playing the appropriate mud cards.  When you use these building material cards, you then add cubes to you player mat, which represents your dam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But watch out!  Other players can attack your dam and damage it by playing stone, weeds, or felled tree cards!  These attack cards cause you to lose cubes from your dam.  But if you're lucky, you'll have some helpful beaver cards in your hand that can save the day.  Using a Busy Beaver card you can add a few cubes to your dam, which gets you that much closer to winning!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is full of interaction and confrontation.  Build your dam, damage your opponents.  The first player to build their dam up and put all the necessary cubes on their player mat is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
