			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there were every any methods to make learning addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division fun, playing Speed Math and Bingo Math could be the answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speed Math (one player)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speed Math is designed to develop arithmetical skills by giving you thirty problems and a ten second interval each in which to answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each second of the ten second interval is worth one point. Answering the problem in less than the initial five second interval will give you ten points. After an initial two seconds, the point value will decrease per each second elapsed. If you answer the problem incorrectly, you will not be awarded any points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will find as your score increases, the degree of difficulty of the problems increases. Conversely, if you continually give a wrong answer, the following problems will have the same answer or will be a variation of the same problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bingo Math (two players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bingo Math has been designed to achieve the same purpose as Speed Math but the process has been altered. Instead of points, you are awarded a Bingo, and you have an additional feature of competing directly against another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each problem comes at six second intervals, these problems are shown at the bottom of each player's Bingo card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to achieve a Bingo, you must move the * [cursor] from the middle square to the answer of the problem located on the Bingo card . . . When you reach the answer, pull the trigger to leave the * in place of the number. If you put your * on the wrong answer, you will be given the correct answer and your opponent will be allowed the remainder of the six seconds to find the correct answer [to his problem].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
