							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Himmelveil HarborMaster</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where the Kriegstrom River meets the mouth of the Mysserian Sea, the ancient City of Himmelveil stands watch over distant shores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WorldWorks is proud to present our first release in the fantasy mega-city of &amp;lsquo;Himmelveil&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;Himmelveil Harbormaster&amp;rsquo;. The city of Himmelveil marks a grand plan by WorldWorks designers to bring into creation an entire fantasy city in cardstock glory. Working from a carefully created grand master plan we are carving out sections of the city for development by our highly skilled model creators. Our dream is an ambitious one; to give every gamer and modeler the tools they need to build a massive and affordable fantasy city for all of their role playing needs. The journey has begun! It&amp;rsquo;s time for you to join us!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Himmelveil Harbormaster&amp;rsquo; is a superbly textured and detailed (both inside and out) multi-storied building with several optional components. How many stories? That&amp;rsquo;s completely up to you! It sits on an optional 3-inch high stonework pier. This model set is a perfect event based location that is equally suited to fantasy, horror and modern gaming scenarios. The only real limit here is your imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Game Notes)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the home and working space of Cinaed Audoenus, a retired voyager. In younger years he explored the far reaches of Arcraetia but in his age he has settled here as Harbormaster to Himmelveil. His years spent bending elbow with mariners in waterfront taverns around the world has earned him deep respect locally as a knowledgeable seaman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The office is usually crowded during business hours with mariners seeking or departing from berths. It's a prime place for news, rumors and shady characters. The harbormaster is in or near the lower floor office space during the day; an overworked clerk does most of the admin work and is only hired during office hours. There are usually large sums of cash in a variety of coinage in the office late in the afternoon. A Harborside Marine is assigned to guard the money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The building has two floors with fully detailed interior and exterior. Multiple levels of ornate detail can be added to the windows, ranging from a a quick and easy build, to an elaborate work of cardstock art. In addition, Himmelveil Harbormaster includes all of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Interior: Desk&lt;br/&gt;    * Counter&lt;br/&gt;    * Chairs&lt;br/&gt;    * Captain's Bed&lt;br/&gt;    * Wardrobe&lt;br/&gt;    * Ladder&lt;br/&gt;    * 3 tables&lt;br/&gt;    * Steps&lt;br/&gt;    * File Box&lt;br/&gt;    * Strongbox&lt;br/&gt;    * Fireplaces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exterior:&lt;br/&gt;    * Tower with small window, clock and anti-dragon spikes&lt;br/&gt;    * Skylight&lt;br/&gt;    * Mansard Roof&lt;br/&gt;    * Flagpole with Signal Flags&lt;br/&gt;    * Ship's wheel&lt;br/&gt;    * Hatch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The building can sit atop a three inch high pillar, accessible by exterior steps leading to two small platforms that come in gridded and non-grid variations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
