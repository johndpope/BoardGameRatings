			<description>A simple card game that uses the rock-paper-scissors mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 55 cards. Each card shows one of x symbols. In addition to rock, paper and scissor symbols, there are fire (burns paper), well (extinguishes fire etc.), and joker pictures. Each player receives one joker card and puts it face-up in front of him/herself. The other cards are shuffled and each player gets six cards. Players take turns choosing one other player for a duel. The duel partners each play one card of their choice simultaneously. The winner of the duel gets the card that the loser played. Then the next player chooses his/her partner for this turn's duel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If both players play the same symbol, both cards stay in the pool and the next symbols decide who wins. If a player has lost all his/her cards, he/she uses the joker card. This means that the joker player uses a hand gesture while his/her duel partner plays a card as usual. If the joker player wins, he/she gets to draw two new cards. If the joker player loses, he/she is eliminated from the game. The first player to double their hand cards to 12 wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
