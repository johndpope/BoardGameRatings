							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anatomy of a Village</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ah, the village, just a small settlement that, in medieval times, was mainly all about agriculture. In my attempt to build up the world of SCRAWL, I have made [these] tables for the village &amp;ndash; what it sells, what you can do there and what events might take part there. When you arrive at a village, you can make notes on each one, such as its name, what it offers and what events are taking place there at any one time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
