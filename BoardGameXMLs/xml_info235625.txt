							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Scroll</name>
									
			<description>The Scroll is a deck building game where players compete against each others, and against the game itself. Players incarnate heroes with unique abilities, expanding the powers on their quest to collect the Tears of Power - the artefacts needed for the ritual summoning the Scroll - and become the ruler of the Sacred Lands.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts the game with a hero (with unique powers to use through the game), a starting deck of crystals (the in-game currency), and a secret quest. Each hero has also a specific thematic and colour, corresponding to the type of crystals they use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four card stacks - one for each corresponding crystal colour - are used to get new cards. Players start only buying cards from their own crystal colour, until they gain new abilities allowing them to get cards associated with the other crystals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game, two Tears of Power must be collected. One is obtained by accomplishing the quest (requires a deck optimisation); the other is obtained by successfully summoning Rhaluyne the Wise (requires enough crystals and a dice roll).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
