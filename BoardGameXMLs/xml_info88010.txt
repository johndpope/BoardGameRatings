			<description>Compass and Empire is a Print and Play Game themed for the Aether Captains world&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played with 6 dice, five dice showing the Emperor, Lady and Compass faces, and one die known as the &amp;lsquo;Roundabout&amp;rsquo;, this game is for two to four players. You will also need the provided set of 12 tokens (or coins if the officers are elsewhere).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play:&lt;br/&gt;At the start of a game the following number of tokens are placed in the center of the playing area, depending on the number of players taking part:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 players: 3 Emperor tokens, 6 Compass tokens, and 3 Lady tokens&lt;br/&gt;3 players: 2 Emperor tokens, 4 Compass tokens, and 2 Lady tokens&lt;br/&gt;2 players: 1 Emperor tokens, 2 Compass tokens, and 1 Lady token&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose who goes first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players, clockwise in turn, roll the dice once and try to get five-of-a-kind. Players may keep as many of the previous player's dice and roll the remaining ones in their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player who rolls 5 Compass tokens (regardless if it is the Compass or the Marked Compass) claims one Compass token from the center. A player who rolls 5 Emperor tokens claims one Emperor token from the center. A player who rolls 5 Lady tokens claims one Lady token from the center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has made five-of-a-kind and claimed their reward, the next player rolls all the dice to start the next round. If a player is unable to claim their reward from the center because there are none left, they may take one from another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If 3 Marked Compass die faces are rolled that player may take the &amp;lsquo;roundabout&amp;rsquo; die to use during future turns; rolling it once when taking it to determine its use during the time the player has control of it. The player can only lose that die if another player rolls 3 Marked Compasses and takes it from them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This die gives the player the following bonuses:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Engineer - the player is allowed to take a token on a 4 of a kind&lt;br/&gt;(a crafty engineer always makes the best of a situation)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mistress - the player allowed to take a 2nd roll of any dice they choose&lt;br/&gt;(one girl here and one girl there)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cutpurse - the player can choose one die which will be locked and&lt;br/&gt;cannot be re-rolled by an adjacent player to their left or right as indicated by the die&lt;br/&gt;(the left hand never knows what the right is doing)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Alchemist - the player may choose any token in center not yet taken&lt;br/&gt;i.e. acts as a 5 wild&lt;br/&gt;(lead turns to gold)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spy - The Roundabout die is lost by that player and placed back in the center&lt;br/&gt;(your secrets will gain you nothing)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to hold a Emperor, Lady and two Compass tokens wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;this game is based on the ancient roman game Jactus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
