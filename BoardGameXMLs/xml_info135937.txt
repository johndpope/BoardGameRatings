			<description>Bao Qing Tian Shen An(包青天審案)is a party game published around the early 90's. The year is not quite sure as the old publishers didn't print the date on the games. The publisher was closed so it is hard to get the exact date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bao Zheng(包拯)(999-1062, also named Bao Qing Tian 包青天) was a much-praised official who served during the reign of Emperor Renzong of Northern Song Dynasty in ancient China. He was respected as a fair justice. His stories are popular in Chinese people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each turn, a player plays a card facedown and draw a card. Players in this game would play different roles. The First player who play the Emperor become Emperor (play Emperor faceup). Then Emperor have to call out Bao Qing Tian. Other players who have Bao Qing Tian card can play it to become Bao Qing Tian. The Bao Qing Tian have to decide which player(s) are the police, Wang Zhao(王朝) and Ma Han(馬漢), depending on their cards. AS soon as the officers are decided, The Emperor says which kind of criminals he want to get rid of (there are 4 kinds of offenders). Then the police can look at one player's hand when his turn is or catch other players' cards when they discard. Bao Qing Tian have to count the times when the police searches, but the limit is 10 searches. If the police arrests the criminal, Bao Qing Tian decides how to punish the player who holds the criminal. Otherwise, the police is punished. For example, a punishment may require player to sing a song, make a funny face, etc. At this time, if players have the mathematical symbols (add, plus, subtract, minus), they can help or afflict the criminal. Sometimes the criminal would have those symbolic cards and he can help himself. If the criminal is the Emperor, he can cancel his punishment (this is the dark side of this game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
