			<description>Battles of the Thirty Years War (1618-1648) Series was originally published by TCS Games as several Desktop Published games.

The bloody struggle left the Protestants mangled and the Spanish masters of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Battle of Lutter (27 August 1626) took place between nearly equal the forces (20,000 each) of the Lower Saxon Circle, combining mostly Protestant states, and led by its Circle Colonel Christian IV of Denmark, and the forces of the Catholic League.  The battle resulted in a heavy defeat of Christian IV's troops by those of Emperor Ferdinand II, led by the Catholic League general Johan Tzerclaes, Count of Tilly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
