			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prepare yourself to return to the Forge. Called back by the seven watchers of the Black Flock, you will face new challenges and new enemies in an ever-more-unstable world of political intrigue, powerful warlords, and ancient secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seven years have passed since last the Domains of the Forge were documented, and in that time much has changed. Bloodlords have fallen, the Queen no longer reigns, and the once proud city of Penance has been reduced to a war zone. Millions have been displaced, seeking solace in the empty wastes of the red desert or shaky shelter in the eternal darkness at the top of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oathbound Seven is the new core rulebook for Oathbound under the Pathfinder game system. It contains everything you need to run an Oathbound campaign. This is not a simple reprinting of Oathbound: Domains of the Forge, but a careful compilation of all six preceding Oathbound books, reworked, expanded, and enhanced, with plenty of new material for returning Oathbound fans. Oathbound Seven picks up the story of the Forge seven years from where it was left off, revealing a period of intense strife and chaos that has seen marked changes in the character and order of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An overview of the Forge and the seven domains&lt;br/&gt;     Seven years of new history, new alliances, and new surprises&lt;br/&gt;     New races and classes for player characters&lt;br/&gt;     Evolutions: A new system for prestige races&lt;br/&gt;     Equipment and materials for rashers of all stripes&lt;br/&gt;     Gifts, skills, feats, spells, and magical items&lt;br/&gt;     Religions, critters, and societies of the Forge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     15 Player Character Races&lt;br/&gt;     12 Prestige Classes&lt;br/&gt;     2 Core Classes&lt;br/&gt;     30 Evolutions&lt;br/&gt;     100 Arrival Gifts&lt;br/&gt;     11 Earned Gifts&lt;br/&gt;     140 Spells&lt;br/&gt;     80 Magic Items&lt;br/&gt;     5 New Skills&lt;br/&gt;     33 New Feats&lt;br/&gt;     29 New Weapons&lt;br/&gt;     12 New Armor/Shield Types&lt;br/&gt;     Over 50 New Items and Substances&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this project started out as a mere compilation of past work, it gradually evolved into something entirely new: a re-envisioning of the setting, a massive amount of new material, and an improvement across-the board on the original products, streamlined by the new Pathfinder rules. New material has been worked into every element of Oathbound, and some chapters have been written entirely from scratch with all new content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even Pathfinder players who don't intend to play Oathbound will find this material indispensable for their games. We have done several rounds of playtesting, so this is the largest, most-tested, most-balanced, and best-proofed Oathbound product ever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Credits page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes new material, plus compiled and revised material from the following classic Oathbound products originally published by Bastion Press: Oathbound: Domains of the Forge, Oathbound: Plains of Penance, Oathbound: Wrack &amp; Ruin, Oathbound: Arena, Mysteries of Arena, Wildwood, Oathbound Player&amp;rsquo;s Guide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
