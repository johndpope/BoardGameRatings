			<description>A manqala game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Wikimanqala:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Hoyito_II&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Hoyito_II&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;These are the rules of the not so well considered hoyito game. &lt;br/&gt;This form of hoyito was recorded as played in Barahona and its countryside, Villa Jaragua, La Descubierta, Jiman&amp;iacute;, Port-au-Prince and Jacmel. &lt;br/&gt;It is almost equal to ba-awa and other African games, except the fact that a four is captured by the one moving, not by the one owning the hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hoyito is a two players game. &lt;br/&gt;It is played on a board made by two rows of six holes (other sizes were recorded, but 2x6 seems to be the most common). &lt;br/&gt;At the beginning each hole has four pieces. &lt;br/&gt; Initial position &lt;br/&gt;Every player controls the row on her side of the board. &lt;br/&gt;Players take turns to move. &lt;br/&gt;At her turn the player takes all the stones from one of her holes and sows them counterclockwise. &lt;br/&gt;If the last stone falls in an occupied hole, all these stones (the one just landed plus the ones that were already there) are picked up and sown in a new lap starting in the next hole, unless &lt;br/&gt;     the last stone makes a casa (&amp;quot;house&amp;quot;; four pieces in a hole). In this case, she captures the contents of this hole and her turn ends. &lt;br/&gt;If, at any moment, a casa has been made in any hole on any side of the board, the player making the move captures them. &lt;br/&gt;If the last stone falls in an empty hole the turn ends. &lt;br/&gt;If in her turn a player can not play (has no stones on her side), she passes. &lt;br/&gt;The player who makes a capture that leaves only four stones on the board captures also these stones and the game is over. &lt;br/&gt;The winner of the game is the player who captured more pieces. &lt;br/&gt;Match Rules&lt;br/&gt;Once a game is over a next one is started, but: &lt;br/&gt;     Each player fills as many holes on her side with four pieces as she can. The empty holes are not used in this game. Nevertheless, they can be recovered on following games. &lt;br/&gt; Initial position after a game ended at 16-32 for South &lt;br/&gt;     The winner of the preceding game starts. &lt;br/&gt;The winner of the match is the one who leaves the opponent with no pieces at all at the end of a game. &lt;br/&gt;Variations to the rules&lt;br/&gt;Some people play this way: &lt;br/&gt;     On your first move you decide the sense of your moving, clockwise or anticlockwise. For the rest of the game and match you keep playing this way. &lt;br/&gt;This may leed to both players playing in opposite senses. &lt;br/&gt;In some cases it was recorded that, at each move, players choose the sense of sowing. &lt;br/&gt;There were other variants commented, but never on a consistent way. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The source is quoted here and seems reliable in spite of inperfect English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
