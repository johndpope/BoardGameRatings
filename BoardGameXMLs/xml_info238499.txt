			<description>The quirky game is a local take on the popular Hasbro Monopoly game and uses downtown Beaufort landmarks, such as the bridges and historic homes, as well as local businesses as playing cards and spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
