							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Broadsword: A Game of Legendary Heroes and Epic Adventure</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A high fantasy tactical adventure game that seamlessly marries elements from classic boardgames with elements from tabletop roleplaying games to result in something novel &amp;mdash; much more than a simple boardgame; not quite a full RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is the GM. The rest of the players choose a combination of race and class for their Hero. Certain spellcasting classes also get a deck of spell cards, unique to that class. The players team up to defeat the evil monsters of the Abyss, achieve the Quest goal, and find the exit to the map (typically leading to the start of the next Quest).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, a Hero may take an Action then move, or move then take an Action. An &amp;quot;Action&amp;quot; is one of nine possibilities: Attack, Cast a Spell, Search for Treasure, Search for Secret Doors, Search for Traps, Disarm a Trap, Use an Active Skill, Use a Special Action, Switch Items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement around the map each turn takes 1d6+4 squares. Attacking, defending, and some other actions are performed with pictographic Combat Dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Heroes lose the Quest if they fail to achieve the Quest objective, or if all Heroes are killed before they find the exit to the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
