							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Naval Campaigns: Midway</name>
									
			<description>Naval Campaigns: Midway covers not only this action but also other major carrier battles of World War Two, including Midway, Pearl Harbor, Coral Sea, Eastern Solomons, Santa Cruz and Philippine Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you, as the fleet commander, sail your fleet and fly your air forces to victory, or will you be plunged beneath the deep blue waves never to be heard from again?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The previous three titles in the Naval Campaigns series examined various surface actions in detail from World Wars One and Two, but with the addition of aircraft the complexity of the battles increases drastically. Now, players must not only maneuver their fleets, but also conduct air operations. This means dealing with search results, wind direction and speed, and coordinating multiple carriers and their air wings. This is a true challenge for any naval commander.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Midway features the familiar Naval Campaigns interface with its real-time environment that can be paused or run up to 10x normal speed. 19 different landmasses are included to model a wide variety of actions. Historical and hypothetical OOB&amp;rsquo;s are also in the game giving plenty of material for would-be scenario designers to exercise their skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
