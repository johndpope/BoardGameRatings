			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Luchadore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wednesday night: A screaming crowd 13,000 strong in a sardine packed arena in Jalisco, competing in a lucha against three other masked champions, two steroid case clowns and a midget dressed in a Superman parody costume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thursday night: A smaller arena in Zachatechas, designed to hold 3,500, filled with twice that many fans thanks to the scalpers. A steel chair match against your best friend (and biggest rival), Rey Furio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Friday night: The craggy hills outside of Monterrey, with your huge, neon red gloved hands squeezing the un-life from the rotting throat of a stinking mummy that walked all the way from the Andes to central Mexico, devouring souls and blood along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saturday night: A real free for all in the badlands stretching between Mexico and the Estatos Unitidos, your dragon-green mask ripped from your shaven skull by the padre of a family of ragged vampire spawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the time the fight was over, you were breathing hard, leaking blood from a dozen cuts, and your bad knee was hurting you again. Your mask was ripped, one eye hole gone, half your bloody cheek visible, but you didn&amp;rsquo;t care&amp;hellip; you pulled your mask back over your swelling face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You wiped your hands on your sweat pants and walked home, humming the ring music from last week, wanting a bath and a beer or ten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sunday night: A day of rest, with your family in the sweltering apartment in Mexico City, icing down your swollen knee and resting up for the 16 man lucha on Monday night, knowing that cameras from Univision and Telemundo would be there, and this would be one more chance for you to make it big&amp;hellip;..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a typical week in the life of a Luchidore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Masked Mexican Monster hunter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What concept can be simpler or more fun than that? Add this Advanced Class to your D20 Modern campaign to bring flavor, fun and masked smackdowns to your next gaming session!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
