							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Confrontation</name>
									
			<description>Confrontation was the name given to the original Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader skirmish game set on Necromunda in which gangs fought against each other, and attempted to increase their prestige and equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published over a number of issues of White Dwarf, starting with Issue 130, and with the last installment in Issue 142.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics focus on realism, allowing characters to make use of cover in specific ways, and requiring them to make specific tests when under fire.  Actions are performed on a points basis, so a character could run forward and fire a few badly-aimed shots, or stand still and fire more rounds at a target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains a large amount of detail concerning combat and psychological effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for purchasing and trading equipment for players' gangs, were also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game appears to be the precursor of Necromunda, published five years later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
