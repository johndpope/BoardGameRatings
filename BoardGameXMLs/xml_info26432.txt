							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Match: Le Jeu de Michel Platini</name>
									
			<description>French soccer player Michel Platini was one of the most famous soccer stars from the '70s and early '80s. In 1978 a soccer game was released and licensed on Platini (with his photo on the cover). This vintage game looks quite good with 22 plastic figurines representing the soccer players. The board has a soccer field &amp;amp; stadium printed on it, the field is divided in squares. The game also has a die, but that die doesn't have numbers but colors on it. Collectors item, especially for soccer fans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
