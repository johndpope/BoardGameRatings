			<description>Crash Bandicoot Purple: Ripto's Rampage and Spyro Orange: The Cortex Conspiracy are two platform games published by Vivendi Universal Games and developed by Vicarious Visions for the Game Boy Advance. They were released in North America on June 3, 2004, In Europe on June 25, 2004 (under the names Crash Fusion and Spyro Fusion) and in Japan on December 9, 2004 (under the names: Crash Bandicoot Advance Wakuwaku Tomodachi Daisakusen! and Spyro Advance Wakuwaku Tomodachi Daisakusen!).&lt;br/&gt;Crash Bandicoot Purple: Ripto's Rampage is the tenth installment in the Crash Bandicoot series of video games, while Spyro Orange: The Cortex Conspiracy is the eighth installment in the Spyro series of video games (and the first Spyro title to be developed by Vicarious Visions). For both series, the games are the fourth installments made for the Game Boy Advance. The story of the games center on a plot to wreak havoc on the universe by the main antagonists Doctor Neo Cortex and Ripto, who have recently joined forces. The protagonists of the story, Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon, must team up and defeat Doctor Cortex and Ripto along with their genetically modified minions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crash Bandicoot Purple: Ripto's Rampage and Spyro Orange: The Cortex Conspiracy are single-player side-scrolling adventure games in which the player controls Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon in the respective games.[3] While the games feature platforming elements that allow Crash and Spyro to navigate different areas, the main focus is on a series of minigames that make up the core of the gameplay. The minigames involve distinctively different gameplay elements, such as destroying enemies in a Breakout-inspired challenge or racing through an area with a jet pack, tank or inner tube. The games make use of the Game Link Cable, allowing players to compete in multiplayer versions of several of the minigames found in the games. Much of these minigames only require one copy of either of the games for as many as four players in the network. Players can earn trading cards by performing specific tasks; these cards can be traded between Game Boy Advance systems to players who do not physically own a copy of the games. Additional content can be accessed if the two games are linked to each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Spyro Orange: The Cortex Conspiracy&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
