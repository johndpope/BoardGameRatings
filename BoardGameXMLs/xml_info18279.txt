							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Flying Doctor Game</name>
									
			<description>Game based on the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia.  Draw 'mission cards' detailing cities that must be visited in order.  Players' planes move along tracks that can be tailwinds or headwinds (increasing or decreasing speed), keeping track on a 'log book' sheet.  Occasionally, a mission card may be a Wild Card, with special instructions.  The board is a map of Australia divided into 'sections'.  The objective of the game is to complete one mission in each section and return to the player's Home Base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Royal Flying Doctor Service began in Queensland in 1928, and was developed on a national basis during the 1930's.  The service provides people of the Inland medical aid in emergencies, as well as comprehensive health care and community service.  The Service today covers more than five million square kms, an area as large as Western Europe.  The box states: &amp;quot;The Royal Flying Doctor Service is a beneficiary of this game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
