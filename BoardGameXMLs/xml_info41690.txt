			<description>Two kingdoms are at war. The side who fights at the right place at the right time will emerge victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;phase one: military strategist advices&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, each player rolls his die and secretly looks at it before covering it up with the cup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;phase two: feints and combat&lt;br/&gt;Players then take turns playing cards into one of the 6 areas on the board. Each area can take a maximum of 3 values. Players may pass. If they do so, they cannot play any more card/s for the rest of that turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;phase three: resolution&lt;br/&gt;After both players are done playing their cards, their strategical strength is determined. An area on the board is in play if the corresponding number is rolled by either player. Any cards played into an in-play area grants the player strategical strength: one times the number of the area for each 1-card played, and two times the number of the area for each 2-card played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever has the higher strategical strength wins the turn, and gets victory tokens from the opponent's pool. The number of tokens won/lost is equal to one plus the total value of the cards played by the losing player. (So on each turn the possible numbers of victory points won/lost are 1, 2, 3 and 4.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;victory&lt;br/&gt;When one side runs out of victory tokens, he loses. The other player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
