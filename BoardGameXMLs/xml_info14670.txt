			<description>A strategy game of subtle movement. Game comes with a wooden board with 15 gold and 15 silver pegs. Points are scored for all opponent pieces still left on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is set up as per specific directions. Pieces may be moved only when flanked by 2 other pieces.  Those pieces must lie in an unbroken straight line, vertically, horizontally of diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won when an opponent in his turn does not have a piece that can be moved to an empty space or make a capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
