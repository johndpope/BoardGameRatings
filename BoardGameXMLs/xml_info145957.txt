			<description>World War II: TCG is the first multiplatform Digital Card Game based on World War II, available for iOS, Android and browser. With over 200 unique cards and unique strategic features, it will become a new reference for Online Digital Card Games. The game core is completed and we expect to launch the game in the last quarter of the year, however, due to our funds depleting we had to move some great game features to the backlog, hoping to implement them once the game has been released. If you decide to help us by pledging the game we will make sure to hire the extra programmers we need to have all those great features implemented by launch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
