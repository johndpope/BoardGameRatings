			<description>A Texas flavored version of a Trivia game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move about the board answering questions to collect tokens AND money (must have one of each token and at least a million bucks to win) in a bid to claim they are &amp;quot;as big as Texas&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trivia questions are asked from one of 5 color coded books that relate to different topics on Texas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though not explicitly stated, the game requires at least 5 players or 5 teams of players in order to actually play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very tongue in cheek handling of Trivia based gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Rustle up your compadres and kinfolk and you'll have more fun than a thirsty Texan at a Margarita convention.  Try your skill at 5,000 questions in five categories: Texas Sports, Entertainment, No Place but Texas, Cities and Towns, and Lone Star Legends.  It aint easy, Bubba.  You'll hit some dry holes in this game, but you gotta keep drillin' away at the trivia questions till you hit your gusher.  And if you love Texas, you'll strike it rich with Texas Trivia.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
