It has its instruction sheet, play field, score pad, 33rpm record, Cub player photographs and a few plastic disks.&lt;br/&gt;You call your play and play the record. Depending which groove the needle slots into gives you your result.&lt;br/&gt;RCA were interested enough to design another, more simple game that was just an album sleeve and a record. The board was on the back of the sleeve. You had to make your own pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
