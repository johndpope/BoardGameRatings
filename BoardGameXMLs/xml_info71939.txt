							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Italy Awakes</name>
									
			<description>Italy Awakes: The Birth of a Nation 1848-1859&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a simple and very playable simulation of the Italian Wars for Independence, the First and the Second, with 2 scenarios (1848 and 1859), for&lt;br/&gt;two players, but also playable solitaire without significant problems. It can be completed in under 3 hours of play, with enough beef to interest even&lt;br/&gt;the grognard, but mostly for the newcomers to the hobby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game turn is 10 days of real time and each unit represents around 3/4000 soldiers. In the tradition of our previous effort, Prussia Rising, Italy awakes is more a game than an historical&lt;br/&gt;simulation, but we still think that playing it could be a fun way to learn a little more about such an important period for the history of Italy, Europe&lt;br/&gt;and the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains:&lt;br/&gt;5 Pages of Rules&lt;br/&gt;63 x 29cm Map (in 3 parts)&lt;br/&gt;395 Counters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
