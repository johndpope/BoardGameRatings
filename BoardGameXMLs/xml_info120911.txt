			<description>Flight Assignment: A.T.P. (&amp;quot;Airline Transport Pilot&amp;quot; or simply &amp;quot;ATP&amp;quot;) was a flight simulator for personal computers released in 1990 by the now-defunct subLOGIC. It runs on MS-DOS based PCs. The simulation models the Boeing 737, 747, 767, Airbus A320 and Shorts 360. It features most major aviation beacons in the United States and about 30 major airports. It also includes a multi-voiced air traffic control simulator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's July 1990 release was snarled by a lawsuit from Microsoft, which claimed ownership of some of subLOGIC's source code rights, and it was settled with a number of concessions on the part of subLOGIC, most notably dropping the phrase &amp;quot;flight simulator&amp;quot; from all of its products. This allowed the release of ATP in December 1990. Releases and updates continued through 1993.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sierra, who bought subLOGIC in 1995, had planned a re-release of ATP for Windows in the late 1990s but this never came to fruition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Flight Assignment: A.T.P.&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Put yourself at the controls of a Boeing 737, 747, 767 or Airbus A320 jet airliner.
