That is the challenge. You will have no time to waste.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catalog Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Captain Kirk, your mission is to stop the Klingon invasion of Federation space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll do battle with your phasers and a complement of photon torpedoes as you search out the enemy.

You'll need to refuel periodically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch out, too, for the fickle Romulans who attack unexpectedly! &amp;quot;Trek-78&amp;quot; is a tough, enjoyable game with excellent graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rating: Introductory complexity . .. easy to play .. . 1/2 hr. playing time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
