							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sovereignty of Dust</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;We used to have a civilization. A future. All we have now is Dust.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sovereignty of Dust is a post apocalyptic strategy card/dice game for 2-5 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring a sandbox day/night system and both free-for-all and team based play, players take on the role of one of five factions vying for control of the ruins of a once-great metropolis now known only as &amp;quot;Dust.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capture your enemies, meet trade caravans and vicious gun runners, collect useful items and resources in the wasteland, gather intel on your opponents and undertake missions to carve your place in a crumbling world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin by selecting their faction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;quot;The Staten Island Resistance&amp;quot; - A ragtag group of soldiers fighting for what's left of humanity.&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;quot;Brothers of Dust&amp;quot; - Though most would view them as a fanatical cult, the Brothers of Dust see themselves as the only light left in the world. &lt;br/&gt;    &amp;quot;Long Island Greasers&amp;quot; - Bikers influenced by the mentality of mid-20th century anarchist punk rockers. Their only goal is to reduce the city to smoldering ash. &lt;br/&gt;    &amp;quot;Pax Americana&amp;quot; - The scientists and intellects who survived the fall of the civilization. They consider themselves true patriots, fighting for the American way.&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;quot;The Ward&amp;quot; - Beneath the ruins of Dust, an army of monstrous human experiments is growing by the day, led by a crazed asylum doctor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each faction has a preconstructed deck of cards, and a unique ability.&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each turn, players will discard any cards they have in play and draw three new character cards to the field of play. One action may be taken per turn by each of these characters. Actions include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Combat against another player's character or a city landmark.&lt;br/&gt;    Scouting the wastelands for supplies, or undertaking a mission on behalf of their faction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory points are awarded for capturing enemy units, conquering landmarks, and completing missions in the wasteland. Once the day/night deck has been depleted - the player with the most victory points wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
