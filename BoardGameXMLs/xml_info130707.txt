							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deceptor</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you have the power of transformation...you are Deceptor! The Elders of the planet Cadon have given you The Power. It is now time to prove yourself worthy of it. Prepare to undergo the incredible transformations!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You feel The Power surge through your body as an astonishing metamorphosis begins! First, your form becomes that of a sleek land vehicle, maneuvering with amazing speed and response. Suddenly, you catapult skyward and fly with the agility and precision of a starfighter. Finally, the transformation to your third form is complete. You stand before the Elders of Cadon as the supreme robotic gladiator of the 35th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the master of deception. You are Deceptor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ultimate Challenge. The Elders have compelled you to undertake a perilous journey. TO travel beyond time and space to a multi-dimensional world filled with fantastic creatures, extraordinary terrain and unparalleled dangers. A quest, Deceptor, which will prove to be the ultimate challenge of your life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To survive, you must prove yourself the master of transformation, and of the mysterious world you survey. In the maze of corridors that catacomb this foreboding realm, you will battle myriads of terrifying aliens...all bent on your destruction: Replicoids. Ion Vipers. Plasmadons.  Flying Sadytes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only The Power can keep you alive. But beware! For even The Power may not save you from the multitude of hidden monstrosities the dreaded Keepers have conjured up. Yes, within the depths of this labyrinth lurk ancient terrors so great even the Elders of Cadon do not dare speak of them. You, Deceptor, must have the courage to confront these evils if you to fulfill your destiny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The challenge lies ahead. Your time has come. You are Deceptor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
