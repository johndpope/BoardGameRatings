			<description>&amp;quot;The modern version of the traditional game of categories&amp;quot; sayeth the box and this is indeed the same categories game people have been playing for decades under various names (Scattergories, Facts in Five, etc.).  What makes this game a bit different is the &amp;quot;Glib Machine&amp;quot;.  At the start, nine of the letter tiles are placed into the appropriate spots on the machine.  The handle is then pulled so that new categories are revealed in the windows above each letter.  The sand timer is turned over, and everyone quickly writes down the name of something that fits the category and begins with the given letter tile.  Once time runs out, the players score their answers.  Players score five points for every player that did not put down the same answer as they did.  So players not only have to come up with a correct answer, they need to find one unique enough not to be duplicated by the other players.  The player with the highest score after a certain number of rounds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
