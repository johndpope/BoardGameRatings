							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Japanese Garden</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a full-color, 24 x 20 inch, floor plan of a Japanese Garden, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Did you think you were really safe in this place? There is nowhere you can go where we cannot find you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Japanese garden is a single map of a small walled garden. The product includes image files for use with your virtual tabletop (VTT), as well as a 360-degree panoramic view from the center of the garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Japanese garden is intended for use in Eastern themed fantasy games. It can also be of use in any historical game set in Japan from 800 A.D. up to the modern day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Japanese garden is a place of relaxation and contemplation. The group could be on vacation here, when their enemies suddenly decide to spring an attack on them as they rest. The Japanese garden has multiple rock formations, pillars, trees, bridges, rails, chairs, and other objects that can be interacted with, making it perfect for a martial arts fight with lots of acrobatic maneuvers and improvised weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another idea is the pool itself. Does the dark pool conceal an unseen or hidden monster within that will ambush visitors to this peaceful place?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
