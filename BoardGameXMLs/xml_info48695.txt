			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &amp;quot;The orange glow of out of control fires continued to illuminate the night sky. Until this morning -- yesterday morning now -- the war had been almost an abstract concept, held far to the south and having little impact at home. The cruise missiles and bombing runs changed all that, striking at military and civilian targets alike. The Christobal Hospital was one of the worst hit sites, throwing the relief effort into chaos. Lang had worked diligently since the first missiles struck, desperately attempting to save her people and forge order out of chaos. It had been thirty hours but felt like thirty days. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &amp;quot;Blood will pay for blood.&amp;quot; That was the Western way, she thought. Yet, if that happened the cycle of violence would escalate and her plans to limit this self-destructive and futile conflict would be for nothing. She could not allow that to happen but there was nothing she could do to halt the rampaging bull that was the Protectorate. Or was there? Perhaps she could prod the lumbering juggernaut, steering it around the worst of the chaos while waiting for an opportunity. One way or another she would end this pointless war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The war to the south is not going well and, after having been the subject of minor raids since the start of the conflict, the bombing of Fort Henry has brought the Western Frontier Protectorate its first real taste of the horrors of war. Many militaristic Westerners are clamoring for revenge, seeking the prosecution of a centuries-old feud. Others argue that this is not their war and that the Protectorate's troops are being sacrificed on the altar of Norlight and Mercantile ambition. The lines are drawn but which will win? Blood lust or pragmatism?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WFP is a land bound together by honor, loyalty and family, but will that be enough to allow them to withstand the storms of war? This sourcebook includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* A complete history of the Western Frontier Protectorate;&lt;br/&gt;    * Information on the Protectorate's government and its links with the WFPA;&lt;br/&gt;    * Details on the major clans, their alliances and feuds;&lt;br/&gt;    * Information on the Enfranchisement Movement;&lt;br/&gt;    * Full write-ups and maps for all three Protectorate city-states and several minor settlements;&lt;br/&gt;    * Sample campaign set-ups;&lt;br/&gt;    * New character archetypes and equipment.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
