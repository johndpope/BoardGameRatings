							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Ork Maintenance Crews!</name>
									
			<description>For every slavering ork wielding a kill-a-zap gun with a bowie knife duct taped underneath, there's another trying to remember which is the crescent wrench and which is the end wrench. No ork chieftain wants to be in charge of this lot, so the bosses strive against each other to assign more competent crews to more important jobs in the hopes of getting transferred back to the combat arm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this tactical card game players try to win points by playing better orks to the higher value assignments, while watching out for a couple kinds of back-stabbing. This game lies between the dice game Catego and the card game Schotten-Totten, but with space orks!.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(From the introduction.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
