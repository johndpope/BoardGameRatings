			<description>In goalunited, millions of players control the fate of their virtual soccer team with just one objective &amp;ndash; make it to the top of the table with tactics, patience and skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's easy to start your career as a manager. Registration and the tutorial consist of only five steps, taking about 10 minutes to complete. After that, the vast world of football opens up before you: with training plan, buying and selling of players, team selection, youth work and choice of staff, the manager&amp;rsquo;s decisions determine success and failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;goalunited 2011 gives you total soccer! The manager selects the team and determines player positions, organizes the training sessions, and can even extend the stadium. Picking the right staff is also vital: doctors treat injuries, financial consultants reduce interest, trainers improve players' fitness, and PR managers improve the club's reputation. The interface allows the player to include every nuance, while remaining refreshingly easy to use. For just a few dollars a month, premium customers can enjoy a few extras. These include friend lists, detailed statistics, team logos, player jerseys, a professional search function and savable training variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
