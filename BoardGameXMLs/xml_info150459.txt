							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Leader of the Pack: Humanoids</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tired of sending wave after wave of mooks at your PCs? Don&amp;rsquo;t have time to stat out the leader of your monstrous tribe? The Leaders of the Pack series provides GMs with unique leaders for the hordes, tribes, and armies of monsters in their campaigns. These NPCs work great as individual threats, and they make particularly dangerous teams when paired together. Add in a handful (or two) of minions and your players will be begging for mercy! Leaders of the Pack: Humanoid includes two distinct leaders for each type of monster presented: bugbears, gnolls, goblins, hobgoblins, and orcs. Each entry includes a full stat block, combat tactics, suggested plot hooks, and sample encounters of varying levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
