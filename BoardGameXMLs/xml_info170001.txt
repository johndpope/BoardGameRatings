							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ilamentia</name>
									
			<description>Ilamentia is a first-person actiony puzzler, featuring 88 challenging mind-bender levels.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is simple, activate all souls and make it to the exit, but every room revolves around wildly differing mechanics. You may be tasked with manipulating physical structures, deal with waves of phasms or briskly bound through the aether. The puzzle is to deduce the limits of the room's mechanics which evolve as you progress. Some rooms focus on brain-melting logic, others rely on sharp reactions, but many more will test the limits of every facet of your cognitive faculties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any reasonably modern Windows PC should comfortably run this game, but it's recommended you give the demo a whirl before purchasing to ensure hardware compatibility, as well as to see if the gameplay is to your liking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
