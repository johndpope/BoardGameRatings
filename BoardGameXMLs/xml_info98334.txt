			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gunfight, Checkmate and Scribbling are programs built into the Astrocade console (in addition to a five-function on-screen calculator!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gunfight (2 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Draw you tinhorn!&amp;quot; You've got to be the fastest and surest shot in the room to win at Gunfight. (from the manual)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gunfight is an adaptation of the arcade game Boot Hill. Players control two wild west gunfighters located on opposite sides of the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to be the first player to shoot the opposing gunfighter a specified number of times (as chosen by the players at the start of the game). A player aims a gunfighter's shot by raising and lowering the gunfighter's arm. Various obstacles provide cover (trees, cacti and a covered wagon). In addition, the player's have to deal with limitations on ammo due to using six-shooters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Checkmate (0 to 4 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenge your friends or family to this fascinating game of wits. See if you can cause your opponents to crash into your trail, their trail, or the sides of your screen...before they nail you! (from the manual)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Checkmate is adapted from the arcade game of the same name. Four opponents compete at once, with up to four human players and the remaining opponents being controlled by the Astrocade. As the Astrocade only came with two controllers, additional controllers had to be purchased to play a three- or four-player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player steers a continuously moving block which leaves a trail behind it. A player is knocked out of a round by running into the edge of the screen or a trail left by any player. When a player is knocked out of a round, points are scored by each remaining player. After three players have been eliminated, the screen is cleared and a new round starts. The game ends after a specified number of rounds have been played (as chosen by the players at the start of the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scribbling (0 to 4 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scribbling is a fascinating creative game. By manipulating the various controls you can create a multi-color pattern on your TV screen and draw or write almost anything you choose. (from the manual)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Calculator&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The programmable microprocessor until in your Bally Arcade contains a 5-function, 10-memory printing keypad calculator that scrolls on your TV screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
