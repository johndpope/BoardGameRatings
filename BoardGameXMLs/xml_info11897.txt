			<description>For the famous Saturday afternoon sports programe 'World of Sport'&lt;br/&gt;A great game of betting on the horses. Seven races and you bet on the all the one with the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;You draw 7 cards form a stanard pack and odds are worked out from the 7 cards (chart in the box shows the odds based on the cards). Player bet on one of the four siuts depending on the odds. Cards are trun over one at at time from the pack and for each suit turned over the horse one one place forward. First horse across the line wins.&lt;br/&gt;Easy to play and great fun for 2 to as many as you like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
