							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chakra View</name>
									
			<description>Chakra View is played on a 7x7 board. Each player has 14 soldier pawns and 7 Mantri (officer) pawns. The object of the game is to be the player who has moved the most of their Mantri pawns to the opponent's baseline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soldier pawns may move forward only diagonally. Mantri pawns may move as soldier pawns, directly forward, or to either side. To eliminate opponents' pieces, pawns make two diagonal moves such that the target pawn is between the starting position and the ending position. The eliminated pawn is removed from the board. In addition, any soldier pawn which was on the space where the attacker rested between the two moves is injured and is returned to the opponent's home lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
