			<description>1940's America, Hidden Value Property Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the early 1940&amp;rsquo;s the Great Depression was finally beginning to ease. Americans were earning more and being able to buy more goods.  In turn further fueling the economy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US Government made the decision to spend over half a million on making new and renewing properties to support this economy boom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The government also introduced trespassing fees and crowding regulations due to the general panic of invasion, during the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are one of four property tycoons who are trying to corner the market and make the best Real Estate Deals! It&amp;rsquo;s an all-out property war, it's BOOM or BUST baby!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea of the game is to move around the board and purchases property (hidden value) in an attempt to have the most money and combined property value by the end of the game (all property is sold).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have to be aware of their purchases to make sure they have enough money in the correct account to be able to pay bills and property purchases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also various ways to exchange, trade or sell property.  Plus there are three slightly different auction systems (Bank, Secret Bid and private auction) that allow players to bid on a property owned by the bank or other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
