							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Barrel Bowl</name>
									
			<description>This game consists of ten miniature bowling pins (each about six inches in height) and a bowling barrel (about five inches in length and about 3 inches in diameter in the middle).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The barrel is hollow and can be filled with water.  The manufacturers suggest that the barrel be filled approximately one-third full with water in order to play the game.  The directions list distances as to how far apart each pin should be placed, and how far away the barrel should be rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game deals with manual dexterity, but also suggests humorous reactions, as the rolling barrel may not move in quite the manner that one thinks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
