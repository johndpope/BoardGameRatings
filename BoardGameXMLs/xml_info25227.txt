			<description>[From back of card deck:]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Millions of women have taken the original Soap Opera Challenge:  General Hospital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now ... the saga continues with Soap Opera Challenge II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New questions and answers from the 1980's reveal it all about your favorite characters and twisting plots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLUS!  Each deck contains Bonus Recipes to let you prepare delicious meals 'Soap Style.' &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a trivia game consisting of 46 cards and a standard 6-sided die.  There are 6 questions on each card, numbered 1 through 6.  The higher the number, the more difficult the question.  The questions are about the soap opera General Hospital, covering the decade of the 1980s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player rolls a die and has the top card of the deck read to them, based on the number rolled.  If the question is answered correctly, the person keeps the card and rolls again.  If incorrect, the card goes on the bottom of the deck, and it's the next players turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over when the draw deck is empty.  The person with the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that due to the recycling of the cards, this can be a very lengthy game if the players are not experts on General Hospital of the 1980s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also rules for solo play (go through the deck once, rolling the die for each one -- if you get 27 or more correct, you win).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, as mentioned on the back of the card deck, included as a bonus are 9 recipes inspired by the characters of General Hospital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
