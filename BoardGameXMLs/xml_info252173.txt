			<description>Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;Zytron II is a multiplayer, twin stick, scrolling shoot em up for Windows PC Computers and is the sequel to a 1990 shoot'em-up for the Commodore 64, Zytron Megablast, which was sold through the classic UK magazine of the time, Zzap64.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is typical of scrolling shoot em ups of that era and will be familiar to anyone who's played such classics as, Armalyte, R-Type or Gradius/Nemesis.  The aim of the game is simple, blast anything and everything in your path to make your way to the last level and destroy the end of game boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you ever wanted a scrolling version of Geometry Wars, look no further.  Zytron II uses neon glow graphics with fast and smooth gameplay in a traditional side scrolling shoot em up.  Created by Trinosis Software, a one man indie outfit based in the UK and taking inspiration from the classic shoot em upsof the 80's and 90's, Zytron II offers multiplayer shoot em up action usually only reserved for the consoles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supports 1&amp;ndash;4 player coop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits&lt;br/&gt;Kevin Murphy: Game Design, Programming, Graphics, SFX&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
