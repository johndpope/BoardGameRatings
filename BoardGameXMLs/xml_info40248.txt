							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alphabet Dice</name>
									
			<description>From the instruction guide:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Introduce an element of play with these fun-to-use Alphabet Dice.  These extra-large sized dice can be useful for stimulating many word and spelling games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This guide is not intended to be a comprehensive set of notes for the dice, but rather an offering of a variety of games and activities which are sure to generate many more ideas by both you and your students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set consists of 12 dice.  Two dice have only vowels printed on the six sides.  The other ten dice have a combination of consonants, vowels and blends printed on the six sides.  The letters are arranged on the die with the more commonly used letters appearing most often.  Following is a chart indicating how often each letter or blend appears in the set.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a-4 &lt;br/&gt;b-2 &lt;br/&gt;c-2 &lt;br/&gt;ch-2&lt;br/&gt;ck-2&lt;br/&gt;d-2 &lt;br/&gt;e-6&lt;br/&gt;f-2&lt;br/&gt;g-2&lt;br/&gt;h-2&lt;br/&gt;i-2&lt;br/&gt;j-2&lt;br/&gt;k-2&lt;br/&gt;l-2&lt;br/&gt;m-2&lt;br/&gt;n-3&lt;br/&gt;o-4&lt;br/&gt;p-2&lt;br/&gt;qu-2&lt;br/&gt;r-4&lt;br/&gt;s-2&lt;br/&gt;sh-2&lt;br/&gt;t-2&lt;br/&gt;th-2&lt;br/&gt;u-3&lt;br/&gt;v-2&lt;br/&gt;w-2&lt;br/&gt;x-2&lt;br/&gt;y-2&lt;br/&gt;z-2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games suggested in the instructions:&lt;br/&gt;Make A Word (3 to 5 players)&lt;br/&gt;Write A Word (4 to 5 players)&lt;br/&gt;Nonsense Words or Not? (2 players)&lt;br/&gt;What's the Word? (4 to 5 players)&lt;br/&gt;along with other suggested games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interesting is the fact that the same letter has different values on different dice.  For example, the letter &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; has a value of 1, on the dice with all vowels (a,e,e,i,o,u) but the same letter &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; has a value of 3, on a mixed die with vowels and consonants (a,l,n,o,p,r).  Also, there are five blends:  ch (worth 5), ck (worth 6), qu (worth 6), sh (worth 5), and th (worth 5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
