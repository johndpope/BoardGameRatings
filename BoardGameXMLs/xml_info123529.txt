			<description>This small sized edition of Pictionary plays similar to the original, but the drawing is not timed as there is no timer included.  As wit traditional Picionary, players are drawing a picture based on a word from a card and trying to get their team-mates to guess the word in order to score points or advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
