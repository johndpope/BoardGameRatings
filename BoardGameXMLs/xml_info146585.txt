							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Venus Must Live, Epic Hero 3</name>
									
			<description>Catalog Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a space adventure. Sometimes adventure authors go made and change the venue of their plots from the more traditional wizards and mediaeval times to the future. In EPIC HERO 3 the time is 2023 and Earth is colonising her sister planets. In order to carry out this colonisation the funding is obtained from mining companies wishing to extract valuable minerals from the planets. Scientists have noticed unusual electro magnetic disturbances on the surface of the planet Venus which could well be created by a sentient life form. This obviously is making life rather complicated for them and being wise scientists they will have not mad the knowledge public. As often occurs in the scientific world they decide that some poor chap will have to act as a guinea pig and make a clandestine trip to Venus - guess who? You have been sent off to Venus in a sedated state. Unfortunately the medical facilities regulator malfunctions on the way, so naturally you arrive at your destination having forgotten what your mission is and also what all the special equipment aboard your ship is for . . . remember you were chosen for your intelligence and common sense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
