							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Big Rig 18 Wheeler</name>
									
			<description>This is a relatively sophisticated roll-and-move trucking game. Players each choose one of 12 major cities as their home terminal and draw a dispatch card with two possible destinations. They choose one, get paid and pay expenses, then set off. When they reach their chosen destination, they draw a new dispatch card from that terminal. If their destination is not a terminal, then they first must deadhead to the nearest terminal before drawing a card. There are 11 dispatch cards for each of the terminal cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the game progresses, players can buy more trucks, up to four of them, at $60,000 each. They can borrow up to $50,000 but must make minimum payments on every die roll until it is paid back with interest. The winner is the player to that makes the most money (including truck values) by the end of 3 hours or whatever other time limit may be agreed at the outset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The roads contain a variety of hazards, from minor annoyances like D.o.T. inspections and flat tires ($100) to a blown engine ($6,500) or a wreck and hospital stay ($8,000). Dispatch cards may be for regular loads (which use a 1 ,2 ,4, 8, 9, 10 green die), or wide loads that move on a slower 1, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7 red die. Players may buy insurance against cargo damage (or not) and occasionally get asked to take an illegal Hot Load, which pays well if delivered on time but nothing if late or stopped at a scale or inspection point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players passing through Atlantic City, Reno or Las Vegas have the option of gambling, drawing from a deck of Chance cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
