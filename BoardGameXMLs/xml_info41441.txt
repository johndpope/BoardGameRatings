							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Game of Words</name>
									
			<description>A rummy-like word card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck of letters has 5 of each vowel (with red ink front and back), and 4 of each consonant (blue ink); plus a blank card, presumably used to replace a missing one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vowels and consonants are shuffled into separate piles; 5 vowels are dealt to each player, and 7-12 consonants.  In a turn, a player tries may spell word from his hand, or add to a previous word.  He may also trade a card by putting one fro his hand under the appropriate pile (vowel or consonant), and drawing the top card of the pile.  (It doesn't say, but presumably one draws replacement cards at the end of one's turn.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One point per card played is earned.  The game ends when all or out of cards but one player, or when no one can play.  Highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
