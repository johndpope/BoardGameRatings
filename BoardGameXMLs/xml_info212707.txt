			<description>ROCKOMAN is a bigger and better version of the famous game ROCK&amp;ndash;PAPER&amp;ndash;SCISSORS. Fight with ROCKOMAN's superheroes to get the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME PLAY&lt;br/&gt;The players take turns going clockwise. On your turn, draw one card from the draw pile and place it, face up, next to the draw pile, in the discard pile. If your card beats the one of top of the discard pile, place all the cards in the discard pile in your point pile (rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper and paper beats rock).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you draw a super card, place it face up next to your point pile. The super card beat card on the top of the discard pile at any time (rock suoer card beat scissors, paper super card beat rock and scissors super card beat paper).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you place gun card, good card, sick card, rock-paper-scissors card, ring card in the discard pile, does the specified action to the opponent (take or give 3 cards, take his super card, play the standard game and the winner takes 5 cards from the loser&amp;rsquo;s point pile).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the draw pile runs out. The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game. Each card in your point pile is worth 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
