			<description>Momodora I is the first game in the Momodora series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game takes a lot of inspiration from other titles such as Cave Story and Mega Man. It's sort of a love letter to those games. It was also the first game project I completed, so it's very roughly put together and really unpolished. I advise you to play the sequels instead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game follows the story of Isadora, an orphaned child who goes into a forbidden land to attempt to ressurect her mother.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's meant to be challenging like an &amp;quot;arcade&amp;quot; game. I hope you enjoy it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
