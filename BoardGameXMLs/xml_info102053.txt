			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone in Star Fleet knew what a Klingon was - and Romulans and Tholians too, for that matter. They had met them in peacetime, had seen their ships. Star Fleet had fought them in wars detailed in a thousand history books. But Andromedans were, when they first appeared, new. No one knew what they looked like or what they wanted or how their technology worked, but everyone knew three things: They were here, they were dangerous, and they neer negotiated. Everything else was a guess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product adds hypothetical units for the Andromedans, fighters, bombers, gunboats, refits of phaser 1s and Heavy Tractor Repulsor Beams for sat ships, new weapons include plasma pods, spatial distorters, and the fearsome dissection beam. Includes scenarios to show the destruction of the Lyran Democratic Republic by the Andromedans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
