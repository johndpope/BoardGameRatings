			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mafia's Mafia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every culture has their underworld figures - the crime 'families'. The Mafia, the Yakuza, the Triads, the Organizatsiya, and others are all threads in a huge tapestry of criminal activity. Their close ties and honour codes make them capable law-dodgers, and most of their activities come just below the line of sight of the average man on the street.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But sometimes, the resources of a few close-knit families are not enough. Enter Smythe Affiliated, and its employees - known as Affiliates. Operating above, below, or in spite of the law, the Affiliates provide illicit goods and shady services to many of the criminal families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their motto: Simple. Inventive. Nasty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AFFILIATES Player's Guide includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     History and current activities of Smythe Affiliated&lt;br/&gt;     Full character creation rules and a guide to the Caltrops System&lt;br/&gt;     Dossier of important Affiliates - and the opposition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AFFILIATES is a role-playing game of guns, fast cars, high-flight espionage, and really inventive unpleasantness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
