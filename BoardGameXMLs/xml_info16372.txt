			<description>Pizzas seem to be popular with Kosmos these days. In addition to the 'Pizza of Catan' (a promotional tie-in with a Geman pizza company), they are publishing a game called Pizza Flitzer (Pizza Speeders) by Gordon MacLeod. Paul and Paula are the fastest pizza deliverers around. Their good reputation is influenced by the fact that pizzas occasionally slip out of their hands. Clumsiness? Nope! Paul and Paula can simply only deliver pizzas that they are magnetically attracted to. Pizzas of the wrong pole rebuff Paul and Paula. The two of them need a little help. Someone will surely remember which pizzas the two of them should be delivering. The game includes a round wooden game board that looks like a pizza with an arrow spinner in the middle, nine magnetic pizza pieces and two magnetic figures. The two figures, Paul and Paula, have different poles (positive and negative) to ensure that they are never attracted to the same pizza. The spinner determines which figure a player, on their turn, may hold over a pizza piece. If they choose correctly, the pizza, with a click, fastens itself to the figure. The winner is the player who owns three pizza pieces first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
