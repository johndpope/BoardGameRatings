							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">M&amp;M/Mars Attacks!</name>
									
			<description>Appeared in the September 2000 issue of Shred Magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The world's first CCG (Collectible Candy Game).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Miniatures combat game depicting the deadly battle between mankind's own saucer fleet, designed in the wake of the Roswell crash, and an invading armada from the Red Planet. It's intended to offer minutes of delectable, candy-coated warfare, followed by a coup-de-grace you can really savor.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You need the board (included in the magazine), 2D6 and at least two kinds of M&amp;amp;M's (saucers).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: To either penetrate your opponent's defenses and bombard their home world or to destroy (and consume) the entire enemy fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fleets are made of 2 different kinds of M&amp;amp;M's (one kind for each player) - the bigger they are (say, Peanut M&amp;amp;M's as opposed to Plain M&amp;amp;M's), the more resistant they are to damage, but the slower they move. Color determines weapons abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assemble your fleet of 10 M&amp;amp;M's of one kind (color combination of your choosing) and place them on your base. The Earth player gets two more on the moon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saucers move and engage in combat, resolved by rolling the 2D6 and using combat tables. Space and Ground attacks are possible (saucers can attack a planet). Planets have different defense capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also rules for ramming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
