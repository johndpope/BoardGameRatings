			<description>In this game, players are trying to accumulate $100,000 or more in cargo from foreign ports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players place their game piece on a starting port on the West side of the game board. Players then spin the &amp;quot;compass&amp;quot; to see which direction they are able to move that turn. Once determined, they can move any number of spaces in that direction (at least one). Players cannot move onto spaces occupied by other players or that depict land or other ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player lands on a port, they receive the indicated value of cargo. Values range from $25,000 to $75,000. A player cannot get cargo from the same spot twice, so a player must visit a minimum of two ports to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as a player's cargo totals $100,000 or more, they win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
