			<description>Business on the Move is an educational business board game.&lt;br/&gt;Players run a business moving different products from China to their domestic market by land, air and sea. The game can be won in 3 ways:-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    the business that delivers orders the quickest&lt;br/&gt;    the business with the greatest profit&lt;br/&gt;    the business with the lowest carbon footprint&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must make the same decisions businesses make every day.  How do I deliver? Will I make a profit? How should I grow? How can I cut my carbon footprint?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn a player must choose between taking an Air/Sea turn or a Rail/Road turn. You can only do one or the other. Playing your turn then requires 4 same steps in strict order:-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Step 1 - Deciding whether to buy new assets- planes, ships, trains &amp;amp; trucks&lt;br/&gt;    Step 2 - Paying operational costs&lt;br/&gt;    Step 3 - Picking up an Air/Sea or Rail/Road card&lt;br/&gt;    Step 4 - The last thing you do in your turn is roll the dice to make deliveries. Income is earned by completing deliveries for the amount shown on your Order cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These 4 easy-to-follow steps are summarised on an A6 card.&lt;br/&gt;Business on the Move  is extremely versatile and can be played at seven different levels, changing how to play and how to win.&lt;br/&gt;Extensive trials across the UK have seen the game played by nearly 600 young people aged 9-19, teachers and business professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
