			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Elevator Action II&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is the sequel to the arcade classic Elevator Action from 1983. This game featured far superior graphics, faster gameplay, and smoother controls. The enemies were also much tougher than they were in the original. Where the first game had a single secret agent stealing documents, this game has up to two players controlling one or two of three characters on a mission to defeat a band of terrorists armed with nuclear bombs. This was also the first game in the series to feature a full-fledged story with in-game cut scenes, with voice overs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features three selectable characters, six levels, more enemy variation, boss fights, an expanded arsenal of player weapons, and a greater degree of difficulty than the original. Weapons include pistol, machine gun, rocket launcher, and bombs of different type for each character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player makes his way through different buildings, fighting the enemies, collecting all the computer data and disarming bombs. Each building has many elevators that will be used while gathering information and deactivating the bombs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The controls consist of a 8-way joystick and two buttons, one for shooting and the other for jumping and kicking. The game is playable solo or as a team with one other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
