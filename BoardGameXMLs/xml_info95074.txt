							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sign of Money</name>
									
			<description>A dice game where players try to roll more money than their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of six dice, three with math signs and numbers one to six, and three with monetary values (two with Euro cents and one with Euro).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn, a player may roll the dice up to five times. After each roll, the player tries to match each sign dice with one money dice. After his rolls, the value shown on the money dice is multiplied with the sign dice (this is done three times - for every pair) and the result is the score for this turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each player had five turns, the game is over and the winner is the player with the most money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
