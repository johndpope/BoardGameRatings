			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a defined scope of encounters, determined prior to the campaign beginning.  The game suggests ten or more encounters for a traditional game.  Characters are all samurai that have three Facets (Attributes): Awar, Kenjutsu, and Tanka.  Each Facet has a numeric value, distributed from a point pool.  This represents the dice pool associated with that Facet.  Opposed actions utilize opposed dice pool rolls where successes are counted and compared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has an interesting structure of basic rules augmented by several optional rules, allowing groups to utilize as much or as little rules complexity as desired.  The game was published in a series of forum posts, but a final &amp;quot;gathered&amp;quot; post puts all the pieces together with some clarifications and better flow.  Additionally, the game subsequently was published in formatted HTML on the author's personal site (no longer extant).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
