			<description>This is a simple but addictive 2 to 4 players race game (no dice are used) where the players &amp;rsquo;fly&amp;rsquo; their men across the board, racing to be the first to bear off all his men from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game the players men are called Merels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you jump your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Merels, you go again; If you jump your own Merels, then you go again! So fly across the board in a single strike, or block &amp;amp; wait for a better opportunity in this multi-color, multi-level, multi-player race game! Recommended Ages 7+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
