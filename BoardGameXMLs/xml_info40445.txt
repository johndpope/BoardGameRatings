							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pursuit of Happiness</name>
									
			<description>A card game using standard cards that gives players a unique way of making melds.  In addition, the melds in each suit have different abilities.  Diamond melds let you acquire more cards; Spade melds let you attack your opponent's melds; Club melds let you defend against attacks; and Heart melds give you happiness, which is the goal of the game.  A good mix of luck and skill that has a different feel than most card games.  Plays best with 3 or 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
