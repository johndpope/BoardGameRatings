							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Barbie: Bring The Bling Game</name>
									
			<description>Barbie: Bring the Bling Game includes 24 glamtastic rings. Take em, Wear em, Swap em. 2 Pinktastic shades included. Pinktastic Shades reveal a secret design that can be seen when sunglasses are on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to get at least one ring of each of the four Barbie icons to win. To play, put all of the rings face down in the center of the play area. The first player puts the Barbie sunglasses on and spins, following the instructions on the spinner. The sunglasses are only passed to another player when indicated by the spinner. The spinner may indicate passing the sunglasses, taking the sunglasses, drawing a ring or passing a ring. Any time a player thinks she has one ring of each of the Barbie icons she can say Bling. The other players take turns looking at the rings with the sunglasses on to see if she is right. If she is correct, she wins. If she is not, she puts one ring back in the middle and play continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
