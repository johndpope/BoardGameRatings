			<description>What can you expect from this expansion?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Almighty Lord Vortexeios who comes when the Golem is destroyed!&lt;br/&gt;     Heroes have to defeat Lord Vortexeios if they want to escape from the Labyrinth!&lt;br/&gt;     Lord Vortexeios has much Life and on top of that he moves quickly around the board!&lt;br/&gt;     Lord Vortexeios spreads havoc and mayhem by destroying the Labyrinth or changing its layout!&lt;br/&gt;     Keys and magic items help in combat with this powerful creature!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story:&lt;br/&gt;The Golem has guarded the Labyrinth for ages&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;But he was not always as we know him now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before his creation, the desert was inhabited by Sand Elementals.&lt;br/&gt;The sole purpose of their existence was turning the whole world into the Great Desert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was because the sands gave power that could threaten even the Ancients themselves.&lt;br/&gt;When the Elementals grew in power, their ruler, Lord Vortexeios,&lt;br/&gt;Mustered a huge army and attacked the races created by the Ancients.&lt;br/&gt;Many lives were lost, buried under the sands and thrown into an endless sleep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seemed nothing could stop Vortexeios.&lt;br/&gt;But then the Ancients intervened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They used the most powerful artifacts known to them.&lt;br/&gt;They crushed the army of the Elementals so that only few escaped.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, they defeated Lord Vortexeios and locked him&lt;br/&gt;inside a sentient construct - the Golem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This creation has been bereaving Lord Vortexeios of power&lt;br/&gt;for centuries so that he can never free himself to plague the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, what will happen if the Golem is destroyed?&lt;br/&gt;Will Vortexeios, Lord of Sand Elementals return?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
