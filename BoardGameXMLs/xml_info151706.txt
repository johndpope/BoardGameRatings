			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Holidays are often an occasion for happiness, bounty, and goodwill. Often however, it can only be reflected upon deeply enough during peaceful periods. Despite this, during war or great times of strife, 'Holidays' can still serve of a symbol of 'what once was,' hope, or just a reason to be extra thankful for what little one still has left. With that said, it is often hard to keep track of dates once a few days have been missed on a calendar. A Sundial is often the most reliable way to keep track of how long time has passed using the consistency of the Sun. As a result, we are hoping to bring some extra cheer to your survivors with this month's Free Content Friday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
