			<description>Each player attempts to connect two railway terminals with his pieces. The player who is first to complete a continuous connection is the winner.  The railway stations possible during each game are determined by throwing letter dice.  If, for example, &amp;quot;F&amp;quot; is thrown, the piece belonging to that player can be placed on Faido, Filsur, Fiesch, Flamatt, Frutigen, or Frauenfeld. It is permitted to interrupt the connecting routes of other players with your own pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-from back of box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
