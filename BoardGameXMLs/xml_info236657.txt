			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is the first document that features both an adventure for the Kaigaku RPG and material for Samurai Dice. I was inspired by those old 2D one-on-one fighting games from the 90s, plus certain martial arts films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with all of the adventures that I've set in the world of Kaigaku you can play this one solo or in a group. We've included four pre-generated PCs in case you want to get up and running quickly. Level them up to be as powerful as you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is virtually art-free, with the exception of some game icons for Samurai Dice. I want to make sure that it's as easy to print out as it can be. Samurai Dice is currently funding on Kickstarter, and we need more backers. With more support we can get beautiful art to deliver a rich and immersive experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
