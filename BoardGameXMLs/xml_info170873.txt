							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cards Against  Normality</name>
									
			<description>Each player have three illustrated idea cards. Each round, the Storyteller begins telling a story. It can be a familiar tale, an anecdote from real life, or something made up. When the Storyteller is finished, players choose one of their idea cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player re-tells the original story based on their chosen card. After hearing all of the version, the Storyteller chooses the best one and awards a Plot Point. That player becomes the Storyteller for the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included as a bonus in John August's Writer Emergency Pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
