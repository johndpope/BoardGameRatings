			<description>Unique horse racing game where each player guides a stable of horses through a program of eight races, where purse money is won and where the majority of races are &amp;quot;claiming&amp;quot; races where the players can acquire other players' horses.  Each horse is assigned a value, so stable owners must be careful not to drop a horse in class so much that the horse is snagged by another owner.  There are ten race programs that each dictate a different combination of Claiming, Stakes, Fast and Sloppy races.  Each horse has a card with a set of numbers for each quarter of the track. A spinner determines which number in the quarter's set is used for movement. The board has bonus spaces.  The cards have bonus moves for horses that are &amp;quot;mudders&amp;quot; when entered into races with a sloppy track.  The game winner is based on highest stable value added to cash in hand after the eighth and final race.  Advanced rules include betting options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was later released as a computer horse racing simulation with Daily Racing Form like past performances and other additional features under the same name.  The computer game is still available along with equestrian related stained glass, an odd combination of products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
