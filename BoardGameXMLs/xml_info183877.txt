			<description>The Fool's Journey is a tarot-based storytelling game, in which a &amp;quot;journey&amp;quot; of nine cards is constructed collaboratively by the players. Bidding (using the non-trump suits) allows players to compete for the prerogative of decisions about trump placement, and to be awarded dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players are encouraged to provide their own unique narrative interpretations of the journey at the end of the game. Dice won earlier in the game are rolled to determine priority for who gets to tell a story first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game requires a copy of the rules, a standard 78-card tarot deck, and &amp;quot;a large pool of six-sided dice (Generally a box of 36 will do).&amp;quot; Pencil and paper are also suggested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
