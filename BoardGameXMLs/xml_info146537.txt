			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on the oft-overlooked ettin. These two-headed giants are capable of being more than just a particularly ugly-looking substitute for an ogre, and have a rich history in both mythology and fantasy games and media. This book introduces three new ettins, the first of which is the primal ettin (CR 8). This monstrous giant is far more feral even than a normal ettin, and its heads are like those of giant boars. Its favored tactic is to impale foes on its tusks and literally rip them apart between its two heads. The next ettin is the ettin mage (CR 11), which trades in superior two-weapon fighting ability for the power to cast spells. Not much brighter than a normal ettin, the one-two punch of flail and magic can still make it a formidable foe, when it can stop arguing with itself. Finally, the three-headed ettin (CR 13) is exactly what it sounds like, and more. This ettin&amp;rsquo;s extra extra head gives it all the brainpower it needs for cunning tactics, making it a supremely powerful foe&amp;hellip;unless its heads are picked off one by one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
