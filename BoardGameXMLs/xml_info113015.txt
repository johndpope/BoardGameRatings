			<description>There are two modes; one has the camera angle in a fixed position while the other mode moves the camera around to keep the player's ship in the center of the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The same 260 rounds that will repeat themselves until the player loses his final ship. After accomplishing 999990 points, The score resets to zero, making it impossible to have a kill screen or specific sequence to end the game in a positive manner. Round 0 is the easiest round while Round P5 (also known as Round 260) is the most difficult round - there are so many levels that even labeling them defies traditional hexadecimal numbering schemes. An anti-aircraft gun tower serves to remind players that the boss is near.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The boss happens to be a starship that is bigger than the other ships on the leader; thus continuing the tradition of video game bosses.While the first stages start out farther away in the Solar System, the final battle takes place on Phobos where the player has to take on the final boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Geimos&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
