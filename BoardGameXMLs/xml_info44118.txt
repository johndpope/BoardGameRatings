							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grimm&#039;s Cybertales</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's late at night. The darkness almost engulfs us, so gather around for the fairy tales of the Edgerunners. Leave behind all concepts of truth and goodness, for we now enter the murky world of darkness, where beasts hide in the shadows and the stalkers wait outside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new fairy tales of 2020 are not for children. They are warnings for adults, as maturity has nothing to do with the blood-curling reality of the terrorist or the frighteningly accurate tarot reading predicting the future ... if you have one, of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nowhere is safe anymore - not that it ever was. but Grimm's Cybertales forces you to see and acknowledge the darkness hanging over the city; while the corporations loom over, it just steals your soul. There's no devils walking the streets, just things - faceless, nameless, omnipresent. They are in the Net, they are on the street and they are in your dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Going to protect yourself? Better learn now, know the myths through and through; scare yourself so badly that your worst nightmare becomes a joke in comparison, and you might just survive. Thats's what it's all about, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grimm's Cybertales is an Alternate Reality sourcebook for Cyberpunk 2020. It contains additional background material on the stanger side of life in 2020; also new rules covering cybernetics, stress, cults, voodoo, the Net, dreams and much more. Take Cyberpunk to an Edge you never knew existed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
