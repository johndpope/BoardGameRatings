							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Foreign King: Riots Expansion</name>
									
			<description>Europe is up in arms, the revolution is everywhere. The people rebels against their monarchies to have a Constitution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you think it will happen also in our country? I do not see why, majesty. You are a great king and Belgium already has a Constitution. But there's always someone unhappy and Belgium is no exception; riots will happen here as well and we will have to intervene. You will not want to use weapons against your people, majesty! Yes of course, my weapons will be firmness and justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In February 1848, Leopold I helped to maintain peace remaining neutral during the revolutionary events that upset Europe between January of 1848 and spring of 1849. He also played an important role in stopping the spread of the Revolution into Belgium. These riots were a series of political upheavals throughout Europe, that remains the most widespread revolutionary wave in European history, but within a year, reactionary forces had regained control and the revolutions collapsed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the Riots expansion, players have to manage riots in the provinces of Belgium and use them for their purpose ruining the plans of the opponents. They can also use the King Leopold I not only to get victory points by majorities and factories, but also turning off the hotbed of revolution in the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 10 riot tokens, mini-rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exclusive expansion was supplied to Kickstarter Deluxe participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: The description is taken from the Kickstarter stretch goal text, the contents here have been corrected from the originally stated 8 to the final number of 10 riot markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
