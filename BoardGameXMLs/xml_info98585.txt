			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four major sports games in one cartridge give you a super value! Extraordinary computer simulations of all the action. In Baseball, you have full control of the speed and curve of the pitch. An electronic umpire makes all the calls. Realistic graphic displays of the players and the entire field make the games more fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baseball (2 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's baseball like the Major leagues with players moving, bats swinging, crowds cheering and runners scoring. Points are earned by a runner crossing home plate, just as in a &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; baseball game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Handball (2 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fast-paced action game keeps the players running. After the serve, take turns retrieving the ball which will bounce off the front and sides of the court. The first player to gain 21 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hockey (2 to 4 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Score goals by firing the puck into your opponent's net. From the moment of the face off, the action is fast and furious, so prepare to respond quickly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tennis (2 or 4 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenge your friends to a tennis match and play singles or doubles. Score points for every volley your opponent is unable to return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
