The object of the game is to be the first player to save one of each of the five animals (dog, cat, pig, cow and chicken). Players can do so by correctly answering interesting animal fact questions, visiting the Cafe&amp;rsquo;and ordering from a kid friendly menu (which offers healthy alternative items like soup &amp;amp; salad, pasta, etc.), visiting the Animal Shelter and adopting a pet or by the luck of the spinner at the Farm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fur &amp;amp; Feathers game features various spaces that allow players to move ahead, forward, visit one of the three animal areas and other positive experiences.
