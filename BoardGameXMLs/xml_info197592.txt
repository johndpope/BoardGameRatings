			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MaeSalaep was developed to help socially validate a computer multi-agent model linked to a Geographic Information System (GIS) developed by researchers to understand the interaction between crop diversification on slopes and the risk of land erosion in a small mountain watershed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of a role-playing game allowed local villagers to understand what the computer model simulated about agricultural dynamics.  It also provided local player views about socio-economic issues to researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is for twelve players divided into three groups of four, each with a character with a particular style of farming skills.  Each character manages their land and cash resources.  A series of &amp;quot;chance&amp;quot; cards mimic random events during play.  A periodic market event allows transactions of crops and cash to occur.  The process uses a computerized system to generate outcomes based on character actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
