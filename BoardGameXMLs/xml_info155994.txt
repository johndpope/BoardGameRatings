			<description>Movie Plotz is a wild game that allows your group to create hilarious fake movie storylines, then pitch them out loud for maximum laughs. Movie Plotz was designed as a very effective team building event that has evolved into a crazy party game where everyone contributes to the fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin with a simple plot (a simple sentence) then draw cards to modify the movie concept. With each draw, players get to redo the pitch and make it even more exciting. In the end, the final plot will be a guaranteed hit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lasts for approximately 15 minutes, until all cards have been played. Depending on the rules variation that you choose to play, the player with the most points will win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
