							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War Games Rules 1750 to 1850</name>
									
			<description>Napoleonic era wargame rules by prolific wargame designer Phil Barker.  Book was first printed in January, 1971 and was reprinted and amended in September, 1972.  20 page rulebook includes 2 quick reference charts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules form one of a number of sets covering various periods based on the same mechanism as the very successful Ancient set produced by the Research Group, and used in three successive national conventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our dates are set to include the first systematic use of light infantry and mobile artillery, and to exclude the expanding-bullet rifle.  Where possible we have used sources from near the end of our period as these provide informed comment as well as facts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We expect that these rules will be mainly used with Napoleonic Troops, and hope that we will now see the last of French Infantry attacking in line, instead of in columns covered by skirmishers and accompanied by horse artillery!  Try it, it works!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We can also thoroughly recommend the American Revolution, the French Revolutionary Wars, and the South American Wars of Independence as alternative excuses for battle, while throughout the whole period there is ample scope in the wars on the Indian sub-continent for those so inclined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
