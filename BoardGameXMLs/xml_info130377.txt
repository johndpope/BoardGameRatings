			<description>Aerochamp deals with a trans-Atlantic air race. Four players travel from the USA to Europe by balloon. The critical factors in the game are wind and gas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wind direction can be determined by the players using tactical cards. The quantity of gas needs to be managed carefully, as otherwise the balloon won't reach Europe and will plunge into the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the power and direction of the wind the players choose the optimal flying course. The players who is first to reach the destined port (in Europe) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
