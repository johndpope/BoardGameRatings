			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This free adventure outline by Peter Schweighofer introduces readers to the exciting world of Heroes of Rura-Tonga, a roleplaying game supplement presenting source material outlining elements for a 1930s pulp campaign in the South Pacific and five, full-length scenarios. When the heroes travel to Antan Island in their seaplane to investigate rumors of a strange cargo cult, they stumble upon an artifact from an alternate future history. But as they&amp;rsquo;re trying to unravel this paradox, they find themselves in the middle of a Japanese hunt for fleeing British spies. Can the heroes evade the Imperial Japanese Navy, rescue the British agents and their important intelligence, and unravel the mystery of the cargo cult&amp;rsquo;s enigmatic artifact? Check out this free scenario to get a feel for the kinds of adventures you can play in the Heroes of Rura-Tonga game supplement and adventure collection available from Griffon Publishing Studio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamers can easily adapt this Any-System Key adventure to their favorite roleplaying game rules. The Any-System Key describes character skills and task difficulties in terms that easily translate into nearly any game system. These terms do not link to any one game engine, but serve as general guidelines to give readers an overall sense how they fit within their own game&amp;rsquo;s stat and difficulty scale. To use this scenario with your favorite roleplaying game system you&amp;rsquo;ll need the copy of the Any-System Key included with the free adventure outline file; or you can download it free from Griffon Publishing Studio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
