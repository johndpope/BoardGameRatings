			<description>Noteworthy is a card game that teaches &amp;quot;ear training&amp;quot; by prompting players to race to arrange cards with musical notes on them while listening to a melody played by the Noteworthy Game app.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fastest players to arrange their scores get bonuses before scoring points based on the accuracy of the notes and timing of the melody. The player with the highest score wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has a single note (A-G) that can be modified in length based on how cards overlap each other (including cards that mark rests in the music). The arrangement of these cards represents the melody that players are trying to perfectly match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
