							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Polish Legions</name>
									
			<description>Polish Legions is a PanzerBlitz variant with 10 scenarios from the 1939 German invasion. It includes 240 mounted, pre-cut counters, a small, mounted map, and plastic overlays portraying railroad lines.  A copy of PanzerBlitz is required in order to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six of the scenarios are based on historical actions, all of them Polish successes(!), including a couple of cavalry victories (but no charges into the barrels of tanks). Two of the four hypothetical scenarios are designed to show the superiority of combined arms tactics over uncoordinated assaults. One interestingly pits panzers against an armored train. The last features a German spearhead operating deep in Polish territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in Issue #1 of VAIPA Quarterly, an undated periodical apparently sold only through eBay.  The issue includes other articles about Poland in World War II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
