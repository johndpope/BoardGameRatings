			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick and Risky Combat? This system focuses on low damage points, no rolling for damage (weapons do either one or two points), called shots (location attempts) and extra attacks, even from the very first encounter. Very few combat scenarios should take more than a couple of minutes. A system with low damage points equates to greater risk of death to both the adventurer and the foe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fewer Rules? Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, every system needs rules. This system also provides rules but many are optional and can be used or modified by the GM in whatever way he or she wishes. I tried to make rules that were easy to remember with little variation. I want the GM to spend less time looking stuff up and more time telling the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes are Powerful? Yes! The hero gets to do pretty much anything he or she wants. Specializations (or training styles) provide a focused start but before long, many adventurers will be doing whatever they want. Fighting, picking locks, healing, using powerful magic... all skills used by one adventurer! Also, many of the simpler foes lack the heroic capabilities of the adventurer. This allows for more dramatic game play because the hero can now take more risks. Advancement is much quicker so players will want to get back to the table and play more often. No more waiting for months to level up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No Named Spells? Why get stuck with named spells that are useless or have too specific of a function? I hated when my low level magic user quickly ran out of &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; spells for the day. This system gives the spell casting system to the player. They have magical power and use it as they wish. They can harness the elements, create illusions and conjure up whatever they want, when they want and how they want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unique Loot? This game system encourages the GM to create one-of-a-kind treasures for the adventurers. Will there still be that +1 sword? Of course, but my hope is that the GM adds a bit more to the treasure to make it special and unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note:&lt;br/&gt;The title page is identified as &amp;quot;ThrowiGames Simple Roleplaying System&amp;quot;. The website refers to the basic rules as &amp;quot;Core Guidelines&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
