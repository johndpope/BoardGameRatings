							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Piggy</name>
									
			<description>The cards are thoroughly shuffled and a dealer deals each player 4 cards.  Remaining cards are placed in the centre of the table.  The object in Piggy is to collect all four cards the same.  The first player decides on a card they don;t want and pass it to the player on their left.  Play continues, with players deciding on whether to draw a new card from the deck or pass one of their own.  Once a player has collected their set of 4, they stick out their tongue!  As other players notice, they follow suit.  The last person to notice receives a letter token P, I, G, G, or Y.  The winner is the last person in, with the least number of letters.  &lt;br/&gt;Shorter versions can be played by just playing to P, I, G or deciding on how many rounds to play before starting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
