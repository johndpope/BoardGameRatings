							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Air Conflicts: Pacific Carriers</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;I am Lucas Stark, an Admiral in the US Navy, and the most advanced war machines &lt;br/&gt;ever created are under my command. My carrier, USS Enterprise (CV-6), has up to 90 airplanes on her deck that are ready to launch at any minute on my orders, and strike within a radius of 400 miles of the Pacific.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Air Conflicts: Pacific Carriers is a unique flight simulation with strategy elements and a compelling storyline. The game is focused on aircraft missions during WW2 that are started from aircraft carriers. Choose your side: US Navy vs. Japanese Imperial Navy.&lt;br/&gt;KEY FEATURES&lt;br/&gt;Take command of a carrier! Slip into the role of Admiral Lucas Stark or Hideaki Hashimoto and become the captain of an aircraft carrier in the Pacific Ocean in WW2.&lt;br/&gt;Protect your carrier! Take control of the ship's cannon turrets in Survive Mode.&lt;br/&gt;Enter the watchtower! Look out for enemies and discover new missions.&lt;br/&gt;Take control of whole squadrons! Instead of controlling just one airplane, you can control aircrafts in every squadron in the respective mission.&lt;br/&gt;Equip your airplanes with real weapons! All possible plane-weapons-configuration is based on real models.&lt;br/&gt;A real setting combined with arcade gameplay! Every plane can only be equipped with a limited amount of ammunition. You can avoid this restriction as you switch between the different planes of a squadron.&lt;br/&gt;A game that never gets boring! Play multiple single player and innovative multiplayer modes.&lt;br/&gt;Experience the most famous WW2 battles! Be in the heart of battles like Midway, Pearl Harbor and Wake Island.&lt;br/&gt;A huge war machinery for you to choose from! The game contains a total of 4 aircraft carriers, 21 battle ships and 12 aircrafts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
