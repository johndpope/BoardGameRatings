			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supernatural suspense, horror, and action await the unwary in Shadowglade! 500 years ago, the world ended. More than that, it was forgotten, the minds of those alive scoured clean of knowledge, history, and identity. In the intervening years, society has rebuilt as best it could, new alliances have been forged and blood-sworn enemies made as the surviving nations have begun to rediscover their roots. Out in the wilds and darkness, however, not all that lurks is friendly...or human...or even alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you've lost everything, there is little else to do. Some become a shadow of who they were. Others simply give up on life. A small group, however, fight. To ensure that those who stripped them of their world are brought to justice. To ensure that no one else has to suffer the same. They fight to bring light to the darkness. &lt;br/&gt;The Torcherbearers are a vigilante band of warriors, the truest adventurers of the realm of Shadowglade. Wandering from town to town, uncovering conspiracies, mysteries, and shadows of corruption, they seek to rid the world of darkness and evil at the edge of a blade. The Torchbearer class delves into their particular specialty in the realm of Shadowglade, the hunting of monsters and the inhuman. Included in this booklet are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Levels 1 - 20 for the Torchbearer!&lt;br/&gt;     Favored Class Options, Traits, and Defects! Small hooks, but strong additions to the right back story, several hooks in the form of class options, traits, and defects are included!&lt;br/&gt;     New and adapted spells for the Torchbearers and Shadowglade!&lt;br/&gt;     new items: Light the darkness with a variety of special candles, a magical item type more common to Shadowglade than some might realize!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
