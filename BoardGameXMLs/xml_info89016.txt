			<description>Monsters of the Savage Snow: The Wanderers Guild Guide to Frostbound Organisms&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the Book&lt;br/&gt;Amid the stark, unforgiving landscape of ice and snow one can hardly be expected to find an abundance of life, yet that is precisely what I, Lord Sir Edric Morgandale, legendary explorer, nobleman, and Wanderers Guild Member in Good Standing have accomplished! Within these excerpts from my personal journals you will find details of dozens of bizarre creatures highly adapted to this stark environment, some that even thrive here. Here too, nestled among my notable exploits, are tales and poems from the hardy peasants that dwell along the costs of living ice; tales of legendary beasts, immortal heroes, and ancient civilizations awaiting discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only one such as I, Lord Sir Edric Morgandale, blessed as I am with my powerful intellect, indomitable spirit, and unyielding thirst for knowledge and discovery, could hope to survive such trials and privations as await those who wander the lands of unforgiving ice. Indeed I was the only one willing to go! Armed with only three galleons of peasants, servants, and men at arms, I boldly strode forth, armed for battle against the legions of ignorance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsters of the Savage Snow: The Wanderers Guild Guide to Frostbound Organisms is a compendium of arctic monsters for the d20 game system. Presented in the unique Wanderers Guild style of in-character narrative and sidebar game information, this volume makes a valued addition to any collection.
