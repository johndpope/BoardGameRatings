			<description>Face your rival in a simple, smooth, cool and relaxed way. Pichenotte Hockey is a surprising dexterity game for 2 players.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to bring the puck (blue disk) in the opponent&amp;rsquo;s net by ricocheting the red disk against the puck. If the puck is behind all the discs it can be directly flicked forward.&lt;br/&gt;To win, you need precision in the angle and in the strength of the shot and sometimes a little luck!&lt;br/&gt;​The first player to score three goals wins !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea of Pichenette Hockey was to make a simple, unifying and accessible game for all. Pichenotte Hockey is a unique product with a sleek design, designed and manufactured in Quebec.&lt;br/&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve managed to create a very simple flicking game on a board that has the exact proportions of a Hockey rink. &lt;br/&gt;The three rink formats are respectively 1/100, 1/150 and 1/200.&lt;br/&gt;An elastic circles the game board around to hold the pieces of the game and serves as a seat to the board on a table.&lt;br/&gt;A precise laser cut and engraving offers a perfect smooth finish to the curves of the wooden board.&lt;br/&gt;The perfectly finished wood provides a smooth contact between the disks and the surface.&lt;br/&gt;The three format of Pichenotte Hockey are lightweight to facilitate transportation and storage. &lt;br/&gt;​The game can be hanged on any wall or left on a table ready to play for hours of fun!​&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
