If you have information about this game, you are invited to edit this section or submit corrections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to quell the civil unrest in Nordland, King Harald Blauzahn orders his son Sven Gabelbart to build a castle: Trelleborg. However, as soon as the work on the first houses commences, there is already evidence of sabotage. It seems some of Forkbeard's own people are involved, but no saboteur has been caught. This places a double burden on the people: to build the castle and to uncover Trelleborg's secret!In Das Geheimnis von Trelleborg, players gain investigation points by investigating the secret. However, it is just as important to gain construction points by aiding in the construction of the castle and loyalty points by supporting life in the village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Stone Circle has been completed, the player who can contribute most to the construction of the castle wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
