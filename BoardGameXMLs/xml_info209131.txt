							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The White Skulls</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The White Skulls is a single campaign, designed to help new [game masters] get an idea of how stories work in tabletop roleplaying games. This story as written is able to be used with any RPG system you desire. The story is written for 2-5 people, and is intended to be completed in one session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story is broken down into seven major events, which happen in chronological order. For the most part, these don&amp;rsquo;t need to happen in rapid succession. Days can pass between events if you wish to prolong the story, as players could easily have other things to do. Some of these events have set outcomes but players are welcome and should be encouraged to take charge of their characters whenever they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
