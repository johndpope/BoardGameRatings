							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Rex</name>
									
			<description>Card game &amp;quot;Easy to learn yet scientific&amp;quot; according to the rules. The game has a mammoth 151 cards, 10 of each number from 1 to 15, and a King card, (which acts as a joker that can represent any number required).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 12 cards which are kept face-down in front of him and the top card revealed. This is your REX pile. Now everyone gets a hand of 5 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to the left who has a card number 1 places it in front of him. We will call this his build-up pile. He can now play a 2 if he has one, and so on. If he cannot play any more cards, he must place one of his cards face-up in front of him. This is his STORE. Eventually all players will have his build-up pile, his REX pile, his STORE pile and a hand of cards. He can play from his hand, his Store top card or his top card on his REX pile. If he can play a card from REX, he must do so, but other cards can be played or not as he so wishes. When the build-up pile reaches number 15, it is placed aside and a new one started with a 1 card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to use up their REX pile, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
