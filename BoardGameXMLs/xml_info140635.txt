			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 5 BU, at the climax of the Twilight War, a thousand Janissaries arrayed themselves against two opposing armies; their force was outnumbered a hundred and forty to one by the combined troops upon the field. In addition to their formidable mental and martial prowess, the monks brought forth various artifacts and weapons of power. The Janissaries used these items with ruthless skill and sent both armies fleeing from the field. Among these powerful items were twin swords, wielded by the Final Arbiter who led the victorious strike against the assembled troops and creatures of the Confederate Army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
