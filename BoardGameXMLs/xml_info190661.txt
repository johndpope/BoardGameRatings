			<description>The Action Max had a very limited release outside the US and only one PAL game is suspected to have been made. The Action Max system requires the player to also have a VCR, as the console does not have a way to play the requisite VHS tapes itself. Using light guns, players shoot at the screen. The gaming is strictly point-based and dependent on shot accuracy. Players can not truly lose or win a game. The system's post-launch appeal was limited by this and by the fact that the only real genre on the system are light gun games that play exactly the same way every time, leading to its quick market decline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Action Max&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
