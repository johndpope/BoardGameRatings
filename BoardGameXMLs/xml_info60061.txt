			<description>User Summary: Campaign module for Land of Samurai (Runequest MRQ)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Japan, 999 A.D.&lt;br/&gt;Emperor Ichij≈ç rules Japan and the Imperial Court is dominated by the Fujiwara clan. The power base they have slowly built over the last two centuries is now being threatened by two rival clans, the Minamoto and the Taira. These two ambitious clans have gained much standing in the Imperial Court and their influence continues to grow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the midst of this political conflict the bakemono Lord, Enezga, has seized several territories in the Iwami province. Both Minamoto and Taira have lost territories and resources to this invasion and in an unexpected move, they have formed an alliance to drive Enezga&amp;rsquo;s forces from their lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ranks of Enezga&amp;rsquo;s army have grown at an astonishing rate and to make matters worse, the sorcerer Sushigawa has also joined with Enezga. Sushigawa has summoned the fabled Sword of Seven Cuts which Enezga has used to slay local kami and defile Buddhist temples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although their losses have been great, if they defeat Enezga then both Minamoto and Taira will gain significant standing and influence in the Imperial Court for such a victory. Minamoto and Taira now face a war on two fronts, for not only must they defeat the invading army in Iwami province, but they also play a deadly game of politics in the Imperial Court against the Fujiwara clan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
