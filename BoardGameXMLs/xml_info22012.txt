			<description>Triplexity, and its sisters Triple-Triplexity, Duple, Double-Duple, and Monotony, were created in 1984. The designers had been playing Go, but couldn't find a balanced way to play three. So they created a grid composed of triangles laid into a hexagon shape, and designed Triplexity. Stones are played on the intersections of the grid-lines. The object of the game is to be the first player to get five or more stones in a row. Opponents' rows may be blocked, or their stones may be captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designers describe the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each player must try to establish a winning position with a strong but flexible offense, while hindering their opponents' play. Every placement of a game stone on the grid increases the possibilities and the complexities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It is an aggressive, every one for themselves game; defensive alliances are short lived and not to be trusted, the timid player rarely comes out on top with each game taking generally not more than 10-15 minutes to play.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Offense writ large should be your plan; defense will follow from a superior offense. Quick moves will facilitate play and learning of the games.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the original game manual (Copyright 1984):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;TRIPLEXITY(TM) is a unique system that allows the playing of several different games. Presented here are the two best, TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DUPLE(TM).  Although these two games are played with the same gemstones and on the same grid, they are significantly different, each involving different dynamics and requiring different strategies.&lt;br/&gt;TRIPLEXITY(TM) (a game for 3) and its partner game TRIPLE-TRIPLEXITY(TM) (a game for 6) offer something we have not seen before, a pure strategy game involving three adversaries.&lt;br/&gt;Each player must try to establish a winning position with a strong but flexible offense, while hindering their opponents play.  Every placement of a gemstone on the grid increases the possibilities and the complexities. As your skill improves you will realize more the dimensions and subtleties of this game.&lt;br/&gt;TRIPLEXITY(TM) is a surprisingly fast paced game.&lt;br/&gt;It is an aggressive , every one for themselves game, defensive alliances are short-lived and not to be trusted, the timid player rarely comes out on top with each game typically taking no more than 10-15 minutes to play.  TRIPLEXITY(TM) fits in well with the fast pace of our modern society, and by its nature is an appropriate metaphor for our times.&lt;br/&gt;DUPLE(TM) (a game for 2) and its partner game DOUBLE-DUPLE(TM) (a game for 4) are closer to the traditional strategy game, in that the third adversary, the wild card of TRIPLEXITY(TM), is missing. But the unique dynamics of the TRIPLEXITY(TM) grid remain, as well as the added dimension of playing two stones per turn.  This simple difference alters the strategy significantly.&lt;br/&gt;In DUPLE(TM), even more so than in TRIPLEXITY(TM), hesitating to seize control can cost you the game.  Yet going for control too soon can be disastrous.  DUPLE(TM) is a game of timing as much as it is a game of position.&lt;br/&gt;From the feedback we have gotten we have found some people preferred one game over the other.  We find comparisons difficult because of the unique qualities of each game.  &lt;br/&gt;TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DUPLE(TM), along with their partner games TRIPLE-TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DOUBLE-DUPLE(TM) as well as MONOTONY(TM) (a game for 1), cover such a range of possibilities that a truly excellent strategy game can be played with any number of people up to and including 6.  (Except 5, we have never been able to get this number to work well.  If you come up with something, we would enjoy learning how to play it!)&lt;br/&gt;TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DUPLE(TM) offers what we think are two of the best strategy games to have been discovered in a very long time.  If you are only an occasional game player we think you will find this to be one of the most fun and challenging game sets you have ever owned. If you are a frequent strategy game player then this one is a must and you will find, as we have, that it is a joy to play.&lt;br/&gt;In keeping with the quality of the games themselves we endeavored to bring them to you in a quality form. This is not cardboard and plastic and with proper care, your game should last you many years.&lt;br/&gt;Have fun.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;HISTORY: In early July, the summer of 1984, John and I were playing Go - the ancient game of territory capturing and strategy of lines. While we were playing Mario came over so we decided to see if the game could be played by three. Well we played our version of Go-moku-narrabe and had a measure of success and fun. However, we were not very satisfied.  So we discussed rule modifications and also the idea of a different playing grid. We were all in agreement over this advance.&lt;br/&gt;After this the rules just seemed to come with the playoff this new game on our grid.&lt;br/&gt;The snatch and snug came as developments of our play over the next several weeks.  I remember suggesting the snatch and we were all in agreement, but thought it would have very few applications.  Then Mario said why not, since w e were able to capture a stone, be able to secure a point.  We all agreed on this advance and the game was set.  But as our skills grew we got closer to the edge and John did his blitz edge game on us.  Well, we are all wiser now.&lt;br/&gt;So when we got tired of sharing the world championship game among ourselves we decided to offer you these games of which we are so fond.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
