			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly... the REALLY Ugly!&lt;br/&gt;Time to cowboy up and throw down against the forces of supernatural evil! Ghostowns &amp;amp; Gunsmoke takes the frights and chills of Horror Rules, the Simply Horrible Roleplaying Game back to the lawless, reckless, gunslinging days of the American Wild West. Relive those days of adventure, hard work and rugged outdoorsmanship that carved a nation out of a vast, unsettled territory... but beware! There's more to this Old West than meets the eye, and it'll take more than a little courage and pioneer grit to tame its wild ways. Lurking in the rough, untamed wilderness of America's frontier are things more dangerous than a Comanche war party or a roaming band of outlaws. Shadows shift and move on the lonesome trail, dark things haunt the empty houses of missing settlers, and the spirits and creatures of Native American lore are all too real, all too deadly, all too hungry and all too eager to prove it. Strap on your sixgun, saddle up your hoss and get ready to throw lead at the forces of darkness... Wild West style! Take all the cow-punchin', whiskey-shootin', gun-slingin', stagecoach-chasin' fun of your favorite Western flicks and mix it up with ghouls, ghosts, vampires and the like, and you'll get a fair shake of what this little gem has in store for ya. It ain't fer the weak-hearted, but if ya got the moxy ya just might help make the West a safer place... or die tryin'. Or pee your pants and pass out in fear tryin'. Or go postal, run off into the badlands and come back later tryin' to kill yer friends tryin'. Whatever. You get the point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plenty of Bang Fer Yer Sawbuck! &lt;br/&gt;To bring this vibrant, dusty and dangerous place to your gaming table, we've packed the inside of this supplement with everything you'll need to make this Horror World come alive. This feature-filled supplement includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6 Brand New Character Types (each with a cool new Character Power!)&lt;br/&gt;New Western Skills&lt;br/&gt;New Special Traits&lt;br/&gt;New Rules for Western Mayhem&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brand New Western Bad Guys&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Western Weapons and Gear&lt;br/&gt;Ghostown &amp;amp; Gunsmoke Character Sheets&lt;br/&gt;A heap of background and source material&lt;br/&gt;A complete Ghostowns &amp;amp; Gunsmoke adventure Script... &amp;quot;A Fistful of Livers.&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt;What Are Ya, Yeller?! &lt;br/&gt;So hike up your chaps, cinch up your gunbelt and get ready to mosey up to the forces of darkness, spit in their eye and slap leather. And if ya ain't got the stomach fer a throwdown, ya'd better git while the gittin's good, tenderfoot. This ain't no place fer a yellow-belly...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
