			<description>Calciomania is a card game that simulates a federation football (soccer) match.  It is played with 3 separate decks of cards: Tackle, Action, and Referee.  Each player is given 6 Tackle and 8 Action cards to begin the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking turns to play cards, they play Tackle cards and compare their values (calculated by color and numbers).  The player who played a higher value Tackle card can then play an Action card for shooting the ball at goal.  The opponent (defender) has to respond with an Action card that blocks the shot, otherwise the shooting player scores.  If someone plays an Action card for committing a foul, a card is drawn from the Referee deck and its instructions are followed.  Regardless, play continues with the cycle of playing Tackle cards and then Action cards.  When all Tackle cards have been played, each players draws another 6 Tackle and 5 Action cards, and continues play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the second batch of Tackle cards have all been played.  The player who has scored more goals is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
