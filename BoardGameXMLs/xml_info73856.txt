			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warhammer: The mass combat fantasy Role-playing game are now mostly referred to as Warhammer fantasy battle 1st edition. This is not wrong, but it ignores the fact that there also were included rules for Character advancement, skills, (many non combat) and even an adventure. This was the foundation for the later Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (1st Edition) . One of the details that were quite similar was the damage chart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the content was made for the miniature game, but the RPG used the same mechanics. The RPG was defined in one of the books included in the box called: Vol 3 Characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WARHAMMER is the complete game system for fantasy adventuring and wargaming. Within the three volumes of this set, you will find all the rules needed to play out fantastic battles and adventures using miniature figures and dice. Suitable whether you are a handful of adventurers facing unknown perils, or a great general leading your huge army into battle against hordes of evil monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
