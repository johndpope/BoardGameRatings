			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sea Wolf is a one or two player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Sea Wolf is to score as many points as you can by sinking both the blue and yellow ships which cross your television screen. There are three different types of ships. Each type of ship has a different point value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are given four torpedoes. After you have used all four torpedoes, you will go into a LOAD cycle, which will take four seconds, at the end of which you will be given four more torpedoes, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Bombardier is the same of that as Sea Wolf except that you can guide your missiles. [User comment: And with another difference being that you are shooting missiles at aircraft rather than torpedoes at ships.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no LOAD cycle in Bombardier as there is in Sea Wolf. You may launch another missile so long as the previously launched missile has hit a plane or gone off the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
