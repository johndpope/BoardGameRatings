							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Highest Bidder: Art Auction</name>
									
			<description>In Highest Bidder: Art Auction players are faced with three paintings each round and bid on them using cards from their hands. Decide on the order in which you want to play your cards, then at the count of three all players place their bids simultaneously; you don't know how many cards each player will bid, nor what might lurk inside the bids. Cards are then revealed one at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cash cards - starting at $10,000 and going as high as $70,000 - are mixed with strategic effect cards and this is where the game becomes truly exciting! When an effect card is revealed it takes effect immediately. Effects include &amp;quot;Draw a random card&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Shuffle the bid pile of an opponent&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Next card is invalid&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Swap a card with an opponent&amp;quot;, and more. Laugh-out-loud moments often occur as bids don't play out as planned and unforeseen circumstances appear. Your effect cards can even end up hurting yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Highest Bidder: Art Auction&amp;quot; is based on the original game &amp;quot;Highest Bidder&amp;quot;. With brand new and highly detailed artwork, larger cards of better quality, 16 brand new &amp;quot;advanced cards&amp;quot; not seen in the original game, and an &amp;quot;advanced play&amp;quot; rule book on top of the base game, the &amp;quot;Highest Bidder: Art Auction&amp;quot; box is packed with goodies and hours of fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
