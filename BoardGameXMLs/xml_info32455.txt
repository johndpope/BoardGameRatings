			<description>The game of Sufficient is played using a deck of 99 cards (11 cards of each of the letters of the word SUFFICIENT. The game is a rummy type game where the object is to rid yourself of your hand. Since there are two I's and two F's in the word SUFFICIENT the I's and F's have either line under them or not. On the deal, players are dealt 8 cards face up in front of them. This is called the SUFFICIENT PILES and they are also dealt 8 cards into their hands. The effort is to spell the word Sufficient using both the cards in your hand and in the SUFFICIENT PILE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
