							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Turku-peli</name>
									
			<description>Players are citizens of Turku and their mission is to show the city for tourists. They need to move through several sightseeing places and then end in the railway station to finish their mission. First one to complete the round is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The play area is a stylized map of Turku with several different routes around the city. Players move by rolling a die. Some of the locations are marked with red, and on those locations something special happens and players refer the rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is most likely a fundraiser, several local companies are shown on the map and the special locations have references to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
