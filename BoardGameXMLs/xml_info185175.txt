			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psychic Enemies and Allies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Occult Character Codex: Psychics contains 20 detailed psychic stat blocks for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, featuring every specialty from esoteric students of dream, tranqulity, and faith to masters of psychic sciences ranging from lore to psychedelia, and of course the dangerous delvers into the darkest corners of the mind that draw their power from pain, mutation, and abomination! You'll find psychic humans, halflings, elves, and dwarves, but also stranger races like nagaji, ratfolk samsarans, and sylphs, running the gamut from good to evil and all points in between. With the Occult Character Codex, you'll have an entire arsenal of psychic characters waiting and ready to blow your players' minds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Occult Character Codex series brings you a fantastic collection of detailed, ready-to-use stat blocks for psychic characters using the new classes in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Occult Adventures rulebook. These characters can be used by GMs as allies or villains, friends or rivals, helpful characters or mysterious strangers, or any other use the GM can think of. Every installment includes 20 fully developed premade characters from 1st to 20th level, drawn from many races and specialties within each class and designed with a full array of spells, magic items, feats, psychic abilities, and detailed tactics for ease of use. If you'd love to introduce elements of the new psychic and occult rules into your campaign but feel a bit overwhelmed by the sheer volume of new material to absorb, this is the book for you. Each Occult Character Codex is an ideal complement to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game NPC Codex from Paizo, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
