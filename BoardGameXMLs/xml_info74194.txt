			<description>Another meandering path game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wend-edge is a path building game in the Wend family for two or more players. Players place tiles to extend their path from a start point towards a target end point. The object of the game is to be the first player to get their path to a predetermined end point &amp;ndash; typically a specific edge of the table, or an end point tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;4 or more Player pieces&lt;br/&gt;1 or more sets of Wend tiles, each consisting of 35 Playing tiles and 1 Start/end tile&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wend tiles are square in shape, and have 2 path entry/exit points on each edge. They each have four path sections which go from one path entry/exit point to another. When placed side by side, the path sections from one tile join up with those on the adjacent tile, to create meandering paths. There are 35 Wend tiles in a set, which includes one copy of all possible combinations of 4 path sections on a tile. A 36th &amp;lsquo;start/end&amp;rsquo; tile is also included in a set, which is used by some games in the Wend family, including Wend-edge. This tile has 8 short path sections (used as starting or ending points), two on each edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will find that a single set of 35 Wend tiles is enough for a good game with 2-4 players. There is no hard and fast limit to the number of players in a game, but most players would probably want a reasonable number of tiles, and thus moves in the game. You can use extra sets of Wend tiles to accommodate more players or for a longer and more challenging game with a small number of players. Wend tile sets come with different coloured dots in each corner, so that it is easy to put tiles that have been shuffled together back into sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
