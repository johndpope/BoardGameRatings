							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Project Nova: The Future of Man</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Project Nova is the second of the series of supplements I will be doing for the F.E.A.R. Corporation Fan Core Book I wrote. Each of these fan supplements will have details of the public or shadow project along with stats on NPCs, any extra rules and options, and so forth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please remember that the Project Nova is not real, that super powers like those described are not real and that this is merely a role-playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Project Nova supplement focuses on some of the key personnel of Project Nova as well as some of the powered beings that they are training, experimenting with and watching. Included are some plot hooks and game mechanics to help put together a Project Nova campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
