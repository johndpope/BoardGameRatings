			<description>&amp;quot;GoldenEye 007 is a 2010 first-person shooter video game developed by Eurocom and published by Activision for the Nintendo Wii video game console, and the Nintendo DS handheld game console. It is a reimagining of the critically acclaimed 1997 video game of the same name, which was developed by Rare for the Nintendo 64. Both games are, in turn, based on the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye. The game was officially announced by Nintendo at their E3 2010 conference presentation. A Nintendo DS version is also in development and will be produced by n-Space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While GoldenEye 007 is essentially a re-imagining of the popular Nintendo 64 title, the game does have some noticeable differences. Levels have been altered to reflect the game's modified story. According to Craig Harris of IGN, &amp;quot;GoldenEye still retains the basics of GoldenEye's story, but retells it in a way that makes sense with Daniel Craig's interpretation of James Bond&amp;quot;. Likewise, the game features modern game design techniques to coincide with other modern first person shooters, such as destructible environments and online multiplayer.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, GoldenEye 007 (2010 video game), available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
