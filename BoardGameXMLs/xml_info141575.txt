Relive the days of America&amp;rsquo;s greatest struggle: a time of blood, smoke, and glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forge of Freedom is packed with historical detail.  Control the careers of more than 1,000 generals &amp;ndash; every general of the Civil War era.  Equip your units with one of more than 50 types of period firearms and artillery.  Field armies containing the Iron Brigade, the Orphan Brigade or 100 other legendary units.  Choose your units&amp;rsquo; standards from a collection of over 700 authentic flags.  Allocate resources toward research in order to gain improved technology and logistical support in five different areas of research.  Engage in diplomacy with European powers and in domestic politics with historically accurate state governors.  Command your navy to hunt blockade runners, blockade ports, launch amphibious assaults, and bombard forts. Customize your brigades by adding personnel and equipment: train sharpshooters and Zouaves, equip reconnaissance balloons and horse artillery, deploy raiders and scouts, manage engineers and signal corps, and much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forge of Freedom allows you to customize the game rules: play with just the amount of complexity that you enjoy.  The turn-based game structure allows you to play at your own pace.
