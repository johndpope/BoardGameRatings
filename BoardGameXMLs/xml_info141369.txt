			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, all you need to have fun with a class for another few months is a few new ideas to tinker around with. Class Expansions is a series of lightweight supplements for The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game that takes a base class and offers alternative class features that, handily enough, each fit on one page or less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following in this vein, Class Expansions: Witch Major Hexes introduces twelve new witch major hexes that delve into those aspects of the witch that have not received their due.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Blood Sacrifice - A witch can fuel metamagically-enhanced spells with the heart's blood of humanoid creatures. Children count as double!&lt;br/&gt;     Borrowed Luck - The witch borrows from the luck of an ally, giving herself +20 to hit for her next attack while the ally languishes with a -20.&lt;br/&gt;     Cursed Brew - Noxious fumes spew forth from the witch's cauldron, cursing all who enter.&lt;br/&gt;     Form of the Familiar - The witch can transform into a creature with the same shape as her familiar and hold this form indefinitely, though she can be detected thanks to her eyes.&lt;br/&gt;     Frightful Flare - Purple flames strike fear into the hearts of enemies and drain their morale.&lt;br/&gt;     Guardian Spirit - Send by her patron, the witch receives an intangible guardian that can cast several spells per day using its own actions.&lt;br/&gt;     Necrotic Touch - The witch's touch applies a temporary negative level. Those who die while afflicted rise as zombies in the witch's service.&lt;br/&gt;     Poultice - An experienced herbalist-witch can apply a poultice as first aid to quickly close the wounds of her alllies&lt;br/&gt;     Transformative Elixir - A voodoo elixir turns its victim into a frog or other such creature, but the saving throw is based on level of consent.&lt;br/&gt;     Visions in the Dead of Night - A witch can give an entire village bad dreams, causing the populace to be tired the next morning.&lt;br/&gt;     Visions in the Heat of Battle - Digging into the mind of a creature, the witch gains insight into how it will move and react.&lt;br/&gt;     Visions on a Glassy Surface - Using her cauldron, the witch scrys on things far and near.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
