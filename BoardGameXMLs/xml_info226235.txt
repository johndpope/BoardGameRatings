			<description>The Gateway to Card Gaming: FourCuatro is a 2-player competitive card game for teens and adults.&lt;br/&gt;You cast spells to defeat your opponent and use defensive traps to counter their spells against you. There are multiple paths to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes complex decision making and layers of thinking, especially if you play the &amp;ldquo;draft&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;constructed&amp;rdquo; formats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the basic format, you must shuffle the 66 card deck and pass out 33 to each player. Revealing the bottom card will show who goes first. On your turn, you cast a spell, and your opponent may or may not try to block it with a trap. Spells are placed based on mana energy available to the players. A player loses the game when they must draw a card, but they cannot. The complete instructions (including constructed format instructions) are found in the deck or on the website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
