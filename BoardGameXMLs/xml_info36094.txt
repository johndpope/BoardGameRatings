							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Devastators 2500</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;The larger Interstellar warships go by many categorical names: Dreadnaughts, Battlers, Star Cruisers, and of course, Devastators. Each player controls a Devastator, or ship, represented by his deck. Play pits Devastator vs Devastator. Run out your opponents deck to destroy his ship.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a custom deck of cards. The object of the game is to destroy the opposing Devastator. When you damage the opposing ship, your opponent must discard a number of cards equal to the damage inflicted. When all of your opponent&amp;rsquo;s cards are in his Destroyed pile, you have won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented by:&lt;br/&gt;Devastators 3000&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
