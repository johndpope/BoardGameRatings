			<description>This party game consists of 12 perforated sheets each of which breaks into a &amp;quot;Mr.&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Mrs.&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Baby&amp;quot; of an animal, for a total of 48 possible families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played like musical chairs and must be played by multiples of three players. The appropriate number of family member cards are distributed randomly to the players. Music starts, and players rapidly pass cards amongst one another. When the music stops, players must call out and rush to get together with the other two members of their family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last one to get to form a group on a chair or on the floor is eliminated. The game continues until a showdown round between the last six players, where they scramble for the available cards on the floor and assemble immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
