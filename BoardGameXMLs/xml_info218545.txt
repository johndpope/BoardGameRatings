							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beastly Buddy</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most adventurers are aware that not all monsters are evil - many just try to feed themselves while a rare few can even be marked as allies. Yet even they must knowledge the unique strangeness of the Beastly Buddy, an overly friendly beast which spends much of its time as a stuffed toy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beastly Buddy&amp;rsquo;s origins are uncertain and vague, largely because it can no longer speak in its native language. From what can be deciphered, the Beastly Buddy grew tired of the hostile plane which spawned it and resolved to travel somewhere new. Upon reaching the boundary to its realm however, an especially cruel enemy trapped it with Magical Manacles which literally turn it into a child&amp;rsquo;s toy. Only the matching key will restore the Beastly Buddy to its natural form, and the two were separated for centuries. The Monster was passed between various households and magical collections over the ages, although few could break its secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Beastly Buddy is freed, it becomes immensely loyal to its rescuer, calling them Master and serving their command. There doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be any magical compulsion to do so - the Beastly Buddy is just rather genuinely grateful for the attention. (In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s also known to snatch up its Master in harmless Bear Hugs whenever the mood strikes it.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately it&amp;rsquo;s also quite gullible, and can be fairly easily convinced to do actions against its interest or which would bring great harm. Thanks to its immense physical abilities, this has led to many tragic instances where the Beastly Buddy has been freed by evil forces to wreak havoc on unsuspecting enemies. Grappling the creature and replacing its manacles is usually enough to restore order, at which point it will become grateful to the next being to free it. There is a chance to change its mind, especially when food is involved. The Beastly Buddy is strangely partial to poisoned food or anything rotten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
