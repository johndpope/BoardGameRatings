							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Jungle Book of Malatra</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to Malatra, land of deep jungle, ancient ruins, loathsome monsters, archaic mysteries and fantastic varieties of life. Welcome to the RPGA's Living Jungle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soaring above the jungles of southern Kara-Tur the Malatran plateau has been invisible to the natives of Abeir-Toril for thousands of years. Most sages consider the area uninteresting wilderness. They couldn't be more wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Living Jungle is a Living campaign. This means that the actions and activities of players and writers affect what happens in the campaign. It also means that players create their own Living Jungle characters to play at conventions all over the world. These characters, known as Heroes, gain power, treasure, and prestige just like in a home campaign. In this way, Living Jungle is similar to playing other Living campaigns such as Living City. In other ways, it is very different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role-playing in Malatra is both simpler and more exotic then any other Living campaign. Magic is rare, with magic items virtually unheard of. True, there are shamans' potions and witch doctors' magic, but forget wielding magic wands and swords. In fact, forget swords altogether! In Malatra you rely on courage, guile, skill and speed. Spears, clubs and blowguns are the most common weapon, animal skins and leather the most common armor. Favored possessions may include tattoos, piercings, scars of battle, and even shiny rocks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think you have courage? Wait until you face a charging Tyrannosaurus rex or a pack of raptors with only your spear and a handful of loyal friends, then talk of courage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, the dinosaurs (called 'Garuda') aren't the most dangerous part of the jungle...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
