							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crawljammer (Issue 6 - Mar 2015)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crawljammer is a bi-monthly zine dedicated to spacefaring adventures using the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG system. It's for players and judges and anyone who wants to bring their game to the next level (the next level being Mars, or Venus, or that weird colony on the Moon, or...well, you get the idea):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And now...Crawljammer #6 is Here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But WHY?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Because sometimes you need ADVANCED CRAWLJAMMING RULES so you can better navigate the chaos of the PHLOGISTON FLUX!&lt;br/&gt;    Because sometimes you&amp;rsquo;re flying through space, and VOID MITES attack your ship, and you&amp;rsquo;d be fine swatting them away, but those chunks of debris you saw zooming nearby turn out to be ROCK TERRORS and they want to eat your face off!&lt;br/&gt;    Because even when you survive that, you know what else might come your way? Magical-energy-sucking ELDRITCH LEECHES, that&amp;rsquo;s what!&lt;br/&gt;    Because sometimes you need that BALLISTA WELDED TO YOUR FLYING LONGSHIP TO DEFEND YOURSELF FROM THOSE RANDOM SPACE ENCOUNTERS!&lt;br/&gt;    Because not every character can be a high-flying, matter-chomping insectoid YOLOVAR who defends his homeworld from monsters!&lt;br/&gt;    Because that would mean you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have the chance to participate in RECRUITMENT DAY FOR THE PERILOUS LEAGUE, and escape that crash-landing on the surface of the moon!&lt;br/&gt;    Because this is CRAWLJAMMER, and we put the SPACE FANTASY in Dungeon Crawl Classics!&lt;br/&gt;    And&amp;hellip;MORE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
