			<description>Shortly after the release of System Shock: Enhanced Edition, Night Dive Studios announced their plans to develop a re-imagining of System Shock as a new title featuring improved art assets and other improvements, and reworking the game to use the Unity game engine. Originally announced as System Shock Remastered, Night Dive Studios has opted to simply name the new game System Shock as they consider the effort they are putting into the title makes it more of a reboot of the franchise rather than a remastering of the original game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Shock_%282018_video_game%29 System Shock (2018 video game)]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
