The Flamewright Hammer. The Nightfall Cloak. The Boots of&lt;br/&gt;Nythrial. These powerful Artifacts were all cra!ed by the Master Smiths of the Forge, and now a!er&lt;br/&gt;many trials, much training, and years of apprenticeship you&amp;rsquo;ve joined their number. You can only hope&lt;br/&gt;that you will be worthy to place your works among the treasures of the Citadel, to be held in its wellguarded&lt;br/&gt;vault until a Heroine shall come and prove their need to the Masters.&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;This is a game for 2-4 players plus a GM. Each of the players represents a Master Smith of the Citadel&lt;br/&gt;of the Forge, responsible for cra!ing wondrous objects and endowing them upon the supplicant Heroines&lt;br/&gt;who require them to fulfill their quests and fight the evils that plague the kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
