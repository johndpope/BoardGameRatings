			<description>This very unusual game had a stick with hands on both ends. Two dancers would stand on either side so that each person was being held by a hand. In between the hands was a spinable hanging plastic piece. The object of the game was to have the dancers gyrate in such a way that that center piece spun around. Whichever team that could keep the spinner rotating the longest was declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
