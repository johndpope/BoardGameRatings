							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Advanced Tracks to Telluride</name>
									
			<description>Expansion kit published for Tracks to Telluride that significantly lengthens the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion does away with the chance cards and gives an extended set of rules covering such things as snow ploughs, dual gauge track, track maintenance and seasonal weather variations. It also introduces a more varied set of victory conditions as well as &amp;quot;personality cards&amp;quot; in the form of special engineers, lawyers and promoters to help you with your track building, court injunctions and financing. More flavour and more interest, but at the almost inevitable cost of a longer playing time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
