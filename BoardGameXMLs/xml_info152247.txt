			<description>In Quizmysteriet your whole family gets to use both cunning and general knowledge to figure out a mysterious theft that a famous person has committed. Is it Little Red Riding Hood that has stolen an egg-roll and is hiding in New York? Or is it Christopher Columbus that has taken a hammer-head shark and is now hiding out in the Sahara desert?&lt;br/&gt;The player that first unravels the mystery will be crowned the city's new master-detective!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players will move about the city, looking for clues as to WHO did the crime, WHAT they stole and WHERE the thief is hiding. The game has been compared to a mixture of Cops 'n' Robbers, Clue and a trivia-game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing, the players roll the dice and then move about the board, trying to get to the different clue-squares (3 different color-coded clues to each part of the answer exists) where they get a clue as to who did the deed, what they stole or where they are hiding and they also get a clue-chip. These chips can be used to get help from the citys former master-detective if the player has a hard time in figuring out the clues.  &lt;br/&gt;When the player thinks he or she has the correct answer they move to the police-station as quickly as possible and once there they get to write down their guesses. If they have guessed correctly they win the game, otherwise they are out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
