			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Zone Killing Zone]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this sequel to Sega Saturn's Battle Monsters, there are a total of 14 characters in the game, and two modes: Normal Mode which is a standard fighting game mode, and Auto Mode. In Auto mode the player selects a type of monster, making their own version of one of the seven playable characters. Auto mode comprises three tournaments, during which the player can upgrade their monster by winning battles. Unlike the 2D digitized actors and platforms of its predecessor, the gameplay is more like Virtua Fighter in terms of 3D characters, move sets and ring outs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features 14 fighters, 7 unique playable characters and 7 visually different but identically playing versions chosen by player 2 or the CPU. An unplayable boss character awaits at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Werewolf&lt;br/&gt;Gush (P1) / Toma (P2)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Faerie&lt;br/&gt;Sherry (P1) / Felir (P2)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minotaur&lt;br/&gt;Batch (P1) / Tairos (P2)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Giant (Frankenstein's Monster)&lt;br/&gt;Drake (P1) / Vilken (P2)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mummy&lt;br/&gt;Rem (P1) / Majete (P2)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gorgon&lt;br/&gt;Rerner (P1) / Karla (P2)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skeleton Warrior&lt;br/&gt;Kal (P1) / Hal (P2)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
