			<description>Your grandmother has left you in charge of her home while she is on vacation. You take on the task of babysitting the kids she usually babysits. You start off babysitting one child, and as your clients grow so do your placement. You are asked to take regular babysitting test to gain your license. Your advisor, which is a talking stork, helps you along the way by defining the different signals the baby makes. You must feed, bathe, change, entertain, and put to sleep the baby. When you get the highest degree in babysitting as possible you beat the game. You can play several mini games including vacuuming, pushing the babies in their swings and trimming the hedges. Babysitting also can earn you money which you can then spend on toys, paint etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Imagine: Babies&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
