			<description>MoonDragon is a game consisting of fourteen hand-painted stones. The stones represent two dragons, each consisting of seven parts: a head, two wings and four legs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players control one dragon, and try to chase the other dragon away from the moon. The fight involves taking up complicated stances, which should protect your dragon's vulnerable areas while allow him to bite your opponent's dragon. These stances can get quite complicated, for example: your head between your right wing and a hind leg, while your front legs are over your left wing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
