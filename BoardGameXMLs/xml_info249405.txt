							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Climate Oasis</name>
									
			<description>It&amp;rsquo;s the year 2070: climate change wasn&amp;rsquo;t a lie and the world has seen numerous changing disasters. First the weather, then the bees, followed by 90% of the entire flora, including the crops. Europe has been long divided and all major governments have fallen. Drones and CRISPR babies rule the day, while antibiotics immune bacteria and EbolAIDS infests the remainder of human kind.&lt;br/&gt;But not everybody seems to suffer, as money can ALWAYS be made. Enter &amp;ldquo;All$eedkorp&amp;rdquo;, a big corporation that has patented new crops that need to be fertilized by genetically modified honeyBEES&amp;trade;, owned by the same company. Babies are born indentured to the Korp Store for their genetic enhancements, and can never pay off the debt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many try to escape the Korp, and some even survive: rebels, who seek a life outside the corporate. You are one of those rebels. Together you must survive the environmental dangers and build your Climate Oasis, while being hunted by the corporation. Work on sustainable projects and reinvent old technology like 3d-printing, and maybe there will be a future&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climate Oasis is a collaborative resource management board game that takes place in the year 2070, and explores possible (and fantastical) challenges society might face. Although you have common goals there isn&amp;rsquo;t one way to success. Upgrade your character, build your Climate Oasis and learn special skills to turn the tide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climate Oasis can be played with 2-5 people and takes about 45 minutes to play. The game is played in turns. Players take tokens (skills) from a common bag and use them to complete projects. Projects generate resources, which can be used to solve threats and finalize projects. However, every player has a specific set of skills, so everybody will need to collaborate in order to build the Climate Oasis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
