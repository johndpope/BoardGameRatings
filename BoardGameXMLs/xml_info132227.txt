			<description>from the designer's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two tribes are competing for territory by breeding.  Couples make babies.  My most thematic game :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Population Pressure is a game for 2 players, played on a hexhex board.  I recommend Hexhex5 to start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The board begins empty.&lt;br/&gt; 2. To begin, one player places one white and one black stone on any vacant spaces on the board, and the other player decides whether to play as White or Black.&lt;br/&gt; 3. Starting with Black, the players take turns.  You may place one stone  on any vacant space on each turn, until you have a group on the board of size 2 or larger.  After that, on your turn you may place as many stones on vacant spaces as you have groups of size 2 or larger on the board. &lt;br/&gt; 4. The game ends when the board is full, and the player with the largest group wins.   If the players&amp;rsquo; largest groups are the same size, the player with the fewest stones on the board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On larger boards, you might experiment with higher minimum group sizes (polyamory?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
