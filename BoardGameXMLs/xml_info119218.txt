			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, the player controls two shield-like characters, Magus and Questor, and must negotiate 15 levels of the game to escape. With the levels playable in any order, the player has a grand total of 2000 moves to complete them all. Each level is a maze with the two shields starting in different locations. The player can switch between the two controllable characters at any time, and must collect all the balloons present on the level before reaching the exit with either character. Perils to be negotiated are fish (which fall vertically down if their support is removed), and chickens (which 'fall' similarly to the left if anything blocking them is removed).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
