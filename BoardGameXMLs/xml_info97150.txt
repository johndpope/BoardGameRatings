			<description>&amp;quot;Challenge your memory and test your luck as you race to collect seven Bible verses over seven rounds and win the game!&lt;br/&gt;Learn what the Bible says about the creation as you lay down one completed verse per hand. Then discard key words from the verses to outscore your opponents. If you can't complete the verse before the round ends, you must try, try again!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players attempt to collect a set of four numbered, color coded cards that complete a Bible verse. This is done by drafting and discarding. Once a complete verse has been collected the player then lays down their set and tries to go out as soon as possible by discarding their remaining cards on other players' sets. Keyword cards and other action cards add an extra twist to the gameplay. At the end of each round, points are 'awarded' based on remaining cards-in-hand, and after seven rounds the lowest scorer wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
