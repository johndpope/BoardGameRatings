							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">30 Character Motivations</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adamant Entertainment, the first Pathfinder support publisher, presents this optional addition to the creation process for your Pathfinder Characters: 30 Character Motivations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Motivations are strong personality traits or passions which represent beliefs or ideals that shape a character&amp;rsquo;s actions and behavior. Motivations find their way into almost every aspect of a character&amp;rsquo;s life and can occasionally be difficult to control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some ways, Character Motivations are similar to Character Traits. In fact, Traits and Motivations can be used in tandem to create well realized character backgrounds. One important distinction between Traits and Character Motivations, however, is that Character Motivations tend to be a much more integral part of the character than Traits normally are, and subsequently convey considerably larger benefits. Character Motivations can easily dominate most facets of a character&amp;rsquo;s personality and typically require a heavier role-playing commitment from the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF features 15 pairs of opposed Motivations, and full rules for their use in your Pathfinder campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
