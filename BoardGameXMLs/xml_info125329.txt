							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Standing Stones</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ring of standing stones is a well known landmark in the north. It actually consists of two rings of monolithic stones surrounding an even taller menhir atop a grassy hill. The outer ring consists of twenty four smaller stones on which an equal number of slightly smaller stones rest forming an unbroken circle. The inner circle consists only of ten stones although those stand slightly taller they are still dwarfed by the central menhir. All these standing stones with the exception of the central menhir are inscribed with countless lines of some runic script.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rumors say that this circle was erected by the warlord Vaelar in the distant past before he led his army to an unknown doom in the icy wastes of the north and that the scriptures are actually the names of the fallen. Other rumors speculate that the warlord himself might actually be buried under this hill, but no one ever dared to try and dig him up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
