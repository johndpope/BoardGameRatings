							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ruddy Vikings: Heroic Deck</name>
									
			<description>The Heroic Deck is an expansion for the standard Ruddy Vikings Deck filled with all sorts of goodness that brings more crazyness to the game!&lt;br/&gt;The expansion includes Heroic Vikings with unique abilities. The Heroic Viking Cards have built in buffers which make them more likely to get past defences.&lt;br/&gt;This coupled with new defences and new buffers mean that players never have to stop having fun filled bearded gaming sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
