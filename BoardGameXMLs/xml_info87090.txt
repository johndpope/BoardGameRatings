			<description>User Summary: Game Chef 2010 Design Competition Submission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;A role playing game for 1 or more players along with a traditional game master role, intent on the journey involved in exploring a strange city located somewhere not entirely known, far from the comfortable and familiar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In A City RPG the players take on traditional characters, sometimes with non-traditional abilities, and just explore the city and their surroundings, to discover what can be found in a straightforward RPG fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A City is not an entry level Roleplaying Game. The author presupposes at least a passing familiarity to the idea of assuming characters, a player with the will to make decisions and to come up with things for a character to do, outside of having a Game Master. The players must have some idea of what a character might like to do, have some sense of independence in order to succeed, to enjoy, playing a game set in A City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Likewise a Game Master, term used here, must have some idea of what sounds good to them, to run the game well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time to dive into the game set in A City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
