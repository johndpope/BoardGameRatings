			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cunning of a Man, Body of a Beast!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minotaurs are fearsome and powerful combatants with the fury of a bull and the cunning of a man. It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that they are often used as guardians of great treasures, or gladiatorial champions&amp;hellip;except when they&amp;rsquo;re all the same CR 4 stat-block from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary. Of course, adding class levels to a monster is hard work&amp;mdash;just as much so as building an entire character from scratch. While there are certainly times where only a specially-made stat-block will do, there are also plenty of times where you just need a CR 9 minotaur, and don&amp;rsquo;t want to pore over a dozen different sourcebooks to put one together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes five stat-blocks for minotaurs, ranging from CR 9 to CR 16, featuring a variety of different classes and roles. Each stat-block also includes one or more unique special abilities that enhance its combat tactics and ensure it will provide a memorable encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you want to provide variety to the stat-blocks in an existing adventure featuring minotaurs, or create your own from scratch, these stat-blocks can be combined in dozens of ways to make interesting and unique encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
