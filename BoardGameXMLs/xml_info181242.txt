			<description>from the website&lt;br/&gt;Deluxe Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls  is NOW available to anyone!  That&amp;rsquo;s right, if you missed the Kickstarter, you can now purchase the PDF of the official rulebook and see what all the buzz is about!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As stated previously, the first 166 pages are the core rules, followed by the Elaborations section which has optional rules and systems you can pick and choose from to add to your T&amp;amp;T games. There is also a 16 page full color section which includes color maps of Trollworld, Khazan, Khosht and Knor along with other paintings and maps.   There is a 50 page Trollworld section that includes descriptions of locations on every major continent and three cities, plus a detailed Trollworld timeline.  The book also includes a solo adventure that gives you the chance to bring dead characters back to life and a GM adventure on the continent of Zorr, plus a detailed weapons glossary and much much more &amp;ndash; over 380 pages with of material, Written by Ken St Andre, Bear Peters, Liz Danforth and packed with art by Rob Carver, Steven S Crompton and Liz Danforth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a newly proofed and corrected version that incorporates the errors and typos found by your fellow Trollhallans and the Kickstarter pledgers. Note that this version of the rules does not yet have the internal links, BUT once we have that done, you will be able to download an updated copy of the PDF for no extra charge.  In the meantime you can be one of the first people outside the Kickstarter to read the new rules and marvel at the art, layout and maps!  All published by Flying Buffalo Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
