			<description>Each coach has a team consisting of 23 players of differing ability ratings.  At the start, each coach secretly assigns each of his players to an offensive or defensive  position which he will play throughout the game.  Position assignments are revealed simultaneously and cannot be changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a play from the line of scrimmage, the coach on offense secretly records his play selection, choosing from 47 possible plays.  The coach on defense then commits each of his linebackers to 1 of about 20 particular strategies, e.g., &amp;quot;Key on Fullback&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Cover Flat Zone (Pass)&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Blitz&amp;quot;.  The play result is decided by a die roll referred to a chart, modified heavily by the relationship between the called play and the linebacker assignments and by the ability ratings of the key players involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
