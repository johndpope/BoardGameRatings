			<description>&amp;ldquo;The Huns were fearsome nomadic horsemen from the steppes of Central Europe. The Hunnic tribes routinely raided and pillaged their neighbors, and each other. The famed Attila was able to unite many of the tribes under his leadership. His devastating attacks on the Christian peoples of Europe earned Attila the nickname 'The Scourge of God.'&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In 451 AD Attila led a large army west across the Rhine River. After rampaging through Gaul for a time the Huns were confronted by an army commanded by the Roman general Aetius and the Visigoth General Theodoric. At the battle of Chalons the Hunnic invasion was turned back. This decisive victory saved Western Europe from the Huns.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8).
