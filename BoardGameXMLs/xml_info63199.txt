			<description>Cycle is an easy to learn yet innovative strategic racing game that uses an action based type of system. No dice, cards, or record keeping are needed and scores are kept on the score track as the race progresses. Each player controls a team of four cyclist which one is a leader in each team. The leader has one bonus action that can be performed during the race which may be played out of turn. The leader also gets bonus points if he finishes the race first among his own teammates, more challenging than it sounds. The team with the highest score wins. The heaviest hitters in gaming should find this game enjoyable and challenging along with everybody else that enjoys a good race game. Warning: The slowest rider's are penalized with negative points at the finish so don't forget about those drifting back. I hope to do a small print run at some point and plan on working on a final design within the next year. Race On and on and on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The release date for Cycle is indefinite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
