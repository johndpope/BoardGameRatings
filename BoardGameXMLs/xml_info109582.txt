A stone may move in only a single direction on a turn. There are no jumps and no captures of opponent pieces. When a player's stone lands immediately next to a stone of its own color, in any direction, on or within the 15 nodes of the central triangular region of the board the moving stone captures the resting stone, which is removed from the board...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To be the first player to have only one stone remaining on the board, occupying one of the 3 central nodes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
