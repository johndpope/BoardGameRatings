							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goblin Stole My Chicken</name>
									
			<description>That's right, Goblins are stealing chickens, and it's your job to stop them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is a farmer trying to keep their fences up to keep the goblins out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, sometimes it's easier to send goblins to your neighbors ... and maybe burn down his fence!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you will play cards to fend off goblin attacks and find ways to make things uncomfortable for your neighbors. Hire town guards to protect your farm, release the hounds to scare goblins away, burn your neighbors fences, place signs to send goblins to your neighbors farm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one person is out of chickens, the person with the most chickens left is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
