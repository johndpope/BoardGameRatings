			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stronghold of Caer Callidyr, overlooking the bay south of the Fairheight Mountains, was cloaked in mist. But the druid standing on the citadel&amp;rsquo;s wall, clad in his dark, green cloak could see the treetops of the Dernall Forest, like green teeth sprouting from the mist. The forest was home to the notorious Fernmouth Estate an asylum for those deemed insane. The druid knew the truth, however. All of the inmates were completely sane the day they were brought in, kicking and screaming. Their minds shattered only after they arrived. But now one of the patients escaped. The druid shuddered and began his descent off the wall. &amp;quot;The secret of Fernmouth Estate is about to be unveiled&amp;quot; he thought. &amp;quot;May the Earthmother protect us all...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
