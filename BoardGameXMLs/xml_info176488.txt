							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GREXIT</name>
									
			<description>Grexit is a card driven competitive game in which up to 4 creditor countries (USA, Germany, Russia and China) vie for contol over the valuable resources of the debtor country (Greece) through economic pressure and by enforcing policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Creditor country has it's own special ability that affects it's balance in the game, while the Debtor country draws a &amp;quot;political party&amp;quot; card to determine what kind of government is in power (left, center or right, each with it's own special ability). All the players draw a hidden objective card which will give them their own personal agenda to fullfill. These agendas will most of the time lead to conflict of interest between the players. Objectives can be for example: to control the most of one kind of resource (eg. oil deposits, natural gas), to own public utilities or services of general interest (eg. Power, Water or Telecommunications) or to save the country (preventing the country from either falling apart in revolt or declaring bankruptcy) or ruining the country (to end the game before the 8th turn).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with each player drawing hidden objective cards&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, an event card is drawn, which will give flavor to the game as well as affect the policies and actions taken during that turn. &lt;br/&gt;Then, the players controlling the creditor countries, draw cards from the &amp;quot;Memorandum&amp;quot; deck and choose which policies they'd like to have adopted by the debtor country. In order to entice the Debtor, they offer the policies face down with a bribe card face up. Bribes can be either money or relief measures which give victory points and breathing space respectively to the Debtor player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Memorandum policies enforced are now laws and are placed on the board. There are various categories of policies, such as budget cuts, salary reductions, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Debtor player may reject a Creditor's offer and hidden measure card but that will enable the Creditor to play a &amp;quot;pressure&amp;quot; card which usually has a negative effect on the Debtor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While these policies are in effect, they provide victory points to the Creditor that proposed them, until a relief measure card of the same category is played which generally negates the policy card removing it from the game and depriving the policy's owner from it's victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the creditors have a greater goal in mind. The country is rich in resources and properties which, while controlled, also provide victory points to their owner. To own a property, a creditor needs to pass privatisation policies, through which, he exchanges the debt owned to him for one or more properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That said, after a certain point in the game, there is a delicate balance to be maintained between happiness/unhappiness and the ever growing debt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enforcing measures has impact on the Debtor country, which sees it's people's happiness dropping and it's Debt rising. Should the people's happiness reach 0, the people rise up in revolt. Should the Debt reach it's maximum point, the Country declares bankruptcy. In either case, the game will end. Otherwise, the game ends in 8 turns. After the game ends in any of the afore mentioned ways, the players compare their victory points to declare the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a general rule, in order for the creditor player to earn victory points, he needs to control properties and to fullfill their hidden objectives to win the game, while any debt owed to him by the debtor player by the end of the game will be lost. On the other hand, the debtor player earns victory points from the bribes accepted, from the properties that remain public, from the happiness of his people (if any) and from the level of the debt (if he hasn't declared bankruptcy).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
