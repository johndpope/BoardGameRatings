							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tales of the Ethersea</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Gothic Steampunk campaign in spaaaaaaaaaace for fantasy rpgs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escape from the terrestrial realm was but an idle daydream for most, until an alien etherfleet crashed down upon the World Between, scattering unheralded bits of advanced technology among an unwitting populace. Although much of the alien technology remains mysterious, some bright coves from the various nations began to get the hang of how some of it worked and even managed to put the debris together in new and inventive ways. Several kingdoms (and even some secret societies) were able to reverse-engineer craft that were capable of traversing the Ethersea&amp;mdash;what we might refer to as &amp;ldquo;outer space&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;via phlogiston-powered engines. The largest of these craft were dubbed arkworlds, for they were big enough to house a population of travelers, explorers, and expatriates willing to take them into the furthest reaches of the unknown Ethersea in search of new worlds that could be colonized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
