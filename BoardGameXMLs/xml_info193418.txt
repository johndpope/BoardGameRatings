							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bleeding Border</name>
									
			<description>Bleeding Border is a first person 3d survival horror game in which the player must escape through the top of a monster infested building using his own blood as the only defense mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with Zoey, losing blood from a fresh amputated arm, after a scavenge incursion went south and all her team members were killed by the apparently indestructible PaleOnes.&lt;br/&gt;Zoey escaped thanks to a rare genetic mutation that makes her blood act like poison in contact with the PaleOnes bodies(it&amp;rsquo;s a shame that to find that she first had to lose her arm :( )&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bleeding Border is inspired in old school games like ResidentEvil and Silent Hill, adding modern elements of gameplay and aesthetics.&lt;br/&gt;In this game the player needs to hide, run and avoid , and only as the last resource use blood, because as soon as the player hurts himself he will start to bleed, and die if his wounds are not treated in time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Needless to say is an adventure with a lot of gore and blood filled action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
