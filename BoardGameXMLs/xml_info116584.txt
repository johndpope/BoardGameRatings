							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Red Crown Game</name>
									
			<description>Promotional item by Red Crown, the oil and petrol supplier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a simple spin and move game. If you land on a square with instructions, they must be obeyed. The track is described in the rules as the 'Road to Better Mileage'. This would have been a much better name for the game, but they went for the safe, mundane option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first one to reach the end of the 'road', wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
