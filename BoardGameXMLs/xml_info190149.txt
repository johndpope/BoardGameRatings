							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Creatures of the Apocalypse Codex</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mutant manual showcases 20 nasty freaks to keep your players on their toes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this tome are the first 13 deviant adversaries from the free PDF offerings: Sickle Foot, Red Harvester, Spikeback, Junk Mobster, Bog-Billy, Scraplurker, Back Hatcher, Quasi, Spiker, Wailing Jhonny, Tyrannosapien, Chest Head, and Talontessa. Also included is the disturbing Muto-Harpy which was previously only available to Society of Excavator members by way of joining our forums, and six never before seen nasties including the troublesome little Nubinz, the grotesque Walking Mouther, slithering, highly venomous Snaykin, enormous yet varied race of Rubble Trolls, winged terror called the Apocalypse Moth, and most fearsome, intelligent and terrifying of all, the Spider Lord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of these creatures come with their own mutation listing, and many, an extensive loot table perfectly suited to the sort of fiend they are, the victims they collect, and dwelling place they inhabit. Also included are encounter tables and the full page, text-free art for each beast to be cut out, photocopied or downloaded from the member&amp;rsquo;s area of our website. Use these full page images as player handouts to show the gamers at your table what their character see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
