			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protector: The Planes is a Tower Defence game where the aim is to defend a path across the screen from waves of enemies who attempt to traverse it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have a starting allocation of gold and spend this on your first units.  As enemies are defeated you earn more gold and can build new units or upgrade existing ones.  On each level you have a number of lives available across all waves of enemies, and for each enemy unit that breaks through your defence you lose a life.  Lose all lives and the mission is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main story missions take place in the mortal realm and increase in difficulty.  There are 10 other planes to visit for one-off missions, each plane having a new gameplay mechanic.  The 10 planar missions serve to give you access to five special units and their five special attacks, for ongoing use in other missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protector: The Planes is the first in the Protector series to be developed for iOS.  The basic gameplay and graphics are most similar to Protector (2008) out of the other games in the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
