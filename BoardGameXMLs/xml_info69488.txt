			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These LARP rules are detailed, covering many different areas of character interaction (with examples) and including extensive background on a fantasy campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description of the Setting from the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Emeth is a fantasy world similar to our world in the fourteenth century. The Guider army occupies the middle-eastern city of Isseter, bringing its faith and politics face to face with the exotic traditions and religion of the locals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dominion rules are designed primarily for the low-magic fantasy world of Emeth, detailed in this manual. However, they may be used for a more &amp;quot;heroic&amp;quot; fantasy world peopled with elves and dwarves, where magic is common. With some adjustments, the game rules may be used even for campaigns that have a radically different setting or tone - perhaps cyberpunk, space opera, or modern guerilla warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the future, there may be supplements with rules and background for other campaign settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
