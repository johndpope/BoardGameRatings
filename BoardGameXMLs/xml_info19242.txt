			<description>Quazar is a large strategic science fantasy wargame - very large, in fact, with 4 27&amp;quot;x21&amp;quot; black and white mapsheets (for a total play area of 4.5'x3.5') and 840 counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player takes the human side and defends the entire map against the other, who takes the invading X-Con (aliens, clones, and robots).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game appears to be a reasonably straightforward wargame of its type, complicated by a fairly wide variety of different unit types and the rules writer, who adopted what I have to assume was a deliberately obtuse style.  For example, the combat phase (with its 8 sub-phases) is called &amp;quot;Violent Interaction &amp;amp; Adaptive Reaction.&amp;quot;  The space combat results table is called the &amp;quot;Space Systematized Probabilistic Outcome.&amp;quot;  Etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a fair amount of chrome, including secret weapons for each side (e.g., the humans can get a planetary defense screen, the aliens can get a space creature which moves around and eats human units).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;840 counters&lt;br/&gt;4 27&amp;quot;x21&amp;quot; mapsheets&lt;br/&gt;2 order of appearance/secret weapon lists&lt;br/&gt;2 guides to opposing forces (guides to your OWN are not included...)&lt;br/&gt;2 &amp;quot;priority&amp;quot; sheets - one has some rules summaries, the other is just color)&lt;br/&gt;Rules folder&lt;br/&gt;Combat results table sheet&lt;br/&gt;Alien pod chart sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
