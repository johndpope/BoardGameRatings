			<description>Wahlfieber is a card game that simulates the atmosphere of an election as various political parties fight among themselves for votes.  Players assume the roles of party leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting off with 5 cards in their hands, they take turns to resolve the election.  During his or her turn, a player either plays a card or discards one.  Playing Vote cards gives a player a stake in controlling one of the nine countries in the game.  If a player collects all four cards of a country, his or her party gains total control of the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Certain Scandal and Authority cards can be played to let players take away votes or even countries from the others.  Other Scandal and Authority cards offer defense from such attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player controls a majority of the nations, he or she wins the game.  Players can also pair up to form a coalition and gain the majority needed to win, making it a shared victory between the two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
