			<description>The financial game of Chinese boxes.&lt;br/&gt;The target of the game is to acquire the absolute majority (160)of the shares. You must go around the board collecting shares and creating new societies and holding companies. Four circuits around four countries give different risk features and you have to manage black funds, bankruptcy, transfers of capital, purchase of shares and the majority of companies. The movement on the board is made by dice rolling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: it is  strongly suspected that this game is identical to Capital Power. But until someone can compare the two boxes and their contents, we should keep two entries in the database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
