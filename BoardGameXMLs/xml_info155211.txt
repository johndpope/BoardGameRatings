			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lord Oakensun was fascinated by insects, spending hours cataloging and classifying his collection. Discontent led the man to experiment with forces he did not fully comprehend. Now farms outside the village have been found abandoned. Lord Oakensun&amp;rsquo;s daughter is missing, last seen near rocky hills a short distance away. A local thief reports his partner was snatched away in the dark amidst sounds of buzzing and chittering. Has Lord Oakensun&amp;rsquo;s experiment gone wrong? What is behind the rash of disappearances from the village?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pocket-Sized Encounter compatible with the Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry rules system for 4th to 6th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pocket-Sized Encounters from Iron Tavern Press are shorter scenarios designed to be dropped into an existing campaign with minimal preparation.
