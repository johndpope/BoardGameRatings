			<description>(from the box)  The ultimate screen test for the armchair filmmaker.  Try your hand as producer, director, screenwriter, comic and critic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you always known you could make it big in Hollywood if you only had the chance?  Your chance is here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You improvise dialog for the great movie stars, past and present.  Create and direct your own make-believe movies.  Produce the poster slogan that launches a blockbuster.  Write the stinging review for a box office bomb.  Compose the title for a new musical comedy.  Supply the punchline for the great screen comics.  Improve legendary film classics...and much, much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player writes answers to various questions, then scores points if 1) others vote for their piece, believing it to be the actual part; 2) they are able to pick the actual part, rather than those of their colleagues; or 3) disguise the actual part (as reader) so that people don't pick the actual movie clip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
