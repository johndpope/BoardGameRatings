			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evildoer spotlight is a new Saturday Morning Tabletop RPG series of short books (5-10 pages), introducing knew enemies, animals and other antagonists. Included in every book will be a brief summary of the evildoer, their character traits and possible plot hooks to tie that evildoer into an adventure, and of course their stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonus material will also be included in each evildoer spotlight. The nature of the bonus material may be a new magic item, a supporting cast of weaker evildoers or even a new evildoer trait to add to the list of traits found in the evildoer toolkit at the end of the core rule book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Book #1: Sweet Tooth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sweet tooth is a bandit boss who leads his bandit gang, doing bandit things. All while trying to impress . . . &amp;ldquo;the ladies&amp;rdquo; . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this spotlight is Sweet Tooth &amp;amp; 8 other types of bandit&amp;rsquo;s, better known as his gang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sweet Tooth and his gang make good antagonists for level 1-6 characters. When combining every asset that Sweet Tooth has at his disposal (especially Tallulah), he and his gang can still remain a threat to level 7-8 characters as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
