			<description>Whether you're at a party, at the park or the beach, in a bar or a cafe or even just at home,Tinz is the perfect companion for 2 or more players. Games typically last 10-15 minutes so in bigger groups it's winner stays on. The system in Tinz is one of the most simple to learn and teach. Pick up a card and then play a card, if you have two matching cards then play the two. Once you play a card it is known as a sold card. You collect the sell value and the first player to reach 4,000G's is the winner, simple right? However everything changes because every single turn you also turn over an Action card. This is where the fun really starts! Will it be the cops busting you? A hydroponics upgrade for increased weed sell value, that sees players bidding against each other. Or the arrival of a rival gang that forces players to cooperate. Tinz Herbalist is pure fun in a tin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
