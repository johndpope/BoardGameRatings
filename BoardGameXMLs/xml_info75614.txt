							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Personnel Files 4: Martingale Security</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transhuman Space presents a rich and varied background that is excellent for near-now science-fiction gaming. But it's so rich in detail that it can be difficult to know what to do with it. That's where Personnel Files come in handy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the world of Transhuman Space, some people still feel the need for personal security. Sometimes combat cybershells and automated systems can handle that &amp;ndash; but sometimes, the customer feels the need for the human touch. (Well, more or less human.) This is where Martingale Security steps in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transhuman Space: Personnel Files 4 &amp;ndash; Martingale Security presents a group of professional bodyguards. They're a small outfit &amp;ndash; just five people, counting OVERSIGHT, the office computer &amp;ndash; and new to the business, but they know their stuff. And they're in just the right place for a life of action, intrigue, and occasional mysteries and misunderstandings. This book provides game details for all five 300-point characters, along with their AI assistants and cybershell support systems, plus scenario seeds and plot ideas. In other words, it's a ready-to-run campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
