							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Squad Battles Modern War</name>
									
			<description>For almost ten years now, the United States military has been fighting a new kind of war, against both conventional and unconventional forces. Their opponents, while minimally equipped and trained, are inspired by strong beliefs and willing to take any action to achieve victory. These battles have been fought in Afghanistan and Iraq, ranging from fighting in rugged mountainous terrain to close-in fighting in cities. Small unit tactics have become the premiere engagement occurrence with highly tactical fighting the basis for deciding victory or defeat. In this new kind of warfare, terms such as IED and UAV have taken on a new significance. The US military has learned to fight these wars using new weapons, new techniques, and new tactics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ranging from operations in Afghanistan such as Anaconda to the initial invasion of Iraq and subsequent fighting in cities like Fallujah, Squad Battles: Modern War covers the major battles and engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq. Modern War provides a unique perspective to how modern combat is being fought at the squad level and how it might be fought in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Scenarios&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* 44 scenarios covering actions such as Operation Anaconda, Fallujah, Mosul and Sadr City.&lt;br/&gt;    * Scenarios range in length from 10 to 25 turns and cover actions from small firefights between a handful of men to hundreds of men battling it out for key strongpoints on a variety of battlefields.&lt;br/&gt;    * Close quarters urban fighting all the way to remote terrain ambushes are modeled and various points in between.&lt;br/&gt;    * 2 linked scenario campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
