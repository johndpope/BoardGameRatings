							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bloodline &quot;The Family Tree&quot;</name>
									
			<description>The Kings Health is failing. You have a very small claim to the throne; if only your bloodline were just a little stronger! Always a bright child, you realize that history is written by the winner and it&amp;rsquo;s time to think like a winner. You&amp;rsquo;re going to rewrite a little history. The problem is that your opponents are trying to rewrite history as well. Can you create the strongest bloodline and become the ruler of the land?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stratagy, Hand Management, Bluffing and a liberal dose of fun are all mixed into this game.&lt;br/&gt; 140 cards&lt;br/&gt;6 [You] cards in 6 colors&lt;br/&gt;14 [wild] family tree cards (white)&lt;br/&gt;120 family tree cards&lt;br/&gt;    20 in each of 6 colors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each set contains &lt;br/&gt;5 Great Grand Fathers (1 special)&lt;br/&gt;5 Great Grand Mothers (1 special)&lt;br/&gt;3 Grand Fathers (1 special)&lt;br/&gt;3 Grand Mothers (1 special)&lt;br/&gt;2 Fathers (1 special)&lt;br/&gt;2 Mothers (1 special)&lt;br/&gt;1 YOU card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set up-&lt;br/&gt;Take 1 set of cards for each player and the wild cards&lt;br/&gt;Take the You cards for each of those sets and randomly distribute them to each player. This card is your color for this game. You will only score points for wild cards and your color played.&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle all sets and the wild cards together and place them face down on the table where everyone can easily reach it.&lt;br/&gt;Deal out 6 cards to each player&lt;br/&gt;You are ready to begin.&lt;br/&gt;On your Turn:&lt;br/&gt;You may do only one of the following things on your turn.&lt;br/&gt;   Play 1 card&lt;br/&gt;   Draw 1 card&lt;br/&gt;   Discard 3 cards and draw 2&lt;br/&gt;   Swap an opponents played card with one from your hand&lt;br/&gt;There is a hand limit of 7 cards. you may not have more that 7 cards in your hand at any time. (this included your YOU card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Start building your family Tree from your Great Grand Parents down to You. You must have played a Great Grand Father and a great Grand Mother next to each other (This creates a Mariage) in order to play a Grand Mother or Grand Father on that set. &lt;br/&gt;A complete family tree will consits of 4 married Great Grand Parents. The Second row will have 2 sets of Maried Grand Parents.  The third row of course will have Your Mother and Father. Last but certainly not least is you, in the fourth and final row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player places their YOU card. At this point the round continues till everyone has the same number of plays, and points are tallied.&lt;br/&gt;The person with the most points in their family tree is the winner of the game and becomes the ruler of the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keeping your color secret from the other players as long as possible is a key factor in winning the game.  If plyers dont know what color you are they cannot steal a card from your family tree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
