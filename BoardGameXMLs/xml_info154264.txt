			<description>Yoo-Doo consists of three six-sided dice, one with letters, one with numbers, and one with colors, 200 orange chips, and a rectangular board divided into a 12x18 grid of squares, each indexed by a letter, a number, and a color.  Players take turns rolling all three dice and placing chips on the corresponding squares on the board.  First player to place a chip on an existing chip then collects all the chips from the board and tallies his score for that round.  The player with the highest score after five rounds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
