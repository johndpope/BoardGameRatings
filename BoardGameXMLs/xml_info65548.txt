							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Step Lively Shuffleboard</name>
									
			<description>Step Lively is a shuffleboard game. Instead of flicking or pushing the pucks. You use the ramp on the end of the playing board to launch your pucks into the scoring areas. Instead of a flat playing surface the gameboard is made up of stepped areas. You can adjust the height of the ramp to adjust the speed, at which your puck will launch and you can also turn the ramp to adjust the angle, to aim your shots more accurately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
