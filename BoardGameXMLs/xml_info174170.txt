			<description>Party Game. Each guest is given a card. The card is split into 3 different competitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1st: Place Names. A montage of 24 illustrations is given. Players must pair them off into pairs that represent the name of a town. Thus, 12 towns in all.&lt;br/&gt;2nd: Words. Similar to the first competition but this time representing 'dictionary' words.&lt;br/&gt;3rd: Silhouettes. There are nine pictures in silhouette and they must be identified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to 12 can play. The host must set a time-limit and when &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot; is called, the guest with the most correct answers wins (and a good host or hostess should have a small gift as the winner's trophy).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
