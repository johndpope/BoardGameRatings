			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In German Truck Simulator the player is a truck driver in Germany. The highway network, though a bit smallish compared to the real thing, is loosely basd on the existing one. The game includes 18 cities and, although beautiful, these are not recreations of their real counterparts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player worksfor a company hauling up to 60 different goods all over the country. His income is a percentage of the haul, though he has to pay for fines (if he doesn't obey traffic laws), delays and damaged goods. The company covers expenses like maintenance and fuel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Difficulty and profitability increase over a number of trips and eventually the player can buy his own truck, one of 18 to choose from.  The truck itself can be upgraded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After earning a reputation and a lot of money, the player can start his own transport company and hire up to 6 drivers - so esp. then the management aspect of the game comes in, though the focus of the game is clearly on driving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game already has a loyal support and fans built an Austria expansion, which, as of version 1.32 is part of the standard game. The game is still being expanded, like there's currently a beta version downloadable to link internet radio stations to the truck's radio, so the player can enjoy live music while trucking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
