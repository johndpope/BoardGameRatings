			<description>From the back:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Telepathy is fundamentally communication &amp;ndash; a bridging of thoughts, a direct link between minds. Civilisation is built on communication; telepathy is the most recent link in a chain that began with cave paintings and primitive grunts and gestures. Each new medium of communication brings upheaval in society. The printing press, the telephone, tachyon transmission and all the rest all wrought change, engendered fear and confusion before they were understood and seen by society as necessary steps in evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Psi Corps is a bridge to the future. As the past century has shown, the changes needed to assimilate telepathy into human society are difficult and painful. The Psi Corps holds telepathy in trust, protecting it from abuse and finding the best possible path for it. It is a necessary step as we take our place in the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motto of the Psi Corps is 'Maternis, Paternis'- the Corps is Mother, the Corps is Father. Telepaths live their whole lives within the Corps. Their every need is taken care of by the Corps, from education to housing to medical care to socialisation. Biologically, telepaths have parents of course, but from an early age, the Corps sees to their well-being with the infinite devotion and care of a natural parent. No telepath need ever be alone.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
