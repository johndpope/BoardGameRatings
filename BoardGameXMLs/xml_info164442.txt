							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Missing Mythic Magic Volume IX</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncover Forgotten Arcane Lore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone knows that knowledge is power, and that having options is better than not having them. It should come as no surprise, then, that wizards, witches, and other powerful spellcasters are always on the lookout for new and exciting spells to add to their repertoires. While many spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook received a facelift and an upgrade in Mythic Adventures, the sourcebook that introduced mythic power to the game of Pathfinder, dozens of spells were left behind. Missing Mythic Magic Volume IX, and its predecessors, aim to give each and every spell from the core rules a full-fledged mythic upgrade, all the way from A to Z, with a special focus on making mythic spells that feel as over-the-top and larger-than-life as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This installment includes 17 mythic spells, from fear to freezing sphere. A mythic forcecage can create cages of much greater size, but with the expenditure of additional mythic power, they can also be made to last for hours at a time, or to slowly enclose on those within, crushing them in a grisly demise. A mythic freedom protects the target from a variety of other things that could inhibit movement, including being dazed, entangled, paralyzed, petrified, and more. A mythic flaming sphere can last indefinitely, as long as you continue to concentrate on it, and a mythic flame arrow can supply flaming arrows to an entire army. This tome contains all that, and much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
