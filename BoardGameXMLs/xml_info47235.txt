			<description>Storekeeper Simulation is a game based on the lives of the people in the Book of Mormon. Players assume the roles of managers at J.P. Senines &amp;amp; Company (Senine being a unit of currency in the Book of Mormon) and must manage a variety of goods with shifting values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was included with the LDS Seminary Manual and was designed to correlate with various lessons. The value of goods in different rounds was determined by events in the Book of Mormon, for example in peace times, weapons might be of lower value whereas during a war they would be more valuable. Students must decide how many items to buy and sell and are limited by storage space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played solitaire or competitively against another person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
