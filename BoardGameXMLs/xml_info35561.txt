							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Poosh-M-Up Slugger Baseball Game</name>
									
			<description>Poosh-M-Up Slugger Baseball Game. Manufactured in 1946 by Northwestern Products Co. of St. Louis, Missouri. Pinball style/ bagatelle-type. Fun to play! Simple design. The balls load under the pitcher's mound and are released one by one by using one of the controls. The bat works like a flipper in a pinball game. Wooden frame, glass top. 14 X 21 inches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game from 1946 is sort of a bagatelle game but can be played by two players. One player acts as the pitcher and uses the plastic pitchers spot to dispense a round metal ball (the baseball) towards the batter who has a bat which by pushing a lever, swings at the released ball in an attempt to make contact with the ball. There are a number of slots where the ball can wind up, scoring singles, doubles, triples and home runs. Double plays are possible and any ball not winding up in a slot after it is struck 1 time is considered and out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
