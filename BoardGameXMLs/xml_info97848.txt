			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Black Sun Box Set includes Promethea Delacroix, Styx, Type-005, and a pamphlet to cover the unique rules used by some Black Sun figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Promethea Delacroix:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though the world sees her as a rich and spoiled heir to the Delacroix fortune, who works as a top model for fun, there is far more to Promethea than that. Ruthless and intelligent, she is one of the most highly ranked officers of the Black Sun Corporation. Promethea uses her beauty and control of the most modern necromantic weapons to further her power and influence within the company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mystic - Dark Black Sun - Level 40&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guidance Points: 3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amate Me (Magic, Effect) - An enemy unit inside Promethea's Control Zone suffers Doom Lv. 2. Effect 15.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fonteius (Magic, Effect) - An enemy unit inside Promethea's Control Zone suffers Seal Lv. 1. Effect 15.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rebelio (Magic, Effect, Reactive) - An Undead unit inside Promethea's Control Zone gets +2 Attack until end of turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Procedo Tute Met (Magic, Effect, Reactive) - This Ability can only be used during the Maintenence Phase, and only once per turn.&lt;br/&gt;Ally Undead Units in Promethea's Control Zone get +2 inches to their Walk and Run speed until end of turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Styx:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Styx is Promethea's personal bodyguard. An undead hound developed by Black Sun labs, Styx is programmed to be unswervingly loyal to its master and is disguised to look like a normal living dog. Styx is a necromantic shadow tasked with destroying anything that could possibly be a menace to its owner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prowler/Undead - Neutral Black Sun - Level 25&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Influence: 1&lt;br/&gt;Uncontrollable: 1+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bound: Only Promethea can spend Guidance points on Styx.  While Promethea is in play, Styx ignores the Uncontrollable rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stealth: (Subterfuge, Effect) - Styx becomes Hidden. Upkeep: O&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hubris: (Subterfuge, Attack) - +5 Attack. This attack can only be used if Styx is Hidden. If Hubris causes damage the target suffers Seal Lv. 1 Effect 14&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invidia (Subterfuge, Counter) - +2 Defense / +2 Attack / +2 Damage. This counterattack can only be used if Styx has just Intercepted a charge that originally targeted Promethea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nemesis: (Subterfuge, Charge, Reactive) - +3 Attack. This charge can only be used if a ranged attack targeting Promethea has just been resolved. This Charge must target the character who made the aforementioned ranged attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Type-005:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Type-005 is the first real success of the Black Sun necromantic weapons program. An elite soldier of inhuman speed, strength, and resistance, a Type-005 is capable of creating animated blades and projectiles from its own bones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warrior/Undead - Neutral Black Sun - Level 20&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Influence: 1 Uncontrollable: 10+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innate Abilities: Damage Resistance&lt;br/&gt;Availability: Type-005 aren't unique, you can include 1 for each 100 levels in the group.&lt;br/&gt;Final Protocol: When the LP of a Type-005 reach 0, remove it from the game and put a counter the size of its base on its position. At the beginning of next turn's Action Phase, before any character's activation, all units within 2 inches of the counter receive an attack (Attack 5, Damage 5). Remove the counter after the attack resolves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bone Harpoon (Magic, Ranged Attack) - Distance (12 in.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chain of Bones (Magic, Effect) - A unit within 2 inches of Type-005 loses one Action Point. Effect 15.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pewter figures are unpainted and unassembled. Requires additional Anima Tactics figures to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
