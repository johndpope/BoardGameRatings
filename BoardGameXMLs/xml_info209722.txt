			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Endless Grudge of Relentless Corpse Sect&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Relentless Corpse Sect is a new Martial Sect for the Wandering Heroes of Ogre Gate roleplaying game. Relentless Corpse Queen rules her sect with an iron-fist, using an insidious venom to turn her admirers into slave-disciples. Aided by her sister and her sister's husband, she is bent on revenge against the people who murdered her father and stole his River Flowing Sword. Once a righteous and respected martial sect, they are now the most notorious and feared clan in all the martial world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF includes stats for members of the Relentless Corpse Sect, new poisons, Kung Fu Techniques and weapons. It is designed to be dropped into any campaign as needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
