			<description>It's a dark time for the galaxy. Sometimes, evil wins. Dark Avatar is the story of the Warlord of one of the clans that make up the Drengin Empire. The Drengin Empire dominates the galaxy. The Terran Alliance is on the brink of collapse, the Arcean homeworld is occupied by Drengin shock troops. But within the Drengin Empire there is conflict, the most powerful clan of the Drengin Empire is known as The Korath. The Drengin Empire merely wants to conquer and enslave the galaxy. The Korath, however, want all non-Drengin exterminated completely. Moreover, something dark is happening to the Korath. The families of the Korath are starting to look..different from other Drengin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your mission is to find out what is happening with the Korath and save the galaxy from utter extermination. Slavelings yes. Genocide no. What good is being the greatest power in the galaxy if there are no slaves to cower in terror?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galactic Civilizations II: Dark Avatar is the expansion pack for Stardock's award-winning hit strategy game, Galactic Civilizations II: Dread Lords. This expansion pack not only adds the usual content that expansion packs tend to do such as new opponents, new units and a new campaign. It also greatly expands the game play of Galactic Civilizations II. New features include asteroid belts on the map that can be mined for resources, unique planets that require special technologies to colonize, spies to conduct sabotage and destabilization (or used to protect your worlds from the same), new types of diplomatic treaties, an enhanced artificial intelligence engine, and much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
