							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Island of the Lost</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 48 x 30 inch, full color battlemap of an Island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;This island seems to have everything from Greco-Roman ruins to a crashed ship. We aren&amp;rsquo;t the first people to be stranded on this island in any case. But why have all these people been lost here?&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Stranded Survivor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Island of the Lost is an exterior map of an oval-shaped island. The west part of the map has a mountain with a ruined structure at the top and several stone stairs built into the cliff faces to ascend the mountain. The mountain surrounds a small waterfall and pool in the west center of the island. The plains in the center have some additional ruins. There is a crashed and submerged sailing ship in the southeast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Island of the Lost is intended for use in fantasy, pulp, and modern settings. The ruins make for an interesting location for relic hunters and archaeologists to investigate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lost at Sea: Vacationers are enjoying a calm summer day onboard a modern sailing yacht when suddenly a storm roils through the area. The storm throws the vessel off course and they crash into a mysterious island covered in mist and fog. As the fog lifts, they see a partially submerged sailing ship and ruined structures scattered throughout the island. Stone stairs ascend to the top of the western mountain and a smaller stone stairway ascends to the top of an eastern hill. In the center of the mountain, rivulets of water form small waterfalls cascading down the cliff faces and aggregating into a small pool of fresh water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is there shelter somewhere inside the mountain? Is it possible to cut down the trees and fix the old sailing ship to escape?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After giving the group a chance to investigate the island and become familiar with the terrain, the sun sets and it becomes dusk. They hear bizarre howling noises coming from the wooded areas of the island on top of the plateaus. The group finds themselves hunted by barbaric creatures with the heads of bulls but walk upright with primate-like hands that have emerged from their caves. The creatures hold primitive rusted swords of varying types like spatha, gladius, rapier, cutlass, etc. The monsters try to kill all the survivors. A twist might be that the creature&amp;rsquo;s bite turns them into like creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
