			<description>SEXPRESSIONS is a (very) adult game, absolutely dripping with sexual innuendo, to be played by 2 or 4 players with equal amounts of both sexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move their &amp;quot;nudes&amp;quot; (playing pieces) around the board according to dice rolls the aim being to collect a total of 35 points.  These points are earned through ownership of Company/Product squares (the least racy of which is called Rolsex Watches) which the other players have to pay to visit, and through complete circuits of the board.  Points are also won and lost through reward and penalty cards which are gender specific.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First to 35 is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
