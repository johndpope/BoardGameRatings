			<description>Breach 2 is a tactical role-playing game developed by Omnitrend Software in 1990 for the Amiga, Atari ST and DOS. It is the first sequel to the 1987 game Breach, and was itself followed by Breach 3 in 1995. The game is set in the universe of Omnitrend's Universe and Rules of Engagement series and is compatible with the both Rules of Engagement games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is a squad leader in the interstellar Federated Worlds Special Forces, whose goal is to utilize his squad of space marines effectively in winning different scenarios. If the squad leader is killed, the player loses the scenario and is bumped out of the mission back to the main menu. The player controls every action of each marine, including the squad leader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Breach 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenge the future!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1987, Omnitrend Software released Breach amidst rave reviews praising it as &amp;quot;...having much in common with cinematic science fiction such as Aliens&amp;quot; - Compute Magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was heralded as being &amp;quot;...a science fiction fan's dream.&amp;quot; - Computer Gaming World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was said that &amp;quot;With products like Breach, wargamers begin to see what the new, sophisticated machines can do.&amp;quot; - Computer Gaming World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, Mindcraft introduces the new, enhanced version of Omnitrend Software's next generation of advanced role-playing combat, Breach 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Captions for four photos:]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commanding Your Squad: All vital mission data at your disposal.
