			<description>It's time for the annual fishing derby and you and your buddies have decided to make it a little more interesting this year by making a wager. Whoever catches the most fish doesn't have to buy his own drinks for the next year and there is only one thing better than fishing and that's fishing with free drinks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fish Tales is a flip toss game where each player takes the role of an angler trying to be the first one to catch 10 pounds worth of fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT IS A FLIP TOSS GAME?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A flip toss game is a boardgame that uses a coin of some sort, instead of dice or cards, to determine different results during the course of the game. This is achieved by flipping a coin and trying to get it to land in a desired location on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
