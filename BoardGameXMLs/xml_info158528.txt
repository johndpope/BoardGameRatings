							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brotherhood of the Rail</name>
									
			<description>From the author's introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Brotherhood of the Rail is a setting for Fate Accelerated that allows players to tell tales of the hobo's mythical world during the Great Depression. The world of tramps and hobos was at once one of unprecedented freedom (with the widespread availability of automobiles, a transcontinental railroad, and the beginnings of an interstate highway system people could travel the country more easily than ever before) contrasted with some of the worst poverty that the nation had ever known. Daily life was frequently a challenge, and hobos were often distrusted, discriminated against, scapegoated, and denied legal protections. At the same time they were essential to keeping a lot of industries alive during the Depression, and provided the labor that build much of the nations Depression era infrastructure such as roads, bridges, dams, railroads, and electrical lines. They also dealt with a hidden world that most people could not or would not see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am greatly indebted to Aaron Houx for his 2002 publication of Knights of the Road, Knights of the Rail from which much of the inspiration and material for this setting is drawn. Since Mr. Houx was, in turn, greatly inspired by Mike Gentry I am indebted to him as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
