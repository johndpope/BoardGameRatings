							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Five Deadly Shadows</name>
									
			<description>From the first page of the adventure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shou town of Kudoku is in despair. Its magistrate once embodied a set of principles that guided the village, but he was murdered by assassins known as the Five Deadly Shadows. The principles have been corrupted and now protect the assassins. Can you recover the principles and best prevent the town&amp;rsquo;s destruction? A Living Forgotten Realms adapted adventure set in the Dragon Coast for Adventure Level 8 (recommended character levels 7 to 9 &amp;ndash; characters below this level may find it too difficult and characters above this level may find it lacks challenge). This adventure is found in Issue 195 of Dungeon online, part of D&amp;amp;D Insider.&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon issues may be found on the Wizards of the Coast website (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://wizards.com/dnd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://wizards.com/dnd&lt;/a&gt;). At least one person at the table (either a player or the DM) must have an active subscription to D&amp;amp;D Insider. We recommend that you allow at least 8 hours of playing time to complete this adventure (the equivalent of a two-round standard LFR adventure).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
