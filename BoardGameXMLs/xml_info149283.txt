							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ironburst</name>
									
			<description>Ironburst is a tactical combat board game using detailed metal miniatures and modular hex-based maps. It plays quick and has simple rules with good tactical scalability. Set-up is fast and so are battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to complete objectives: gathering resources, building, or eliminating specific enemy troops, etc. Players gather resources located on the board to build and repair units and to buy special Event Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The miniature line and the game were developed together, so the miniatures are designed to fit the game mechanisms and vice versa. More specifically, each miniature has multiple moving parts that can be removed (if they are destroyed) and rotated (to aim, to indicate that a weapon has already fired, etc.). Thus, these modular miniatures allow players to do bookkeeping and track game events directly on the battlefield instead of using paper. The moving parts are magnetic and can be swapped in and out to allow players to customize their forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To allow the moving parts to take the stress and friction of repeated movement, Ironburst miniatures are cast in a special zinc alloy called ZAMAK, which is not as soft as tin (and much lighter), nor as fragile as resin, while keeping a good amount of detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
