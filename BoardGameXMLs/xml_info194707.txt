			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grid Position: The Ultimate Grid Racer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A race game for 2-4 players that combines board and classic video arcade into one exciting game. Drivers dodge and bump as they compete for first position while the track thunders along beneath them. As well as opponents, keep a look out for the oncoming drone drivers and oil spills as you select high gear in your bid to win the Championship!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grid Position uses a unique gameplay mechanic where the cars advance along the track comprised of a 4x5 grid by moving the drone and crashed cars backwards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player moves their car one space either forward, back, left or right in turn order that is decided by a dice roll.  Each car has a corresponding coloured dice that are all rolled at once with the highest roll getting the first movement down to the lowest roll moving their car last. Cars also have a Low and a High gear with a forward move only allowed while in High gear and a back move lower your gear to Low.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each car has moved all drone cars and any oil spills are moved one space backwards to give the illusion of the race cars moving forward along the track. The Black Race die thrown with the coloured dice adds these drone cars and oil spills when it rolls a 1,2,3 or 4(must match with a coloured die) with a 5 or 6 completing a Lap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players win the race by being at the front of the pack when Lap 7 is completed with a tie being decided with a Photo Finnish roll off between the tied cars. Winners receive a Trophy card for the race with seven trophies available through a Championship season. Player with the most trophies after seven races is crowned the Champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
