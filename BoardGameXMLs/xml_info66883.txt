			<description>Early abstract wargame for two players or teams.&lt;br/&gt;The board shows land and sea in a 16 by 20 rectangular grid. There are a few features on the map: a harbour, a fort, a town, a capital, an island and three trenches.&lt;br/&gt;The forces are made up of 320 cardboard counters depicting land sea and air units. The units have different movement and fighting capabilities. They have also different point values.&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to capture the opponents capital. If the war is finished earlier by mutual agreement the winner is the one who has destroyed enemy units of a larger total value than the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
