			<description>Mah≈ç Sensei Negima!? Neo-Pactio Fight!! is a game for the Wii based upon the popular Japanese manga, Mahou Sensei Negima. It was released in Japan only on June 12, 2007. It's the third Negima game to be released on a Nintendo game console (After Mahou Sensei Negima! and its sequel on the GBA), and the first console Negima game not published by Konami.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arenas in the game are in full-time 3D, and the characters can move in any direction, as well as jump. Up to four players can play in Battle Mode. Controls are operated by using both the Wii Remote and Nunchuk (the Classic Controller and Wii Remote (used sideways) are also supported as control methods). Certain attacks and moves involving quickly moving the Wii Remote left and right or up and down. By getting a Pactio Card, one can activate a Pactio transformation like in Negima!?, randomly (though possible to control) becoming one of the three different forms: Armor (powerful version of your character, using a very powerful attack), Cosplay (character dresses up in costumes, and boosts the characters abilities), and Suka (or &amp;quot;Miss&amp;quot;, in which your character is transformed into a weak super-deformed animal, such as a Kappa in Kaede's case). The art style of the game (as well as many of its characters' moves) is based not on the original manga by Ken Akamatsu or the first anime. In between fights during the Story Mode, cut-scenes done in the style of Negima!? are shown, featuring voice acting from the voice actors of both anime adaptations. Ten characters from the Negima universe are playable as main characters. In addition, the other girls from the Negima series can be set as support (effectively a permanent power-up), similar to Marvel vs. Capcom, The King of Fighters '99, and The King of Fighters 2000. Up to two support characters can be equipped to each fighter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negima%21%3F%23Video_game Negima!?]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
