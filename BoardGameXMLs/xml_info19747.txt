			<description>Go on an adventure with Dora and collect the cards from the images on your backpackcard. The player who collects them first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a backpack card with four different items depicted.  Each player must collect and play those four cards plus a Dora card to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a backpack card and 4 random object-cards who are put in a row in front of you. Shuffle the remaining object-cards and put it in the middle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Youngest player starts. He takes an object-card from the middle. If it is a Dora card or an object-card with an object also on his backpack card, then the card goes &amp;quot;into&amp;quot; his backpack. If it is not the right card, the player can discard that card or swap it with one of the cards in his row. The swapped card (with the right object) can go &amp;quot;into&amp;quot; the backpack. This ends his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who has collected a Dora card and his 4 object cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
