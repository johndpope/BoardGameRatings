							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bits of Magicka: Rings and Jewels</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bling&amp;rsquo;s the thing! Magical gems and jewelry by the score; 100 pieces from trinkets to treasures, detailed and ready to drop into your game. The abundant imagination of author Greg Ragland has provided bewitching baubles: jewels for the ankles and arms, neck and navel. Shiny!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each item has a physical description (written for a GM to read aloud if desired), a brief history, and complete 3.5 Edition stats. In addition to the familiar magic rings and amulets, you will find earrings and nose rings, bracelets, masks and hairpins. They may be cursed, powerful, intelligent or the subject of an intensive search; their histories provide many possible plot hooks or story ideas. The pieces range from no value (did we mention cursed?) to 200,000 gold pieces, and include Encounter Levels (from 1 to 20) to make them easy to fit into any treasure hoard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Item cards are provided for all pieces, giving a summary of the physical description and stats. GMs can hand these cards to players, to retain for future reference. We have included a text-only version that can be used to cut and paste directly into your GM notes or sized into a large print version for those who prefer larger type. TTA has also provided our usual helpful index, making this product even easier to Buy Today and Play Tonight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
