			<description>Fate of a Nation:&lt;br/&gt;Arab-Israeli Wars, Six-Day War, 1967&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On 5 June, 1967, Israel surprised the Arab forces massing on its borders with a pre-emptive strike. By the end of the day a hundred thousand soldiers and several thousand tanks were locked in battle &amp;mdash; a struggle that would decide the fate of Israel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both sides had spent a decade preparing for this titanic struggle. Both sides acquired every modern tank they could, and upgraded those they retained from earlier wars. The opening battles saw more tanks in combat than the famous Battle of Prokhorovka between the Germans and Soviets near Kursk in 1943. The clash was swift and brutal. Within days a thousand wrecked tanks littered the battlefields and Israel was victorious.&lt;br/&gt;Fate Of A Nation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INSIDE YOU WILL FIND:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armoured forces for Israel, the United Arab Republic (Egypt), and Jordan in the Six-Day War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Israeli P&amp;rsquo;lugah Tan&amp;rsquo;kim (Tank Company) fields Sho&amp;rsquo;t,&lt;br/&gt;Centurion, Magach (M48), M51 Isherman, M50 Sherman, M1 Super Sherman medium tanks, and AMX light tanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UAR Kuteybh Debabh (Tank Battalion) fields the latest T-54 and T-55 tanks backed by older T-34/85 medium tanks, IS-3 heavy tanks, and SU-100M tank destroyers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jordanian Saraya Mudr&amp;rsquo;e (Armoured Squadron) fields Centurion and M48 tanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These forces are supported by mechanised infantry, artillery, and air power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion module presents army lists and additional rules for the Six Day War for use with the Flames of War miniatures wargame system. This is not a stand-alone game, use of the Flames of War core rulebook is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in Wargames Illustrated #312.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
