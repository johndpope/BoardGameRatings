							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spellfire: Booster Pack, Set 11 â€“ Nightstalkers</name>
									
			<description>September 1996 - This was a very unique set.  First and most odviously, every card in the set is a photo card, as opposed to just the usual chase set.  This set focused on two things.  Like the previous set, this booster focused on the old undead and made them fearsome again.  New unarmed combat cards for undead, and other boons to the previously alive are found through the set.  The other major theme is the two new card types: Thief champions and thief skills.  This made yet another card type to deal with (are rarely counter), but overall, it wasn't a huge effect yet.  Landmark Cards: Nelanther (#4); Falknovia (#5); Cromlin (#7); Assassin's Guild (#14); Cavern of Ancient Knowledge (#18); Complete Suprise (#25); The Guildmaster (#28); Jacqueline Renier (#32); Julio, Master Thief of Haslic (#34); El-Hadid (#40); Orcus (#44); Trumpet of Doom (#53); Herald of Mei Lung (#54); Use Poison (#63); Nemon hotep (#67); A Sure Thing (#74); Level Drain (#97); Bag of beans (c#11); Gib _________ (All designers, c#18-23); Den of Thieves (c#24); and Mad Scientist's Laboratory (c#25).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
