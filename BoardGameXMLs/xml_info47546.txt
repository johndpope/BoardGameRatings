							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Triamore: The Covenant at Lucien&#039;s Folly</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of this covenant I can tell you this: That it is located within the lands of the Holy Roman Empire, on the skirts of that temporal power, and that it enjoys some standing with Frederick II. That it makes its home in a great castle, and holds a manor of land as might a temporal lord or abbot, with a village of peasants under its hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash; Goliard of Tremere&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Triamore is an Ars Magica Fourth Edition sourcebook covering this unique covenant, its manorial holdings, and the surrounding region. It's more than a narrow treatment of these topics, though &amp;mdash; it's a treatise on the society, politics, and manorial life that surround every covenant, explaining how Triamore, Bois de Haillot, and Brabant are similar to &amp;mdash; or differ from &amp;mdash; every covenant, village, county, or duchy across Mythic Europe. More than that, Triamore presents a complete overview of a living, thriving covenant, ready for occupation as-is by a group of player characters, for use as a detailed NPC covenant, or merely as an example of what a well-developed covenant can be in an Ars Magica campaign, filled with ideas that may be scavenged for your own saga. For any storyguide or player seeking a focused look at day-to-day life in a covenant and in rural medieval society, Triamore is a complete and detailed study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
