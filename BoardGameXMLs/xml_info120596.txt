			<description>'Veils of Verdandi' is a fantasy board game in which players work together to complete a heroic quest.The game has been created with the aim of translating the excitement of interactive storytelling of role-playing games to board games, while simplifying existing game concepts as well as adding new ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players must rescue the nephew of the king, prince Ture, from the dangers and mysteries of the Dark Forest. To do this, the players move across the game board as an adventuring party and visit strange and magical places while battling vicious enemies. But the players must move quickly, for when day changes to night, the Dark Forest becomes much more deadly indeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Used in this game are 4, 6 and 8 sided dice for combat and movement across the board, as well as for specific interactive story challenges the game has to offer. Players may buy new equipment and magical items during the game, and train their special abilities to a higher level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is the first in a saga, the next installment of the game, Veils of Verdandi Book II, will carry the story beyond the Dark Forest and into a vast and deadly mountain range, and Slavic mythology. Players will be able to carry over any equipment and skills acquired in the first installment, and use them to defeat such dire foes as the Vampire, the Werewolf, and other dark and dreadful creatures born of mist and moonlight, that will challenge the might and magic of even the hardiest of adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
