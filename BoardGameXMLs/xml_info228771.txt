			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wolf Simulator is a simulation game featuring survival elements. First, you will have to select a wolf class. Currently there are two: warriors and scouts. The class you choose will affect different characteristics of your wolf, such as speed, endurance, attack power etc. In the course of the game, your wolf will be able to evolve and increase its abilities by participating in turf wars between wolf packs and hunting various wild animals. Participation in territory battles will earn your wolf leadership points, which can be used to found and expand your own wolf pack ruled entirely by you.Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
