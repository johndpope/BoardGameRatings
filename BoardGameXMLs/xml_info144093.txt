							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chung Ling Soo Murder Mystery</name>
									
			<description>Chung Ling Soo was a very talented stage magician who was shot and killed during last nights performance.  You play a police detective who will try to bring in more evidence than the other players.  The game board is made up of 12 hex tiles which make up a map of London.  You may move your pawns around a maze of streets, back alleys and even make use of the Underground train system. The three interior tiles have police stations, the nine outside tiles have evidence locations.  The object of this game is to score the most victory points.  Victory points are earned by moving your &amp;quot;police&amp;quot; pawn around the game board to various named evidence locations, acquiring the evidence and returning the evidence to one of three police stations.  When you attempt to find the piece of evidence you decide how valuable it will be, the more valuable the harder it is to find.  During your game turn you also move one of nine &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; guy pawns.  When moved adjacent to another players pawn you may pay the &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; guy to attempt to steal various items from the player (money, tools, or evidence).  The game ends when evidence from all differently named nine evidence tiles have been turned in by any combination of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
