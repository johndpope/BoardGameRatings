			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the beginning of time we, as a species, have been wary of that which lurks in the areas hidden from our sight. Deep caves, forbidden for generations, condemned manors, untouched by time, and endless labyrinths designed to keep evil inside are all elements that have become a staple of most fantastic games. So here at Aeternitatis we decided to give some options that let you develop characters that not only find themselves at home within these dark places, but that have survived or at least somehow been touched by their foul power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help us, all you have to do is to send us some feedback about this product. Let us know which elements you would like to see more of and which ones we should not touch again with a ten foot pole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF Includes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 Ranger Archetype. The Watcher, a restless forest guardian.&lt;br/&gt;1 Druid Archetype. The Haruspex, and his fearsome tainted transformation.&lt;br/&gt;1 Companion Archetype. The loyal Totemic guardian.&lt;br/&gt;Rules for taint and corruption.&lt;br/&gt;2 Feats&lt;br/&gt;1 Halfling race Archetype&lt;br/&gt;4 Character Traits&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
