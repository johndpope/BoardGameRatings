							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of City Life or the Boys of New York</name>
									
			<description>Very simple game in which players draw cards and play into or take from a community pool.  The real point of the cards is to show the various types of people living in NYC, which was then as it is now, the largest and grandest city in the Union.  Cards vary from the positive to the very negative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
