			<description>Fivesies is a short, puzzly dice game that came for free on the back of an Asmadi Games ad at GenCon 2011.  It will be available as a free print and play to everyone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 5x5 grid, and requires each player to have a set of 7 dice.  Any dice will do, of any shape and size, and having varied dice will change the gameplay slightly!  Each row and column on the board has an attribute, such as 'Even' or 'Lower than all adjacent dice'.  Dice are rolled off the board to create a supply at the start of the game, and then players take turns placing them in valid locations.  The goal is to complete rows or columns with 3 or more of your own dice in them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
