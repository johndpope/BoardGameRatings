			<description>Literature is played with a standard 52 card deck with the 8s removed.  It is played in teams of equal number of players.  The object is to collect 8 sets formed from the high (A-9) and low (2-7) of each suit.  You collect them by asking for them from the other team, constrained by the 2 rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) You may not ask for a card you have&lt;br/&gt;2) You may not ask for a card where you have no members of the set&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may not communicate to your own team.  One your team has collected the set, you must identify what players on your team have which cards in the set or the set goes to the other team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
