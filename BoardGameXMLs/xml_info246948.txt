			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tennis Match: A Talking Game! is a rather simple tennis type game that is unusual because it &amp;quot;speaks&amp;quot; the the action (quite unusual for 1978).  The game was intended to run on a &amp;quot;12K computer with MITS (Microsoft) 8080 BASIC)&amp;quot;, and requires the system to be equipped with an &amp;quot;Ai Cybernetic Systems Model 1000 Speech Synthesizer System for S-100 bus computers&amp;quot;.  The synthesizer card's output required external amplification.  As the card cost as much as a computer (at the time), and the S-100 bus system was not in universal use, the appeal of the program perhaps was limited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original &amp;quot;tennis&amp;quot; game program was written by V. Nahigan and Dave Ahl.  The speech synthesis portion was written by Steve North.  The game was published as type-in source code in Creative Computing Vol. 4, No. 3, May/June 1978.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
