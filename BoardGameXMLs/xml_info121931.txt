							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wealthy Literary Connoisseur Has Stepped Out Of The Room While You</name>
									
			<description>Jackson Tegu's entry into The Role-playing Poem Challenge. The characters in this game are authors, left alone in a room with their contemporaries and shelves housing all of their works. Each author venerates one other author and despises a second. In the fifteen minutes of game time, the players air and escalate their conflicts, perhaps using books as props that can be thrown around. It currently exists only as a post on a thread at Story Games linked on The Role-playing Poem Challenge's entry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
