							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Seraph</name>
									
			<description>Seraph is a skill based, acrobatic shooter&amp;hellip; without aiming! Featuring an angel, known as Seraph, who&amp;rsquo;s fighting to restore her lost power and ultimately escape a prison infested with demons. However, dark magic has trapped the angel inside her human Vessel: if the Vessel dies, so will Seraph.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Weapons are auto-aimed - It&amp;rsquo;s up to the player to concentrate on acrobatic evasion and positioning instead, unleashing havoc with Seraph&amp;rsquo;s dual wielded handguns, machine-guns, shotguns and a host of other weaponry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Incredible freedom of movement - Scale vertical walls, dash through enemy attacks and cartwheel over explosive spells - all with slick, responsive and simple controls. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Close range finishing moves - Demonic flesh can be shredded by gunfire and physical attacks, but larger foes are only fully destroyed by using a very short range angelic attack called Smite. Enemies can be blasted at range but Seraph must enter the fray to finish them off - the ultimate in risk/reward gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Designed for longevity - Levels and environments are procedurally generated and are filled with random pick-ups, weapons, enemies and bosses. A variety of special events sprinkled into the mix mean that each play session will be different!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Easy to play, hard to master - Incredibly accessible gameplay means you&amp;rsquo;ll be kicking Daemon ass in seconds, but the continually adjusting (and visible) difficulty rating ensures you&amp;rsquo;re always challenged, whether a new player or a seasoned Seraph veteran.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Deep character progression - Skill trees and a Daemonic crafting system offer a tonne of replay value, with players unlocking new weapons, abilities and spells with the materials they find on the corpses of their foes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
