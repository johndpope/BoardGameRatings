			<description>This is a 'dragon dogfighting' game.  Each player has a dragon card that lists a unique combination of attributes such as attacks, armor, hit points, and maneuvers.  It is played on a plain hex grid, with cardstock hex playing pieces that indicate facing direction.  Each turn, all players select a maneuver from a list of those allowed (which depends on the dragon's maneuver trait.)  Movement is resolved simultaneously, and then players have an opportunity for attacks (flame or claws.)  Additionally, there are spell cards which may be played for privileged moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(No playing time listed; I guessed.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
