							<name  sortindex="1">キングスプレート　カードゲーム　シリーズ３</name>
									
			<description>In Kings Plate, based on the traditional Japanese chess game Shogi, the player's goal is to checkmate the opponent's king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do this, you must use the various units in your army, with each unit having different abilities in terms of movement and special actions. Players can create their own armies from the cards included in the game, thus forcing them (and their opponents) to rethink their strategy each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kings Plate: Card Game - Series III includes a king for each player and a variety of army units, including the strongest monsters yet and advanced human units. These cards include suits and ranks as in a regular deck of cards, and they can be mixed with the other series in the Kings Plate family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
