							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pig Dice</name>
									
			<description>Game comes with 5 six sided dice in a small plastic tube (similar to what LCR comes in).  Each &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; face on each die is replaced with a picture of a pig.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a push your luck dice game similar to Pass the Pigs, where you roll the 5 dice as many times as you want until you want to stop. If 1 pig comes up in a roll it is worth negative 10 points. If 2 to 4 pigs come up, it is the end of the turn with zero points for this turn.  If all 5 dice are pigs, then all of the score for the game is lost and the turn is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
