			<description> SLIMES OF D (or: SLIMES ATTACK !! ) &lt;br/&gt;A 20 minutes, ONE player slime-defense card game&lt;br/&gt;No bookkeeping, NO DICE: just you, the cards and a token to defend !!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 1. INTRODUCTION &lt;br/&gt;This is the story of a small but crucial battle in the Great War of D. &lt;br/&gt;While waiting for the Heroes to find the Amulet of D'eugor, the Black Knight sends a special force to destroy the Stone of D. The Stone of D is hidden in a small cave in the depths of the northern mountain, protected by the Mage of D. To buy time, the Mage of D casts a mighty defensive spell to drive all dark forces from the area. For a while, the Black Knight's minions are held back, but then they find that one creature can penetrate the barrier: the lowly slimes! Now, as the slimes creep ever closer, the Mage of D must use the power of Fire, Earth, Water and Air to protect the Stone of D!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 2. THE MISSION &lt;br/&gt;As the Mage of D, with the power of Fire, Earth, Water and Air, you must hold your ground by repelling the Slimes until the King Slime arrives, and then defeat him to win the game !!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 3.
