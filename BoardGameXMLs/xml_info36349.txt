			<description>&amp;quot;Each player controls an A-10 Thunderbolt II (The Warthog) on Close Air Support Duty.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with a custom deck of cards shared by all players. The deck includes Mission Cards, Munitions Cards, Enemy Cards, and Event Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mission Cards are ground targets of various Mission Point values. A player who successfully attacks the target wins the Mission Card and adds the Mission Points to his score. Enemy Cards, representing a variety of Soviet air and ground threats, are played against opposing players. Munitions Cars represent bombs, missiles, or other payload items which aid in attack or defense. Event Cards offer a variety of bonuses and can be played at various times as specified on the particular card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also six named Pilot Cards that are not a part of the main deck. At the start of the game each player randomly selects one Pilot Card. Each pilot has a special advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fuel and ammo counters are used to track each plane's status. The aircraft are required to return to base to refuel and rearm. Damage can also force a plane to return to base where the damage is repaired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to have the most Mission Points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
