			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Halloween Fun for the 5th edition of the world's most popular roleplaying game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an adventure for brand new characters - level 1-5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes arrive in the town of Redryn's Rest to answer the call for adventure! A clan of goblins has been attacking the town's outlying settlements and the town mayor is offering a huge reward. The characters arrive too late: the quest has already been awarded to rival band of adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things escalate when the opposing adventurers&amp;rsquo;' foolish bravery unleashes an ancient, cruel fey menace on the peaceful lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Venture into the Witch's Fields, meet new monsters, colorful NPCs, and more all against the backdrop of a spooky Halloween-inspired adventure sure to give your players tricks and treats (but mostly tricks)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenging Challenges&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our adventures are special because they're really tough but also really fair. This offering is scaled for lower level characters but they'll squirm when they face the dark fey and their bloodthirsty witch queen. Tough adventures are the ones you'll remember and hopefully that mean's you'll remember us!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
