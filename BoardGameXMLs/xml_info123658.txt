							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heraclitus: The Meta Game</name>
									
			<description>The origins of this game came about due to discussions involved with games evolving over time and being robust enough to handle the change.  Other concepts were also added to shape it, such as handling draws and the use of the pie rule to handle uneven game conditions.  The game was built around these concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name of the game comes from the philosopher Heraclitus who said a person never jumps into the same river twice.  The game involves the changing of game conditions from round to round, and a testing of the player's skill to be able to evaluate and manipulate such game conditions to their advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The base game takes place on half a checkerboard, and each player has 12 pieces each.  In the basic game, if no rules changes are applied, players end up dropping a piece on the board from the reserve, sliding one of their pieces on the board, or swapping one of their pieces with an opponent's piece on the board.  Players capture enemy pieces by jumping.  In the normal game, players win the game by capturing at least 6 enemy pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Game #29 in the Games on Half a Checkerboard Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
