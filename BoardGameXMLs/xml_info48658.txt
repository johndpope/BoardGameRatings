			<description> &amp;quot;This is for your own good.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Peri didn't believe it. The two inquisitors, clad in starched black uniforms and flanked by armored protectors, seemed anything but helpful. She looked left and right, hoping for an escape route. It was no use, of course. They had cornered her on the observation deck of Perth's great Bast Tower. Her only way out was an eighty-meter drop to the main canal below. Not an appealing option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &amp;quot;You've made a mistake,&amp;quot; she said in order to gain time. &amp;quot;I'm a loyal citizen.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &amp;quot;Perhaps, but illegal weapons were found in your home.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &amp;quot;But we're trying to fight off the Republicans. How can we do that without-&amp;quot; The fast acting sedative dart silenced her almost immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &amp;quot;She is working with others,&amp;quot; the first Inquisitor said. &amp;quot;Do you think she will protect them?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &amp;quot;Maybe at first, but I am sure she will see the error of her ways. Eventually.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A utopia built on the principles of of rational science and the common good, the Humanist Alliance has stood almost unchanged for 350 cycles. The vision of its enlightened founder Yuri Gropius still guides it today. Dark shadows lurk within this bright land, however. Social harmony depends on all citizens doing their part and powerful state institutions maintain unity. Personal freedom is fleeting: seemingly innocent quirks can esaily be labelled deviant and result in reeducation. Hypnosis, drugs and other mind-control techniques routinely regulate the population. The situation is made far worse by the Alliance's domination by the Southern Republic. This insular society is ready to crack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Humanist Alliance Leaguebook gives Heavy Gear roleplayers and Gamemasters everything they need to set scenarios in this dark utopia. The sourcebook includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A complete history of the league&lt;br/&gt;    Details on resistance movements&lt;br/&gt;    Information on HIRA, the secretive Humanist espionage service&lt;br/&gt;    Full write-ups and maps on all seven Humanist city-states&lt;br/&gt;    Sample campaign set-ups&lt;br/&gt;    New equipment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
