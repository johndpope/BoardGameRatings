							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Terror on the Bozeman Trail: Red Cloud&#039;s War</name>
									
			<description>The Bozeman Trail is an epic from Red Cloud's War (1866-1868). As head of American forces, will you assure the security of the colonists, construct a fort, and escort working parties while defending yourself from Indian attack?  Will the impetuous Captain W.J. Fetterman break-through the blockade that is strangling your forces more and more each day?  Or perhaps you will take on the role of Red Cloud and his warriors: American Horse, Big Road, Brave Eagle, and Crazy Horse!  You will harass the Boys in Blue and drive them from the land, while being wary of the power of their weapons.  Ambush will be your best weapon, and you may be able to end it all with an assault on the fort itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes:&lt;br/&gt;17&amp;quot; x 22&amp;quot; map&lt;br/&gt;280 die-cut counters&lt;br/&gt;1 Turn = 3 Months, 1 counter = 1 leader, or 15-20 US soldiers/cavalrymen, or civilians, or 100 Sioux warriors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
