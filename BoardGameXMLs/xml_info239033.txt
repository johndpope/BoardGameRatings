			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement lists 100 different items that could be found in an Egyptian tomb. Many of the items are constructed from valuable materials, and many were believed to possess magical powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The items are suitable for a wide range of settings. They could be used to flesh out fantasy adventures in an Egyptian-themed location, such as the Desert of Desolation or Paizo's Mummy's Mask Adventure Path. They could be used for tomb robbing, or modern or horror adventures that may be set in a tomb, or the items could already have been recovered and be in the possession of museums or collectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imiut Fetish (Stuffed, headless animal skin, often a bull or a feline, tied by the tail to a pole which terminates in a lotus bud and is inserted into a stand)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page of the supplement is the cover, one page the front matter and introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
