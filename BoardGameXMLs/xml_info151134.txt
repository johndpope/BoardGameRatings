			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago the vampire lords ruled over the continent of Vathak with fear and bloodshed. The great castles of these tyrants stood as massive tombs, silhouetted against the night, grim reminders to all of Vathak&amp;rsquo;s races of their extensive power and iron rule. It was with the return of the Old Ones which usurped this rule, and drove these beings to the point of near extinction. As their numbers declined, many of these being made the choice to flee Vathak and it&amp;rsquo;s cursed lands. The vampire which remained faced a difficult battle, and to combat their dwindling race, these creatures began to breed with their humans slaves. A product of these unnatural unions, their children, the dhampir, would fill the ranks as their soldiers. Or so they thought...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Talents: Dhampir Feats brings you over 35 dhampir feats for use in Shadows over Vathak or other Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
