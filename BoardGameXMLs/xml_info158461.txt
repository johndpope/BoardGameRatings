							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sacrificial Pool</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 48 x 30 inch, full color floorplan of a Sacrificial Pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Drown them or else the Water God will take us all in the tsunami of his rage!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sacrificial Pool is a single map of a temple built into a hill or mountainside overlooking a beach. The edges of the map have a view of the exterior beach and hill/mountain. The center of the map has a view of the interior of the temple, as it is open topped from above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sacrificial Pool is intended for use in fantasy or horror games. It could be used in a modern game as an archaeologist find of an ancient structure as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sacrifice to the False God: Since ancient times, the people of the island have used the sacrificial pool to appease the Water God ever since a terrible tsunami and a flood nearly wiped them out. The Water God was angry so he sent his waves. He demanded blood, the water of man as tribute or he would spread even more death upon the people of the islands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What they could not possibly know is the Water God was slain by another god who wanted the blood being sacrificed to the Water God. This Blood God had been gathering the yearly blood sacrifices and preparing for his physical entrance into the world. Now is the year of his arrival. When the sacrifice is made this time, the Blood God will form itself from blood using the images of the Water God to maintain its charade (You can see the image of this god on the bottom of the pool and its face on the statues). The Blood God vows it will feed all the time, rather than just once a year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player Characters can get involved by trying to stop the gruesome sacrifice (people are immersed and drowned in the pool alive), or by witnessing the murder of one of the people in town by the Blood God, who literally drains the blood of the victim through its tentacles, leaving a desiccated husk behind. Its up to the group to decide to confront this Blood God about the string of murders or run out of town and leave the people who worship the Blood God to their fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
