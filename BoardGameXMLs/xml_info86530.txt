			<description>After 3000 years of restless retirement, batty old elf Willy McWindup is suddenly called in to perform Head Elf duties amidst a wild case of snowball fever sending all of Santa's remaining Head Elves to bed rest.  With mere days before Christmas Eve and piles of presents yet to construct, you must reign in old Willy's outrageous ideas and convince him to green light and produce your concepts to help save christmas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Santa's Workshop Disaster is a quick family holiday themed card game for 2-6 Players, the more the merrier!  It plays similar to Apples to Apples, using funny and disgusting combinations of IDEA and CONCEPT Cards, which together represent a finished present yet to be constructed. Taking turns playing the Head Elf, you draw an IDEA card and (reading aloud) present it on the table.  Helper Elves (the remaining players) then choose a CONCEPT card that they feel best matches the IDEA card.  Receiving the cards face down, the Head Elf then shuffles and (reading aloud) presents the CONCEPTS on the table.  Using ANY criteria, the Head Elf then chooses which Combination of IDEA and CONCEPT to green light and send to production - thus scoring one point towards the win for the player whose CONCEPT was chosen.  Roles then rotate around the table until there is a winner with the most CONCEPTS chosen (rules vary based on number of players).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Santa's Workshop Disaster is a Free Print and Play designed by Monster Make.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;108 Cards, all files provided in High Resolution, including Rules and Tuck Box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently files can be found HERE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a large file (240MB) consisting of 14 pages of 8.5x11 (Letter) Cards with 9 cards to a page.  It also contains 1 page of 8.5x11 PocketMod layout Rules, and 2 pages of 8.5x14 (Legal) Tuckbox layouts. &lt;br/&gt; The files will eventually be loaded into the Database, but for now can be found at the above link!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included is alternate rules for 2 players with the addition of A,B,C cards and a version for young (3+ years) players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks, hope you enjoy!!&lt;br/&gt;Stephen - Monster Make&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
