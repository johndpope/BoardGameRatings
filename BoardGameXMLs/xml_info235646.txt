			<description>The game is for 2 players or 2 teams of players. Movement is determined by 3 dice with the numbers 1 to 5. On 2 dice, the 6th side is blank (stud). On the 3rd die, the 6th side is red (called gas station attendant). Each player or team has 5 motorcycles and 5 numbered race tracks. If it's track number is rolled the motorcycle advances 1 space. If the player rolls red, he may move any motorcycle 4 spaces; if all 3 dice show the same number, the motorcycle on the track of this number is moved 4 spaces. The gas stations count for 4 spaces. Each motorcycle arriving at the finish line gets a set number of points, depending on the order of arrival. The player or team with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
