			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world's first Roguelike mecha role playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set on a ruined earth after a massive war that culminated in various superweapons being deployed disasterously while in space orvital colonies vie for supremacy. GearHead plays more like certain older tactical mecha games than it does a true Roguelike. Players can battle on foot, or more often in various vehicles and mecha. Gearhead comes in two modes. A standard ASCII Roguelike format, and a graphical sprite driven version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play a character from one of 5 different pasts ranging from refugee from the lunar colony war, to orphan, to anmesiac, to deserter from the army that attacked the lunar colony. There is a wide range of professions availible ranging from standard pilots to firefighters, to entertainers and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once play begins the game selects several plot threads that the player may encounter along the way. It is very possible that no two games will play out quite the same depending on chance and choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can access a wide array of weapons and parts that can be purchased or more often salvaged from enemy vehicles and then attached to the players craft in many diffrent configurations. Personal equipment shares some of these features to allow the player to customize and upgrade weapons or even themselves with enhancements and cybernetics. This extends to NPCs the player may pick up along the way. Though how you act can have great impact on wether NPCs will stay on, or leave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
