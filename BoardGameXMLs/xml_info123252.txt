			<description>From the RPG description here on RPGGeek:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced Quick20 isn&amp;rsquo;t really all that advanced. The game is designed for experienced GMs who want an easy to play system where you can generate characters quickly, explain the rules in a few minutes and get down to gaming. It&amp;rsquo;s also a high trust system. That means it assumes that the players are there to help each other have fun and are willing to compromise for the sake of running a good session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules provide a rough level of balance, but I&amp;rsquo;ve left quite a bit for the group to determine. How far can you stretch a role? What exactly can you apply advances to? What are the limits of the magic system? I have my answers for each question &amp;mdash; but they aren&amp;rsquo;t always going to be the same as yours. Use this book as a starting point. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about the rough edges too much. As you play, you&amp;rsquo;ll find solutions that are comfortable for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
