							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vanguard Station</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Vigilance-class listening post was designed as a deep-space station that could serve a variety of functions. The small, PL-7 outpost is just over 160 feet tall and houses a permanent crew of 10. There are also barracks and facilities provided for 16 additional personnel or guests&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever hesitated to have space-faring characters arrested because you don't have a detention center ready to receive them? Well, worry no longer! Vanguard Station VII is one of twelve such outposts used as a base of operation by ConFed Security - the law enforcement officers of the space lanes. Not only does the station have a pair of armed patrol craft, but it also has a dedicated detention center and full compliment of trained personnel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The station lounge and administrative offices are open to the public. The food is only re-hydrated government fare, but the drinks are good and the patrons understandably well behaved. By re-using the barracks map page in place of the detention center, the same station can represent a civilian establishment (like a truck stop in space)or even a military garrison or supply depot. Whether the characters are just visiting (voluntarily or not), or looking for a place to call their own, this little station can fit the bill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     21 page PDF file detailing the station, interior locations, and personnel.&lt;br/&gt;     Open Game License stats provided for the vessel and crew, as well as the shuttles and escape pods.&lt;br/&gt;     Map Book&lt;br/&gt;         Full-color 26 page PDF file containing complete interior maps.&lt;br/&gt;         Includes miniature-scale maps for tactical combat.&lt;br/&gt;         A 22x22 inch, 150 dpi, color JPEG image of the top deck.&lt;br/&gt;         A 22x28 inch, 150 dpi, color JPEG image of the main deck.&lt;br/&gt;         A 14x10 inch, 150 dpi, color JPEG image of the engineering deck.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
