							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ya-Lo, The Football Card Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;A Thrill on Every Play. New Thrills in Every Game. Easy to Play. Realistic Football for Real Fans.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This vintage football card game was originally released in the mid-twenties. A 1940 edition, marked on the box cover as the &amp;quot;New Collegiate Edition&amp;quot;, was used to prepare the following description. The limited information located regarding the twenties edition indicates that it may have been self-published, but otherwise it is believed to be similar to the later edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1940 New Collegiate Edition consists of a box, a 16 3/4 x 9 3/4 inch football-field board (a box bottom insert), 55 Offensive cards, 55 Defensive cards, individual card boxes for these two sets of cards, 29 Time-Out cards, a metal football marker, a cardboard &amp;quot;10-Yard Marker&amp;quot; and the rules.  Note that there are are tracks on the board for keeping track of the four quarters and four downs, so there may have been additional markers to place on these tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board depicts a 100-yard football field, marked in one yard increments. The 10-Yard marker is used to determine when enough yardage has been gained for a first down. The metal ball is used to mark the field position of the ball. Movement of the ball up and down the field is determined by the Offensive and Defensive cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1925 set does not contain Time-Out cards, or mention of time-outs in the rules.  The separate board does not have any tracks for quarters or downs.  In addition to the Rules, it includes four pages of &amp;quot;Help for the Novice&amp;quot;, a summary of the current NCAA football rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
