							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Call of the Wild (Original)</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humanity gave up the ways of civilization and embraced an animalistic, primitive way of life known as the Call of the Wild. The Call is a force of nature working through the greater spirits of animals. As humanity embraced the call, they physically changed to a greater resemblance of an animal, and through these changes, they became the tribes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tribes act as separate races, and though one can produce children between tribes, the child is not guaranteed to follow either parent. A child is always handed over, at the earliest convenience, to the care of the tribe to whom the child was embraced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
