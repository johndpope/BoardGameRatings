			<description>Story telling game for children. With the help of 55 playing cards a story is created. The cards are all nicely illustrated and textless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player gets six cards. With at least three cards he tells a story. If the story makes no sense he gets his cards back. If the story is fine he gets 2 points for a 3 card story, 3 points for a 4 card story, etc. After that the next player gets a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player cannot make story he draws three more cards, if that does not help he loses his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Already existing stories may be used in the telling of a new story. When there are no more cards and a player uses his last card the game ends. Who has the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For small children or beginners it is advised to start with less cards in the stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
