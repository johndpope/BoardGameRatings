			<description>A simple dice game designed by Jonathan Tweet (On the Edge, Hecatomb, Dreamblade), that was made freely available on the Wizards of the Coast website in the late 1990s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website in 1998:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Design by Jonathan Tweet. If you really like it, you can send a toy dinosaur to the designer c/o Wizards of the Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control two out of the three battle zones to win the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three battle zones: land, air, and sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has two boxes per battle zone. Players take turns rolling a die and writing the number rolled in any open box--including an opponent's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two numbers in a player's battle zone are multiplied together to determine that player's strength in that battle zone. The player with the highest strength in a battle zone controls it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all twelve boxes are filled, the player who controls two out of three battle zones is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with a blank Land, Air, &amp;amp; Sea score sheet, a pen, and a twelve-sided die. (If you don't have a twelve-sided die, any die will do.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turn, each player rolls a die and writes the number rolled in any open box on either player's side. (Hint: Put high numbers in your boxes and low numbers in your opponent's boxes.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When both boxes in a player's battle zone have numbers in them, multiply the numbers together and write the result on the &amp;quot;Strength&amp;quot; blank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When both players have a result for Strength in a battle zone, circle the higher number. (Cross out both numbers if there's a tie.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all twelve boxes are filled in and all six Strength numbers written down, the player who has higher Strength numbers in at least two battle zones wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If each player controls one battle zone and the third is a tie, then the game is a tie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
