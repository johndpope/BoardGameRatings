							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Grendelssaga</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Grendelssaga is a mini-campaign set on the rogue world of Grendel, in the Queen Alice&amp;rsquo;s Star system. Grendel is largely unexplored, an uninhabitable world in the next orbit out from the human colony world of Beowulf. This book introduces the world of Grendel and its conditions, and is a sourcebook for the small outpost run by the University of Alicia, studying the violent weather and emergent life forms. The players must make their way from Beowulf to Grendel, across a system under dire threat from Kaefer marauders and human raiders. Once on Grendel, the players must survive the next storm until they can get themselves and the students away from the world. They will go on to further explore the world, making contact with a Pentapod enclave, a crashed human warship from a distant war, and the secret at the heart of Grendel, along with its 100,000 year history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;This is a soft cover print compilation of 3 adventures previously released as separate PDF's&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rescue Run&lt;br/&gt;Salvage Rights&lt;br/&gt;Black As Pitch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
