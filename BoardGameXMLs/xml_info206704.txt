							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Desert Princes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Come, traveller and listen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The desert is a harsh mistress and you've much to learn if you will survive. Take water with me and I'll see if you are worthy of my attention.&amp;quot; guide, name unknown, in the Aradi desert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The desert is always trying to kill you, whether from heat or sandstorm or lack of water or monsters never heard of before. There's beauty here and a vibrant culture that ebbs and flows like the sand, yet has a deep abiding strength. Everyone knows they're needed and has a task that is vital to the survival of their village, town or city. These are the people who created the Great Race as a test of courage and ability. The worthy are invited and the race is scheduled according to a formula no-one outside the Youlin Aradi peoples and outsiders should consider an invite a great honor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this guidebook, you'll find all you need to create a character or NPC from the desert region. There's some new magic, edges and other goodies to round out your character. You'll meet the Nine and see how they rule the land, sometimes cooperating and others in conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
