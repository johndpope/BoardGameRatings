			<description>&amp;quot;Pok&amp;eacute;mon Rumble Blast, known in Europe as Super Pok&amp;eacute;mon Rumble and known in Japan as Super Pok&amp;eacute;mon Scramble (スーパーポケモンスクランブル Supa Pok&amp;eacute;mon Sukuranburu), is a Pok&amp;eacute;mon video game for the Nintendo 3DS. It was the first Pok&amp;eacute;mon game released for Nintendo 3DS. The game was released in Japan on August 11, 2011,[1] in North America on October 24, 2011 and in Europe on December 2, 2011. It is a successor to the 2009 WiiWare release Pok&amp;eacute;mon Rumble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was re-released as a Nintendo eShop digital download for the PAL region on November 29, 2012 and in North America on December 20, 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pok&amp;eacute;mon Rumble Blast features similar gameplay to its predecessor Pok&amp;eacute;mon Rumble, in which the player's Pok&amp;eacute;mon explores various areas while battling enemy Pok&amp;eacute;mon. A boss Pok&amp;eacute;mon awaits at the end of each dungeon and the difficulty of each boss increases as the player progresses throughout the game. In this game there are towns in the area and each town has machines where you can buy new moves, release Pok&amp;eacute;mon when you have too many, and a fountain filled with Glowdrops that heal your Pok&amp;eacute;mon. In the game, Glowdrops are disappearing and you have to find out who took them and catch them. This game includes Toy Pok&amp;eacute;mon from all five generations.&lt;br/&gt;A Pikachu switching with a Oshawott. When switching the player is delayed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pok&amp;eacute;mon Rumble Blast also comes with the option to play against others wirelessly using StreetPass tagging. This allows the player to see other player's Pok&amp;eacute;mon and Miis.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pokémon Rumble Blast&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
