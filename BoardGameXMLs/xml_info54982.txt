			<description>The game contains a very long snake (more than two meters?) which has to be assembled from tiles during the course of the game. Game starts at the tail, then proceeds in a Dominoes fashion (colors have to be matched). But the segments of the snake are not straight, instead the snake coils (overlapping is allowed). When no player can place another tile, the head of the snake is added. The player it points at is the loser and receives one point. The player with least points after a certain number of plays, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
