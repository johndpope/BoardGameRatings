							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ultimate Word Game</name>
									
			<description>Players start at the beginning of the game board, and advance by correctly answering multiple choice word meaning questions found on the game's word cards. The word cards are based on dictionary meanings, world facts, and well known legends. Extra advances are made by correctly spelling the word, and stating the number of vowels in it. If the word's meaning, spelling, and vowels are all correctly answered, the player gets a bonus card. Bonus cards are multiple choice as well, and are based on synonyms or antonyms. If the bonus card is answered correctly, the player rolls the die, and may advance or retreat on the board depending on the roll. The winning player is the first one to get to the end of the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
