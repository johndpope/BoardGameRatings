			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This group of agents and assassins has a goal diametrically opposed to that of the Black Lantern Society. No one knows who the elusive Merchant is, much less what his ultimate goals are. The only thing that is known was provided by the Brother who wrote this report - an assassin and troubleshooter within one of the cells of the organization called &amp;quot;Caravans&amp;quot;. By creating the Cipher, agents can send information anywhere with no one realizing anything amiss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What could Red Store want, other than power? How can they influence the Southern Kingdoms? Is there a way to get more agents into the Store? This book answers some of these questions and poses others. Ultimately, you will write this story by taking inspiration from the Guidebooks and adding your ideas, creating a new story to experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
