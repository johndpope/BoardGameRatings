							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quarterback Option</name>
									
			<description>The ideal compact football game for the All-American armchair quarterback. An ideal game for families and parties. Can be played by 2 or 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has been especially designed to give &amp;quot;Armchair Quarterbacks&amp;quot;the opportunity to try their own football strategy. It is not a game of chance but creates realistic game situations in which the play outcomes depend on which player outwits his opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fold-out magnetic play board includes easy-to-read and easy-to-use scoreboards, time and play clock, indicators for &amp;quot;yards to go&amp;quot;, times out, wind factors, downs and quarter, and a scale model for the actual length of a football field with each yard line marked for recording of exact yardage. magnetic markers are used as the &amp;quot;first down marker&amp;quot; by placing it 10 yards in front of the ball when there's a first down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spinner-play selector cards are used to select play calls and punts, field goal attempts, extra points, fumble recoveries, penalties, length of kickoff returns, onside kicks and wind conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 42 cards used for running plays including penalties, fumbles and injuries. There are 42 pass play cards including interceptions, fumbles and penalties. The pass completion rate is nearly 50%, with an average completion gain of over 11 yards and includes possibility for touchdowns. There are over 300 different outcomes possible from the use of these 84 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nearly total realism can be simulated by advanced players. but the game is enjoyable by players of all levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
