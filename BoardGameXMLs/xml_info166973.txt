							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Glassworks</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep into old age, Brighton Shaterhamer is trying to connect with his grandson, the glass artist Rosalni, only to find him missing. Also disappeared is Brighton&amp;rsquo;s collection of Rosalni&amp;rsquo;s work. There&amp;rsquo;s magic here nobody quite understands. Take Ghost Whisper, the glass longsword. What enchantments it holds, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to discover, but the aura of the specter within it could conquer half your battles. And there will be combat. You may have to travel into battle through the glass triptych depicting the War of Corruption. There will also likely be an army of glass golem to face down - glorious looking things with molten hearts beating in translucent chests. But, no false moves! In motion, golem shatter, becoming moving figures of shards that will slice and dice you. Just a suggestion? Snoop around the forbidding glassworks first. Ask the shop girl. If you dare, ask for Galthric.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.Great for use with Legends of Anglerre, Strands of Fate, Dungeon World, Risus: The Anything RPG, FUDGE, Harnworld, and easily adaptable to Dungeons, and Dragons, Dungeon Crawl Classics, Pathfinder, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, The One Ring, HERO, GURPS, BRP, Barebones Fantasy and many others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
