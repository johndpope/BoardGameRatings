			<description>Ristorante is a game for 2-4 players where each player is a chef in the kitchen of a great restaurant. Each turn they will serve the customers that arrive in the restaurant, perfect their technique or prepare gourmet menus for the important culinary competitions. However, all of this requires dedication and effort and in order to try and out-cook the other chefs they will have to go to the limit of their physical and mental capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, the player with the better record will become the acclaimed chef of the Ristorante.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played throughout 5 turns. In each turn players will take actions (prepare the orders or prepare gourmet menus) until all players have passed and a new turn begins. In the even turns, there will be a culinary competition where players will present their best work in order to get points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
