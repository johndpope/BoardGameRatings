			<description>Intructions for use:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Booster Deck is very easy to use and enhances any GODSEND Agenda game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     All players are dealt 3 cards for the scene. A scene is described as ONE entire combat (not combat round) or&lt;br/&gt;     New cards are dealt at the beginning of every scene to replenish a player's hand back up to three.&lt;br/&gt;     Cards can be discarded for new cards at the beginning of the scene.&lt;br/&gt;     At the beginning of the scene players may confer and trade cards among one another but after this is done no further trading between players is allowed.&lt;br/&gt;     The game master is dealt 2 cards for every player. His cards are not attached to any one NPC and may be freely used among all NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;     One card per player may be played per round at any time on any appropriate situation. The game master may play one card per NPC per round as well.&lt;br/&gt;     Once a card is used it goes into the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a scene is over all discarded cards are shuffled into the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All player actions while using the cards must be described in cinematic detail or the benefit of the card is forfeit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
