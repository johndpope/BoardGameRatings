			<description>Perception of time is a difficult skill that takes many months to fully develop in children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     What is a half-hour?&lt;br/&gt;     Is five minutes a lot?&lt;br/&gt;     Why is the hour split into 60 minutes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of these questions require understanding and the habit of correlating clock-hand movements with flow of day and night. The new game from The Brainy Band will help children to determine the time on the clock-face, to figure out the relation between &amp;ldquo;hours&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;minutes,&amp;rdquo; and to learn the notions of time and duration of activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By performing different fun tasks, the players will move around the game board designed in the form of a clock-face. The players&amp;rsquo; objective is to do as much as possible in the course of the game, while preventing others from completing their activities and moving forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
