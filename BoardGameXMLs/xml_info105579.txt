			<description>Space Shuttle Project is a Nintendo game released in 1991 by Absolute Entertainment. The object of the game is to successfully launch and fly a space shuttle. The first part of the game is often very difficult, requiring the player to activate oxygen and hydrogen pumps as well as get all of his crew members into the shuttle within a strict time limit by moving an elevator up and down and avoiding bumpers. Then, the player must successfully launch the shuttle into space, maneuver it through space, and complete a mission; the final step is to land the shuttle successfully. The game has a name and password system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Space Shuttle Project&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
