			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comic Book Super-Heroes Second Edition is here, and it's ready to rock your gaming table! This incredible RPG gives you everything you need to create your super-hero and save the world (or destroy it)! Written by Wes Yahola (creater of the 1st edition), with artwork by LPJ and Brad and Jessica McDevitt, this 90-page masterpiece will step you through everything you need to live and breath the life of a superhero. Want to create a bald hero with telepathic powers? No problem. How about a rich playboy by day and brooding anti-hero by night? You can do that! You can create any kind of hero (or villain) that you want! Heck, we'll even make a hero for you with adamantium claws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
