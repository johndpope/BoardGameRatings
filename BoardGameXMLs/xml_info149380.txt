			<description>C.W. Faulkner published numerous sectional card based board games around the turn of the century.  Zooloo has uniquely shaped cards that form an animal themed globe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play starts by shuffling the smaller card deck and taking turns playing cards around the circular disc.  All players start with a set number of counters.  Players try to play the best card they have in hand, then take a card at random from the hand of the next player.  When the smaller deck is played out the dealer shuffles and deals the larger card deck.  Areas on the circular disc carry penalties or bonuses like paying a counter into the pot or taking one out.  The game ends with the circle is complere and the player with the most counters left is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
