			<description>&amp;quot;Eye of the Beholder III: Assault on Myth Drannor was not developed by Westwood Studios, the developer of Eye of the Beholder  and The Legend of Darkmoon, but by a different company. Despite employing a brand new game engine, updated graphics, interesting and oft-unique NPC selection and good gameplay tweaks, many felt that the storyline of Eye of the Beholder III: Assault of Myth Drannor was weak and that the game had lost the 'feel' of the previous editions, especially when compared to the second game in the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Storyline: After defeating Dran the heroes tell the patrons of a local tavern about their success over Dran Draggore and how it saved the town. After that, a mysterious man enters the tavern and asks the heroes to save the ruined city, Myth Drannor, which is ruled by a Lich named Acwellan. The man then tells the heroes that they need to save Myth Drannor by getting an ancient artifact from the Lich known as the Codex. After the heroes foolishly accept the quest, the mysterious man teleports the heroes just outside of Myth Drannor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay features the forest around the city, the mausoluem, and finally the city ruins including the mages guild, and a temple that was named after Lathander, a sign of good to the ruined city.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Eye_of_the_Beholder_(video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
