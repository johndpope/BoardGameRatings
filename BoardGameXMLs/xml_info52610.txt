							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Burning Plague</name>
									
			<description>From publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 4-6 1st Level Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sickness has come unto the simple mining community of Duvik's Pass, poisoning their wells and blighting their crops. With the pestilence leaving the strongest men of the town's guard a few short days away from death, the burden of descending into the mines and purging the wellspring of whatever evil has settled there falls to an intrepid band of adventurers. Can these noble heroes prevail within the depths of Duvik's Pass, or will they too fall victim to the perils of The Burning Plague?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Burning Plague is a Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons adventure designed for a party of four to six characters of 1st level. Dungeon Masters (DMs) should feel free to adjust the adventure as necessary to accommodate groups not falling within this range. However, given the fairly low power level of the inhabitants of the mines at Duvik's Pass, it should be noted that parties consisting of 20 or more total levels are unlikely to find satisfactory challenge within The Burning Plague.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
