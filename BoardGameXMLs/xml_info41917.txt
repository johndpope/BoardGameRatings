							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aces in the Pot</name>
									
			<description>This is a simple game for two or more players, played with two dice and two counters (e.g. coins) per player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll one die to see who goes first.  Then players take turns (clockwise) rolling two dice.  If either die displays a 1 (an &amp;quot;ace&amp;quot;), a counter is put in the pot (that is, in put in the middle of the table).  If two 1s are thrown, two counters are put in.  If either die displays a 6, both dice and one counter are passed to the player on the thrower's left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player without counters cannot roll the dice, and thus merely passes them on.  (He or she is not out of the game, however, since  he or she will receive a counter if the player on the right rolls a 6.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until there is only 1 counter left outside the pot.  The player with this counter makes three consecutive rolls.  If he or she does NOT roll a 6, then he or she has won.  If, though, a 6 is rolled, the counter and the dice are passed to the player on the left, who in turns rolls three times.  And so on. The first player to roll three times without a 6 wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite being entirely luck-based, the game is fun on account of its dramatic twists and turns and come-from-behind wins.  The luck is an equalizing element that makes this game especially suitable to play with children&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: R. C.
