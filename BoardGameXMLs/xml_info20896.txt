			<description>DON'T TILT MILTON WHILE HE'S SNOOZIN' ...&lt;br/&gt;... I'LL BE WINNIN', YOU&amp;quot;LL BE LOSIN'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;so goes the rant on the box of this typical late sixties plastic offering from Ideal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to place as many objects on Milton as possible without causing him to topple out of his hammock.  Objects come in pairs - 10 large objects (e.g. bird nest, hat) and 10 smaller 'accessory' objects which pair off with the relevant larger object (eggs, feather etc).  The first player places one large object on Milton &amp;amp; their turn ends.  The next person to play places the relevant accessory object and then also another large object on Milton &amp;amp; their turn ends.  Play continues in this manner until Milton topples out of his hammock; the player who causes this event to occur is eliminated from the game.   All objects are removed from Milton, who is replaced in his hammock &amp;amp; play commences again until only one player, the winner, remains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
