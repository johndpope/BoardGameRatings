			<description>Octodad is a third person adventure game about destruction, deception, and fatherhood. The player controls Octodad, a dapper octopus masquerading as a human, as he goes about a day of his life. His existence is a constant struggle, as he must master mundane tasks with his unwieldy boneless tentacles while simultaneously keeping his cephalopodan nature a secret from his human family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls Octodad like a marionette, dragging his arms and legs around while his body flops along. The player&amp;rsquo;s goals are often simple household chores made difficult and interesting by the flailing, tenuous control they have over Octodad&amp;rsquo;s body. Being an octopus also has its strengths. Octodad can slip through tight spaces, grab objects with his suckers, and knock things around with tremendous strength. But if the player does things too out-of-the-ordinary, Octodad&amp;rsquo;s family will grow suspicious and realize what he really is. If they do, it&amp;rsquo;s game over for Octodad!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
