			<description>A solo card game using the standard 52 card deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remove the aces from the deck and place them face up in a row on the table.  Deal nine cards in a row to the right of them, and the rest of the deck in three rows of 13 cards below them.  When the four kings become available, place them above their aces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aces are built on upwards and the kings downwards in suit sequence.  It does not matter where the two sequences meet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only the bottom card of a column is available for play.  It may be built either on its ace or king foundation, packed on the bottom card of another column, or itself be packed on.Packing may be upwards or downwards in suit sequence, and the player may change this at his convenience.  A space left vacant in the layout by removal of a card is not filled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
