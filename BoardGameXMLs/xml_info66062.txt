							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Angel</name>
									
			<description>Based on a tv series with the same name. The board represents different locations (the docks, police station, the apartment of Cordelia, a cemetery, ...) in Los Angeles. One player plays with the character Wolfram &amp;amp; Hart (the advocates of the devil). The other players play with Angel and his acolytes (Cordelia, Gunn &amp;amp; Wesley).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principle of the game is to win points by fulfilling mission cards, these points are needed for the destiny track. The ultimate goal of the game is to advance the soul of Angel on the destiny track to level six (six points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
