			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Let's take a break... it's almost dark&amp;quot;, his voice was rough, like charred skin. The rider in front of him stopped and Vogelstamp's wide, round face emerged from the rainbow hood. &amp;quot;We stop when I say so. There's a couple hours until sunset and a few miles back I saw a sign for a town called Stahlbr&amp;uuml;gge.&amp;quot; Engmann stretched on the back of his horse, up to its ankles in mud. He looked at Vogelstamp, mumbled a few words, and put his hand on the horse's flank. It gleamed with sweat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
