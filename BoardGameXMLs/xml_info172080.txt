			<description>Who can build the most AWESOMEST TreeFort?&lt;br/&gt;August 1978 &amp;ndash; no computers; no cable TV; no money; no girlfriend; and no grown-ups around to nag about chores! School&amp;rsquo;s gonna start next week and you&amp;rsquo;re sick and tired of hanging at the mall and the local swimming hole. &amp;ldquo;What do you wanna do today?&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know, what do YOU wanna do?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Hey, let&amp;rsquo;s build some tree forts!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tree Forts is a fast-paced and surprisingly strategic card/board game that will take you back to the days of lava lamps, Atari video game consoles, and lazy afternoons spent scavenging for stuff to add to your fort. Players compete to determine whose fort is best - but be careful - your neighbor might have some water balloons or a mud flinger to pelt your fort (and damage your chances of winning)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with a Pallet card and use candy and resources to purchase and build additions to their forts. Each addition has a point value and when you reach a certain point value you win. Player interaction occurs through mud flingers and water balloons that may be used to remove points from player's additions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
