			<description>From the RoninArts Website:&lt;br/&gt;Philip Reed, popular D20 System PDF author and designer of Steve Jackson Games' Frag, and Christopher Shy, best known for his work on White Wolf's Vampire and Eden Studios' All Flesh Must Be Eaten, present a new and exciting roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wrung-out Runner leaned over and fixed me with a bloodshot eye. &amp;quot;Listen, man, you don't even know what wasteland is,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I've seen it. I've seen Ground Double Zero.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Get out,&amp;quot; I said, letting the boredom creep into my voice. &amp;quot;No one living's come out of Missouri since the event.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;That's just the legend!&amp;quot; he snapped, pounding a palm on the table for emphasis. My own hand crept toward my pistol, but that seemed to be the end of his outburst. His hand rested where it had landed. It had a perpetual little tremor to it, nerves strung way past the breaking point.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;There's even people, living people, still trying to make a go of it there,&amp;quot; he continued. &amp;quot;But the necros ... They've got necros there that would scare the crap out of what we see down here. Then there's the hole&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;His voice drifted off. I made a scoffing sound but avoided meeting his eyes. When he mentioned the hole, some unimaginable horror had shone in his eyes. Whatever really spawned that fear, I wanted no share in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MotoCaust, a post-apocalypse wasteland filled with zombies, fast cars, and massive guns, is perfect for gamers looking for a little flesh eating and automotive destruction. This 52-page PDF includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- Complete rules for character and vehicle creation and playing the game.&lt;br/&gt;-- An overview of the wasteland, focusing on the area known as Texas.&lt;br/&gt;-- The necros, mutant zombies brought to life by some weird alien spore.&lt;br/&gt;-- Sample vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;-- Front and back covers.&lt;br/&gt;-- And lots of beautiful artwork -- over 20 full-color paintings and almost 20 B&amp;amp;W sketches -- by Christopher Shy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plug, the turret man on our tricked-out SUV, swung his piece to fire at the necroworm. The brute was dozens of feet long, snapping down its powerful jaws as it tried to grab the rear-end of our ride. It shrugged off the 20mm rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Great. Now we've woke up his bee-autch!? Plug snarled as the beast's mate exploded out of the ground to our right. Things were beginning to look grim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
