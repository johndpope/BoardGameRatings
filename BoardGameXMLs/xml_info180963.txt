							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Random Encounters Remastered: Porphyra</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Random Encounters Remastered is intended to provide GMs a detailed, comprehensive source for randomly generating unique encounters with a variety of interesting terrain features, NPCs and site-specific monsters. More than simply a bunch of tables, Random Encounters Remastered also presents rules, guidelines and advice for quickly creating interesting roleplaying and combat situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Random Encounters Remastered has until now striven to be setting-neutral. This time, we decided to try something a bit different by creating encounter tables appropriate for distinctive regions of Purple Duck's Porphyra Campaign Setting:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    God-blasted Wastes: Scorned by divine forces for supporting the enemies of the gods, it harbors elemental beings and the ghosts of an godless past.&lt;br/&gt;    Haunted Sea: Cursed by necromantic forces and kept free by the efforts of desperate pirates.&lt;br/&gt;    Primeval Woodland: A highland forest as larger-than-life as the giants, fey, and beasts that roam it.&lt;br/&gt;    Spirit-Watched Country: Hills and plains vexed by undead, fey, and stranger things from the Astral and Ethereal Planes.&lt;br/&gt;    Tainted Estuary: A tropical coast polluted by evil, celebrated for mechanical marvels, and loomed over by dragons and aberrations.&lt;br/&gt;    Underdeep Ruins: Buried remnants of lands and nations literally crushed by the arrival of strange new gods and new lands, now haunted by the restless dead, aberrations, and patrols by underground races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this book is designed to be used with Porphyra, the features of these regions are easy to adapt to other settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
