			<description>It's serious! The earth was hit by a flood! Everyone is flying and running away! It's true!&lt;br/&gt;However, there are still birds left behind on the ground!&lt;br/&gt;What are you doing! Ostrich! Penguin! Kiwi! It's true! It's true!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a balloon card indicating the pattern of his country, turning one piece per turn and tying it to the straps that comes from his favorite animal.&lt;br/&gt;If all the straps are filled with balloons, that bird will fly away, to the country of the most prolific balloons!&lt;br/&gt;The kiwi has special abilities. Once you acquire Mr. Kiwi, that player can go for balloons in other countries once. So the second half of the game when each player owns a kiwi, is very thrilling!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
