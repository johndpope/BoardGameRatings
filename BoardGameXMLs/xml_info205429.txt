			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a good idea for all of us to sit and have a quick chat about the experience we&amp;rsquo;re looking to get out of this game, how much time we have, what issues we&amp;rsquo;d rather avoid or ban or focus on, and the general tone and theme of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One group&amp;rsquo;s game of Weeping Sun might mirror survival horror, while another is about exploration or epic heroism. Getting everyone on the same page before we get into the nitty-gritty is often a good way to break the ice, and make sure there aren&amp;rsquo;t any uncomfortable situations during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game apparently was developed prior to the contest announcement.  Although it was received and enumerated as an accepted entry, it was not considered in the voting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
