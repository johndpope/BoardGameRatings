			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Return of the Spirit Warrior&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Necromancerâ€™s Grimoire: Spirit Warriors presented a new kind of martial character for 3.5 and Pathfinder games. Spirit warriors could draw upon the power of exemplars&amp;mdash;mythical warriors whose legendary deeds had allowed them to ascend to a quasi-divine status&amp;mdash;borrowing their strength and skill in order to complete their own epic quests and adventures. They manifested these powers in the form of spiritual arms and armor, as well as a number of unique supernatural powers that would allow them to perform feats of daring that normal warriors could only dream of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, spirit warriors have returned with no less than six new exemplars to choose from. Unlike the original exemplars, those found in A Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s Grimoire: Spirit Warriors II do not have opposed exemplars, so while this book doubles the number of exemplars available, it produces exponentially more combinations of exemplars than were available before. The book also includes everything you need to know about the spirit warrior class itself, so, while the original book would increase the number of available exemplars, it is not necessary to make use of this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exemplars found in this tome are might figures from the dawn of time who determined the fate of their entire races. From Ertanis Stargem, the elf-father, to Lycaon, the first werewolf, your spirit warrior can call upon these ancient figures from beyond the mists of time. Call upon the power of titans with Primothas, or delve deep into the secrets of the night with Moran, the first revenant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you liked the first book devoted to spirit warriors, and wished you had more exemplars to choose from, this is the book for you. If this is your first introduction to spirit warriors, what are you waiting for? Unlock the ancient mysteries today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
