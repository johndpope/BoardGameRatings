							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rainbow: A Game With Colour Cards</name>
									
			<description>Card game of using colours to make other colours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal out all the cards evenly but include the Dummy as an extra hand. Give each player 30 counters. At the start, each player puts 10 counters into the Pool. The Dummy hand is left face-down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player, in their turn, can ask any other player for a card by naming the colour he would like. If successful, that player can ask again, and so on until he gets a negative answer. If this happens he must 'Buy' a card from the Dummy (by paying one counter into the Pool) and add it to his hand. If a set is acquired during his turn then he must expose it by laying down the correct cards (Master Card plus the two colour cards needed to make that Master Card colour. For instance, 1 Yellow + 1 Green makes Blue. For every colour set that a player exposes, he gets a number of counters from the Pool. This varies with the sets exposed, but will result in taking 4, 3 or 2 counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One set is different, the Rainbow set, which comprises of the Rainbow Master Card and the rainbows 6 colours (I know there arte 7 colours in a rainbow but the designer of this game did not know that). The round ends when a player lays down the Rainbow set and he or she takes the Pool and every other player must hand over counters for every card still in their hand (1 counter for a colour card, 2 for a Master Card.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as many rounds as there are players and the winner is the one with the most counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An alternative way of scoring is given that awards points instead of counters and a further, easier game, called Rainbow Sequence, is described.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
