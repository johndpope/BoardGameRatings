							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">FS Chess Football: A Thinking Fan&#039;s Game</name>
									
			<description>Game pieces of different speeds, power, and abilities are strategically positioned and moved to play a chess like football game.  The plays occur in stages.  A small and soft ball is tossed and kicked with the fingers.  The game is played within the box that it comes in, and the sides of the box keep the ball from easily leaving the playing area.  Sand timers are included if the participants want to speed up play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
