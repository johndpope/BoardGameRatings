			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the first Character Folio for the Breachworld RPG, featuring a possible antagonist, ally, foil, or all of the above in the form of a relentless&lt;br/&gt;mechanical assassin. He has much to offer in any of those roles, with depths and possibilities for his character that are a fruitful ground of role-playing&lt;br/&gt;opportunities. And, because he has full stats at different levels of experience, he can fit in nicely as an addition to any table, or even as a pre-generated&lt;br/&gt;character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this supplement:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    402, the Machine Man assassin, described and illustrated&lt;br/&gt;    Four character sheets for the character at four different levels of experience&lt;br/&gt;    Adventure ideas for involving 402 in your campaign&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
