			<description>In a time of crisis, will you choose to remain calm or fall into the panic? This is a game about a doomsday prophecy. Players&amp;rsquo; goal is to become the Prophet and brainwash everyone into believing that the world is ending. In this mind game, Everyone starts out with the same amount of sanity points. Once your sanity points are gone, you fall into a state of madness. The player who plays the role of the Prophet will spread his prophecy(madness), and convert every other player into the state of madness, thus becoming his follower. Once he turns everyone into his follower, he wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rest of the players need to not only keep themselves from losing their sanity but at the same time, expose the Prophet&amp;rsquo;s lies. The player who destroys the Prophet&amp;rsquo;s last bit of sanity will become the next the Prophet. There is no trust in this game, as anyone who fights on your side might be your enemy next round; because the only way to win the game is to become the Prophet and eliminate the nonbelievers yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our game features a handful of controversial historical figures that had made the significant impact through the course of the world history, whether it is good or bad. Players will be able to play the role of a historical character of their choice, use their unique ability to either fight against the Prophet or be the Prophet themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now stay sane, and spread the madness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
