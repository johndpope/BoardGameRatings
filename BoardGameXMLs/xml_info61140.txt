			<description>From the publisher's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A free web enhancement for Arcana Unearthed and Arcana Evolved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This free six-page download by Jeffery A. Dobberpuhl presents 10 spells from the core rules System Reference Document (SRD) converted for use with Monte Cook&amp;rsquo;s Arcana Unearthed or the forthcoming Monte Cook&amp;rsquo;s Arcana Evolved. The process of converting standard d20 spells for these variant player&amp;rsquo;s handbooks appears in the DM&amp;rsquo;s Screen and Player&amp;rsquo;s Guide as well as in the Arcana Evolved appendix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t use the alternate magic system found in these variant player&amp;rsquo;s handbooks, you may be interested in adapting these spells&amp;rsquo; heightened versions (cast at one level higher than normal) and diminished versions (cast at one level lower than normal) in your own d20 games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some spell names are new or slightly altered from the originals to help differentiate the spell versions. In such cases, the new name appears first, followed by the core name. In a few cases (such as the &amp;ldquo;fog cloud&amp;rdquo; series), the alternate names serve as models you can use for renaming other spells that you convert from the SRD or even the ones in this article. You might, for example, have a mage in your game learn a slightly different version of the spells presented here, with different effects. For instance, corrosive mists might inflict 3d6 points of damage per round when heightened, but deal no temporary Strength damage and carry a different name, such as horrible fog of doom. Minor changes like this both keep players on their toes (&amp;ldquo;Have you ever heard of this spell before? Me neither!&amp;rdquo;) and prove useful in storytelling. (&amp;ldquo;This is the spell MY master taught me! Now you shall see whose magic is stronger&amp;hellip; your feeble corrosive mists or my superior horrible fog of doom!&amp;rdquo;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the spells in this article were chosen to show how you can give the spells you modify a thematic set of effects that can enhance storytelling. For example, the colors used in acid arrow and corrosive mists are similar. Further, both spells, when heightened, cause victims to lose strength as the acid eats away at them. A few spells were chosen for this article because they are cool utilitarian spells that are fun to play around with. And some were tossed in as good, basic utility spells to round out the group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players of Arcana Unearthed will notice that a few of the spells include racial descriptors, which are introduced in Arcana Evolved. They do not affect their use with Arcana Unearthed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
