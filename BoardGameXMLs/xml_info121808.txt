			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starion is part puzzle, part shooter game. Time-travelling aliens have altered history. You are Starion, a rookie space fighter pilot and you must correct the changes the aliens have made. You choose one of the 243 time zones under attack, fight the enemy spaceships in first-person (cockpit) view dogfights, and pick up the letters left behind by the destroyed ships. Once you have cleared the level, you must form a word with the letters you've collected. You then have to cross the time gate and guess what historical event the word refers to. Once that is done, pick another timezone, and the game continues to another dogfight/puzzle sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game developed by David Webb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
