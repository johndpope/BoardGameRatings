			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Lincoln Station, the City of the Future!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lincoln Station is one of the largest cities in the United States. It is full of all the glitz and glamour one would expect from such a jewel of society. Sadly its core is more corrupt than one can imagine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mega-corporations vie for power while metahumans battle it out in the streets, but there are opportunities waiting those who know where to look.  Lincoln Station is full of stories... what will your's be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lincoln Station Stories is a Setting Book designed for use with Michael T. Desing's Sentinels of Echo City but can easily be adapted to the comic-book system of your choice.  It features the history and current events around the city as well as information about the boroughs that make it up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lincoln Station Stories contains write-ups for many of its more notable metahumans but leaves more than enough room for new Heroes and Villains to enter the stage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
