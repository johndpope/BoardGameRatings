							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Barney Picture Game</name>
									
			<description>Join in the fun as you travel around the neighborhood matching colors and collecting photos of your friends Barney and Baby Bop.  you'll even take photos of one another with Barney's super camera spinner.  If you're the first player to collect one each of all five sights, you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to move a stand-up playing piece along the pathway and take five pictures of Barney. Movement is determined by a spinner with a player moving forward to the color indicated by the result. The spinner is a clever representation of a camera. Players draw one or two cards when landing on designated areas. Some cards require a player to take a &amp;quot;pretend&amp;quot; picture of another contestant with the camera/spinner while that kid makes a certain facial expression. The Rainbow Picture cards are drawn randomly as player land on spaces that reward a lucky spin. Each player tries to assemble a complete set of five different Barney poses and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(description stolen from Pete Belli's review: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/496407/i-love-you-you-love-me-were-a-happy-family&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/496407/i-love-you-you-lo...&lt;/a&gt;-)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
