			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Shoppers enter the It's Only Money Mall via the spinner and begin shopping, with the aim or acquiring 5 spaces on the It's Only Money Shopping Money Card, while denying opponents' ability to do the same.  Perilous pitfalls and profitable bonus spaces all contribute to playing excitement.  The first player to acquire the five spacess, as well as the $50,000 in game money, is the winner.  It's a fast paced game of shopping strategy, savvy and spending.  Do you have what it takes to win it all?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
