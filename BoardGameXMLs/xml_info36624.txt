							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Drunken Coachman</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;... the Amusing Game played in Naval Messes.&amp;quot;  This is a small box card game where the goal is to move the Coachman figure between players using the cards dealt to you at the beginning of the game (they move the card a certain number of players left or right&amp;quot;.  If a stop if played you lose a chit from your stock (you star with twelve) to the centre.  A &amp;quot;fares please&amp;quot; card gets you one stock counter from each player.  The person who has the Coachman in Front of them at the end wins the chits from the centre.  You play to a set total score or until all but one player is eliminated.  The original game makes you play your cards without looking at them but a suggested variant of playing from your hand make it more interesting.  This is one of a number of light English Card Games created during the 1930's.  There is no publisher, author or date on the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
