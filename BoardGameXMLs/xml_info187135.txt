			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PowerForce is a campaign setting for the Powergame role-playing game.  PowerForce was developed in an online forum by numerous contributors; because of this process some areas of the setting are quite well developed and other areas remain fairly vague.  Setting aspects such as heroes, villains, and other non-player characters are well presented, as are details about various hero or villain groups and their motivations.  The setting also features several alien races that have a tenuous presence in the game.  The setting also features a (basic) online Powergame (5th Edition) character generator for the game, developed in JavaScript.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
