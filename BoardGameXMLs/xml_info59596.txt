			<description>&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kingdoms of Kalamar is the original Kalamar campaign setting box. At this time it is still a generic setting not designed for any special RPG system (but with Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons in mind).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHEREIN you will explore the lands of Tellene, a world filled with powerful sorceries, strange races, clashing armies, deadly political maneuvering, chivalrous heroes, scheming villains, fantastic gods and their zealous priesthoods, ancient tongues, clandestine power groups and much, much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRICATELY designed with the proper blend of magic and realism, the Kingdoms of Kalamar&amp;trade; fantasy campaign setting will satisfy the needs of even the most demanding gamers. Geographic and historical research were used to create Tellene's topography, populations, armies, cities and laws. Yet, the numerous schools of magic, priesthoods and supernatural marvels of Tellene exemplify the aura of high fantasy that pervades the realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The KINGDOMS OF KALAMAR&amp;trade; boxed set comes fully loaded with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Volume I: Sourcebook of the Sovereign Lands. This 100 page tome details the history of the peoples and nations of Tellene. From the depths of the mysterious Vohven Jungle to the vast savanna of the Drhokker horse-lords, the Sourcebook of the Sovereign Lands describes every kingdom, race and topographical feature.&lt;br/&gt;     Volume II: Mythos of the Divine and Worldly. Over 40 new deities and religions are painstakingly described within this 88 page guidebook. Secret organizations, languages, runes, constellations, astronomical marvels and an eight page index are also included in Volume II.&lt;br/&gt;     A magnificently detailed, 3' by 4' full-color map that comes in two sections depicting the eastern and western halves of the continent. Brilliantly created, this painting has been called the finest fantasy map on the market. As an added bonus, a calibrated hex-map overlay for accurate distance determination is included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The KINGDOMS OF KALAMAR&amp;trade; is ready for adventure with any fantasy roleplaying system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
