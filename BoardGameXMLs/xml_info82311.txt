							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tiny Tank: Up Your Arsenal</name>
									
			<description>Tiny Tank: Up Your Arsenal is a third person shooter video game developed by AndNow and Appaloosa Interactive. Initially meant to be published by MGM Interactive, they dropped the title and gave it to Sony Computer Entertainment America. It was released on August 31, 1999 for the PlayStation console.  Tiny Tank is a relatively straightforward third person shooter. The player controls Tiny as he traverses many levels, eliminating SenTrax forces as he goes. There are two bars at the top of the screen that show Tiny's health and the amount of nanometal acquired. Nanometal is essential for the on-board Fix-It Crabs to repair Tiny. If the nanometal meter runs out, health cannot be regenerated. There is also a map on the upper right hand corner identifying the surroundings, enemies, and mission objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tiny Tank: Up Your Arsenal,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
