			<description>This party game from Dennis Productions is a simple quiz about how to spell the names of a dozen well-know composers. It consists of 12 player cards, and a key card with the answers. The box features an illustration of a piano player in formal dress at the keys of an open grand piano.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player card has three columns with different spellings for the same 12 composers and an answer column in which the player writes 1, 2 or 3 to reflect the column of his chosen answer. The player with the most correct answers at the end of the time limit wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
