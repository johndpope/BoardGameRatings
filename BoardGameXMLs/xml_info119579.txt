			<description>The &amp;quot;It's all about grAtitude!&amp;quot; project began with an idea several years ago to teach, in a fun and entertaining way, age-old universal principles of prosperity and abundance that have been taught in every major spiritual and cultural tradition. Those principles are known today by names such as Law of Attraction, Law of Allowing, Law of Gratitude, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea, conceived by Theuns Serfontein in South Africa, was to use a board and card game (played much like a cross between Monopoly and Trivial Pursuit) to teach and promote these principles.  In 2010 the Law of Attraction worked to put Theuns together with Steve Vernon (a graphic and web designer in the United States) through an online marketing company in which they both were involved and, thanks to Skype, they became not only business partners, but very close friends.  A few months later, Theuns asked Steve to partner with him in his dream of creating &amp;quot;grAtitude!&amp;quot;- the game (originally called &amp;quot;Bridge to Success&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grAtitude! board game is played by tossing dice, moving around the &amp;quot;G&amp;quot;-shaped track, drawing cards from any of the four decks (depending on what space you land on), and following the instructions on the card within a certain time frame. You may, for example, have 30 seconds to name as many things as possible that start with the letter &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; that you're grateful for and win 1000 grati for each thing you name, or you might be told the Universe just rewarded you with 5,000 grati because you wrote down three daily goals this morning, or you might be asked to complete a famous quote or answer a multiple choice question.  With over 700 cards in the game, the possibilities are almost endless!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
