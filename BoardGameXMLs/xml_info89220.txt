							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ultra Quick Soccer</name>
									
			<description>The scope of Ultra Quick Soccer is much like the other games in the Ultra Quick lineup. With UQ Soccer, I aim to provide you with an extremely quick and accurate method of resolving the final score between two soccer teams. With UQ Soccer you can play out an entire season for a team or a league in rapid fashion. UQ Soccer makes a perfect stand-alone game for season replays. It also functions very well as a complimentary game by resolving the games that don&amp;rsquo;t particularly interest you in a detailed shot-by-shot game, while you use the detailed game to play out the games that do interest you. &lt;br/&gt;Unlike most quick play games, which only provide a team score, UQ Soccer does offer an optional individual scoring module to allow you to track league leaders in goals and assists in leagues that track the stat. There is also an individual goal keeper option for some seasons which will allow you to track goal keeper Wins and Losses as well as GAA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
