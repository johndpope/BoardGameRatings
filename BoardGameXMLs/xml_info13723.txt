			<description>Basket of Fruit is an educational game designed to teach its players various desirables and undesirables of early nineteenth-century English society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a pyramid as his or her token.  They move their tokens from the start point based on the result of spinning the Totum.  Whenever their token land on a space, they are to read aloud from the booklet the explanation for the picture on the space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever lands exactly on the last (20th) space wins and ends the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
