			<description>Orconomics is a game for 2-5 players, competing against each other to establish Companies in ten industrial sectors. Companies&lt;br/&gt;in each industrial sector generate income or losses, and grant players abilities that can be used during the game. As players build their business empire, they will also gain or lose Trophies depending on their presence in each sector and whether they dominate it.&lt;br/&gt;When a player holds a set number of Trophies the game ends immediately, and that player is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, each player found or raid companies in different sectors of Orcs industry: Tourism, Smuggling, Totemology etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board consists of 10 sectors that assembles randomly for each new game. That gives a good replay rating as sectors will have different value and will affect on each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Companies in different sectors provide a special ability of the sector. For example, a leader of a Totemology sector will get an ability to send a crisis to an opponents sector. That also gives a variety of tactic decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another important part of the game - Influence Cards. It is hard to get it, but these cards are really powerful and can destroy your opponents plans and becomes even more devastating in various combos with sector abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the main concept of the game lays in the interaction of all player. It makes a player to be involved in the gaming process even during the opponent's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
