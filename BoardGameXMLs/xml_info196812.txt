			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Eight] players are allocated on each island and take the role of landowner and head of family. [Character] profiles include job, number of members in household, water needs, and equipment. [The character's] objective is to provide enough drinking water (quality and quantity) to his or her family by investing in new water equipment according to their income. [Characters] also have to accommodate new relatives on their land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into 2 sets of 3 rounds. Each round represents a one-year period. The first set is dedicated to individual strategies, the second set to collective rules. An important debriefing stage is then dedicated to collective analysis of the situation and proposals for new scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is provided as a ZIP archive including source code for the water simulation results and UML diagrams.  A play session report also is available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
