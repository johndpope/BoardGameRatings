							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Archangel Michael</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Archangel Michael is the commander of God's armies; he led the heavenly host against Satan's forces during his rebellion. The patron saint of many who value chivalry, Michael's primordial feats of arms are glorified as &amp;quot;the first deed of knighthood and chivalrous prowess that was ever achieved&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A prince of light, Michael is described as the &amp;quot;viceroy of heaven&amp;quot;; the title that formerly belonged to Satan. Although furious in battle, Michael is the angel of forbearance and mercy, and presides over human virtue. Myth states that Michael, along with Gabriel, Raphael, and Phanuel, will be strengthened during the Battle of Armageddon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
