							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Modern: Six-Pack - Psionic Operative Items</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like Modern: 13 Arcane Operative Items, this PDF explores what kind of items the R&amp;amp;D departments of the various covert agencies might come up with in a world that features psionics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As I looked through the various psionic powers and compared them to the spells in the SRD, I noticed quite a bit of overlap was possible; a number of spells that were used in that PDF had psionic powers that served the same function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than take up space by essentially duplicating the same sort of entry, I left those items off and stuck with six items that were different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
