			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Perception is more important than reality&amp;quot; is a phrase you will hear quite often in the halls of high-powered business. In most modern campaigns that will be an undeniable truth&amp;mdash;it doesn't matter how well or badly a business is doing as long as the public thinks the company is strong and reliable. What's more, this extends far beyond the corporate world. Many a politician has won election and re-election based on reputation rather than the facts of his or her voting record. The key to managing people's opinions is the ability to manipulate their perceptions. To accomplish that, companies, charities, celebrities, and even heads of state turn to public relations experts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building Blocks: Spin Doctoring features a set of optional rules for measuring and influencing public opinion across the broad spectrum of a campaign world. It will be most useful in campaigns where the player characters have a measure of fame, their adventures are a followed and reported on by the mass media, and details like public perception and approval ratings are important to the group. Also featured are details on the Bird's Nest Promotions organization-a public relations firm suitable for use in nearly any campaign set in the modern-day-including a fully developed NPC write-up for the organization's owner, Jeri Bird.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
