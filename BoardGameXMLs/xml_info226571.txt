			<description>In Fleet Ambush, two players will take control of a fleet each, Humans Vs. Aliens. At the start of the game, both players construct a fleet of ships using square pieces. Your ships can be armed with many weapons, including ion cannons, fighter bays, turrets and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once both players have constructed their fleet, the two fleets will battle it out the cold dark depths of space! Each player takes turns activating their ships, moving and then firing! You can also use your fighters to create a fighter screen, blocking your ships from your enemies weapon systems!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, you will need to disable all of your opponents ships, or have more standing at the end of 10 rounds. Let the best Admiral win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full instructions to PnP and play are here: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/18h-WMTEOyfyf5At1PZwqjYJRNHouzVJKbM_FX-0v-_I/view&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/18h-WMTEOyfyf5At1PZwqjYJR...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
