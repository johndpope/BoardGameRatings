							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paduk</name>
									
			<description>Paduk is a traditional game of Korean origin usually played on the specially marked inner 9 by 9 grid of the Go board. Players own two sorts of pieces, called stones (round) and columns (square). The stones are able to move, the columns stay on their places, until a player breaks the game, then all columns of this player go to the hand of this player for new placing. A player is not allowed to break the game twice, the hostile side must break the game also. Object of the game is to form geometrical positions of four on the board, which are formed of the two sorts of pieces. After the first move Paduk offers more movement possibilities than Go and clearly more than Chess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
