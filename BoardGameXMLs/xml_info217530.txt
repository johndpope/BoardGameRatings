							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Demonic Toupee</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally created by a trickster demon, the Demonic Toupee is often employed as a tool of revenge and conquest for those possessing the infernal knowledge needed to create it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When placed on a living creature&amp;rsquo;s bald skin, it forces its way into their brain with hair-like tendrils and takes control of their body.  With few natural defenses of its own, it will then do what it can to secure the life and safety of its host.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having access to its victim&amp;rsquo;s memories, it will mimic their mannerisms to blend in. The Toupee can also trigger chemical reactions in their brain to increase their physical abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imbued with an endless drive to expand its influence, the Toupee sucks nutrients from its host to grow its body. Once its &amp;ldquo;hair&amp;rdquo; is long enough, it will cut off pieces of itself that then become new Demonic Toupees. Its offspring will defend and defer to their creator so long as they remain close by.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
