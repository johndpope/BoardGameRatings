							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Final Deathweek</name>
									
			<description>You should have died in that huge accident last summer &amp;mdash; but one of your compatriots had had a premonition in which they saw the accident happen, and you had decided to trust this, and thus managed to escape death at the last moment. You returned from the banks of the Styx feeling that you could now enjoy summer life with more treks and more beaches...but you can't relax just yet. Fate doesn't like when people tamper with her whims, and the angel of Death is stretching his hands towards you slowly but surely. Will you be able to escape his clutches for another week? It's a desperate, shared struggle for survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final Deathweek is a cooperative card game. Players hold cards that symbolize &amp;quot;death flags&amp;quot; (death warnings) of certain colors. Each turn, each player in order must select one of the available events for the day, trying to NOT match the colors of the event with the color(s) they have in hand. While not matching colors, they should also try to form chains with the events they take. If the colors do match, the player takes damage, eventually being killed if too much damage is taken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lasts for seven days, and if all players survive, they beat the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
