							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sting of the Spider</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Begin Communication&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TO: All agents in all bureaus&lt;br/&gt;FROM: Orion Foundation&lt;br/&gt;RE: San Cristobal Base&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once called a &amp;quot;glittering island jewel&amp;quot;, the beautiful resort of San Cristobal has begun to show more cracks. The establishment of an Orion Foundation Operations center on the island has proceeded smoothly&amp;mdash;but no one suspected that the new center would see so much business, so soon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But indications of grave trouble have been increasingly common on the island. Not only have the usual nefarious perpetrators of revolution, piracy, and smuggling gained strength and influence there, but now ruthless agents of the Web have established themselves on San Cristobal. Their work is urgent, though the Web's objectives on the island remain unknown. Are they working in concert with the Russians? The Cubans? Perhaps the CIA?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sting of the Spider is the sequel to Web of Deceit, the module that introduced players and Administrators to San Cristobal. This module is designed to expand the adventure on the island and answer some important questions. Though it is designed especially for Orion Agents, representatives of other agencies will have little trouble adapting the module to their campaigns - there's plenty of danger to go around!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End Communication&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
