			<description>&amp;quot;NASCAR 06: Total Team Control is the ninth installment of the EA Sports' NASCAR video game series. It was developed by EA Tiburon and released on August 30, 2005 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The NTSC game cover features Hendrick Motorsports teammates Jeff Gordon, driver of the #24 DuPont Automotive Finishes Chevy Monte Carlo and Jimmie Johnson, driver of the #48 Lowe's Home Improvement Chevy Monte Carlo. The PAL region game cover features Kurt Busch in the #97 Irwin Industrial Tools Ford Taurus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NASCAR 06 follows the series' recent tradition of being subtitled with the major new feature of that edition. Total Team Control derives from the new teammate features: one can switch control from their driver to another car on their team during a race, and can command the teammate to follow, block or work with the player. It also implements Logitech USB audio technology, allowing the player to order their crew chief with a headset or microphone. The rest of the game retains the modes and features brought into the series by NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup, making NASCAR 06 very similar to its predecessor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game received positive ratings from many reviewers who praised the new teamplay features, adding to an already abundant amount of content. It is likewise criticized by fans and reviewers for subpar graphics, unrealistic damage, and not making the strides to the series NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup did; John Davidson, a reviewer on 1UP, called the features &amp;quot;gratuitous&amp;quot; and believes that they &amp;quot;provide a constant feeling of detachment&amp;quot; from the racing experience.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;NASCAR_06:_Total_Team_Control,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
