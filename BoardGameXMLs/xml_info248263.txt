							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Putty Pals</name>
									
			<description>Putty Pals is a colourful, bouncy, and squishy cooperative two-player platform puzzle game, challenging two players to communicate and solve problems together. Players must guide two cute, brightly-coloured balls of putty through over thirty levels of obstacles and hazards in a vivid, cartoonish world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two characters can cooperate in a variety of ways. They can flatten themselves to form a high-bouncing trampoline, link hands to swing each other through the air, and much more. Colour-coded puzzles mean that both players will need to do their part to get the heroes back home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
