			<description>The Supreme Board Game is fun and easy to learn, easy to play, and no 2 games will ever be identical.  A game can be played within 15 minutes or so, and the ideal combination of luck and skill creates a fun interactive atmosphere.  Any player can win at any time, but after a series of games, the more skillful player should prevail.  If you would like to add more skill and excitement, the advanced rules using the doubling cube will lead to a dynamic 2 player heads up match, or a multi player tournament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Navigate your pawn according to your die rolls, from the start to the finish, taking advantage of short cuts and tunnel spaces that could instantly catapult you from last place to first place!  The exciting fast paced game play will keep you guessing who's going to win until the final turn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
