			<description>In Snapshouts, each player gets 5 picture cards and 5 letter cards.  Your job is to assign one letter card to each picture, and then write a single word relating to the picture that starts with the letter you assigned to it.  Record your words on the included score sheet.  When everyone is ready, the guessing can begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, flip the 60-second sand timer and reveal one of your pictures and the letter you assigned to it.  All of the other players shout out words, hoping to guess the word you wrote.  All they have to go off of is the picture and the letter.  If someone guesses your word, add the picture card to their score pile and put the letter card in your own score pile.  Quickly show the next picture/letter combo, and continue in this way until time is up or all five of your words have been guessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues this way around the table, and once everyone has had a turn the round ends.  Count up the number of cards in your score pile and record it on your score sheet.  The game lasts a total of three rounds.  In the second and third rounds, each card is worth more points.  After three rounds, the game ends and the player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
