							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Plaza: A Game for Everyone</name>
									
			<description>Plaza comes in a monopoly size box with poker chips, a special deck of cards &amp;amp; a game board showing 9 combinations of cards. &lt;br/&gt;5 hands is a game in each hand one chip per player is placed on the board for each combination. &lt;br/&gt;4 cards are removed from the deck &amp;amp; the rest are dealt out.&lt;br/&gt;Players earn chips by revealing cards to match the combinations on the board.&lt;br/&gt;Then a stack of cards is started by the dealer with his lowest card of any suit.  This stack must be built sequentially by all players until the 11 (high card is placed or the next numbered card is not available.&lt;br/&gt;Whoever placed the last card starts the next stack.&lt;br/&gt;The first player out of cards collects a chip from every other player for every card they have left.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of 5 hands the one with the most chips wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are similar in design to Plaza but this only has four suits with 11 cards each (not 12), The rules are completely different and Plaza has no board and does not use chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
