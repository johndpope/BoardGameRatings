			<description>At the beginning the clock is set for 12 o'clock. The pawn stands at the field with the glassy shoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a set of cards and lays them with un-bewitched side open at the table. The player throws the die and draws the pawn. Is the final field a good fairy he is allowed to bewitch one of his cards. He turns it so that the bewitched side is open. Is it an evil fairy one bewitched card has to be turn to the other side.  The player whose cards with ball dress, a coach, horses, coachman and prince are open in front of him wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;Take your turn to spin the spinner and see what it says for you to do. Magic the storycards with the Fairy Godmother; Unmagic the storycards with the Nasty Stepsisters. Win the heart of the Handsome Prince, or move the clock forward three hours, but beware!!! ... tick, tock, tick, tock... when midnight comes, you must Unmagic all your storycards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
