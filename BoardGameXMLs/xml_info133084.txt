			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes rules supplements read like the world-setting bible of frustrated novelists. While solid world- building is a useful skill, you don&amp;rsquo;t always need four paragraphs of flavor text to tell you swords are cool, magic is power, shadows are scary, and orcs are savage. Sometimes a GM doesn&amp;rsquo;t have time to slog through a page of history for every magic weapon. Sometimes all that&amp;rsquo;s needed are a few cool ideas, with just enough information to use them in a game. Sometimes, all you need are bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1 With A Bullet Point is a line of very short, cheap PDFs each of which gives the bare bones of a set of related options. It may be five spells, six feats, eight magic weapon special abilities, or any other short set of related rules we can cram into about a page. Short and simple, these PDFs are for GMs and players who know how to integrate new ideas into their campaigns without any hand-holding, and just need fresh ideas and the rules to support them. No in-character fiction setting the game world. No charts and tables. No sidebars of explanations and optional rules. Just one sentence of explanation for the High Concept of the PDF, then bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The High Concept: Five feats that allow spellcasters using the classic and venerable spells haste and slow (and blessing of fervor, if it is used in the campaign) to have as many options as characters who use material weapons. This is the latest in a series of products to celebrate the &amp;quot;Summer of Bullets&amp;quot; event!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The feats included are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Distorted Speed: You can change the effects of speed-changing spells you cast.&lt;br/&gt;    Marathon of One [Metamagic]: You can focus your speed-influencing spells on a single target.&lt;br/&gt;    Master of Speed: Even when not casting a speed-altering spell, you can affect the movements of your willing allies.&lt;br/&gt;    Overlord of Speed: Even when not casting a speed-altering spell, you can affect the movements of your willing allies.&lt;br/&gt;    Unrestrained Spell [Metamagic]: The targets of your spells may be farther apart than normal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
