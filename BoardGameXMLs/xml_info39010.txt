							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Liberty Island</name>
									
			<description>Liberty Island is all about the early days of the 20th century when people came from all lands, escaping turmoil and poverty,religious tyranny and governmental brutality. They came from all corners of the world past the Lady holding the torch of freedom to Ellis Island. People came to NYC forming segregated sections like Chinatown and Little Italy. As years passed and the country grew, the city became one and we all became Americans in the Land we call the Melting Pot.&lt;br/&gt;Liberty Island is quite simple. A player chooses a ship and a bag of deeds naming them the nationality of their choice, like Irish or Italian. They must move these ships to obtain as many rows of city squares as possible(a row consists of 3 horizontal city squares). The nationality with the most rows(12 rows in all) at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
