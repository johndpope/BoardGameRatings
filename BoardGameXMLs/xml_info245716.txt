			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be ready, as mythology comes to life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to 8-Bit Adventures! Do you yearn for a simpler time, when video games scrolled right and you only had to deal with two buttons at a time? An era where blocky, colorful, vaguely recognizable shapes made up heroes that battled odd and often confusing villains with little to no context? Then Fat Goblin Games has you covered!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product line is designed to take a nostalgic look at the iconic video games of the past and bring those adventures to life in your campaigns in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game with all new options. Each volume will includes all the things you need to play a game &amp;ldquo;inspired by&amp;rdquo; a classic video game! The names have been changed, but the flavor remains the same to ensure that the references are easy to see. Each volume describes a different game world, each inspired by a classic game sure to inspire nostalgia in even the most hardened of veterans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume covers the iconic gear found in the Greco-Roman inspired world of the Cloud Kingdom that can be used to defend against and defeat the legions of monsters released by Medusa, Queen of the Monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
