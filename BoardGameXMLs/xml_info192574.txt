			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night of the Barrel is a storytelling game of recalling just what happened during the biggest party of the year. The problem is, the Drunk doesn't really remember things all that clearly. And their memory got worse as the night wore on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are going to need the help of their closest Pals to piece things together. But they may find out some things are better off staying forgotten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab some friends and figure things out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
