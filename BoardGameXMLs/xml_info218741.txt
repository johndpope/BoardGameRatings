			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long awaited Post Apocalypse gamebook!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decades ago the world was crushed in a disaster few of the living remember. You know that the key to future survival lies in discovering the truth about the destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your village was burnt to the ground by the Death Skull Gang. Everyone died &amp;ndash; except for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With no weapons or food you wander into the wasteland &amp;ndash; where only Death can enjoy your hardships...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game is random - each game is unique. With several different items and weapons to find, many problems to solve, you will have hours of fun play ahead of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast paced, easy to learn, rules. You only need pencil, paper and two dice. This solo role playing adventure is a new take on the post apocalypse adventure books. With inspiring illustrations and colorful descriptions, this game book gives you an interesting world to explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    50+ full page illustrations by Dvir Agiv.&lt;br/&gt;    Several different weapons with their own caliber ammo to collect.&lt;br/&gt;    Many different enemies to fight.&lt;br/&gt;    Trade with merchants.&lt;br/&gt;    Four different skills that are used throughout the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;    Random game makes each play different!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
