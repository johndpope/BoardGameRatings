							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Legion Campaign Book</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dark Legion Campaign is a continuation of the epic plot that began to unfold within the Dark Symmetry Campaign, although it can easily be  adapted as a stand alone adventure in this terrifying solar-system spanning campaign which is recommended for experienced players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 1200 years the Apostles have plotted their return. They have festered at the far reaches of our solar system, drawn in new recruits  to their cause, and waited for the right signs to herald their re-emergence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Events once again transpire on Nero that begin a race against time in search of the remnants of war, an interplanetary dash to recover ancient technology that can prevent the forces of the  Dark Legion gaining a superior edge during their second coming. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Massive Campaign: From Nero to Mars, the players will sample all that the mega corporations have to offer during an epic campaign that spans almost the entirety of the solar system. &lt;br/&gt;     Menacing Hazards: New denizens and creatures lurk within, whilst comprehensive rules cover everything from traversing Mercury&amp;rsquo;s inhospitable surface and scouring the sands of Mars, to battling beneath the oceans of Venus. &lt;br/&gt;     Secrets Revealed: Unearth forbidden lore  of the enigmatic Ancients during the rush from planet to planet, knowledge that some in the Brotherhood would prefer to remain hidden. &lt;br/&gt;     Updated Pre-gens: All six characters have been revisited and updated to reflect some of the experiences they would have endured as part of the original Dark Symmetry Campaign. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
