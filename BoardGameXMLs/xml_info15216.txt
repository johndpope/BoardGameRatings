			<description>Two player game on the battle of the same title, a well-known British defeat occurring during the Second Afghan War.  Components: Four page rulebook, 11x17&amp;quot; map, one sheet of 3/4&amp;quot; counters and 2 player aid cards.  As it is a desktop publishing game, the counters must be assembled before play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units are normally 100 men or 2-6 guns.  Each hex is 150 yards and each game turn is 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sequence of play is (1) Afghan reinforcements, (2) Afghans move, (3) British fire, (4) Afghans melee, (5) British move, (6) Afghans fire, (7) British melee.  Fire combat is done by rolling to hit, with struck units being eliminated.  Melee is done by odds ratio with the only outcomes being Attacker eliminated, Defender eliminated or an exchange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Afghans can eliminate the British baggage train before 16 turns pass, they win.  Any other result and they lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First published in 2005 by Kyber Pass Games it is republished by Whitedog games with  new counters, a variant scenario and an historical article on the battle by Tom Cundiff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2nd edition features:&lt;br/&gt;    *  Two-Person or Solitaire Play&lt;br/&gt;    * Sixteen-Page Rules Manual&lt;br/&gt;    * Rules Include a New Variant Scenario&lt;br/&gt;    * An Original Historical Article on the Battle by Tom Cundiff&lt;br/&gt;    * 22 x 15 Hex Game Map in Full Color by Map Artist Richard Dengel&lt;br/&gt;    * Map Comes in Two Printer Format Options: Two Letter-Sized (8.5&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot;) Sheets and Four Letter-Sized Sheets with One-Half Inch Margins&lt;br/&gt;    * 130 Beautiful Playing Pieces by Counter Artist Tom Cundiff&lt;br/&gt;    * Map, Counters, Charts and Rules Available in PDF Format&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
