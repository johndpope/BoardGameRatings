							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Micro Mouse Goes Debugging</name>
									
			<description>This game was developed by Steve Hughes for the ZX Spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The premise was to control Micro Mouse around a screen which contained lines of BASIC program, some of which is missing. While Micro Mouse is replacing the code, he must avoid bugs which will try to kill you and also pinch part of the code. Micro Mouse's only form of defense was a can of data kill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Micro Mouse Goes Debugging&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
