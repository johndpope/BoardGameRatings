			<description>DEPLOY! is a challenging highly themed Euro game of strategic business development involving worker placement, resource management, set collection and an asymmetric upgrade mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game 1-4 candidates set out to prove they have what it takes to be the next IT manager. Through timely development of your server-room, careful management of your staff, tight financial control and prudent investment in supporting technologies you aim to show that you are the one who can deliver the most business value to the company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEPLOY! closely echoes the real world of IT management focusing on the balancing act between cost, time and value. With the second edition it now features a tailored solo gaming experience, server-room expansion, worker training and new technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The company you work for has started on an ambitious modernization and expansion strategy, focusing heavily on replacing their outdated IT systems. A large number of projects have been created by the powers that be. Some of them could help to fund your department; others will add real business value to the company but may not help so much in your running costs. But it&amp;rsquo;s all about the business value at the end of the day and you know the current IT Manager will not be with the company much longer and are out to prove yourself a worthy successor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, you need to generate more business value from the projects than the other contenders for the IT manager position. Each project needs components (databases and stuff) which, in turn, need capacity from servers either in your own data-centre or in the cloud. You already have staff but they are mostly working on other activities so you will need to re-assign some of them when you can afford it. You don&amp;rsquo;t have any spare capacity so you&amp;rsquo;ll need to add some and keep it optimised so you don&amp;rsquo;t waste money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the company will not let just anyone run their projects, especially the really important ones. So, you have to build up the technical knowledge and experience of your team to show you can be trusted with the company&amp;rsquo;s future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
