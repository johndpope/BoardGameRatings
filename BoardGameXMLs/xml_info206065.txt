			<description>Goal of the game is to have most roof pans in the own colour on the roof and also some ladders at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;Therefore as often as possible enemy tiles have been included in the game, flipped and thus transformed into its own color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a character that is moved according to the dice roll. The target field specifies what the player is allowed to make. Options are:&lt;br/&gt;a) place one roof tile of his color onto the roof&lt;br/&gt;b) place two roof tiles of his color onto the roof&lt;br/&gt;c) miss a turn&lt;br/&gt;d) draw an event card and execute it immediately&lt;br/&gt;e) Interim Evaluation trigger (here ladders come into the game)&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one half of the roof is fully occupied.&lt;br/&gt;Each roof tile is worth one point, each conducting one another point.&lt;br/&gt;Whoever has the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
