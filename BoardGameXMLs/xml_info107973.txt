							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Basketball Deck Building Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a 2 player deck building game that has player interaction, balance, and strategy as the primary focuses. Every game turn has both players taking actions. We have defense and offense represented, so you are not just at the mercy of the cards. You do not have to add to your deck each turn, so the size of your deck is up to you, and there for you are in control of how likely you are to draw the cards you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
