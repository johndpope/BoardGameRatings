			<description>WWF King of the Ring is a professional wrestling video game based on the World Wrestling Federation, released in 1993 for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy. In this game, players can vie for the title of King of the Ring by competing in an eight-man single elimination tournament. Additionally, players can battle the entire roster through a string of singles matches to become WWF Champion. Also available are exhibition matches in singles and tag team modes for one or two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NES version features eleven wrestlers: Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, Bret Hart, The Undertaker, &amp;quot;The Narcissist&amp;quot; Lex Luger, Mr. Perfect, Razor Ramon, Shawn Michaels, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow and &amp;quot;You&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the game's wrestlers possess the same basic moveset, consisting of punches, kicks, a body slam, a suplex, a throw, a dropkick, stomps, elbow drops, and a move off the turnbuckle. There are no signature moves. However, each wrestler varies in speed, strength, and stamina attributes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;WWF King of the Ring,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
