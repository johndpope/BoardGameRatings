			<description>Here's an innovative new way to learn Beginning Language skills, plus, as an added bonus, your students will have so much fun they won't realize how much they're learning! Rather than the same old boring drills, numerous worksheets, or endless practice exercises, introduce your students to an exciting new way of learning with the Roll &amp;amp; Learn Pocket Cubes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set includes: two pocket cubes made of the same durable material as our pocket charts, 24 learning cards, and a resource guide. The learning cards are designed to slide easily into plastic sleeves that are located on each side of the cube. Each card has either a photograph or colorful text printed on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game instructions vary depending on the skill being taught that day. Some games require both cubes being tossed, while others have students toss one cube and find the correct answer on the remaining cube. The games include: picture and word matching, alphabetical order, initial sounds, compound words, and long and short vowels. These games can be played with either the whole class or placed in a learning center for small group or individual play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set is a terrific tool for teaching with a kinesthetic approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
