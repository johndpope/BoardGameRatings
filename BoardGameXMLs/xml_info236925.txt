							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dust 1947: Battle for Zverograd</name>
									
			<description>The year is 1947, and World War II is far from over! Thanks to the discovery of a crashed ship from outer space, Germany acquired access to advanced technology. New armament and VK-propelled walkers lumber on the battlefield. Discover a world in which soldiers use conventional rifles next to lasers and jet packs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dust 1947 is a hybrid of board and miniature games. Using high quality plastic figurines, players fight over a special mat divided into squares. Checking line of sight, movement, or weapon ranges is easy and intuitive thanks to light and clear rules. On the other hand the game offers a great tactical depth and wide range of possibilities when you create your fighting force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dust 1947: Battle for Zverograd is a two-player starter set for Dust 1947 that also serves as a standalone game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
