There is one problem, though. The princess has been kidnapped by a dangerous dragon Fortunately, something good comes out of this situation too. This is the ultimate chance for the courageous warriors to make a good impression on the princess. That is why they go to battle to save the princess. Because only one of them can marry the lady, the knights do everything whithin their power to make life miserable for one another. This whole spectacle is watched by a very critical royal family. The knights really work their heads off to win the sympathy of the family. They will most certainly put in a good word for them with the princess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the game:&lt;br/&gt;The players are knights.
