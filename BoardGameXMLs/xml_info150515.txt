							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Synanthropes (Revised)</name>
									
			<description>From the &amp;quot;About&amp;quot; page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synanthropes is a story game about representatives of the known sentient races of planet Earth: the Crows, the Rats, the Roaches, the Cane Toads, the Geckos, and the Raccoons. Collectively, they may be referred to as the Synanthropes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometime in the future, somewhere between twenty-five and one hundred years from today, humanity disappeared, for reasons unknown. Some time after that, synanthropes&amp;mdash;those animals who live in ecological niches that humans created&amp;mdash;evolved, becoming intelligent communities in their own right, aware that they live in Humanity&amp;rsquo;s cast-off ruins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play representatives of these groups, each player from a different species, who are joining together on a scientific expedition. It&amp;rsquo;s the first major cross-species undertaking since the end of the Resource Wars: there is a building, a skyscraper in the center of an otherwise abandoned wasteland, which has never been explored by any of your people. Your mission is simple: make your way to the top, collecting information and any useful Human Artifacts which have survived these centuries, and maybe, if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky, an answer to the question which has haunted the Synanthropes for as long as they&amp;rsquo;ve realized that there was a civilization before them: Where did the Humans go, anyway?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But be warned... the peace among your species is a fragile thing and the Wars weren&amp;rsquo;t just about resources, but about utter cultural incompatibility as well. Your species are just different. Your mission is as much about trust as discovery, and if it&amp;rsquo;s a failure, then quicker tempers among your people may once again call for war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
