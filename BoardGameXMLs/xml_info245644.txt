			<description>The kobolds are running wild, pilfering Maurice's favorite toys, and even his beloved gem collection! Though only simple fake gems, they sparkle so wonderfully that the kobolds must have them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Kobold, the players send their kobolds to collect toys and gems, gaining points for them during and at the end of the game. But Maurice is hot on the trail of the little rascals with his flashlight: If a kobold is caught by its light beam (which is part of the clever 3D set-up), it takes to its heels as fast as it can. Whoever most skillfully avoids the light beam and collects the greatest number of points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
