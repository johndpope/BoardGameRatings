			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We RPG game masters have a lot of tools to help us run our roleplaying games. Our monster books and bestiaries give us piles of foes to throw at our adventurers. The various guides for game masters often give us non-player characters, treasures, and story-building tips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the hardest parts of game mastering, however, is coming up with interesting adventure locations for our characters to explore. These locations need to be fantastic, detailed places that capture the minds of our players every session we run. Good locations are hard to improvise and often hard to strip out of a fully-fleshed-out adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sly Flourish&amp;rsquo;s Fantastic Locations is a book, available in PDF and print-on-demand, that gives you twenty system-agnostic locations to drop into your favorite fantasy roleplaying game. Each location builds on a fantastic theme, such as a mysterious ancient structure under the ice, a cursed castle of a mad king, a fallen celestial fortress, and a dwarven mine that cracked into the tomb of a dead god. Each location includes artwork by Brian Patterson of D20Monkey. Sometimes this artwork takes the form of maps. Sometimes it's an overlook of a specific location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These sites and structures aren&amp;rsquo;t full adventures. Instead, you and your players build your own stories in these fantastic locations, then you populate them with the monsters that fit your story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
