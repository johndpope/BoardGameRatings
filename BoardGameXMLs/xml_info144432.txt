			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; VAPORWARE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is stuck in the development limbo known as Vaporware. Few to no details have been released about about its gameplay, plot, or release date since its announcement many years ago. It may or may not be in active development, but neither has it been cancelled officially.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep Down is a single-player game with the option to have up to four players in co-op multiplayer, akin to that of Dark Souls, with random players dropping into the player's world to help them defeat monsters and find artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player perspective for Deep Down begins in New York City in the year 2094. By touching magical artifacts, players are teleported into the distant past to explore dungeons and avoid or battle monsters and seek treasure. Each of these dungeons are randomly generated for each player. As well as this, the artifacts you touch correspond to an emotion, including anger, rage, hate, envy, lust and wrath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Deep Down (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
