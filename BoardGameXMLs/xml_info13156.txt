			<description>This is a Swedish Monopoly-clone from the 1950's, judging by the look of it.&lt;br/&gt; Players take turns making &amp;quot;launch attempts&amp;quot; using the spinner, which determines their destination in the Sol planetary system. Unless a player has already bought the destination, it may then be purchased using &amp;quot;space fuel&amp;quot;. &lt;br/&gt;When all planets/moons in a set are owned by a player, he or she may construct space stations which increases the amount of space fuel paid by other players landing at said station. There are also the equivalent of &amp;quot;chance&amp;quot; cards, which are written in sort of a pulpy SF style as befits the theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are eliminated when they run out of fuel, thus eventually determining the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
