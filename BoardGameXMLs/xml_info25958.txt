			<description>East-German cycling game. Each player controls a team of 4 cyclists. The game is not dice controlled and not with cards either. In fact it has quite a tactical system, the rules are quite simple but don't depend on luck. Per turn each cyclist can use either 3,4,5 or 6 action points to move the same number of squares (each number can be used only once). There can't be more than one rider on a square (except the blue ones), so riders can eventually be blocked. The red marks are intermediate sprints, where 4 points are awarded to the winner. The blue squares are punctures. There are also bonus points for a cyclists who helps another cyclist (for example after a puncture), this bonus is added because of 'comradely behavior' (the communist regime clearly showing here). At the end of the race every cyclist gets points (80 for the winner, 76 for the second,...). Now the players add up the finishing-points and bonus points of their 4 cyclist to determine who wins the game. The board (58*32cms.) looks surprisingly beautiful and well designed for an East-German game, the cyclist are also well produced, in plastic. Nice vintage game for collectors of sports games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
