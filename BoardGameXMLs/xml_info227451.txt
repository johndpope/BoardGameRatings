							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spring Coming Baseball</name>
									
			<description>Spring Coming Baseball is a fast play statistical replay game by Roberto Chiavini (but not so fast, as you roll for each inning for each team, to get the number of hits and run for each inning), with individual yearbook for a huge plethora of leagues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teams are rated for Offense and Defense, and the total of the two ratings are combined to highlight a column on the Hits grid.  A roll of two six sided dice, potentially modified by a roll of the ten sided &amp;quot;Third Die&amp;quot;, produces a number of hits for the half inning being played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, for each hit, a percentile roll versus the batting team's Conversion Percentage is made determining whether that hit produces a run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Repeating this process for each half inning, individual games can be played in minutes, and seasons (or post-seasons) in a single sitting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic game comes with a rulebook and the 12 seasons of the All American Girls League, 1943-54.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following yearbooks are also available: &lt;br/&gt;American Association, 1946, 1947 and 1948&lt;br/&gt;Big South League 1996 and 1997&lt;br/&gt;Canadian Baseball League 2003&lt;br/&gt;Dixie Association 1971&lt;br/&gt;Federal League 1914 and 1915&lt;br/&gt;Inter American League 1979&lt;br/&gt;International League 1965 and 1966&lt;br/&gt;Lone Star League 1977&lt;br/&gt;Mexican League 1955&lt;br/&gt;National Association 1871, 1872, 1873, 1874 and 1875&lt;br/&gt;North American League 2011 and 2012&lt;br/&gt;Pacific Coast League 1952, 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956 and 1957&lt;br/&gt;Pecos League 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016&lt;br/&gt;South Atlantic League 1963&lt;br/&gt;South Coast League 2007&lt;br/&gt;Texas League 1950, 1951 and 1952&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
