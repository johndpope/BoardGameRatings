			<description>&amp;quot;An Action Game . . . Encounter Alien Starfighters and Mysteries of Deep Space Flight.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This simple colorful children's game is built into a small hardcover book that opens to display a pop-up backdrop and everything you will need to play the game. The rules are printed on the back cover, but the game can be opened and closed without disturbing play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is because the playing pieces are bound into the book and rotate around the gameboard, a handy feature that also keeps them from getting lost. The game also uses a spinner to regulates movement and a &amp;quot;Scanner Wheel&amp;quot; to resolve Red Alerts (events) and attacks on Alien Starfighters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Wanderer Book &amp;quot;Take Along Game&amp;quot; from Simon and Schuster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
