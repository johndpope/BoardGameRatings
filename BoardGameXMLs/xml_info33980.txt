			<description>Simple roll-and-move game designed to educate children on the morals of courtship.&lt;br/&gt;Now stands as a museum piece both in the National Library of Australia, where it is dated &amp;quot;c1905&amp;quot;, and in the National Archives of Australia, where it is dated 1909 based a copyright registration record by the designer.&lt;br/&gt;In the latter it is part of a National Archives display entitled The Games We Played, which features a dozen games form the same publisher and designer from around the early 20th century.&lt;br/&gt;From the display notes: &amp;quot;...some of the favourite sports of the time - yachting, horse racing, cricket and tennis - were cleverly packaged for parlour play. Even more serious matters - such as not offending your prospective in-laws or getting through to the right number at the telephone exchange - could all be managed with the lucky toss of the dice. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;All these board games were designed by Christopher George King of the National Games Company, a man who obviously had a real creative bent.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;His moral sense is also evident in Snakes and Ladders where traits such as anger and avarice send you tumbling down the board while kindness and obedience are duly rewarded...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
