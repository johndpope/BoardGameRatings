			<description>From back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cold War is over. Bush&amp;rsquo;s War is winding down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You were a shadowy soldier in those fights, trained to move through the secret world: deniable and deadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then you got out, or you got shut out, or you got burned out. You didn&amp;rsquo;t come in from the cold. Instead, you found your own entrances into Europe&amp;rsquo;s clandestine networks of power and crime. You did a few ops, and you asked even fewer questions. Who gave you that job in Prague? Who paid for your silence in that Swiss account? You told yourself it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It turned out to matter a lot. Because it turned out you were working for vampires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vampires exist. What can they do? Who do they own? Where is safe? You don&amp;rsquo;t know those answers yet. So you&amp;rsquo;d better start asking questions. You have to trace the bloodsuckers&amp;rsquo; operations, penetrate their networks, follow their trail, and target their weak points. Because if you don&amp;rsquo;t hunt them, they will hunt you. And they will kill you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night&amp;rsquo;s Black Agents brings the GUMSHOE engine to the spy thriller genre, combining the propulsive paranoia of movies like Ronin and The Bourne Identity with supernatural horror straight out of Bram Stoker. Investigation is crucial, but it never slows down the action, which explodes with expanded options for bone-crunching combat, high-tech tradecraft, and adrenaline-fueled chases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Four distinct styles of play - Burn, Dust, Mirror and Stakes, lets you set the level of betrayal, grit and action in your game.&lt;br/&gt;     Four different Vampire types - Supernatural, Damned, Alien and Mutant&lt;br/&gt;     New rules for Cherries, car chases, and stats for spy tech and weaponry&lt;br/&gt;     A highly detailed background on settings, from a black-program prison in Lithuania to the the crumbling rooftops of Prague's Old Town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Updating classic Gothic terrors for the postmodern age, Night&amp;rsquo;s Black Agents presents thoroughly modular monstrosity: GMs can build their own vampires, mashup their own minions, kitbash their own conspiracies to suit their personal sense of style and story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rack silver bullets in your Glock, twist a UV bulb in your Maglite, keep watching the mirrors ... and pray you've got your vampire stories straight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;this is the Dragonmeet Special Edition&lt;br/&gt;without interior art and is not the final release&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
