			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fall of Eagles is to some extent a companion to our Imperial Wars sets, which enable players to recreate colonial actions in the nineteenth century. Fall of Eagles shifts the scene from Queen Victoria's little wars to the major conflicts in Europe itself. The rules are designed to allow wargamers to taste the flavour of formal warfare in the nineteenth century.  It is a period which saw great changes in both the political make-up of Europe and the technology of warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer has defined both the ground scale (and consequently, the figure basing parameters):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Figure Scale: 1 figure = 50 men (infantry and cavalry)&lt;br/&gt;Ground Scale: 1cm = 20 yds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules include army lists for the period's major powers, as well as a points system to allow for ahistorical battles to be fought between roughly equivalent forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
