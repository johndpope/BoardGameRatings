			<description>A simple track game designed and illustrated by Jessie MacQueen Mackintosh (1892&amp;ndash;1958). In the game, Mackintosh used not only Aboriginal motifs, but also illustrations of traditional Aboriginal life and cultural events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being a roll and move game, there are plenty of special spaces and you must obey them if you end your move on one. Special spaces include No. 5 Dig for honey ants &amp;mdash; miss a turn? No. 13 Throw boomerang &amp;mdash; run to the emu space; No. 45 Pointing bone &amp;mdash; you are knocked out of the game; No. 87 Lost churinga (shield), go back to No. 71&amp;rsquo;. And so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The explanatory notes that accompany the game are an attempt to broaden the knowledge of the players about indigenous culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I cannot be absolutely certain but it would appear the game was never boxed (highly plausible in the 40's after the war).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
