			<description>Publisher Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the bowels of the dankest dungeons come all of the elements necessary for the most challenging foray into excitement you've ever seen on your TRS-80! The object of the game is to take a character of your own creation through an awesome 99 separate levels of dungeons. Along the way, you'll come face to fang with a myriad of malevolent monsters -- but for the stout of heart, pure of soul, and, occasionally, the fleet of foot, there is wealth to be had -- and lots of it, too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No detail has been overlooked! Purchase your supplies -- weaponry, foodstuff, magicks, and armor -- then outfit a character of your own design for entry into the dungeon itself. The player has TOTAL control over dozens of variables, including character creation, dungeon levels, the buying AND selling of supplies (one may need to finance one's next dungeon adventure!), and dungeon/character saving for later play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Certainly one of the most exciting fantasy programs ever devised for the TRS-80. If you've grown tired of arcade-type fare, then perhaps it's time to enter a world where you can live the fantastic. HIDDEN VALLEY -- you may never want to leave. Skill Level: Advanced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Marc B.
