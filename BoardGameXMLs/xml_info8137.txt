			<description>A very early offering from Games Workshop, and apparently an ancestor of what would become Warhammer 40,000, Spacefarers is &amp;quot;a set of science fiction skirmish rules designed specifically for the Spacefarers range of figures manufactured by Citadel Miniatures Ltd... The rules have been designed for two players to carry out small scale skirmishes with each player in control of a unit of Imperial Marines, Dark Disciples, Star Patrolmen, or independent gangs.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the rules are pretty standard tabletop miniature skirmish rules.  Each unit may move a certain number of inches per turn, may fire a ranged weapon, and/or engage in close combat with models in close proximity.  No grid is used for movement, a ruler is used to measure linear distances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the massive armies sported by the game's descendants, Spacefarers focuses on single squads, and allows for more detail, such as rudimentary hit location, along with different armor protection for each location, and individually equipped models.  The game appears to have much more in common with games like Necromunda or Mordheim in this respect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are short, only 44 pages, with sparse hand-drawn artwork; not a single photograph is used.  Two introductory scenarios are included, rules are included for constructing your own forces.  Depending on which force you choose to represent, you get a certain amount of &amp;quot;money&amp;quot; to use to buy equipment, and the rules indicate how large your squad will be (in one case, it's random!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
