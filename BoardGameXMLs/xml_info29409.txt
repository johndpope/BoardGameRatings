							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Nurturing Game</name>
									
			<description>[From the Publisher:] The Nurturing Game teaches adults and children to express their feelings, to become aware of themselves and others, to use their personal power in positive ways, to praise, to use gentle touch, and to get along with others.&lt;br/&gt;Animals, the earth, and the elements have been portrayed on the game board as symbolic of a world where despite size, color, and capabilities, everyone and everything is accepted.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the nurturing game is to begin along the two tracks that lead children and adults to a world of hugs, togetherness and rainbows. Along the way, players will get a chance to express their feelings, increase their self awareness, learn to use their personal power in positive ways, practice using gentle touch, and offer words of praise to themselves and others. The game ends when everyone meets at the rainbow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
