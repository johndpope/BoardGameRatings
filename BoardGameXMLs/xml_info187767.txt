							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Masha and the Bear: Trouble in the Garden</name>
									
			<description>Masha and Bear lavish care and attention on the fruit and vegetables in their garden: the strawberries, raspberries, carrots and all the other healthy delicacies. They love picking them and nibbling on them. But what&amp;rsquo;s THAT? Every night, uninvited guests get amongst the beds and help themselves to the fruit and vegetables. Who on earth can it be? Get your thinking caps on and start guessing!&lt;br/&gt;Who knows which animal is going to cause havoc in Masha and the Bear&amp;rsquo;s garden next? The player to guess correctly the most times can advance his figure the furthest, and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player selects one animal card. Each player places the selected animal card face-down in front of them. The other three animal cards are put to one side, also face-down.&lt;br/&gt;Once all the players have decided on one animal and have put down the animal card in front of them, face-down, the youngest player takes the shaker, shakes it vigorously and then tips all the chips out onto the table. The chips must be separated such that the top side of the chip is clearly recognised.&lt;br/&gt;Now each player turns their selected animal card face-up and compares it: How many animal chips can you see that show the same animal as depicted on your own card? You are allowed to move your figure precisely the same amount of fields up the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player whose figure is the first to reach the final field is the&lt;br/&gt;winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
