							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Top Gun: Guts and Glory</name>
									
			<description>This video game is loosely based on the Top Gun movie starring Tom Cruise. Essentially controlling an modern U.S. Air Force jet through ten treacherous levels, players must take out enemy jet fighters in addition to intimidating battleships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aircraft that can be chosen are the F-14 Tomcat, the F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighter, the Soviet-made MiG-29 Fulcrum and the F-16 Falcon. Players can either dedicated themselves to a long career mode, engage in a quick air combat session, or go on a bombing run that would test the nerves of any modern Air Force pilot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Passwords help to store the player's progress while in career mode. The player can only see and fight against two enemy aircraft at a time due to the various limitations found on the original Game Boy system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Top Gun: Guts and Glory&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
