							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chronicles of Arax: Solo Adventure Game</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Arax is a world filled with blood and battle, magic and monsters, slaughter and sorcery. It is a world where the weak are crushed and the strong survive, where those who are bigger and more powerful bully those who are weaker and more vulnerable. It is a world in need of a Hero, someone who can stand against the darkness and fight on behalf of the downtrodden. A Hero like YOU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chronicles of Arax is a game where you, the reader, takes on the role of a Hero in the world of Arax. It is your job to fight against evil and injustice, to undertake various Quests to further the goals of good, and hopefully get some fame and loot in the bargain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Arax is a dark and dangerous world, and death will await you at each turn. The ancient empires of men, dwarfs and elves are crumbling, beset on all sides by the dark hordes of the orcs, goblins, demons and the undead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The once magnificent elven forests, at one time beautiful, green and lush, are now withering and dying, the magically-crafted towers and wondrous tree-cities that lie within broken and shattered. Only the elven talent at manipulating mana, the magical force that permeates Arax, has stopped their race from being wiped out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dwarven fortresses built high in the mountains of Arax are now overrun with goblins, who burrowed up through the earth and attacked from within the otherwise impenetrable fortress walls. One by one the fortresses fall and, although the dwarven courage and skill with weapons is legendary, even they find themselves overwhelmed by the sheer number of goblins pouring in to their homes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And humanity find themselves sorely pressed on all sides, their cities and towns constantly raided and besieged. The barbaric orc tribes march down from the north, pillaging everything in their path. The necromantic legions from the southern desert kingdoms shamble forward, unrelenting in their march towards the human lands. Some humans even turn against their own, worshipping demonic powers in secret and plotting the downfall of their race from within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But all is not lost. Many Heroes have arisen in these dark times, men and women, human, elf and dwarf, each of them seeking to turn back the tide of darkness that threatens to engulf Arax. Will you be one of these Heroes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What You Need To Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a few things you will need to have handy in order to play the game. First and foremost is a copy of these rules. You may print these rules for your own use, and even give them to friends and family if you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need a set of polyhedral dice. This means you need a d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20 (check out the glossary if you are not sure what this means). Some pens and paper are also necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need a copy of the character sheet found at the end of these rules as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, you may wish to purchase some premium content for Chronicles of Arax. This content, available for $1 each, includes things like new Hero types, new Quests, new tables and charts and much, much more. All of this is optional however; you can play the game simply with these rules!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
