							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Night of the Rise</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Night of the Rise is a unique adventure that offers the party an alternative to the &amp;quot;hack &amp;amp; slash&amp;quot; approach. The opportunity for role play is high and it is sure to tap into skills and abilities most of your characters never knew they possessed. Not only does it offer a new experience for your players, but hopefully it has them smiling several times during the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A request to deal with a bandit captain named Giles Ne'Ville sends the adventuring party on a two-day journey. During this journey, they find an entertaining way to deal with this Giles Ne'Ville. Will they use this opportunity? Or will they take the typical 'hack &amp;amp; slash' approach to dealing with villans?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Night of the Rise is an engaging adventure written for a party of four or more characters of 1st-6th level, with recommendations for higher level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximate runtime is 3+ hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
