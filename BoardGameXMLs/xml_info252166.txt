			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A horizontally scrolling typical shoot'em-up, Star Sabre is a modern homebrew release for the Amstrad CPC. The game was first released by the retro publisher Cronosoft in 2008, and then 2 years later by Psytronik. Those previous versions were for the 128K expanded Amstrad. In 2016, the game saw a third release, for both original 64K and 128K Amstrad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;2384AD. Mankind has extensively colonised several hundred planetary systems after the development of a space folding drive. While the ruins of extraterrestrial civilizations are discovered, they have all long since passed into history.  Humanity finds itself alone in the galaxy, with no option but to pick over the bones of these ancient otherworldly peoples, in order to learn about them, and why they disappeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a routine survey mission at the edge of explored space in your S922 Sabre scout craft, you briefly pick up a distress signal from a nearby Xeno-archaeological site. Locking in the coordinates, the folding drive kicks in and delivers you to a scene of devastation! Vessels of unknown origin are raining destruction upon the outpost, so while it appears mankind's isolation is at an end, it seems the task has fallen to you to blast these new galactic neighbours into the history books!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits&lt;br/&gt;Paul Kooistra: Game Code and Graphics&lt;br/&gt;Targhan: Sound Code and Music&lt;br/&gt;Matthew van Rooijen: Loading screen art&lt;br/&gt;Sylvestre: Loading screen pixel art&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
