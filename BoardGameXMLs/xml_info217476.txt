							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of Saipan 1944</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Late in the Second World War the Japanese found themselves on the defensive against their numerous American foes. In 1944 the Island of Saipan became the American's next target. From Saipan long range B-29's could bomb the Japanese mainland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stakes were high. The player commands the American forces trying to take the island away from the Japanese which are controlled by the artificial intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was created by Joni Nuutinen as part of the Conflict-Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
