			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mists of Akuma is an eastern fantasy noir steampunk campaign setting for D&amp;amp;D 5th Edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ages past the imperial dragons of Soburin were undisputed masters of the land, sea, and sky, lording over the races of the realms with iron claws. Only the combined might of the legendary Imperial Siblings proved powerful enough to cow the majestic serpents and since then they have become elusive things of myth. With the fall of the Kengen Occupation and the renewed infighting of the great clans however, rumors of their reappearance have begun to circulate among the settlements at the edge of civilization&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this FREE PDF sample for Mists of Akuma, you&amp;rsquo;ll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A brief history of the imperial dragons of Soburin, how they differ from their traditional draconic kin, and whom they hate more than even the clan lords.&lt;br/&gt;    A wyrmling underworld dragon, a deadly challenge rating 6 monster.&lt;br/&gt;    The adult underworld dragon, a fearfully lethal serpentine challenge rating 12 threat.&lt;br/&gt;    Hakanokishi, ancient underworld dragon and potent adversary (with a challenge rating of 18).&lt;br/&gt;    A full page map of the continent of Soburin by cartographer Michael McCarthy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
