							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Armageddon War: Special Dice</name>
									
			<description>These are THREE special dice that can be substituted for regular Armageddon War dice while playing. These are NOT needed to play Armageddon War. Here's the scoop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This is a set of 3 dice, one in each color. They will have a different color ink than the normal dice so you can tell them apart).&lt;br/&gt;     You can choose to substitute one or more of these dice on your roll.&lt;br/&gt;     Red die (measured fire die) - Takes the best attacker faces (star-star and star-star-shield) and replaces it with star-symbol and star-shield-symbol. If you roll the face with the special symbol, you remove 1 action step from the attacker after combat. This means the attacker would not have an action step after firing, or would take 1 less damage from any counterfire. However, this is at the cost of doing 1 less strike to the target you were shooting at.&lt;br/&gt;     Black die (suppression die) - Takes the best attacker faces (star-star and star-shield) and replaces it with star-symbol and shield-symbol. If you roll the face with the special symbol, it does 1 strike to a different unit in the same hex as the original target.&lt;br/&gt;     Green die (shoot &amp;amp; scoot die) - Replaces the star faces (there are two) with a symbol and makes two faces with 1 shield instead of 1 face with 2 shields. If you roll the face with the symbol, you may retreat 1 hex away from the defender after the attack resolves, and this does not count as an extra action step.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
