							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Box of Spiders</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;If you start with a box of spiders, pretty soon you're left with one mean looking spider.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BoS is played with a standard deck of playing cards, including two jokers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal the cards into  6x9 grid; this forms the playing area.  Number cards should be dealt face-up.  Picture cards and jokers should be dealt face down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Standard 2 player game:&lt;br/&gt;- Player 1 has the red number cards (red spiders)&lt;br/&gt;- Player 2 has the black number cards (black spiders)&lt;br/&gt;- Court cards and jokers are flies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn consists of a player making a capture:&lt;br/&gt;- The player moves a spider of their colour over any number of friendly pieces and empty spaces onto any fly or an enemy spider of equal or lower value.&lt;br/&gt;- Movement is orthogonal only &lt;br/&gt;- If no capture is posible, the player must pass&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When both players pass, the game ends.  Players score 1 point for each remaining spider of their colour, and 1 point for each captured card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3-4 player rules:&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets the number cards in 1 suit.  In a 3 player game, there will be a neutral colour of spider.  These do not move, but can be captured according to the normal rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
