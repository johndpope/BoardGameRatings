							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mutant Chess</name>
									
			<description>Mutant Chess is a chess variant where the pieces mutate throughout the game. Higher ranked pieces (like queens) can split up and become lower ranked pieces. Lower ranked pieces (like pawns) can combine to become more powerful. The only piece that can't change its status is the King. Mutant Chess is played on a slightly smaller board and there have been some modification to the pieces, but the basic chess game is still the heart of this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
