			<description>&amp;quot;Sometimes success has nothing to do with skill.&amp;quot; - Anonymous (as quoted on the front of the box)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Object of the Game&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to move up the corporate ladder to the penthouse suite and become the Chief Executive Officer of the company.&lt;br/&gt;(from the rules pamphlet)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is essentially a roll-and-move race, with event cards and money and other twists to make it a bit more interesting.  Instead of rolling the die to determine how far you move, the roll determines which deck of cards you draw from:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 Job Performance&lt;br/&gt;2 Education and Experience&lt;br/&gt;3 Misfortune&lt;br/&gt;4 Personal Life&lt;br/&gt;5 Connections&lt;br/&gt;6 Fortune&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the card determines your move, usually by giving you a choice.  For example, here is a card from the &amp;quot;Personal Life&amp;quot; deck: &amp;quot;You suddenly get hit with two paternity suits.  Collect (2) enemychips and move back (3) or pay $2500.&amp;quot;  Here's one from &amp;quot;Connections&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Your boss' spouse takes a liking to you at a company picnic.  Move up (2) or collect $500 and two friendchips.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most turns you'll have to make a decision as to how to best balance your forward progress with your money, friends, and enemies.  Friend chips are awarded for various &amp;quot;friendly&amp;quot; events, and Enemy chips are earned for all the people you had to step on to raise yourself up.  Friendchips can be turned into $250 each if you can't otherwise make loan payments, or they can be used to move up one extra space.  Enemy chips can be bought off for $500, and you can't enter the CEO's office (and win the game) unless you have more friendchips than enemychips.  You also must enter the CEO's office by exact count, so it helps to have friendchips to adjust you movement as needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, certain squares landed on indicate that a card from the &amp;quot;Outside Influence&amp;quot; deck is drawn.  These cards affect all players.  These events may refer to the department indicated on the board spaces.  The departments are &amp;quot;Sales,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Accounting,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Data Processing,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Manager,&amp;quot; etc.  A card from the Outside Influence deck is: &amp;quot;A new simulator increases the productivity of the Technical Department.  All technical staff move up (3).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
