			<description>&amp;quot;The Great Northern War (1700 - 1721) was a military struggle between Sweden on one side, and Russia, Denmark, and Saxony-Poland on the other.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In 1708 Charles XII launched an invasion of Russia, determined to capture Moscow and force the Tsar to accept a peace treaty that favored Sweden. Peter the Great ordered a 'scorched earth' policy to deny supplies to the Swedish invaders.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In September of 1708 Tsar Peter learned that a Swedish force protecting their supply train was separated from Charles XII and the main Swedish army. He pounced. Peter lead a flying column to attack the Swedes while the main part of his army blocked Charles' path to Moscow. The battle took place near the village of Lesnaya.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the fast play rules are relatively straightforward, they still manage to encompass a number of historical aspects that affected the battle. The rules cover unit formations, terrain, charges, morale, commanders, and differences in the battle tactics of the Russian Dragoons and Swedish cavalry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
