			<description>Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At four am the lone bugler stirred. He could lie still in the Texas cold no longer. He arose and faced the forbidding walls 250 yards away. A call to arms burst forth from his bugle, and was joined by the cry of &amp;quot;Viva Santa Anna&amp;quot; from a thousand hoarse throats. Massed infantry columns charged the dark fortress and their feet sounded a drum roll to accompany the now blaring Duegello. No quarter, death to the infidels. There would be no prisoners taken today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside the walls, 182 men stoically faced the thousands. There was no fear in this place. They had already chosen death rather than retreat. Suddenly, from a dozen or more positions, the defender's cannon roared to life and bathe the famous fortress in an eerie light. The siege of the Alamo was over, the battle of the Alamo had begun...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There can be no surrender... &lt;br/&gt;GOD AND TEXAS!&lt;br/&gt;VICTORY OR DEATH!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;scale&lt;br/&gt;-squad level&lt;br/&gt;-5/15 yrds per hex&lt;br/&gt;-30 seconds per faction per turn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;command&lt;br/&gt;-command the texian or mexican forces in the final assault on the alamo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;variants&lt;br/&gt;-mexican attack force size&lt;br/&gt;-texian reinforcement (gonzales and goliad)&lt;br/&gt;-mexican assault column allocation&lt;br/&gt;-morale base and breaking points&lt;br/&gt;-arms and munition levels &lt;br/&gt;-base fortress defense levels&lt;br/&gt;-gun powder quality&lt;br/&gt;-assault detection range&lt;br/&gt;-fog of war&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;play&lt;br/&gt;-quick turn based, pbem capable&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;system&lt;br/&gt;-Win 95/98/00/Me/XP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
