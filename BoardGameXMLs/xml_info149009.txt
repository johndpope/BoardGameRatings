			<description>Publisher's Description: &lt;br/&gt;How do you think a compass is related to fried eggs? What does a roller skate have to do with a ballerina? It&amp;rsquo;s up to you! This game (for both adults and kids) inspires you to come up with creative connections between seemingly unrelated things. Pluck objects from the bag and imagine an association&amp;mdash;poetic, practical, serious, or silly&amp;mdash;to reveal hidden webs of meaning and surprising details about how you perceive the world. There are no wrong answers&amp;mdash;only intriguing ideas. Be pensive. Be spontaneous. The setup and rules are simple. The possibilities are infinite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1 Two Sided Game Board&lt;br/&gt;     1 Drawstring Bag&lt;br/&gt;     85 Object Chips&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup:&lt;br/&gt;Choose one side of the board to play on, the blue (easier) or green (harder).  Provide slips of paper and writing instruments to the players.  Each player draws 3 object chips, face up, from the draw bag.  The youngest player chooses one object chip blindly from the bag and places it in the center of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;Each round, one player (the curator) places an object chip on the board, connected to a previously played object chip.  Other players take three minutes to privately choose an association between the object and the others to which it is connected on the board, writing it on a slip of paper.  When three minutes are up, the curator shuffles and reads the examples aloud.  Each player, except the curator, votes on the best connection, drawing one object chip blindly for each vote received.  The role of curator then moves to the next player counterclockwise.  When all players have served as curator, the player with the most objects is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An alternate &amp;quot;cooperative&amp;quot; ruleset is provided for a puzzle activity experience, placing pieces on the board and attempting to make compelling associations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
