			<description>From the website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primitive is an easy to learn game about the birth of human society. It's a fast-paced adventure game in a time that never was. Hunt dinosaurs, climb volcanoes, run from brutal prehistoric lizard people, the choices you make are yours alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your friends will create a tribe of proto-humans. It is from this tribe that your characters are drawn. This focuses play on the group and not just the individual. The society is more important than any one participant; the whole greater than all of its parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beset on all sides by danger, peril, and often a constant fight for survival, your characters are also faced with a struggle from within, the internal battle between savagery and civility. Will you succumb to your animal instincts or will you strive for something more enlightened? Will you cower in fear or will you summon the courage of the beast inside you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As if all this wasn't enough, one more great challenge faces your band of cave people. The characters in Primitive are are pre-verbal, and may only communicate to each other with grunts, gestures, and props. Watch as your play group develops language organically through play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An amazing experience that draws together a group of players like no other game, Primitive is a game you will want to play again and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be civil, or will you be savage?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
