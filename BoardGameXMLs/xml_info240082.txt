							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Time of Legends: Joan of Arc â€“ Village Pack</name>
									
			<description>The box full of lovely terrain to expand your games.&lt;br/&gt;This Terrain Pack builds on the small village you get in the core box, with a total of 52 extra terrain pieces! These include another large farmhouse and 3 new cottages to help fix the village housing crisis. On the outskirts you can see the 5 old ruins of the houses that were burned down five years ago in the English raid.&lt;br/&gt;We have 12 unique, double-sided hex tiles including a collection of river tiles to add this important terrain feature to your games. And, because we now have rivers, we have bridges (1 stone and 2 wooden) to span them, and a water mill sitting beside it to grind the flour for the villagers&amp;rsquo; daily baguettes.&lt;br/&gt;And two more scenarios besides.&lt;br/&gt;Speaking of villagers, we&amp;rsquo;ve got a wealthy merchant, a fine princess, a young peasant lady, a blacksmith, and an apothecary to join in your scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;We also included the pieces to make a small camp, with 8 tents around 3 campfires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
