			<description>The Bertin was an East Indiaman used for long&amp;ndash;distance trading during the eighteenth century. She was later converted into a ship of the line, taking advantage of her design, already suitable for a warship. When, in 1770, she was commissioned into the French Marine Royale, under King Louis XVI, her armament was doubled &amp;ndash; Bertin became a fourth rate with 56 guns and a crew of more than 300 men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ship pack can also be used to represent the French ex&amp;ndash;merchant ship &amp;ldquo;Berryer 1759(1770)&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ship pack contains a new ship with base, ship card, ship log, and specific deck of maneuver cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
