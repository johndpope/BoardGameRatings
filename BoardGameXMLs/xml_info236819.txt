			<description>A Two-Round Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are all part of a &amp;lsquo;gang&amp;rsquo; of orphans and misfits who have decided that you would not sit back and let the world have its way with you any longer. You all want to make something of yourselves, and have begun to take the first steps necessary to walk that path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thramnar, the gnomish junk dealer who resides in the south section of the Rat Hills dump, offered you all a job collecting &amp;lsquo;usable&amp;rsquo; junk in the depth of the dump on the outskirts of Waterdeep several months ago, and he has always been happy with your finds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the course of your scavenging earlier, you found a peculiar Dragon Amulet and took it to Thramnar to appraise. He offered you each the usual finder&amp;rsquo;s fee: 2 silver pieces each as compensation, as well as an additional gold piece bonus if you would deliver the amulet to Kerenkos the Sage at Gelfuril the Trader&amp;rsquo;s shop. And that is exactly what you had intended to do. Unfortunately, it hadn&amp;rsquo;t been quite that easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It took a little doing, and the resolution of a few problems along the way, but now the amulet has been delivered safely into the hands of the dwarven sage, Kerenkos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
