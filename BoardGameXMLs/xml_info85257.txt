			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2010 will prove to be an exciting year in the Renewal campaign given the outcome of some of the difficult challenges the players faced last year. The ongoing campaign has many new twists and turns with some familiar friends and foes as well as new and unexpected ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interaction between the Faction nation groups remains vibrant and active and some of the actions of the previous season are sure to resonate this year. In its entirety the Renewal campaign continues to provide a rich and detailed number of plot lines for players to become involved in whatever their individual motives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year sees us using a new site and one with great potential for the future. We hope you will all enjoy your experience there and be sure to give us useful feedback. Changes in some of the faction command teams will bring fresh impetus to the factions and continue to develop the factions presence within the campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This booklet contains all the necessary information for booking and attending Curious Pastimes events for this year. As ever we ask that you read them carefully as the majority of the out of character information you require to attend our events is contained within. The rest is on our web site (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.curiouspastimes.co.uk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.curiouspastimes.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;), or available in print from the office and the Game Organisation Desk at events. Experienced players should also read them, and make sure things still work the way they think they do! In character rules are published in a separate volume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
