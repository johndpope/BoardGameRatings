							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sting Game</name>
									
			<description>You have just landed on Teaser's Lucky Casino; its token is valued at 20 million. You quickly take a deal card and give it a sly glance. Is the deal card worth millions or is it a worthless Sting Card? Nobody knows except you! The tension mounts as you place both the token and the card on the gameboard. As the Sting Man, you open the bidding with 10 million... the other players are confused... are you bluffing, or does the deal have a real value? They all pass. You make your final bid... 120 million. The next player sense a Sting Card... he challenges; the following player thinks you bid too high... he challenges; the last player pauses... 121 million... he wants the deal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A grin crosses your face as you are handed 121 million in cash. Slowly the deal card is turned over... it's a Sting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have to be a shrewd Sting Man to make the wildest deals and get away with it... or be sharp enough to uncover a Sting to receive the big payoff. If you work your deals with skill and finesse, you'll build the largest fortune and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
