P. Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s Dreamlands, and the Cthulhu Mythos Comes to vivid life once more In this Swords and Sorcery supplement For any Fantasy Role-Playing Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the peerless works of Lord Dunsany, from my surreptitious campaign notes they come at last:  the secret Gods, Monsters, and Heroes who inspired the very foundation of the World of Castle Oldskull.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How was the world created?  Who created it?  Who were the first gods?  Where did Odin and Zeus and Ra and all of the other sacred children come from?  What is the meaning of mortal life?  What is the lost mystery of the progeny of Yog-Sothoth?  Who are the invading minions of Azathoth and Nyarlathotep and Great Cthulhu, and how will the irrevocable Apocalypse end the world?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn all of that and more herein, in my years-long expansion of the phantasmagorian dream tome which inspired Borges, Del Toro, Gaiman, Gygax, Howard, Lovecraft, Moorcock, Smith, Tolkien, Vance and many more:  Lord&amp;rsquo;s Dunsany&amp;rsquo;s fabled world of wonder, re-sculpted by me as the firmament for your epic Swords and Sorcery campaign:  the PEGANA MYTHOS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a massive compendium of monsters, gods, magic items, treasures, lands, mega-dungeon locations, and glimpses of the World of Oldskull.  Herein you will find 55 detailed entries detailing the gods, heroes, antiheroes, prophets, and the most ancient monsters and undead who populate the World of Oldskull.  You will also find cryptic notes pertaining to hundreds of lands and locales, forbidden artifacts, new magic items, lost cities and underworlds, and the priesthoods of Pegana.  How does the Pegana Mythos tie into the Cthulhu Mythos?  What is the true past of the world?  What terrible secrets and fabulous treasures await the most reckless heroes who dare to plunder the strongholds of Saigoth, or to swim in the poisonous vampire-infested seas above the Doggerland?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come learn and know!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
