			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fables Light is an almost entirely narrative roleplaying game.  A typical game has one to five characters, called Protagonists, and a Director (or GM) that establishes the setting, plays the Antagonists (non-player characters), and resolves any issues that cannot be resolved through collaborative narration.  Additionally, the Director is responsible for taking notes and compiling a post-game summary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is concerned with recreating exciting scenes, linked together by narrative arcs to create a campaign.  Characters are defined as players see fit, but generally follow a description with personality elements and traits.  They grow and change as the game progresses.  The rules essentially deal with methods to streamline activity and provide for speedy, exciting play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
