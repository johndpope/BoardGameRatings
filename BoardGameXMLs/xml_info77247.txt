			<description>From Publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;We live our everyday lives in space. I don't mean space literally--although our Galactic culture now spreads across thousands of systems. I mean that we live our lives in a dimension that we call space--we move from space to space, city to city, planet to planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But when we first developed faster-than-light travel, we had to get used to a higher dimension than space: hyperspace. In hyperspace, normal space is nothing but a line representing anywhere you might want to go in the universe. You pick a destination, travel through hyperspace to it, and bang--you're there. Suddenly, we could travel to distant planets in a few hyperspace jumps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And our enemies could, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the Bavakh Empire is attacking our planet--Dukis. We've never been a warlike people, and there's no way we could hold out against an invasion of even a hundred ships. But the Bavakh have tens of thousands of ships--millions of ships!--and besides that, they're one of the most murderous, tyrannical races in the galaxy. No one thinks we have a chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But we have a secret that the Bavakh don't. We know how to go into pathspace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pathspace is a dimension even higher than hyperspace. In pathspace, the Bavakh are nothing but ants marching on a line. When the Bavakh invade us, they'll be completely vulnerable to anyone waiting in pathspace--and they'll be gone before they even catch sight of our world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My father was the first person our planet sent into pathspace. I wasn't even born when it happened. But he's up there now in pathspace, defending us. He'll have to face nightmarish Bavakh ships. He'll have to master his will completely, forming it into &amp;quot;Points&amp;quot; that launch devastating attacks. They say he'll even live forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And when he defeats every Bavakh, maybe he'll come home to us--&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
