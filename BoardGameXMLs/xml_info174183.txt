							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Argor Fantasy Role Playing Game</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Argor FRPG is a roleplaying game in the classic tradition of high fantasy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is designed to be an ideal introduction to RPGs for new players. The rule mechanics are straightforward: you only need six-sided dice, and you always aim to roll as high a score as possible. All the familiar elements of fantasy are here: orcs, elves, magic, dragons etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the game is also intended to have depths that will intrigue more experienced gamers. There are no character classes &amp;ndash; instead a skill-based approach means players can create diverse characters who&amp;rsquo;s abilities progress with experience. The game world offers a wide range of different gaming experiences: a river-valley civilisation of rat people, war-loving lizard men who ride dinosaurs into battle, desert-dwelling serpent-folk and more besides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Argor FRPG features original rules, it is designed to offer more than that. The product comes complete with supporting resources that help create a vibrant gameworld atmosphere. The world of Argor is described in all its glory, with maps, a complete history and a gazetteer of locations. Even if you have your own preferred fantasy RPG rules, Argor FRPG will give you histories, languages, locations and plot hooks fit to grace any game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
