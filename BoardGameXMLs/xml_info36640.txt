							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Gettysburg Campaign</name>
									
			<description>Recreates Robert E Lee's 1863 invasion of Pennsylvania using the same block game system as Worthington's previous Civil War game Forge in Fire. The game will cover the historic campaign through June and July. The Confederate player will play Lee while the Union player will play Union Commanders Joe Hooker and then George Meade. The goal of the Confederates is to capture certain import areas including if possible such cities as Baltimore and Washington.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself uses a classic block game system. Strategic level play takes place on a point to point map of the Maryland and Pennsylvania countryside. Once combat is joined players will switch their counters to a battle board to conduct the tactical level combat. The units themselves are classic block game counters with a unit's strength being designated by numbers on the outside of the block which can be rotated to reflect losses in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
