							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cold Space (StarCluster 4)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cold Space is now StarCluster 4 - Cold Space! This product now uses the StarCluster 4 system rather than its original system. This is a self-contained product - you do not need any other StarCluster 4 product to use this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cold Space covers the years 1949 to 1989, after swiss scientists discovered a faster than light drive and antigravity using obscure physics principles. The Soviets quickly stole the idea, and the race for the stars was on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ships they flew in were crude, rough, and apt to fall apart if not tended constantly, but they worked!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cold War has moved into space, where the Americans, Soviets, and the rest of the nations of the world move in a political miasma of espionage, proxy wars, revolution, deceit, and betrayal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The years 1949-1989 are a time of profound cultural change, from sock-hops to discos, from Studebakers and Kaisers to Deloreans and Z-cars, from sliderules to micro computers, from the nuclear family to extended step-families, single moms, and gay parents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cold Space has 50 extra-solar colonies on 23 planets and moons, as well as Mars, the moon, and other colonies in our own solar system. The older colonies grow into maturity and power, while the young colonies live in a frontier state, where the latest tech may be a liability because no one can fix it. There are revolts, insurrections, and coups, shadow wars and assassinations, and political allies with radically opposite means and ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pdf includes a star file for NBOS' AstroSynthesis Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
