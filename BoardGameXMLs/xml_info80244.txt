							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Sidekicks 2: The World Championship</name>
									
			<description>Published in 1994 (Japanese title: Tokuten Ou 2 - Real Fight Football), the sequel corrected most of the flaws in the original's design, including the ability to switch players' control during the game, a smaller goal, and no more long shots taken (in Super Sidekicks 1 the simple long shot was sometimes too long, leading into a throw-in situation). It increased the number of teams to 48 and divided them into 6 geographical &amp;quot;regions&amp;quot; (new teams underlined):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Europe A: Italy, England, Spain, Holland, Switzerland, Norway, Turkey, Ireland&lt;br/&gt;    Europe B: Germany, France, Bulgaria, Sweden, Russia, Greece, Belgium, Romania&lt;br/&gt;    Americas/Oceania: United States, Mexico, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras&lt;br/&gt;    Asia: South Korea, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan (as Republic of China), China, Iran, Hong Kong, United Arab Emirates&lt;br/&gt;    South America: Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Colombia, Bolivia, Uruguay, Peru, Ecuador&lt;br/&gt;    Africa: Cameroon, Morocco, Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa, C&amp;ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Guinea, Zambia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you start the game, you go into a &amp;quot;Regional Qualifying Round Final&amp;quot; against another team from your region. After beating it, your team goes into the World (Cup) Tournament, in which you are grouped with 4 other countries in a round-robin. After winning against all of them, you go into an elimination tournament: the quarterfinals, semifinals, and the final for the World Cup. This type of tournament thus is more reminiscent of the real-life World Cup. If a match ends in a draw, you also have the option of replaying a full game, go to the penalty kick tiebreaker, or play a sudden death (golden goal) game (the golden goal feature was not present in the original Super Sidekicks).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All subsequent Super Sidekicks games followed the same design and gameplay as Super Sidekicks 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Sidekicks&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
