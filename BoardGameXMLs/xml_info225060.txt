			<description>Playtest introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Interface Zero 2.0 for Pathfinder playtest. Interface Zero 2.0 is a cyberpunk setting originally developed for the Savage Lands roleplaying system by David Jarvis, Curtis and Sarah Lyons, Thomas Shook, David Viars, and Peter J. Wacks. Now our development team is converting the setting to be compatible with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game rules, with plans to release the setting later this year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For now, we would like to invite you to take the material offered here and give it a test run. We have provided pregenerated characters from all the available classes with a broad representation of available races. Also included is a new system of combat rules designed for modern weapons, rules for hacking, and a selection of gear and items. The document provides a number of scenarios designed for 4 or 5 characters. Get a feel for the classes and the rules. Most of all, enjoy yourselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you read this book, you're going to realize Interface Zero 2.0 isn't a traditional cyberpunk setting. It's not all about raging against the &amp;quot;Big Bad&amp;quot; megacorporate machine because they are messing up the entire world. Nor is Interface Zero 2.0 just another grim and gritty &amp;quot;living on the edge and celebrating the fact that you survived another run on a corp&amp;quot; type of game. Sure, those elements are welcome, even mandatory in the world as it exists in 2090, but here's the deal. We want Interface Zero 2.0 to be more than that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
