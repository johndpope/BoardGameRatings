							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lord of Novallese</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mullshire is a small, isolated town nestled in a mountain valley deep in the cold north of Andora. The people of Mullshire are hunters, trappers and miners and live hard but honest lives. In ages past the Empire of Man kept a strong fortress called Novallese farther up the mountain, one of many that guarded the passes of this ancient range. But Novallese has been abandoned for centuries, left to ruin after the last great wars. Novallese is located just a few miles north of Mullshire, and its ruined tower is visible from the town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently strange lights have been seen in Novallese at night, and travelers have reported strange creatures roaming the woods between the town and the keep. The Old Keep Road has become unsafe, and young people have started disappearing from the town. A declaration written in blood was found pinned to the front door of Mullshires only store, stating that a new Lord had taken residence in Novallese. The town would pay a seasonal tribute to the lord of coins, coal from their mines and a young virgin girl. Believing a Nosferatu has taken up residence in the old keep the people of Mullshire have put out the call for Vampire Hunters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An introductory adventure for two or more characters in the 0-40 experience range.  A slightly modified version of this adventure appeared in the the Tryout rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
