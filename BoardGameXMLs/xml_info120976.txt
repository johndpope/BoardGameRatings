			<description>Party game. There are card slips (like tickets in size). One slip will have a word on it. Its matching slip will have another word but related to the first slip word. For example, a first-half slip might have the word 'Buckingham' and its other half would be the word 'Palace'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second half slips are placed around the house. Each player is given a first half slip with the word that will match one of the slips around the house. At the word &amp;quot;Go&amp;quot;, the players set off to look for their match. If a player thinks he has found it, he takes both slips back to the host and, if correct, earns one point. Then he is given another slip to solve. After the host calls time, the player with the most points, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
