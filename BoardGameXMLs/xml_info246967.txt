			<description>The 15 pawns are placed in the first line of the game board, indicated with an arrow. The pawns may move one space per turn or jump over as many opposite pawns as possible. Jumped over pawns are removed from the game as are pawns that don't jump when it is possible to do so. Movement and jumping on ones own side of the gameboad is only forward or sideward. On the opponents side of the game board moving and jumping is allowed in any direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who gets the most pawns onto the opposite half of the game board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
