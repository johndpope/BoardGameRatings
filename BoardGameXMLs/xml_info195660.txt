							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Inuma: The Yellow Book</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains the rules to take the worlds you've created with Inuma and do something fun with them. You're going to make a story, but you're also going to play a game, but there's not going to be a score and no one's going to lose. As you can see, this activity is not easy to define. It is what it is. We call it &amp;quot;story gaming.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll need two to five friends to story game. It will take between one and three hours, depending on how many people are involved. What you're going to do is create a short story that can be tied together with other short stories to weave an epic involving the world you've created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generally, everyone playing will have the same things to do, but sometimes the &amp;quot;host&amp;quot; will have special duties. This is usually the person who invited everyone to play a story game or the person who owns the Inuma set, but it can be anyone you designate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Yellow Book focuses on cooperatively creating and detailing the significant characters for the campaign.  Unlike traditional games, in Inuma characters are cooperatively shared among all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
