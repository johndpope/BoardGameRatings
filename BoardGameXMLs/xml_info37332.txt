			<description>A Pietjesbak (or Pitjesbak, translated: Seedsbox) is an 8 sided wooden box covered with felt. It has a diameter of approximately 38 cm. The game is played in the box using 3 regular D6 dice. You also need a piece of chalk for scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are different playing versions of this game. Special houserules/pubrules are common.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most common rules:&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 15 points to start with (or 9 for a short game), marked with chalk on their side of the Pietjesbak.  The purpose is to get the highest score within 3 rolls and with that lose all his points.  The starting player can roll any/all three dice up to 3 times. Each other player gets as many rolls as the first player, and tries to get a higher score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One counts as 100, 6 counts as 60,  the other numbers count as their face value. Special combinations have a higher score. The highest score wins the round and the player can reduce their score by 1, 2 or 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The different scores (from lowest to highest):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     3 numbers that are not one of the special combinations below. The dice are added together. Example: 1,2,6 = 100+2+60 = 162. The winner reduces their score by 1.&lt;br/&gt;     Zand/Sand, 3 identical numbers. Example: 3,3,3. The higher the better (except: 1,1,1 aka Drie Apen). The winner reduces their score by 2.&lt;br/&gt;     Soixante-Neuf/Sixty-Nine (4,5,6 = 4+5+60 = 69). The winner reduces their score by 3.&lt;br/&gt;     Drie Apen/Three Apes (1,1,1 = 100+100+100 = 300, which is unbeatable). With this score you instantly win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To summarize (with out-of-sequence ranks in bold-italics): 300 &amp;gt; 69 &amp;gt; triple-six 180 &amp;gt; triple-five 15 &amp;gt; triple-four 12 &amp;gt; triple-three 9 &amp;gt; triple-two 6 &amp;gt; 260 &amp;gt; 220 &amp;gt; 205 &amp;gt; 204 &amp;gt; 203 &amp;gt; 202 &amp;gt; 165 &amp;gt; 164 &amp;gt; 163 &amp;gt; 162 &amp;gt; 125 &amp;gt; ...&amp;gt; 122 &amp;gt; 110 &amp;gt;...&amp;gt; 104 &amp;gt; 70 &amp;gt; 68 &amp;gt;...&amp;gt; 64 &amp;gt; 14 &amp;gt;...&amp;gt; 7 (lowest 2,2,3)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
