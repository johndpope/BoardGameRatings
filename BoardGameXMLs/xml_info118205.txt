			<description>Like Odin Sphere and Muramasa: The Demon Blade, it is a spiritual successor to an Atlus game titled Princess Crown and takes some concepts from Norse mythology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon's Crown is an action role-playing game structured like a traditional side-scrolling beat 'em up where players move their characters across the screen into the background or foreground attacking enemies. Players may choose between one of six characters--Fighter, Amazon, Elf, Sorceress, Wizard, and Dwarf--who must travel though a number of environments using standard attacks as well as magic spells to defeat enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in a fantasy world where vast labyrinths and catacombs lie beneath civilization. Magic-users seeking a legendary treasure know as the &amp;quot;Dragon's Crown&amp;quot; have used their sorcery to link each of the ruins together in order to search for it, which they plan to use for a sinister purpose. Players must take up the role of one of six adventurers to keep the crown out of their hands, as well as search for treasure of their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dragon's Crown (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
