			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They Are The Squamous&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They were once humanoid like anyone else... healthy, living tissue with their own futures and destiny, but something went wrong.  A glitch in the genetics, an outside influence, a combination of factors, no one is sure.  Now, they're the opposite of healthy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They hide in communities and societies, destroying those that come in contact with them and rendering the healthy into their own monstrous form and substance.  They remain hidden and grow until they're discovered, or until it's too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is more than a supplement for the Victory System; this is how I visualize the cancer that I've just been diagnosed with.  Would you kindly help me beat the hell out of it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;#BeatTheSquamous is a supplement for the Victory System; you will need the core rulebook to play.  Some material used in this book is found in the Powers Companion or the Special Abilities Compendium; these would also be useful to have.  Or you know what?  With my permission, convert this material into any game system you like, and feel free to contact me if you'd like a hand with that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Destroy these horrific monsters without let or hindrance, and then, if you would be so kind, share the story of the fight and the victory on social media with the hashtag #BeatTheSquamous.  Not only am I using guided imagery and visualization to fight my cancer, I'm crowdsourcing its defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
