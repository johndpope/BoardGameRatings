			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to North Sandalwood. We hope that you enjoy your time working for the town as a member of the Special Animal Control Unit. Your job is to deal with various animals such as dogs, cats, raccoons and the occasional exotic pet that get loose. You offer a vital service to the members of this town and we are grateful that you have decided to join the team!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your latest assignment is to check out the Golden Creme Delights factory. There have been reports of critters that have been skittering around the factory at night. These creatures are responsible for damage in the factory and they must be captured before the current owners can sell the building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the Module&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cake Walk is the ironic name of a new adventure for Savage Worlds written by John Beattie (Weird Wars Rome: Wellspring) and artwork by Jordan Peacock (Wonderland No More, Savage Worlds: Deluxe, Interface Zero and artwork for many other projects).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this adventure, PCs take on the seemingly mundane role of animal control officers, but when they respond to a complaint of an animal infestation at a local sweet goods factory they end up facing something that is neither mundane nor an animal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from the Savage Worlds ruleset, dice and a pencil, everything you would need to play this adventure is included such as pregens, figure flats, a map of the facility and even adventure seeds to take this from a one-shot adventure to a campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
