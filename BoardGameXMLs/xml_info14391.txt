			<description>This game is based on a series of children's books and a movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to reach their clubhouse as fast as possible - to do this they need speed, intelligence and luck. &lt;br/&gt;The player who is the first to have two of his pawns in the clubhouse wins the game. You move pawns by playing cards. You may only play cards who match either number, color or symbol of the previous card played. The number on the card determines the number of spaces you move forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
