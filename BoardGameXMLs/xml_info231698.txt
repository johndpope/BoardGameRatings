			<description>Hero to the common man, Banzuiin Chōbei leads a ragtag band of renegades against all those who intimidate and steal from the weak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chōbei is historical character, remembered as a Robin Hood-type figure who protected the oppressed common-folk from the uncaring samurai and other threats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chōbei's rag-tag band is represented with mixed-weapon groups, bringing you some interesting new tactical choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set includes 10 metal heads and 18 brand new cards including 'Lead from the Front' and 'Ultimate Sacrifice', which boost the prowess of your commoners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chōbei was eventually cornered by his enemies while visiting a bath house. A great swordsman with amazing stamina, he defeated every attacker and was only killed when they set fire to the building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
