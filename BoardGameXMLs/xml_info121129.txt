			<description>5 Spots Party is the first development by CosmonautGames, which will initially be distributed exclusively through Nintendo's WiiWare service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 Spots Party is based on a successful &amp;quot;casual&amp;quot; game that reached number 1 in sales for 3 weeks on the RealArcade game site.  This development for Nintendo has placed special emphasis on playability through the Wii Remote, and a special mode was added for this platform that enables up to 4 players to compete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on the popular pastime of finding differences between 2 photos.  There are 3 different modes and different playing options for one or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
