			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solar Defense is an independently published PC game that combines the best elements from the tower defense and base defense genres. Set in deep space, players are thrust into the command chair of space station about to come under heavy attack and must deploy their defenses to respond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solar defense is all about perfecting base design. There are 8 basic towers in the game, all of which can be upgraded to perform specific functions or optimized damage certain enemy types. As the station can only support an limited number of towers the player has to make tough decisions such as rationing the number of reactors to fit another missile turret or shield on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike most tower defense games where tower upgrades are capped, Solar Defense features a unique upgrade system. The functions of each tower can be improved indefinitely however each upgrade costs increasingly more than the last and provides diminishing returns. To fuel upgrades, the station can salvage resources or mine them nearby asteroids however as the station takes damage these resources get shunted to repairs making defense as important as offense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually the station will succumb under the onslaught which is rendered in full 3D giving you that &amp;quot;oh hell&amp;quot; feeling as your base is swarmed by hundreds of ships ranging from attack fighters to enormous capital ships. Despite your inevitable demise, the game makes you want to try &amp;quot;just one more round&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;If you do well enough in a level you'll unlock a unique and powerful technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall Solar Defense is worth a look for anyone who has an interest in RTS or tower defense games. It is accessible to most players and comes with a tutorial that steps you through all the basics. Perfect for the casual gamer with most runs lasting around an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
