			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiny Details is a collaborative writing game for one to four players age twelve or older. Create a story by following a set of mechanical directions and watch as the story emerges. No outline, preparation, or forethought is required, so this game is great for a spontaneous one-off at a convention or party, or for those days when you're missing too many members of your group to play your regularly scheduled game. Tiny Details is time flexible and slow-paced; it works well with knitting, cookie-baking, or whiling away time on public transit. You can play in person or via distance, solo or with your friends. The only equipment you need is pen and paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
