			<description>Lair is a competitive building game where you are in charge of constructing a 60's era, underground HQ &amp;mdash; inside a volcano, no less &amp;mdash; for your nefarious boss. It has a Euro-influenced, worker placement mechanic where you have two types of workers: the lowly henchmen that you use to claim a room, and the lieutenant that can command henchmen to activate the ability of the room. You spend order tokens to command a henchmen, but if you command another player&amp;rsquo;s henchmen, you have to give that player the order token. It also has a expanding score track that doubles as the elevator shaft, which affects your build options and game strategy in interesting ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a small-box strategy game that plays more like a big-box game. The game is highly thematic, from the tongue-in-cheek art style, to the streamlined gameplay that rewards villainous actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Command your workers and make judicious use of scant resources to build an optimum lair, and gain the boss's favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
