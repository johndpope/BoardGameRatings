			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2, also known as GTA2, is the sequel to the 1997 hit PC/PS1 game GTA. It was created by DMA Design, the creators of the original game, and featured the same top down perspective and gameplay but with an improved engine &amp;amp; many new features including an in-game save feature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is set in a Max Headroom inspired &amp;quot;3 weeks into the future&amp;quot; cyberpunk/sci-fi setting and had a dynamic gang allegiance system where player actions affected a positive/negative rating for each of the 7 gangs in the game. The game features the same basic mix of open world gameplay &amp;amp; directed missions as the original game, but with a wider variety of weapons, vehicles &amp;amp; mission types spread out over its 3 levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was released for the PC &amp;amp; Playstation platforms initially, and a Dreamcast release followed a few months later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PC release of GTA2 was made available to download for free by Rockstar on its website a few years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
