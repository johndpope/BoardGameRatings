			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An action/adventure game. As Matt Trakker you have to explore VENOM's lunar base. You'll have to avoid or defeat guards and traps and solve puzzles. You can collect masks with different powers, which will help you during your quest. The back of the box says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Matt Trakker receives a message on the MASK computer - &amp;quot;We have kidnapped Scott Trakker and are holding him to ransom on the moon. Unless you surrender your entire forces to Venom, you will never see him again. Signed Miles Mayhem.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Matt is faced with a terrible dilemma. To agree to VENOM's demands would give them total control over the Peaceful Nations Alliance, but to ignore their demands would surely mean Scott's life.&lt;br/&gt;Can you, as Matt Trakker, rescue Scott and return him safely to Earth?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
