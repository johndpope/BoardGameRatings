							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rage of the Gladiator</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Rage of the Gladiator is a WiiWare game. It is the second WiiWare game to use the Wii MotionPlus. The gameplay is similar to the gameplay of Punch-Out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rage of the Gladiator is a fantasy-based first-person perspective fighting game. You play the role of Gracius, battling for his life in the arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to an interview with Joystiq, Ghostfire Games CEO Ed Roman states &amp;quot;The game consists entirely of boss fights. After all, boss fights are the most interesting aspects of most video games. So we skipped the &amp;quot;fodder&amp;quot; creatures. Each boss is essentially a little &amp;quot;puzzle&amp;quot; that you need to figure out how to defeat. Some require dexterity, others require memorization, and some require listening to what they're saying very carefully so that you react to their attacks appropriately.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Rage of the Gladiator&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
