			<description>From the Kidult Homepage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enroll your pirate crew, hoist your anchor and set sail for the conquest of seas. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to charge up your cannons to shoot down your enemies&amp;rsquo; sails. Galeone Galeotto is a game of luck and memory.&lt;br/&gt;You first have to try and pick up from the table your four pirate cards with different colors, before forming the ship crew.&lt;br/&gt;Pay attention, if you pick up a pirate in a color you already have just put it back on the table... then try and recall where your enemies have put them, one never knows!&lt;br/&gt;Once your crew is recruited, the whole staff is completed and you can start firing at the enemies&amp;rsquo; galleons. You pick up cannon cards that allow you allow to hit other sails with a given color: the yellow cannon hits a yellow sail, the green cannon a green sail...&lt;br/&gt;Yet you have to set the strategy and decide which galleon you want to shoot at.&lt;br/&gt;Sail before the wind and... fire!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available as pdf download on the Kidultgames Homepage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
