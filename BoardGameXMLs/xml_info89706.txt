							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">North Atlantic Convoy Raider</name>
									
			<description>From the game manual's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This game pits the Bismarck against the British Home Fleet in a desperate attempt to bring England to her knees&lt;br/&gt;by sinking merchant ships or by dealing a decisive blow to her Home Fleet. The action occurs during the spring of&lt;br/&gt;1941 in, the North Atlantic Ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You are the Captain of the Bismarck; the computer handles the British Home Fleet, convoys, and airsearch.  The game is played on a 12 x 12 grid representing a portion of the Atlantic Ocean. The object of the game for you is to sink as many British merchant ships and battleships as possible while bringing the Bismarck back to port. The object for the computer is to sink the Bismarck as quickly as possible or at least force it back to port before substantial  damage can be done to the British forces.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a simple text-based map, the player moves the Bismarck across the North Atlantic in search of convoys to attack while trying to avoid the main forces of the Royal Navy.  The game took into account the impact of weather changes and night time operations in a basic fashion, and combat was reported in simple lines of text.  Written in BASIC, the game was designed by National Microcomputer Associates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
