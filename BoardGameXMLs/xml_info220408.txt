			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OH NUTS! is an exciting and humorous game that is perfect for friends and family. It is both fun for kids (ages 6+) and engaging for adults! Strategy, a sense of humor, and a bit of scheming is all it takes for loads of fun and laughter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each deck comes with 108 cards, and the total game time is anywhere from about 10-30 minutes. The goal of the game is simple. Be the first to collect 4 of the same kind of nut and move them from your nut &amp;quot;surplus&amp;quot; (cards in your hand) to your winter &amp;quot;stash&amp;quot; (cards you play on the table). Easy right? Ahhhh, but you need to watch out! The sly fox, ravenous raccoon, sneaky squirrel and stinky skunk are all after your nuts too, and players might play one of these cards on their turn to take a nut from you (or your stash) OR make you lose your turn by switching the direction of play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
