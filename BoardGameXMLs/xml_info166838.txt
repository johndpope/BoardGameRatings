			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Road Trip players will take on the role of one of several people participating in a road trip. Each of them has some reason for being on the trip which they determine themselves and each of them has a relationship with each of the other people on the trip. The nature of that relationship is determined by the players involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The destination and purpose of the trip is determined by the players. Each trip will consist of a number of scenes, two per player, which are played out in order. Changes to characters from one scene carry over to the next scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the game , players follow a number of steps:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Discuss Boundaries&lt;br/&gt;     Determine the nature of the trip.&lt;br/&gt;     Determine the method of travel&lt;br/&gt;     Create characters and roles&lt;br/&gt;     Play out the scenes&lt;br/&gt;     Create an epilogue (optional)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
