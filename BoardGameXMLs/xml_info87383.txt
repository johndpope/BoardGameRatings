							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deity Do&#039;s and Don&#039;ts</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Web Enhancement for Faiths and Pantheons&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faiths and Pantheons by Eric L. Boyd and Erik Mona offers an incredible amount of information on the primary deities of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting, including hit points, attacks, saving throws, and other abilities in a format similar to the MONSTER MANUAL&amp;rsquo;s. At first glance, one might expect to treat deities in a FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign like any other monster-brought in to harass and fight the heroes. Otherwise, why include that combat information?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In truth, the deities of Faer&amp;ucirc;n are much more than very powerful monsters and should be treated as such. Epic-level characters who have an easy time slaying dragons and the tarrasque should not look to the deities as their next conquests, to be pushed off the tops of walls, looted of their items, and locked in dungeons to make artifacts. These beings are deities for a reason, so introduce them into your campaign after careful consideration and in particular circumstances. This free supplement to Faiths and Pantheons helps guide you through this process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To use this web enhancement, you must already have Faiths and Pantheons. This bonus material is exclusive to the official FORGOTTEN REALMS website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This layout intentionally begins on page 2. There is no page 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
