			<description>From the back of the module:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The army of the Kentucky Free State is on the move. The Morrow Agriculture Base TA-14 and its team A-60 are in their path. As a member of MARS team C-13, you have to fight a series of rear-guard actions to delay the Free State army. If you are successful and very lucky, Agriculture team A-60 will have enough time to evacuate the base and surrounding civilians. If you fail many will die, and the Morrow Project will lose important assets that will help rebuild the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game package contains all of the information, maps and systems necessary for the Project Director to run this scenario. Also included in the package is information concerning MARS teams, a Morrow Agriculture Base, the Kentucky Free State, detailed cache contents, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
