			<description>18ES Caminos de Hierro (Paths of Steel) is a game of the 18xx family based on the spanish railways in the 19th century.&lt;br/&gt;As other 18xx games, there are two main elements. A map where the players build railways and create routes, and a stock chart where users buy and sell shares.&lt;br/&gt;Players can buy shares in several companies, a company is not associated with one player, but only the director of each company (the player with the most shares) operates the company (build rails, stations, and buy trains).&lt;br/&gt;18ES has several mechanics not present in other games of the series, as build contracts, and company takeovers. &lt;br/&gt;The game finish when the national Railway company R.E.N.F.E. is formed and take over the rest of the companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
