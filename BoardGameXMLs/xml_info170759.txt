			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;One-Minute Bulge is a solitaire challenge. The entire campaign only takes about 60 seconds to play so One-Minute Bulge is obviously a short game. However, it offers the player most of the strategic choices available to the German military commanders in 1944. The player represents a group of high-ranking officers like von Rundstedt, Model, Dietrich, and von Manteuffel. Historical factors like weather, supply, the Westwall defenses, and the dreaded Fuhrer Conference are included in the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This little simulation attempts to create a narrative and it does an adequate job for a game with a short duration. The player will need a combination of good luck and bad weather to seize the crucial port of Antwerp for the Fuhrer. In 1944 Feldmarschall Model said the chances for a successful attack were only 1 in 10. In a typical One-Minute Bulge  session the player has slightly better odds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One-Minute Bulge is a free Print &amp;amp; Play game with a single 8.5&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot; map, seven playing pieces, a couple of charts, and a few markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
