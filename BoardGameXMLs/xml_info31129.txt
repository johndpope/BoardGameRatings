							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vuelta Ciclista: el Juego con Kelme</name>
									
			<description>Beautiful Spanish game released at the end of the '90s and  endorsed by the Kelme cycling team. The game has three different levels of play, including one in which you manage your team buying riders according to your budget.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has three gorgeous boards in which you can play the Vuelta, Giro or Tour. Each of these races consists of three stages plus a time trial. (Except for the basic level, in which you use dice, the time trial consists of Trivial Pursuit-like questions.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team consists of three cyclists (a leader, a climber and a rouleur) and this game has everything a cycling game should have (mountains, intermediate sprints, drawing from other riders; this one also has falls, punctures, exhaustions... even an antidoping test).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
