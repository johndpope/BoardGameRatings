			<description>From Pagat:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a card game in the Barbu family.  It uses a standard deck and has four subgames (Queen of Spades, Last 2, Tricks and FanTan).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Queen of Spades: the object is to avoid taking the Queen of Spades.  Players who win a trick on which the QoS is played pays the bank $100.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last 2:  Avoid winning the next-to-last and the last tricks.  The player who takes next-to-last trick pays $50 to bank; Player who takes the last trick pays $100 to bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tricks: The banker gives the appropriately marked chip to the winner of each trick. At the completion of play, each player adds the numbers on his chips and multiplies this total by $10. This dollar amount is what the player receives from the bank. For example, if a player wins the 1st, 4th, and 11th tricks, then he would receive $160 from the bank (1+4+11 = 16 x $10 = $160). The 1st trick is worth $10; $20 for 2nd; $30 for 3rd; etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FanTan: Play all of one's cards before any other player can play all of his.  The bank pays $100 to the player which is the 1st Out; Bank pays $50 to 2nd Out; 3rd Out receives nothing and pays nothing; 4th Out pays $50 to bank; 5th Out pays $75 to bank; 6th Out pays $100 to bank; 7th Out pays $125 to bank; 8th Out pays $150 to bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
