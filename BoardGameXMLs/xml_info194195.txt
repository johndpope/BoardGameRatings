			<description>It happens in an instant. The awakening of a world. When events urge that world into a point of sudden chaos, and clarity. In this instance, in this world, it was called Windfall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Windfall was the sudden manifestation of Aether &amp;ndash; raw and unstable magical energy. Unleashed by the whim of the gods, it's presence has changed the world forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Windfall is a strategy card game for 2-4 players, where each player takes on the role of a powerful Guardian. These mighty individuals battle for control of the Aether using amazing spells, powerful relics and deadly creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Windfall, there are two primary ways to play. The first is the more casual Adventure Mode, where players will be playing from a shared group deck, making the best play out of the cards they are dealt. The more advanced mode of play is Drafting, where each game session starts with a unique drafting process before the players battle it out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, as your power grows, you will summon creatures, equip weapons, harness ancient relics and cast deadly spells. Each player will battle the other guardians, reducing their life until only one remains standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
