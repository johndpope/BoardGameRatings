							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Small Town Secrets</name>
									
			<description>Theme: &amp;quot;Every small town has its secrets. When a murderer is loose, and everyone is suspect, you never know what will be uncovered. Is the Quarterback dealing drugs? Does the town Doctor have Mafia ties? Is the FBI Agent assigned to the case actually the killer? Only by making use of your investigative team to find the evidence can you beat your opponent to the truth.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play: Deck building game that uses a built in scoring mechanic that may slim your deck each turn. Scored cards have either positive or negative values, and can be played to reduce an opponent's score. In addition to buyable cards to make your deck stronger, there are also Secrets that star outside the deck, and give powerful effects once activated. Each player also has a single Dark Secret that can give a massive amount of points toward winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal: The first player to reach the point total on the &amp;quot;Premise&amp;quot; wins the game. Premise cards included have 10, 20 and 30 point goals, though the 10 point goal tends to be an hour long game by itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
