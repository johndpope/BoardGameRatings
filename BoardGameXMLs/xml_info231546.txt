			<description>Description from the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;THE BATTLE OF GEONOSIS was the first battle in the Clone Wars. It would be the first major combat of the Grand Army of the Republic, as well as the first major battle the Jedi would fight in years. BATTLE OF YAVIN The Battle of Yavin was a major battle of the Galactic Civil War that led to the destruction of the First Death Star and was one of the Rebellion's first major victories.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play Star Wars Box Busters each player needs their own Battle Cube, which is a small folding diorama. Each Battle Cube has a unique combination of capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Battle of Geonosis is exclusive to this two-pack, Battle of Yavin was also sold as an individually packaged item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
