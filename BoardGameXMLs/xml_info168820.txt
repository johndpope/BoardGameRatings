			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ancient Past contains eight playbooks of player classes for Dungeon World that has gorgeous cover art done by Nick Ladd. This pack features adventurers who are tied to the world and its ancient past. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Ageless: You are an immortal adventure who has learned to escape death&amp;rsquo;s grasp and avoid the cruel hand of physically ageing. Even if the weight of the ages is taking a toll on your mind, you are font of power and knowledge from across the ages. However, death can only be denied for so long&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;    The All-Powerful: You were born at the dawn of time along with the gods. You are far more powerful than any mortal hero could ever hope to be. However, as time goes on, the divine energies you were birthed in are fading. Each use of your powers brings you closer to exhausting this irreplaceable energy which one day may fully run out.&lt;br/&gt;    The Curseburdened: Once an adventure with hope in your heart and a spring in your step, excited for your greatest adventure yet. It was going all so well till you and your original party disturbed a seal containing all of the worst curses throughout the world&amp;rsquo;s history. Now you live an s a paranoid adventure, simply waiting till the curses take hold.&lt;br/&gt;    The Doomed: You are a pathetic as you are poor. You are a weak, disgusting, disease ridden beggar who openly suffers more than anyone else in the world. This class is only for masochist or ambitious players who wish to weather the storm of miserableness that will be heading your way if you play this class. But it&amp;rsquo;s not all without its perks, for if you can make it to the end alive with this poor soul he becomes a great and powerful hero that could have only been forged in those terrible trials no other human could have survived.&lt;br/&gt;    The Imprisoned: You are the first sinner, imprisoned by the gods at the dawn of time for your crimes so terrible they would not chance them being visited on the world again. Now that countless ages have passed you have escaped your prison and are now a fugitive fleeing from the gods themselves.&lt;br/&gt;    The Relicbearer: You possessed ancient magical treasure from around the world that have still maintained their use to this date. You can choose from a wide and colorful range of relics to own which to aid your party with in a moment&amp;rsquo;s notice. In a pinch, a GM could use the list of relics in this playbook for some nifty treasures to reward their players with in their games.&lt;br/&gt;    The Stone Guardian: You yourself are a relic that survived from an ancient civilization now long forgotten to history. You are a living statue who must find a purpose and a new people to protect as you set off into the world.&lt;br/&gt;    The Traveler: The knowledgeable traveler who has seen much of the world. You know where all the best inns are at, the most beautiful landscapes and the most dangerous dungeons. You are always well stocked and well liked most places you stop at.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
