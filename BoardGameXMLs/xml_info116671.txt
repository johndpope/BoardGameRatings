			<description>There are 2 characters you must choose, a driver, who drives a custom kart, and a co-driver, who uses all weapons and has 2 Toon Powers. There are tournaments which players must race a series of races and win with the most points. Battle modes in arenas let two teams battle in different modes and Cartoon Eliminators are endurance races where last kart in each lap is eliminated. The carts have three stats: acceleration, speed and handling if chosen as driver. If co-driver, they have two Toon Powers that fall into four categories: Shield, Attack, Boost and Flight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a total of 18 tracks, 12 of them being custom-made tracks like the wild west. The other 6 tracks are cartoon-themed tracks themed in their respective cartoons. Each of the cartoon-themed tracks are based together on a single map with each track taking a different route on the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Show-Themed Tracks:&lt;br/&gt;    Cow and Chicken-Cow &amp;amp; Chicken's School&lt;br/&gt;    I Am Weasel-Construction Site&lt;br/&gt;    Johnny Bravo-Johnny's Neighbourhood&lt;br/&gt;    Dexter's Laboratory-Dexter's Lab&lt;br/&gt;    Power Puff Girls-Townsville&lt;br/&gt;    Courage the Cowardly Dog-Bagge Farmhouse&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Custom Tracks:&lt;br/&gt;    The Farm&lt;br/&gt;    The Haunted Mansion&lt;br/&gt;    The Harbor&lt;br/&gt;    The Icy Mountain&lt;br/&gt;    The Wild West&lt;br/&gt;    Rocky Mountain Trail&lt;br/&gt;    The Theme Park&lt;br/&gt;    The Pinball Machine&lt;br/&gt;    The Spooky Mine&lt;br/&gt;    The Castle&lt;br/&gt;    The Jungle&lt;br/&gt;    Volcano Island&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cartoon Network Racing&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several additional aspects in the Nintendo DS version.
