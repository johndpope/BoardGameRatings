			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Grand City of Middelburg is a vast metropolis that is home to over a million souls... and one hellish demon. This hellion stalks the shadows to prey on the lives of men and feast on their very terror. This ruin of a man has come into the city like a thief in the night and now seems to rule it through fear, yet noone has ever lain eyes upon it and lived. The string of murders left behind in its wake grows more gruesome and horrific as the days tick by and yet there seems to be no end to what this monstrosity has planned for this once serene city. Can you survive the Ruined Man's machinations? Can you survive in a city that is tearing itself apart at the seams? Can you survive when all around you the people turn upon one another in paranoia and suspicion? Can you survive in the Ruined City?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ruined City is the first campaign released for The Runed Age setting and takes place in the Grand City of Middelburg as a series of gruesome murders happen and sends this metropolis of a million souls spiralling into panic, paranoia and darkness. The Ruined City is the first of four books in the greater Ruined Man campaign and serves to set up the main characters and events in the campaign, teach the players the unique campaign mechanics and puts them to the test to see if they have what it takes to survive in the dangerous city of Middelburg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City of Ruins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ruined City is not only an adventure and campaign book. This book also serves as a primer for the city itself. The Grand City of Middelburg was introduced in the Runed Age Corebook as a massive sprawling metropolis, home to a million people and ruled over by corrupt politicians and greedy merchants. Now the Ruined City will take you down onto the streets of Middelburg and show you all the places, buildings, monuments and areas of interest in each district of the city. The Ruined City alone will take you through a whole third of this gargantuan city with nearly a hundred unique locations visited and explored. By the end of the book you will know these parts of Middelburg better than you know your own hometown and you will be able to craft your own adventures and campaigns in and around Middelburg by drawing on the history and culture of the people and locations of these districts. But it isn't all dry reading. Each of the missions in the book is paired to the districts explored in that chapter, meaning that as you read and learn of these places, the campaign will take your through them as well so you can feel and experience them as any NPC in the world would.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Path to Madness&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ruined City contains four missions that will test your players to their very limits. Each mission is unique and seemingly separate, yet there is a thread underpinning it all: The Ruined Man. Each mission is as much noir mystery as it is an action adventure and it is up to the players to piece together the &amp;quot;whos&amp;quot;, the &amp;quot;whats&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;whys&amp;quot; of the Ruined Man before he utterly drives the city into madness. If the missions themselves are not enough of a challenge for your players, the Ruined City will show them how the city falls deeper into suspicion and despair the longer the campaign goes on by making it harder for folks to get along and having the desperate people of Middelburg turn to crime just to survive. Now not only do the players have to fulfil their obligations and complete the missions, but they have to do so with the whole city seemingly agains them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
