							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Contempt for the Ogre-Poet</name>
									
			<description>From the Rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;There is no book in the fiefdom, not since the ogre-poet came.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For nigh on eight years, the ogre-poet has terrorised the wildfolk of the realm, feasting on their flesh when e&amp;rsquo;er he finds them. The only safety was found in literature: the ogre-poet would wander off, distracted by the book and forgetting his hunger for the month.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In three days&amp;rsquo; time, the sickle moon is set to rise and the ogre-poet will again venture out on his fleshfeast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have three days to stop him&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Note: a Game Chef 2014 finalist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
