							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cairns</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built under mounds of stone, these ancient structures stand as memorial or burial grounds for great kings, emperors or legendary warriors of the past. Perhaps, the cairn is the most fascinating fantasy location ever and, certainly, it is the most played in fantasy RPGs. Traditionally, the cairns are filled with precious treasures, ancient belongings of defunct heroes and, of course, sleepless monsters. Undeads roam the silent underhalls and guard the forgotten crypts, waiting eagerly for some fools who dare to descend in the darkness of their domains. In this product, you will find five different cairns you can use in your adventures. The cairns may be used as part of a greater complex or individually.&lt;br/&gt;Here are some adventure hooks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round Cairn: While in another dungeon, the PCs find themselves transported in this cairn, appearing on one of the Gate Rooms. The gates of the cairn begin to produce monsters at constant rate, and the PCs must find a way out before being overwhelmed. Perhaps the key for opening the entrance portal lie in the central room, but some riddles must be overcome as well.&lt;br/&gt;Emperor&amp;rsquo;s Cairn: The good emperor lies in his death slumber from thousand years. It is said he was put to sleep by magic, for unknown reason. Now, a young scholar has found the key to awake the man and bring a good ruler to the world. The forces of evil try to destroy the remains of the king by awakening dreaded undeads from their graves in the cairn. The PCs are hired to retrieve the remains of the emperor and perform the ritual to awake him but they must confront the undead rising into the tomb.&lt;br/&gt;King&amp;rsquo;s Cairn: The PCs are searching the crown of an ancient king into the cairn. They find it in the sepulcher but if worn, the crown turns the PC into a powerful lich, who awake all the undead into the cairn. The only way to escape, for the PCs, is to spark again the loyalty in the undead that were the King&amp;rsquo;s Guard and persuade them to fight for their king.&lt;br/&gt;Ruined Cairn: The PCs venture into a ruined cairn, which is infested by goblins. They discover ancient memorials of a disappeared race. When they arrive to battle with the goblin leader, they discover he is a strange crossbreed. The PCs will be able to defeat him only if they have gathered enough clues from the ancient cairn.&lt;br/&gt;Multilevel Cairn: A strange spell has been cast on this cairn; it influences the alignment of the undeads who guard the ancient treasures. The PCs are caught in a war erupting in the cairn. The key is an evil necromancer who seeks a lost artifact kept into the cairn and found a funny way to destroy the guarding undeads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
