							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SNAFU</name>
									
			<description>SNAFU is a real-time co-operative party game inspired by Pit in which you're trading cards to collect sets; however, you're working as a team to beat the clock and each player is a character. One player may have to play like she has T-Rex arms, another may have to speak like a robot, and still another may have to play with his cards on his forehead. SNAFU can play out in sixty seconds with three or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
