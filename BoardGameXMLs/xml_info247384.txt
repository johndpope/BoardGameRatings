							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fungal Forest</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fungal Forest is a massive, 30 page adventure that plays out in three acts. After a sudden earthquake rocks the area surrounding the farming village of Gallowood, the party are the only ones in the area equipped to minimize the devastation that is sure to follow the disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quake ripped up and broke open large sections and passages to subterranian passages. Now those living on the fringes have been spotting groups of drow just out of sight. Worse, others have spotted a massive mushroom jutting from a newly formed mountain. The area around the toadstool is slowly being overgrown with smaller versions of the massive fungi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fungal Forest is an adventure for four to five, 15th level adventurers looking for a challenging adventure within a winding mystery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
