			<description>Publisher's Blurb: This rulebook contains everything players need to ready their characters for the Shattered Frontier! Combat, weapons, horses, skill, equipment and more are covered, along with detailed character generation and professional advancement! With no levels or classes (and only gaining experience in skills used), characters can change professions at will, just like the Old West!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By far the most deluxe western ever produced, this softcover rides into town with 224 full color pages crammed with beautiful period artwork! Yes, the Aces &amp;amp; Eights: Shattered Frontier RPG is the highest quality, most complete western ever marketed in the adventure game industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, there&amp;rsquo;s the innovative and visual Shot Clock game aids, which eliminate the abstraction and complexity of other RPGs &amp;ndash; a player can actually see the cover, position and location of his or her target! Of course, the Shot Clock game aids aren&amp;rsquo;t the only innovation in the Aces &amp;amp; Eights game. The realistically deadly combat supports an overall game system that rewards characters for pursuing professions, giving players the in-game incentives to do much more than follow the outlaw trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamers interested in the history, nations, and the rest of the major western movie adventure 'mini-games' beyond the gunfight (prospecting, cattle drives, frontier justice, advanced brawling and chases, and so on) should check out the Aces &amp;amp; Eights core rulebook, which also includes all the material you'll find in the Player's Guidebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
