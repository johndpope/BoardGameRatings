							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kongai</name>
									
			<description>Kongai is billed as Kongregate.com's collectible card game, but doesn't play like a card game.  Additionally, not having cards is not a significant disadvantage, because the cards are well-balanced and skillful play is drastically more important than the cards used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is flash-based - a 2-player duel where each player has 3 characters from a pool of 40 with a wide array of unique abilities abilities.  Gameplay is primarily a weighted rock-paper-scissors system where being able to read your opponent's moves is essential for victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
