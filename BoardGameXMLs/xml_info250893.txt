							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Druid Circle: Circle of Staves and Swords</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ebethan Game Designs is pleased to present a new Druidic archetype to use with Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Fifth Edition: the Circle of Staves and Swords!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join a tradition of fierce guardians of the natural order. The Circle of Staves and Swords shirk the overuse of natural magic and shapeshifting abilities. The wanton use of such gifts is an affront to nature herself. There is a reason she gave us our mortal erudition, and it was not to emulate or recreate her thunderstorms or wolf packs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is so we could fight those who would corrupt and destroy the natural world. You must use a civilized mind to fight such a foe, and that means not giving into your feral instincts. Once you balance your sapient mind with the gifts of nature, you will make the perfect guardian of the world: an ally to those who see your wisdom, and a slayer of abominable monstrosities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
