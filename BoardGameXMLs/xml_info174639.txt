			<description>from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the electronic release of the BioMet Infection RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a few pages, the game contains the background setting, in classic cyberpunk style, the adventure seed, the characters' sheets to play with, and the instruction for the Master. This is all you need for a few sessions of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BioMet Infection is a cyberpunk RPG for 4 players and a Master, inspired by John Harper's Lady Blackbird, based on mechanics vaguely resembling Vincent Baker's Apocalypse World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A known scientist is found dead; his body is revealed to be the one of a mutant, and the agent in charge of the case is mysteriously killed. An unknown virus called BioMet is spreading into cybernetic implants like a cancer. The sprawl is in turmoil, divided between criminals, cyberpunks and mutant rebels. Multiple reports indicate the appearance of the so-called MetZ, once humans, now infected cyborgs. Four special agents are called to investigate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
