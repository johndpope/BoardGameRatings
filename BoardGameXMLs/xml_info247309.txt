			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a list of 100 books on survivalism that players might find on a bookshelf. The books are mostly suitable for a modern setting, as the vast majority were first published in the late 20th century, although some are older.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survivalist books do not just cover guns, ammunition and defence; these books also cover subjects such as surviving in the wild, hunting, gathering, growing and storing food, medicine and dentistry, prepping and pre-20th century skills, such as smithing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entries have the book's name, author, if known, and in every case other details, in particular the area that the book covers. They can be used to pad out a bookshelf with other genuine material, although it is unlikely that any one person would have books on the whole range of subject material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some examples are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;71. The Book of Basic Machines: The U.S. Navy Training Manual by U.S. Navy (Machines from the lever through pulleys to the internal combustion engine)&lt;br/&gt;72. The Book of Blacksmithing by Michael Cardiff (Setting up a blacksmith's shop and 15 simple projects, including knives and decorative items)&lt;br/&gt;73. The Encyclopedia of Country Living, 40th Anniversary Edition: The Original Manual of Living Off the Land &amp;amp; Doing It Yourself by Carla Emery (Buy land, cultivate a garden, including herbs, raising, housing and getting food from farm animals, making sausages and bread and wood stove cooking)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
