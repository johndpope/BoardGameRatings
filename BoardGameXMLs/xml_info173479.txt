			<description>A Steampunk Card Game of Adventure Across the Multiverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine, beyond the bounds of your world that there are in fact several worlds, several Alternate Realities. Each more fantastic than the last all given life and connected by the pure power of thought, creativity, and terror harnessed in a mystical energy source called &amp;quot;Aether&amp;quot;. These Realities exist tethered together in a tumultuous ever growing and ever changing Multiverse. While most worlds are blissfully ignorant many know of it's existence and even travel between the Realities seeking knowledge, riches or power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twisted Skies is a Steampunk card game of Adventure and Intrigue set in the fabulous adventures of the AIRSHIP ISABELLA. Players cooperate to complete daring missions at the start of the game but will double cross and challenge each other as they near victory. Can you master the Steampunk Multiverse?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take control of an elite airship. By manning and equipping the ship and crew, players take turns attempting to complete mission cards in an attempt to earn enough Victory Points to win.  Other players can try to Interrupt the current player from succeeding at a mission, or can form alliances to help each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twisted Skies is played in a sequence of Phases that make up each player&amp;rsquo;s turn. Players take their turns one at a time proceeding clockwise around a table. The active player taking&lt;br/&gt;their turn is known as the Mission Attempter The Sequence of play for the phases of a turn are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Ready all Exhausted Cards&lt;br/&gt;2. Draw one Manifest Card&lt;br/&gt;3. First Drop. Place one Crew card into play or Equip a Tech card&lt;br/&gt;4. Open Trading. Players openly trade cards with the Mission Attempter&lt;br/&gt;5. Draw one Catalyst Card. If it is a Mission Card place it on the Table.&lt;br/&gt;6. Mission Attempt. The Mission Attempter tries to gain points by completing Missions.&lt;br/&gt;7. Pirate Trading. Players blindly trade cards from their hands with the Mission Attempter&lt;br/&gt;8. Second Drop. Place one Crew card into play or Equip a Tech card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has made the Second Drop (and resolved any effect of that Drop) then their turn is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
