			<description>The Gig is a dice drafting jazz improv game by Robb Smigielski and Jamie Gray, in which players must work together - whilst vying for the spotlight themselves - to complete one of several playable songs, whilst independently crafting their own solos in a roll-and-write mini-puzzle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start each turn by bidding for leadership with one of their five instrument cards (labelled 1-5, higher numbers allowing them to act sooner.) Players must choose carefully - each of their instrument cards, once played, will remain discarded until all five have been used, and playing the same number as another player will deplete the Audience Enthusiasm that in turn affects how many points players can score from continuing the song.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then draft dice in order, with the first player becoming 'The Leader' (able to gain extra points) and the last player becoming 'The Backup' (who can draft dice that will otherwise only be available next round.) On their turn, players can draft dice: notably, they may a) take one die and change the color or value, b) take two as they are, or c) return three dice to the bag, re-draw them, and use those.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing dice to the song, players must place dice in keeping with the songs unique puzzle. Playing dice to the song will gain the player points equal to the current Audience Enthusiasm level, and if the die matches the player's instrument, will boost their share of the 'area control' scoring of the song at the end of the game. Over time, players can also build their solos, on a roll-and-write board of smaller, simpler puzzles that interconnect with one another. When each small puzzle is completed, players can hand them in for a set number of points, as well as a boost to the Audience Enthusiasm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the song is complete and the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
