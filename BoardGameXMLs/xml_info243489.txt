							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bookshelf Stuffer, Vol. 12: Midnight Reads</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not uncommon for the starring characters of a fantasy adventure to find their selves picking a book off of a shelf. They may be trying to find a secret door, looking for more magical manuals, or simply browsing for something to read. But what kind of book did they retrieve? Who is the author? What is the title of the book? In this twelve volume of The Bookshelf Stuffer there are twenty possible books for the characters to come across, complete with information regarding the race or culture that the book was written and published for, who the author was, a brief description, and the average value of the book. The books in this edition represent the library selections most interesting to characters wanting a bit of something to read during the darkness and gloom of night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
