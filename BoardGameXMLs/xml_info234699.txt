			<description>Shadows in the Void is a unique spacefighter combat miniature wargame based on highly modified core rules of Hind Commander (mainly simplified and streamlined) and inspired by classic ancient Chinese military treatise The Art of War. Unlike most games within the genre, Shadows in the Void focuses on stealth, electronic warfare, and the interactions between spacecraft in your squadron. It certainly is not a &amp;ldquo;Red Baron in space&amp;rdquo; ruleset &amp;ndash; you won&amp;rsquo;t see many dogfights during the battles. Why would advanced war machines of the far future use tactics which became obsolete in mid-20th century? Of course, they look very appealing on screen, but not necessarily on the gaming table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the moment of release, the miniature range will cover all units from two of the five races, with the remaining ones released gradually in later waves. The miniature scale of choice is 3mm, and the Shadows in the Void range is designed to be compatible with Odzia≈Ç &amp;Oacute;smy PSF 1/600 sci-fi range. The miniatures will be produced in small series, with frequent additions of new versions of earlier units &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s boring to sell the same miniatures all time, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
