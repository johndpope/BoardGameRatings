			<description>The sequin-drenched box is almost as irresistible as this tell-all game, where players must guess what happened and how! Have you told off a boss? Made out with someone in a closet? Players work together to build on the story and speculate using situation cards until the moment the truth is revealed with a swipe of the gold sequined box &amp;ndash; Yeah or NOPE. You&amp;rsquo;ll blush, you&amp;rsquo;ll giggle, you&amp;rsquo;ll gasp&amp;hellip; because you never know the whole truth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;information provided by publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
