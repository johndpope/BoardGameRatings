			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character creation involves distributing points from a pool into Attributes (Body, Dexterity, Knowledge, Aura, and Weapon Skill; and distributing points from another pool into Skills.  While the game aligns Attributes with card suits this appears to have no actual effect on play.  Likewise, the game presents a method of improving Skill Ranks but ranks have no actual effect on play.  Instead, a character may use a Skill only if they have at least one rank in it.  All actions are resolved by the game master flipping a card from the deck--an 8 or higher is success; no modifiers are used.  Combat works essentially the same way except the card is not compared to 8 but the opponent's relevant weapon Skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules would require adjudication and various rulings to be fully useful in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
