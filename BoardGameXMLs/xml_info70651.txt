			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you a parent who wants to share the fun of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons with your kids, but you're worried that the rules are too complicated or a standard adventure would tax their attention spans? Are you a teacher or librarian who would like to introduce your students to the game, but you're reluctant to take on the regular time commitment of a full-blown campaign?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a great many reasons to share D&amp;amp;D with kids. Besides being just the kind of imaginative play that kids naturally engage in, Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons develops an array of essential educational skills, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Math skills&lt;br/&gt;     Reading skills&lt;br/&gt;     Writing skills&lt;br/&gt;     Cooperation and leadership&lt;br/&gt;     Problem-solving&lt;br/&gt;     Creative thinking&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've heard from many of you out there that you've been wanting to unlock these benefits for your kids, but you feel that they're not ready for the basic game or you just don&amp;rsquo;t have the time to run your own campaign. So we put together this variation, based on the new novel for young readers, Monster Slayers by Lukas Ritter. Monster Slayers: The Heroes of Hesiod captures the flavor, fun, and educational benefits of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons in a fast-paced, easy-to-learn experience for kids ages six years old and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster Slayers: The Heroes of Hesiod requires no previous knowledge of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, and all you need to play is included in this adventure, aside from a few dice and pencils (and some friends to play it with). Play time can be as little as fifteen minutes or as long as an hour, depending on how many monsters you run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster Slayers: The Heroes of Hesiod isn't just for kids. It's also a fun diversion for experienced players who need their D&amp;amp;D fix but don&amp;rsquo;t have the time for a full-length game. Or share it with your non-gamer family and friends who claim to be intimidated by the rules of the game. It won&amp;rsquo;t be long before they're hooked on the game you love!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Give it a try and let us know what you think!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
