			<description>The hilarious charades game for the whole family! Can you imagine Dracula brushing his teeth or a frog cooking? In this charades game for the whole family you get to act many crazy and funny things. Roll the two colour dice to decide who you are and what you do, and the other players try to guess it from your gestures, moves and facial expressions. If someone guesses correctly, both you and the guesser move forward on the game pad &amp;ndash; but beware of laugh attacks, since a player who laughs at the actor has to move one step back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
