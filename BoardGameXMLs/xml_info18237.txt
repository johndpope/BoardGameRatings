							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Car Game</name>
									
			<description>The Car Game is Whist-type, trick-taking card game made by Castell Brothers, under the Pepys brand, in the 1960's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cars featured include the Ford Zodiac, Rolls Royce, Bentley Continental, Vauxhall Velox, BRM Formula 1 car, Jaguar, Cooper Formula 1 racing car, Triumph TR3, Donald Campbell's famous Bluebird...and many more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to win cards, and to win cards one must win tricks.&lt;br/&gt;Briefly, cards are dealt to the player, further cards are turned up until a CAR-CLASS card appears. Players now choose 3 cards from their hands, which together will give a good points score for that Class of Car. They place their 3 cards face-down and all turn them over together. The set of 3 scoring most points for that Class wins, and the winner take&lt;br/&gt;all the cards from the table which show that Class, and any Bluebird cards. These are set aside and kept by the winner. The cards left on the table are returned to the players' hands.&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until the last CAR-CLASS card has been played for.&lt;br/&gt;Players count up all cards they have won (BLUEBIRD and TRIO cards) counting 1 point per card, and deducting 1 point for each card left in their hands.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to score an agreed number of points. For 4 players to reach 50 points will require about 6 or 7 games. For 2 players, 100 points will require about the same number of games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is the same as in the PLANES GAME and GIRL from the same publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
