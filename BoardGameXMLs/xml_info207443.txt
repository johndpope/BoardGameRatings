			<description>We Were Not Cowards: Sedan 1870 &amp;amp; The Fall of the Second Empire is a grand tactical scale wargame by Ray Weiss covering the final desperate battle for Sedan in what amounted to Napoleon the III's last day in power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses Kevin Zucker's The Library of Napoleonic Battles series rules as a base and builds upon those to simulate the intricacies of military operations representing all levels of command and control. Units are at a brigade, division, squadron, or battery scale, with 1000 men per infantry Strength Point. Turns are approximately 1 hour each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game not only covers the somewhat hopeless historical battle, but also explores several &amp;quot;What if?&amp;quot; scenarios that explore what may have happened had Durcot retained command after MacMahon was wounded from Wimpiffen and ordered a retreat towards Paris. There are 2 other &amp;quot;What If?&amp;quot; scenarios that allow the french to respond to the Prussian encirclement which occurred a day before the actual battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
