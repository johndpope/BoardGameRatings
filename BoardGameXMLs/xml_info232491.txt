							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forgotten Lands</name>
									
			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you re-discover the Forgotten Lands? Evidence has surfaced of a civilization lost to time. Historical clues have led your archaeological team to the general area where they existed, but now you must find the exact location of their sacred sites and buildings. You're not the only one looking however so you'll need to hurry if you want to claim the discovery for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this solo roll and write game, you'll enter numbers into the search areas for four lost sacred sites/buildings. You're goal is to match the total for each row and column to a target number. The better that you're able to do this, the quicker your team can locate the site and the higher you'll score. Take too long and a rival archaeological team will find it first and you'll get no points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you search for the first three sacred sites: the Altar of Offerings, the Observatory, and the Grand Temple, you'll find clues leading you to the general location of a fourth huge site known as the Tomb of Kings. You'll use those clues to unlock that location and then search for it as well. The Tomb of Kings has the potential to earn you the most points, but is also the most difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
