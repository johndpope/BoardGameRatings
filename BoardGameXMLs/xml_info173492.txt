			<description>In a distant kingdom, the royal palace is in turmoil.  After one of the king's tasters dies of poisoning, the king no longer knows who to trust within his closest circle of confidants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is the Queen, who he married to secure the relationship with the neighboring kingdom, but who does not share the love he has for her.  Their daughter, the Princess, next in line to inherent the crown and friends with enemies of the king.  The Bishop, who has spoken aloud that the king should be replaced by a spiritual leader.  The Knight, just back from war with the neighboring kingdom and in a rage that the war had ended through marriage and not bloodshed.   The Rook, who has become senile in his old age and now wandering the halls of the castle aimlessly.  And the Pawn, ready to rise up in the ranks of the royalty by any means necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you help protect the king through the seasons of time and ensure that he remains atop his throne?  Or will the tyrants prevail and take his crown from you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;En Passant (from French: in passing) is a special move in chess that allows an opponent to capture another pawn &amp;quot;as it passes&amp;quot; which was the inspiration for this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this 16-card playing card game each player is dealt four cards.  The player with the King card in their hand goes first.  Starting with that player, each player plays a card and performs the action listed.  For example, one card may have you steal another players card.  Or another card may have everyone pass their hands to the player on their left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to keep track of the King Card as he travels from player to player.  Once someone is only left with one card the round ends and the player with the King Card gets a point.  The first player to 3 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
