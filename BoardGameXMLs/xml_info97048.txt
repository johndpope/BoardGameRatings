							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ultimate Monsters</name>
									
			<description>From the Back Cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is a dangerous place, filled with all manner of perils from villains and evil-doers to the local terrain; all seem intent on putting an end to the lives of those who would dare stand against them. So in the face of such perils one would ask what could be worse, what terror could summon such feelings of dread as to incapacitate its prey? The answer is simple; the unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the hunters become the hunted there is little to fall back on and even the trusty sword can only provide so much protection. Now you will have knowledge; knowledge that even the most hardened of warriors would be unwise to scoff at.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bringing together a collection of vile and horrifying creatures with which to populate the dark places of your fantasy worlds and reside your character's nightmares, Ultimate Monsters has been developed to aid both players and Games Masters alike as they venture into a wider and more dangerous world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
