							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Drunken Hermit</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town of Hermit&amp;rsquo;s Rock is waking up. Once again folks are opening businesses there and settling old caves. Nilgen Kastmire is ignorant of the history of the place. But his kids needed a fresh start, so he opened a tavern there. Too bad. It&amp;rsquo;s sad, but without your help, he&amp;rsquo;s likely going to die there. He should listen to his patron, old Andrew, always at the bar, telling whoever is buying how Sorrows Keep got its name. Or he could listen to his restless wife. Maybe she&amp;rsquo;s going to discover the were-creatures repopulating the depths of the dead city. Maybe she&amp;rsquo;ll take a shine to Oiveren, ship captain and were-crow. Maybe she&amp;rsquo;ll convert. If you&amp;rsquo;re shrewd about the trajectory of history and can read the bones of time, please, wise-up Nilgen. Interpret the dangers encroaching around him. Keep Nilgen alive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
