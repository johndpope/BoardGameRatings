			<description>Hunt the Higgs is an educational card game intended to introduce schoolchildren to a few of the basics of particle physics. Cards represent &amp;quot;bosons&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;final states&amp;quot; and experimental events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns in trying to pair a boson with a final state from their hand to make as a high a score as possible. These scores are hidden from other players and the player with the highest card combinations at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An elements of tactics is introduced with the experiment cards which can either boost your own experiments or interfere with those of other players. Play of one of these experiment cards is the mechanic that causes the game to end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
