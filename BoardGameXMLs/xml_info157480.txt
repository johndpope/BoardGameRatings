			<description>A game of illustrating ridiculous randomly generated phrases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has four decks of cards separated by parts of speech. Each player draws 5 cards: 1 adjective, 2 nouns, 1 verb, and 1 adverb. These 5 words make the phrase the player will illustrate. All the players keep their words secret while they draw their own phrases. When everyone finishes, the group works together trying to guess the words that each artist had based on their drawings. Each correct word guessed earns the artist two points, while each close, but not exact word earns the artist 1 point. The player with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since it&amp;rsquo;s a game about creativity, adapting the game and playing by house rules are encouraged. For instance, younger players may want to only draw 4 cards (skipping the adverb) to adjust the game to fit their level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While groups of 2-8 players work best, the game can be played alone as a drawing exercise or even in a group of up to 54 players each with their own 5-card phrase!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Includes: 54 red Adjective cards, 108 yellow Noun Cards, 54 green Verb cards, 54 blue Adverb cards, 8 small pencils, and a pad a paper. Instructions on box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
