			<description>Publisher's Catalog&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the captain of a federation starship battle cruiser. Your mission is to run an enemy blockade and to deliver vital supplies to federation forces under siege on planet M/5. You control your ship's course and speed along with the firing of its weapons. You will have to fight battle after battle successfully to reach your destination. Besides the enemy, you will have to cope with ship malfunctions and ion storms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a sophisticated game providing ship status reports, sensor scans and graphic displays of the enemy ship, weapons tracks and shield hits. It also displays appropriate warnings and messages. You'll find this game faster paced and more challenging than many of the star treks on the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
