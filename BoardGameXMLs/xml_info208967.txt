							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eastern Highlands</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Legendary Adventures - Eastern Highlands, we visit a remote region of the world known as the Ironhills, more specifically the small, isolated village of Netherknell, which resides high up along the eastern stretch of the hills. This industrious frontier location lies far from the sanctuary and safety of civilization, instead serving as a gateway to the wild M&amp;oacute;l Aerie mountains beyond. In short, a place where danger and peril are omnipresent companions. However, such worrisome concerns are nothing new to the people of Netherknell, who boldly face such threats with the same stoic resolve and determination that they always have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the pages of Eastern Highlands you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Ironhills Region. Information on the Ironhills region, including sections on the settlements of Berxley, Howe, Hyrstmill, Heswyn, King's Landing, and Grumheim. Plus, notes on other points-of-interest, key locations, and adventuring opportunities within the highlands.&lt;br/&gt;    The Village of Netherknell. An expansive gazetteer on the village of Netherknell, which includes detailed biographical information on the NPCs who live there, their businesses, society, and more.&lt;br/&gt;    Content, Content, Content. Eastern Highlands includes 12 amazing quests for your players to undertake. The majority of which can be easily transplanted into another setting or campaign. In addition to quests, Eastern Highlands features more than a dozen random encounter charts - enough to keep your players happy for many, many sessions.&lt;br/&gt;    New Rules. Though fairly light on new rules, Eastern Highlands does include original statistical information for 3 NPCs, plus a player handout that features in one of the quests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
