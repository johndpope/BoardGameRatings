			<description>Publisher's description from front cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Could YOU have led the disastrous British commando raid on Rommel's HQ to victory instead of defeat? Have you got what it takes to jump out of a plane in a German uniform on a moonless night, knowing if you are captured you will be shot as a Spy? Have you ever wanted to blow up an airfield? Here's your chance!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Submachine Gun is a role-playing game featuring commando raids of the Second World War. It contains complete, easy to understand rules for arming and leading both the raiders and the defenders, including sections on: American, British and German small arms plus tanks, bunkers, flamethrowers, mines, demolition charges, martial arts, artillery, night raids, use of German uniforms, garrison confusion and much more. The only other things you need are paper, pencil, some dice, imagination and guts. Good luck!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
