							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hexadelic</name>
									
			<description>The Hexadelic equipment consists of 68 diamond-shaped tiles, 14 triangular tiles, 6 tile racks, and a board. The board is divided into triangles which are grouped into hexagons of various colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a hand of diamond tiles and plays one on each turn, in such a way as to match the tile and board colors (the triangles making up each diamond tile may be the same color or two different colors). Triangular tiles may be drawn and used to complete hexagons. Completing a hexagon (by any means) scores points based on the hexagon's color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
