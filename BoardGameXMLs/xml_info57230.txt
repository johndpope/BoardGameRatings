							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bindle Rails Expansion #1: Imperial Mexican Railway</name>
									
			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available Now For Print and Play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion is now available for Bindle Rails and involves running track between Mexico City and the Atlantic.  The object is to hook up these two regions and join as many resources and cities up along the way.  If you aren't able to make it across the mountains, you lose - but run enough rail and you will be considered a visionary among your contempories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to downloading and printing the PDF's, you will need 27 Event Cards from the original Bindle Rails game as well as most of the cubes.  If you need to print out cards for the expansion, please refer to the main game page to direct you to the PDF that will allow you to print the cards.  The mats, Goal Cards and Manager cards are not used in this variant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
