			<description>An abstract simulation of American football.  The blurb below doesn't mention it, but the pieces are wooden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---begin quote from publisher's flyer---&lt;br/&gt;SCOOZIE is a game created to simulate football running and passing plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Offensive team has one runner (ball carrier), two receivers, and 8 guards.  This team also has the ball!  The Defense has eleven tackles.  Points are scored by advancing the Offensive ball carrier on the playing field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is a classically beautiful, strikingly original grid pattern with intricate route ways for the ball carrier to travel, and a system of circles with &amp;quot;diamond spaces&amp;quot; that let guards and tackles cut across the field.  The sculptured playing pieces can grapple each other in strategically located blocking positions.  The ball carrier can pass the ball to any eligible receiver.  A terrific game for pure strategy lovers, and a splendid simulation for football bluffs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elegant hand finished 16x16&amp;quot; wood board with superbly silk screened playing field adds a visual pleasure to the challenge and fascination of the game-play itself.  In leather-like gift box with felt pouch for pieces.  Thoroughly detailed and illustrated rule book.&lt;br/&gt;---end quote from publisher's flyer ---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
