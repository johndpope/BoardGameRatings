			<description>The labyrinth in the magic garden is constantly changing. By clever rotating the magical hedges, players open new paths to mysterious creatures and precious treasures. Magic cards help to fulfill the tasks. Who masters the turns and finds his way out of the magic garden first?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new twist at the changing labyrinth. This time, the paths are bordered by hedges, which can be rotated to change the paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a stack of cards that direct him to various places in the labyrinth. In his turn, the player moves his pawn along the path; he may also rotate one hedge before, during or after his move. If he reaches his current target, he turns his next target card face up. Otherwise, he gets a magic card as consolation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The magic cards can be used during a players turn to aid movement. A hole allows to slip through a hedge. Two fairies allow to fly from one fairy spot to another one, ignoring the terrain in between. A player may use any number of magic cards in his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a player has visited the targets on his six cards, the other players decide which exit he needs to reach to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
