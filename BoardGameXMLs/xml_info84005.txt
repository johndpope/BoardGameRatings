			<description>In Lines of Fire you must protect your castle by sending Goblins, Swordsmen,  Knights, Orcs, and Dragons into battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will strategically form an army using vertical and horizontal lines of offense and defense. When battle starts, the more powerful unit will defeat the other. The first to reach, and destroy their opponents castle will win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is simple. Each player has a castle and a 20-sided die. The die is used as a counter to represent the amount of damage the castle can take before it's destroyed. In order to protect the castle, each player will draw cards. Players will draw creatures with powers of 1 through 5. The higher the number, the more powerful the creature. The creatures are strategically placed in lines using one of 4 horizontal positions in front of the castle. If at any point an &amp;quot;Attack&amp;quot; card is played, the front line of each players army will attack each other in a head to head battle. The creature with higher power will destroy the other. Unused power will be applied to the creature behind the defeated creature. If a player is eventually able to successfully deal damage to another player's castle, the castle takes damage. If a castle is brought to zero, that owner of that castle loses and the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
