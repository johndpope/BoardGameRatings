			<description>HIJACK is a roll and move game, players are long haul truck drivers, picking up and dropping off loads at different cities in the US and Canada, making a living and avoiding HIJACK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a map of northern North America, part of Mexico is shown, but the paths between cities do not go there.  Most cities have two or three paths leading to/from them, but some (Detroit, Jacksonville, New Orleans) only have one way in or out. Spaces on the paths reward or penalize players, moving your Big Rig back or forward spaces, rewarding your good deeds with cash, or fining you for speeding, for instance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three decks of cards, Load, Partial Load, and Destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pack of money, printed for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 Trailer Title cards, 4 Truck Insurance cards, and 4 wooden Big Rigs, apparently cut out by a band saw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also two other wooden pieces, I think these are tractors minus their trailers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professionally printed (it has a bar code), no designer, artist or publisher credits.  No rules in the only copy I have found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have a copy of this game I found going through my archive. The publisher is LAD Game Company, PO Box 926, Salem, OR 97308. I suspect I purchased this new from my FLGS (which has been out of business for over 25 years). My copy only has 4 tractor pieces, no trailers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UPDATE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I know the person/people that made this game. I will update with instructions pictures to follow. I will also add different pictures showing actual game pieces in the coming days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
