			<description>You are a gang leader and your aim is to become the Patron of the city. In order to do this, you will recruit and use your henchmen to manage traffic and take control of the neighborhoods, in short, anything that will get you up into the Mob.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gangs City is based on a mechanism of laydown tiles where the characters perform different actions (fight, recruitment or traffic) according to  the direction of their tile and where their location. During a turn, you place your characters, one by one, trying to assess the tactics your opponents to not let yourself overwhelmed by the other gangs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
