							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Pau&#039;ans: The University of Sanbra Guide to Intelligent Life</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pau&amp;rsquo;ans are a tall, gray-skinned species of humanoids with sunken eyes and wrinkled skin. Gaunt and with sharp teeth that clearly indicate carnivorous tendencies, Pau&amp;rsquo;ans move with a deliberate pace and have soft, gravelly voices that are calming to hear. Pau&amp;rsquo;ans are taller than most humans (though not as tall as Wookiees) and have long, slender fingers that end in nails that closely resemble talons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xenobiologists from the University of Sanbra have uncovered connections between the Pau&amp;rsquo;ans and the Utai, the smaller species with whom they share the planet of Utapau. Genetic sampling has confirmed a few tenuous biological links, though the exact evolutionary process by which the Pau&amp;rsquo;an species developed separately from the Utai is still a mystery. Xenoanthropologists date the first Pau&amp;rsquo;an civilizations back almost 57,000 years before the Battle of Yavin, making theirs one of the youngest known civilizations. Though no written history of this time exists, scientists currently theorize that the long-lived Pau&amp;rsquo;ans are genetically closer to their progenitor species, and that as a result of their longevity the Pau&amp;rsquo;ans have likely only evolved a very little since the planet was settled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
