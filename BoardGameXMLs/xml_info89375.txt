			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NBA Street V3 is the third game in EA&amp;rsquo;s NBA Street 3-on-3 basketball series. The game is based on streetball matches that emphasize tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three game modes: Play Now, Street Challenge, and Dunk Contest. Play Now allows players to set up an exhibition game using any of the unlocked players and courts. The Dunk Contest is a competition to perform the best dunks by using chains of tricks. Street Challenge is the career mode where players create a team and attempt to become the best squad in the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matches are played to 21 points, with dunks worth 1 point and 3-pointers worth 2. Street V3 has a large trick library and, when tricks are performed successfully, a power bar is filled. When the power bar is full, a team can perform a Gamebreaker. If the Gamebreaker is initiated inside the 3-point line, the player will start an elaborate dunk that can be enhanced by performing tricks and passing the ball. When the basket is worth 2 to 4 points, depending on how many tricks were completed, and the other team loses 1 point. In pro matches the bonus are increased to 3 to 5 and -2, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Street V3 has an elaborate character creator that can be used to invent a wide range of players. Players can also customize courts. This game was the first in the series that featured online capabilities for the PS2 and Xbox versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
