			<description>Plotwise, Delicious: Emily's New Beginning picks up where Emily's Honeymoon Cruise left off.  The core gameplay of the game is the same as always, with all the variety that engine brings; however something that is new in this game is the ability to choose which dishes to serve to the customers who are likely to come, according to the forecast.  This element gives you more control, and allows you to aim for bigger tips by delighting your customers with their favorite dishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary by zefquaavius&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
