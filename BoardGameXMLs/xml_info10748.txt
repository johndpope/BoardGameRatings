			<description>Poka-Tile is a very simple adaptation of poker to a boardgame.  There are 108 square tiles depicting a double deck of cards plus jokers.  Each player has 4 tiles in hand (on a rack) at a time and must play them to form a row of exactly 5 tiles (the first player has a bonus space to play from).  Extra tiles are discarded, so there is no hand management aspect.  Rules are provided for draw and 7-tile variants, neither of which adds much to the basic idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
