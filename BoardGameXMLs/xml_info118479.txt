			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back in 2005 Top Fashion Games went out on a left field limb and released a very different sort of product entitled Fantasy Fungi. As this product was rather unique in subject and content the speculation was that the game market audience would either love it, kinda like it, or flat out hate it. At Top Fashion Games we were dreaming of the &amp;ldquo;loving it&amp;rdquo;, figuring on (with fingers crossed) the &amp;ldquo;kinda liking it&amp;rdquo;, and fearing the &amp;ldquo;flat out hating it&amp;rdquo;. Much to our surprise the results of the pdf release gave our humble company quite a few 5 star ratings and Fantasy Fungi has become one of our most profitable sellers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though future releases of Fantasy Fungi were speculated we never intended for the first release to be a &amp;ldquo;core book&amp;rdquo; of any sort and as such there has been a bit of difficulty of reintroducing the nature of our game system fungi in other products without having to repeat a bit of lengthy terminologies and explanations. As such, it was decided that we should release a new fungus book that would serve as a core rules system. Such a product should carry the appropriate information regarding the make up of the logical rules surrounding the fungi and should also carry any initial needed extras, such as important or extremely useful feats, monsters, and so forth. Finally, in order to make such core rules regarding fungi extremely accessible the pdf book should be offered for free over the net.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pdf that you are now looking at is the results of this decision. By taking a wee bit from the first Fantasy Fungi book and adding in a great deal of new, fresh material we have created the &amp;ldquo;core fungus&amp;rdquo; book of our desired intentions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
