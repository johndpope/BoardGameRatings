			<description>Homestretch, the wild, wacky, horse race game where four steeds, cabbage, banana, girdle and beetle bohm, stand on springs.  The race begins with a spin and they're off.  Each player moves one of his horse's legs by the direction of the spinner.  The object is to move your horse down the track and split away from the bunch.  Each player must move his horse over a fence and hedgerow.  As you move your horse into the stretch and down to the finish line, try to avoid getting all tangled up, or your horse may be left trailing the pack.  The first player to have two of his horses feet across the finish line wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
