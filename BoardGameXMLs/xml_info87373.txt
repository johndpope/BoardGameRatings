							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BEAN! The D2 RPG</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;BEAN! is an easy-to-master, rules-lite, d2 RPG system, and the latest stand-alone title from the Fabled Worlds RPG game system! Perfect for introducing new players or children to the hobby, BEAN! is also great for veteran gamers who enjoy flexibility in their rules. Complete in one simple volume, spend less time reading and more time playing! The highly versatile and customizable d2 game system is unique and quickly memorized, so simple, yet able to handle any situation on the spot, without having to thumb through volumes of obscure rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best part? You get to toss your beans! With a d2 dice system, you could use standard dice for &amp;quot;high or low&amp;quot; &amp;quot;odd or even&amp;quot; rolls, you could toss coins or any other objects that have two distinct sides, but we recommend plain ol' beans! They're cheap and plentiful, some people really enjoy customizing their own beans, and a handful of beans keeps the game moving along quick and easy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
