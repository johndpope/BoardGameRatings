			<description>Children&amp;acute;s trivia game themed on the movies of Astrid Lindgren. The deck of movie cards is shuffled and one card is turned face up. Players roll the die and move their pawn on the board. This is divided into several squares, each with a picture from a movie based on a book by Astrid Lindgren. If your pawn lands on a square containing the same picture as the one on the card, then you get that card. The next card is turned face up, and so on. Players may either just move according to the die, or they may try to land on one of the squares with a question mark. If they do, one of the other players picks up the top quiz card and reads the question with the same number as the number on the die. So, if you roll a five and land on a question mark, you will have to answer question number five. The questions are all about movies based on the books of Astrid Lindgren. One side of the die is marked with an arrow, and if you roll the arrow you just pick up the current card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card equals one victory point, and three cards of the same movie will earn you bonus points. The player with the most points when all cards are taken is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameboard&lt;br/&gt;430 questions on 86 cards&lt;br/&gt;24 movie cards&lt;br/&gt;4 pawns&lt;br/&gt;1 die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also released in a Norwegian edition with 350 questions on 75 cards, and 16 additional puzzle cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
