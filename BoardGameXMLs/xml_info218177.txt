			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Native Wars is a competitive, two-player card game, where players manage their tribe decks to capture the most territories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game features unique card and dice play. Players' cards are numbered in which you have to roll two dice to activate them by the total sum of your roll. Their card effects guide your tactical actions in the game through manipulating cards in play, attacking the enemy, or granting war power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will need to recruit the best tribe members by collecting copper and paying for their costs. You then need to decide which tribe members will go into certain territories to take on your opponent's tribe. Be the first team to capture two out of the five territories to win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
