							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hexostrategy: 300 Spartans</name>
									
			<description>300 Spartans is a classic step-by-step strategy game, i.e. players make moves in turn by moving their troops on a map and roll dice to learn the results of their actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is dedicated to the events of the Greek-Persian wars. One player commands the Persian army and the other leads the Greek militia. The game has 3 levels - financial-political, strategic, and tactical. It means that a player collects money, forms an army, leads them in marches, and commands them in a battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can be used as a strategy module for the Age of Battles system. In this case you should add some sets to it, the first of which should be the Greek and Persian cavalry. The strategy rules stay the same, but the tactics of the Age of Battles system are used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
