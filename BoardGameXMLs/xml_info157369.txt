			<description>The title is more recognisable to English speakers as&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Eeny Meeny Miney Moe&lt;br/&gt;Catch a ****** by his toe&lt;br/&gt;If he wriggles, let him go&lt;br/&gt;Eeny Meeny Miney Moe&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card game. 32 cards in four sets of eight. Each set is in the same colour and is numbered from one to eight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four cards are dealt to each player and 4 are turned up in the middle of the table. The rest are placed in a stack to the side. Each turn a player may exchange one card from his hand with one from the middle. Or, he can take all four cards with his hand. After everyone has had a turn and nobody has exchanged a card, the four in the middle are replaced by four new cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to collect together 4 cards of the same colour or four cards of any colours that have four numbers in consecutive order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you achieve either of the two objectives, you lay down your hand. All the other players now reveal their hands. For each card not in any order, they score one to three points. In effect, this means that they will score one to three points. After nine rounds of play, the player with the highest score, loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
