							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Knights of the Chalice</name>
									
			<description>From the Game's Website&lt;br/&gt;Knights of the Chalice is a classical turn-based, party-based CRPG, where your foes are cunning and will do their best to crush you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Never before in a game you've seen your opponent push you into flame or align your companions in order to throw a spell at them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a classical dungeon crawling RPG in a fantasy world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knights of the Chalice is a PC computer role-playing game (CRPG) for Windows loosely based upon the Open Game Licence 3.5 (OGL), the set of rules at the root of the popular pen-and-paper role-playing game  Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Edition 3.5, made by Wizards of the Coast. However, many changes had to be made to apply a set of rules designed for a pen-and-paper game to a computer game. As per the terms of the Open Game Licence, it is clearly indicated within the game which parts follow the OGL exactly and which do not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, you create a party of four adventurers - the player characters. Unlike some other games, you do not get to recruit companions later in the game. For each player character you choose a class - Fighter, Wizard or Cleric - and a race - Human, Half-Elf or Half-Dwarf (Mul). The characters immediately start in the tower of the Knights of the Chalice, where they receive a mission - to look for a knight who has gone missing. After this briefing, the players can explore the tower then leave the place and try to complete their mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
