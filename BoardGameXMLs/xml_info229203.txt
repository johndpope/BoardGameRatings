			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can You Resist the Howling Lament of Doom- from the Keener!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;From on high he sent fire, sent it down into my bones. He spread a net for my feet and turned me back. He made me desolate, faint all the day long.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Lamentations 1:13&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential energy of grief coupled with the hope of life (or unlife) eternal is a largely untapped source of power in the battle between good and evil, tyranny and freedom.  Professional and ecclesiastical mourners for the honored dead, called keeners, focus their energies on the laments and threnodies that cross that line between the living and the dead. Their utterances have great power to heal, destroy the living and the unliving, and they have magic power of considerable strength to impose their will on the world.  Welcome to Aaron Hollingsworth&amp;rsquo;s Hybrid Class: Keener from Purple Duck Games.  This new 20-level class contains everything you need to play a fascinating new profession, who can harm or heal with her voice and speech, cast spells as a bard or cleric, and apply special conditions called laments upon her effects.  They are specialists in mourning, and know much of death and undeath, but beware whether they support good or evil!  They could be the guardian angel of comfort, or the banshee of ancient stories by a smoky fire&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
