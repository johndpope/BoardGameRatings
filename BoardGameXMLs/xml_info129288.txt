			<description>Exchange Square is a stock market simulation board game where players compete to become the first to reach Master Trader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buy and sell assets and ride on the economic highs to make the most money. Beware of the bubble bursting as other players back-stab you to get ahead in the rat race!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This turn based roll and move game involves both team work and individual insight. Players can buy four assets (Gold, Oil, Technology and Property) and then manipulate the prices of their assets by using Insider Knowledge cards. Fortune may smile on some lucky traders with the Tax &amp;amp; Benefits cards, however beware of the Event cards which can change everything in one move for all the players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
