							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thunders of Venus</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exploration of Venus was ill-fated for the British right from the start. All three of their Venus expeditions between 1874 and 1876 disappeared without a trace. The surviving expedition members could not be rescued until years later when&amp;mdash;to the embarrassment of the Empire&amp;mdash;a German zeppelin recovered them. Ever since, the British have been searching for ways to stop the decaying process the precious liftwood of their ships is exposed to on the Morning Star. The British hope to regain air supremacy on Venus now lies in the young and ingenious scientist Roger Kincaide. Over the years he has developed the so-called &amp;lsquo;Kincaide Field&amp;rsquo; and the day has come that he wants to fieldtest his invention with the airship Aphrodite. The player characters are invited to join the maiden flight. A day of celebration, that could change the course of future history&amp;mdash; if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the Thunders of Venus that turn the cruise into a fierce struggle for survival&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is set on Venus. A test flight of an experimental air ship ends in a catastrophe and the player characters, surviving crew and guests find themselves in the middle of the Venusian jungle. Will they be able to fight their way through to the next human outpost? Will they survive the threats of the jungle or will they end up as raptor food? What are they going to do when they are caught in the crossfire of a conflict between two rival Lizard-men tribes? And why can&amp;rsquo;t they shake the feeling that someone might have sabotaged the whole thing&amp;hellip;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventurers should be favorable towards the British Empire which in turn should trust them. The events in this adventure are especially suited for characters experienced in the wilderness. Be they Adventurers, Explorers, Hunters, Survivors of all kinds, Doctors or Soldiers, they will all be able to put their skills to use. However, social skills will be useful as well, so that Celebrities, Moneymen, or Academics, seemingly lost in the jungle at first, will have their chance to shine too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
