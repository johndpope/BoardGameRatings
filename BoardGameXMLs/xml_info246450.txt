			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've all seen examples of magic squares.  The most common one is a 3x3 square using the integers 1 through 9 in which the sum of each row, column and diagonal totals 15.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players alternately choose an integer (1 to 9) that has not been previously used and place it in any unfilled cell of a Tic-Tac-Toe board.  The goal is to make the sum of each row, column, and diagonal equal to 15.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game of Magic Square was written by David Ahl and published as type-in source code in Creative Computing, Vol. 1, No. 2, January/February 1974.  The program listing is in BASIC with the note:  &amp;quot;In converting...to your dialect of BASIC watch out for multiple statements on a line (indicated by a backslash) and compound IF statements.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
