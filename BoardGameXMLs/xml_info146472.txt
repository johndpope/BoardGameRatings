			<description>Catalog Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Underwater Arcades&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are tired of battling it out in outer space against marauding alien ships, then this game offers something of a difference. The idea of this game is that you control a submarine which can be moved in any direction, including diagonally with the arrow keys. Of paramount importance is to avoid all the dangers that lurk in the deep. You have to contend with depth charges and a liberal sprinkling of mines. If that is not enough, then the seabed has mountainous terrain which is continuously changing and must be avoided at all costs. The submarine carries an armament of torpedoes which can be fired either vertically or horizontally, these can be used at your discretion. For the seasoned campaigner there are five skill levels, affecting the speed of the submarine and also the number of depth charges dropped by the search vessesls. Sounds, of course, is included, however it is only fair to say that this is not one of the prime features of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
