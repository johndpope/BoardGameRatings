			<description>The first product from M.E.K.Games, ARMORY is a non-collectible, medieval fantasy card game for 2-4 players. Each player needs a 60 card deck (identical to Opponent's) The objective is to arm your 3 Combatants with their weapons and thus be first to ATTACK card your Opponent to win. Cards are the 3 Combatants, Weapons and Mystics (spells and damage), Guardians and Attack cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each player lays out his Combatants, a Player, during his turn, will have 1-3 cards to play from his hand of 7: lay out required weapons or trade-in's to seek cards he needs from his deck. He then announces he is open to attack and the Opponent will then try to strip off weapons or damage the player. When the attack is done, the next play is the Turn-Player and has 3 cards to play, etc. Defense from Opponent's attack is played from cards left in hand after the 1-3 turn-cards are played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMBATANT REQUIREMENTS: 2 Warriors each get a Shield, Helmet, Sword and Spear. 1 Archer gets a Helmet, Bow and Quiver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is configured and sold for 2 Player action (optimal play). With 3-4 players, each Player, on his turn, will tactically decide who his Opponent will be for that turn. Other players, with special cards can occasionally butt in. 3 Player action can get pretty hot because of this. 4 Player action, does get a bit slow and though able for play, is not the optimal number of players. 2-3 Players is what turns this game on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Streamlined to 11 Rules and 11 Card Tips makes this quick to learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules, FAQ, and the cards may all be seen at the game website &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.mekgames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.mekgames.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
