							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rogue/x Feats</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wily rogue is known for its ability to use deft hands and a smooth tongue to weasel one's way out of any situation. But for some of these bandits, thievery and subterfuge can only take one so far in the harsh real world. Putting those talented hands to new training and new tactics helps put a whole new spin on the roguish craft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tides of War: Rogue/X is a series of feats that will allow your rogue PC to blend more seamlessly with a variety of other classes. Many of these feats are designed to be taken as early as character level 3rd. Each of these feats is compatible with both the standard rogue as well as the unchained rogue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
