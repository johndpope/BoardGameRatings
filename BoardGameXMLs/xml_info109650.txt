							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Leap Over</name>
									
			<description>A Chinese Checkers-style game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From website;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start:   10 stones of their own color for each player on the triangular sections whose point is the center of a side of the board&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play:   Take turns jumping any one of your stones over another stone directly next to it, to an empty intersection immediately on the other side of the stone being jumped, on the same straight line from which the jump began. A stone may jump over stones of either color, in any direction on the board, and over more than one stone, as long as it touches down after each one. The jumping stone may change direction at the end of any one leap in a series. Stones on the outer edge of the board can be jumped over only by stones also on the outer edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jumps over stones at the center of any &amp;quot;pentagon&amp;quot; may follow either fork on the other side of the pentagon. Every move must be a leap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal:   To be the first player to move all stones into the opponent's start position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
