							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legio</name>
									
			<description>Legio is a turn-based strategy game for one to two players. The game takes place in a mythical fantasy world where magicians, warriors, and monsters battle for domination. Playing Legio is an intense experience, requiring careful strategic thinking, rewarding both courage and cleverness!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a mix between chess and a turn-based war game. Both players control an equal army of characters, with the goal of eliminating the other player's army. A game of Legio consists of two battles. The first takes place on the drawbridge and the second inside one of the two castle battlegrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
