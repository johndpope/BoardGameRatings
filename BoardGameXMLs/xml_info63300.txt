			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One Hell of A Job&lt;br/&gt; The city of Los Diablos, Nevada is a thriving community of crime and vice. The Lucky Devil Casino is the oldest establishment in town, not to mention the hottest spot for night life. Built by reputed mob boss Vincenzo Reno and left to his eldest son, Santino &amp;quot;Sonny&amp;quot; Reno after Vinnie's brutal gangland murder, the casino has seen its share of violence and sin. But things are about to get even worse. Finally ready to exact revenge on his father's murderers, Sonny has put out the word on the street - and he's looking for the most skilled and ruthless cons, thieves and killers the country has to offer. Enter the Scumbags! But what these hired guns don't know is that there's more to Los Diablos (and Sonny Reno) than meets the eye. Instead of a mere mob rivalry, they're unwittingly stumbling into a conflict of a much darker and more eternal nature. Before the long day is done, they'll do battle with angels, face down demons and stare eternity full in the face - and God only knows what (or who) will be left when the smoke clears. But hey, it's not often you can say &amp;quot;the Devil made me do it&amp;quot; and be right...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's Inside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scumbags is a complete adventure Script for Horror Rules, the Simply Horrible RPG, a horror comedy game of ridiculous proportions. This supplement is packed with everything you need to play, including Bad Guys, Cast, backstory, artwork, Plot Pushers and enough Sequel Suggestions and Plot Twists to turn it into five adventures instead of one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
