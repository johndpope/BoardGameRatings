							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orschild: Winds of War</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fall has come to Orschild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biting winds sweep in across the rocky highlands, bringing promises of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cold rain falls from the ash gray skies on the tired inhabitants of the refugee camps.  In each direction the sworn enemies of the province are arming for war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more and more places across the province the hatred between men and dwarfs grow.  Jealous nobles who have seen their privileges lost to the dwarfs rush the people to unspeakable atrocities in the name of freedom.  The Sau kin defends their honor with their lives.  Their foremost champion has left on a quest for the lost origin of the dwarfen people and the key to the mysteries of the great dividing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Heart of the province. the city of Resna, stands Lord Gideon, and listens to the sad songs of the autumn winds.  It tells of terrible treason, blood brothers in bitter struggle and a sovereign in tears. It tells of abandoned ideals, lost souls and broken hopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of people who did not have the strength to carry on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And of heroes who had the courage to defy destiny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
