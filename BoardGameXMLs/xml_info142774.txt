			<description>Hatfield vs. McCoy is a turn based card game of hillbilly combat and strategy.  Each family deck contains character cards for that family.  Players will use family cards in combination with action cards against other player&amp;rsquo;s families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fate of your family is determined by the defense of your farm while doing all that you can to eliminate any family that opposes you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A standard game has 148 cards divided into three decks.  Two deck's of 20 family cards, and one shared deck of action cards. Each player will also have 20 farm tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will start with three family members in play and three action cards in their hand.  Each round players will equip their family members, then declare if they are going to fight or call for back up and bring more family in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If one or both players declare that they want to fight, they will send family members to fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the fight action cards, equipment cards and traits on the family members will be added.  The family with the highest number will win.  The family with the lower number, loses all family members and equipment in the fight.  Any excess damage (the difference between the two team totals) will be taken out of the farm tokens of the losing family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The family that runs out of family members or tokens loses, and the other family wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
