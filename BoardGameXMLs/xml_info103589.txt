			<description>BACKGROUND&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many fell putting an end to the reign of terror of Wu-Feng, Lord of the Nine Hells. The funerary urn housing his ashes was buried in the cemetery of a village in the Middle Empire. Years have passed, and the cursed legacy has been forgotten by the living. &lt;br/&gt;Hidden away in hell, Wu-Feng has forgotten nothing. His incessant research allowed him to locate the receptacle. The shadow of his former incarnation already extends to the villagers, who are unaware of the danger threatening them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately, the Fat-Si (Taoist priests) keep watch, guarding the border between the dead and the living. Armed with their courage, their faith, and their powers, they will try to return the reincarnation of Wu-Feng to Hell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;USER SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghost Stories is an iPad adaptation of the board game Ghost Stories by Antoine Bauza.
