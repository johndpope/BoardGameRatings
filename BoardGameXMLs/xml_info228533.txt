			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worshipped by the conquered people of Ancient Laakmara, which is now known as the glorious Resh Summara, Alkhali Maakra is the goddess of bloody parity, violent egalitarianism, and the esteemed enemy of the ordered world of the Old Gods of the Eastern Empire of Resh Summara &amp;ndash; chiefly the Great God Tamummu, Hawk-Sun of Universal Order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF presents fans of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game with a whole new goddess for use in their campaign, one that is violent, socially relevant, and sure to have a bevy of assassins at her beck and call. This PDF provides GMs with all of the relevant information they need to introduce Alkhali Maaka into their campaign setting! Whether GMs need information on how her priesthood acts, how they dress, what their sacred duties are, or how they respond to threats, it's in here. Players will also find four new traits, as well as bonus information on Urdimmu the Mad and what he offers the Witches of Laakmara.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
