			<description>This 1966 publication is a fairly simple roll and move contest to collect electoral votes. The center of the board has an outline map of the United States with the Electoral College votes of each state marked. The map divides the states into six color-coded regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move around the edge of the board on a 64-square track. Most of these are individual states, and landing on one allows a player to take the state if uncommitted or to contest it if held by another player. To contest, he rolls 2D6, and on a 2-6 wins the state, while on 7-12 the challenged party gets to take a state in the same region from a challenger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a deck of Political Fortune cards which are collected on eight of the spaces. These can be positive or negative: losing a state or a turn or even all states in a region; or winning states and becoming a &amp;quot;favorite son&amp;quot; in a state, which confers unchallengeable ownership of that state for the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player collects the majority of the states in one of the six regions, he takes over all the electoral college votes for the region and all of those states are locked (can no longer be challenged). First player to 270 Electoral College votes wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
