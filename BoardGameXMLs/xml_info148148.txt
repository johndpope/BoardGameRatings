			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Level 19 is a full-color, 32 x 30 inch, floor plan of a futeristic warehouse, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sector 5 Level 19 Warehouse District is a single large room map of a futuristic warehouse. This product includes a 360 panoramic view from the middle of the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sector 5 is intended for use in near or far future science fiction settings. Sector 5 can be used as part of a terrestrial base or building or as part of a spaceship, star port, or space station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product can be used with our Sector 15 map. In this case, Sector 15 is the top floor, with Sector 5 Level 19 being a medical cargo loading/unloading area with storage in the lower level and the northern door can lead to a room with the lift to Sector 15. Sensitive cargo is lifted up to Sector 15 immediately and usually shipped with more mundane cargo to bury this fact deep within the cargo manifest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group might be hired to guard a cargo ship and make sure the cargo arrives at Sector 5 safely. Once they get there, thieves decide to hit Sector 5 to steal the cargo. The group needs to defeat the thieves and save the cargo. Alternatively, they are hired to steal the cargo and need a plan to bypass door security and defeat the warehouse guards to steal the cargo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
