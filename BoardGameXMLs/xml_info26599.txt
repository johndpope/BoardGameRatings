			<description>A gambling game for 2-6 players ages 12 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Pott&amp;quot; is a lively and spirited dice-game.  Each player places one of their four numbered tokens (0, 1, 2 or 3) upside-down and everyone tries to guess the sum of the selected token-values by placing a chip of their color on the correct number.  Whoever guesses the sum wins the prediction-chips.  If no player guesses correctly, the chips go into the pot.  The winner of the next round receives both the current prediction-chips and also the pot.  The player who possesses the most chips at the end is the winner. Contents: game board, 24 number tokens in six different colors, 60 chips and an easily understandable rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
