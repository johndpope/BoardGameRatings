Roger Peaks is a small quiet mountain range, with a strong dwarf population, until an accident opened an old mine which had been long forgotten. This old mine was a copper mine, which supplied the town with enough resources, it made them rich off the profits. Four days prior to the PCs coming into town, some townsfolk traveled to the mine to investigate, but never returned. Rumors spread as the townsfolk became nervous, wondering what happened to them? Did they get killed or did they find the treasures of the mine and run off with it?
