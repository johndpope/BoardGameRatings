			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fehr's Ehtnology: Qit'ar profiles the qit'ar race for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Qit&amp;rsquo;ar, known by such nicknames as tiger-mutes, bladecats and even the Dark Enemy, are a race more alien than most, as their presence is an accident, a fluke of war and the powerful magic that brought them to the world they find themselves on. The name, &amp;lsquo;qit&amp;rsquo;ar&amp;rsquo;, is in the dialect of a local tribe that had dealings with them on their new world, as the race in question communicates telepathically among themselves, and does not claim any particular name, but are content with the one they have been assigned. The name means &amp;lsquo;remnant&amp;rsquo;, and is appropriate because the race has been separated from the larger group during a large-scale attack. The &amp;lsquo;qit&amp;rsquo;ar&amp;rsquo; were a slave race, engineered for warfare by a force known only as &amp;ldquo;The Masters&amp;rdquo; and sent against targets that were thought to be vulnerable to their skills. Since the shift that sent them from their place of origin, they have struggled to find a place, to be independent, and to rediscover what it is to be a race and a people of free will, being Qit&amp;rsquo;ar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This release includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     ecology of qit'ar&lt;br/&gt;     racial characteristics for qit'ar characters (including alternate racial characteristics)&lt;br/&gt;     a selection of racial feats&lt;br/&gt;     traits for the qit'ar race (if you use traits)&lt;br/&gt;     sample qit'ar 1st level character&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the tenth and final release in the series of racial supplements detailing the new races for Porphyra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The qit'ar are a psionic race and build upon the work of Dreamscarred Press in their Psionics Unleashed and Psionics Expanded line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
