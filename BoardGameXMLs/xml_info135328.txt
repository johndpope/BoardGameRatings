			<description>Arrazzles is a game/sculpture crossover, with the metallic-colored cards having five different patterns of cuts or slots on them, allowing them to be combined in all sorts of arrangements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to being a freeform building tool, Arrazzles contains rules for a number of games, such as a memory game in which players try to match the colors on the cards and a building game in which other players try to guess the object that you've created. In &amp;quot;The Shift&amp;quot;, players divide the cards equally amongst themselves, then take turns creating a sculptured arrangement of cards in the center of the table. Try to be the first player who places a card so that the cards shift and fall into a new arrangement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
