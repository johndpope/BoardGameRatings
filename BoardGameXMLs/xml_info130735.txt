			<description>Bionic is a paragraph driven solo adventure game set in an alternate future where those with the resources have become half-machine. Super corporations rule the world from elaborate orbital stations while gangs, governments and citizens struggle to survive on the ever worsening surface of Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you create an Android who is employed by the largest augmentation corporation in the universe - Cyber Tech Revolutions Ltd. Each game you select a Contract from the Data Archives to complete, which will have you exploring the city of Kinacha (divided into Upper Kinacha and Lower Kinacha) completing the tasks set forth by your employer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game utilizes a roll and keep mechanic. For any given task there will be a difficulty number and based on your skills and attributes you will roll a certain number of 10-sided dice and then may select to keep a certain number. If your final result is above the TN you act recklessly, below the TN is cautious and matching the TN is the ideal outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has been divided into 5 Chapters for ease of printing and playing. Each Chapter will slowly add more mechanics to the game building on the core of Chapter 1 and the Contracts in each successive Chapter build on the story of those occurring before it:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter I is an introduction to the Bionic world and in particular the city of Kinacha.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter II introduces a more fluid Encounter deck (with more cards that can be permanently removed as well as cards that only get added when you achieve certain goals), a new game board (Lower Kinacha) and allow access to the Underground via the Underground Access Status card. Chapter II focuses on the gang war in Lower Kinacha.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter III takes place in the Underground proper and introduces a secondary Encounter Deck and a secondary Item Deck for this purpose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter IV expands upon what is already in place, and mostly adds a large number of new contracts to move the story towards the conclusion. This story arc features many decision points in the Contracts that will affect future Contracts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter V is the conclusion, and knowing what the additional components are would be a spoiler!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
