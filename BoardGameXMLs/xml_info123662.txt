			<description>Each player tries to collect the most points by offering up words in a given category: animals, birds or rivers for example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card with category is drawn and players bid how many words the category of each player be able to give.&lt;br/&gt;Example: in the category Fairy tales, the highest bid is currently 5. As no other player may submit more than five fairy tales, all other players pass. The player who starts the highest bid must now name 5 fairy tales in the length of time agreed (eg 60 seconds). If successful, He wins the card. Otherwise, the player who had next biggest bid, receives the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the deck is exhausted the player with the most cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to spice up the game, you can also decide that the words of the category will start with a given letter. The youngest player then chooses the letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
