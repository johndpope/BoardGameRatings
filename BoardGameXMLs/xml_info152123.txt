			<description>Take to the Skies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fly a patrol over the trenches and tangle with enemy planes in this set collection card game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climb and dive as you jockey for position, attempting to line up the perfect shot. Choose from over 20 different historic aircraft, each with different performance attributes which suffer as the plane takes damage. You may wind up an ace, or go down in flames!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;            &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A World War I aerial combat set collection card game. In Dogfight players strive to collect then play sets of cards in order to shoot down their opponents. The game is over when only one side remains, or when the victory conditions of the scenario being played are met.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features set collection, card drafting, and variable player powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dogfight contains 54 cards used to form the draw deck during the game. Each card is from one of six Attack Sets, as noted by the title across the top of the card: Crossing Shot, Diving Shot, Head On Shot, Strafing Run, Trailing Shot, and Turning Shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack Sets may have special conditions governing when the set can be played. Before trying to damage an enemy plane, you must collect a number of cards from the same Attack Set equal to the card&amp;rsquo;s Set Size. These cards are then played together as a Bid for Damage. If the attack is successful, then the target plane suffers damage equal to the Damage Value listed on the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some cards in the deck have a Defensive Value and can be used to avoid an enemy attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The draw deck is also used for randomly assigning specific types of damage to target planes. For each point of damage inflicted, one card is flipped over from the draw deck and the listed damage is applied. The information along the bottom of the card is used solely for this purpose, and is ignored during the set collection portions of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
