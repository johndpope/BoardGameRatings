							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Migration</name>
									
			<description>Mythic Migration is a 2 or 4 player, light strategy game. Players compete to be the first to get all their mythic creatures across the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The terrain is the obstacle. The board begins covered as plains (1 hex tile thickness) which no one can cross. During their turn players have two action points they can divide as they wish. They can move terrain hexes to build up (create mountains two tiles thick) for Yetis to cross, tear down (reveal the base board of water) for the Nessies to cross, or move their creatures towards safety (Yetis on mountains, and Nessies on water).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beware, all your terrain movements potentially help your opponent(s), so minimizing the help you give them while maximizing their moves to your advantage is key!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Contents:&lt;br/&gt;1 Full Color Rule Book&lt;br/&gt;1 Wood Board (4 pieces)&lt;br/&gt;4 Wooden Double-Sided Yeti Tokens&lt;br/&gt;4 Wooden Double-Sided Nessie Tokens&lt;br/&gt;28 Wooden Double-Sided Terrain Tiles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
