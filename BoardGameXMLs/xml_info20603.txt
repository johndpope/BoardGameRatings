							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Taxi and the city</name>
									
			<description>Taxi and the city seems to be (according to the information of the publisher) a new line of games, in which the players try to earn the most money by working as a taxi-driver in a certain city during the agreed playtime. Right now it is only available concerning the German city 'Wiesbaden', but others are planned.&lt;br/&gt;Afaik... DiceBoxx has been shut down and no one is following up ... too bad:(&lt;br/&gt;R.S. (living in Wiesbaden... close to DiceBoxx)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
