			<description>French card game aimed at youngsters to get them interested in food preparation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight recipe cards are placed in the centre of the table. Each player gets six random ingredient cards. In a turn, a player must place one ingredient if he can, to one of the recipe cards. He then replenishes his hand. Play proceeds until one recipe card is completed with all its ingredients. The player who laid the final ingredient claims the recipe card which will be worth a number of points. The more ingredients a recipe needs, the more points it is worth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all the recipes are claimed, the player with the most points, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
