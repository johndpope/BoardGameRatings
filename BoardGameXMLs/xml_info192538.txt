							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Life and Times of a Teenage Sorcerer</name>
									
			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Mt. Barker High, a typical and not-at-all typical high school where ordinary folks and budding young spellcasters rub elbows on their way to adulthood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players create and play teenage sorcerers with developing skills and desperate social situations. Use different magical powers to solve mysteries and make high school bearable. Roll back time. Speak powerful words to sway the local bully. Empathize with your over-worked teacher to get an extra hour before the big exam. Alter reality in your favor. Summon secret notes to ruin your rival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's unique about this game - it reinforces multiplication tables. To succeed in an action, players roll two dice and multiply the result. The harder the action, the more times they will have to roll and solve their simple equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A great game for kids learning their math and wanting a slice of imagination on the side!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
