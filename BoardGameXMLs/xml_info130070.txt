			<description>TicTo is a Greek verb that means, &amp;quot;I do&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I work&amp;quot;. TicTo is also a strategy game in 3 dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board recreates a city of Greek ground plant, the counters are its inhabitants and the rules their legislation. The game begins with a established order that, when modified, turns into a labyrinth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's objective is the construction of a way to lead the head counter to the departure position of the opponent. The counters do the way and block up the opponent's way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
