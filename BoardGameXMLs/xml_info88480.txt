			<description>Extra character card that was sold in Essen '06&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bartender used as a card &amp;quot;character&amp;quot; to play up to 9 additional players!&lt;br/&gt;However, it does toast with those who drink Alcohol is often used in preparing So delicious cocktails it is in fact part as appetizers with champagne, tequila or vodka (hence the three glasses represented the illustration)! &lt;br/&gt;Apart from this, it is like everyone else so it must make the gesture to drink and pronounce the word related to the nationality of each drinker's drink which she participates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But be careful because if general tour paid by the bartender or in-between the direct involvement (see rule of the game), then we should pretend to shake a shaker saying &amp;quot;Cocktail&amp;quot; to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
