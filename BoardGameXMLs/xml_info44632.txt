							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Flower for Mara</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She died that night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She was the light of my days, the glory of my existence. Cut down like a flower in the prime of her life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, I stand at her grave. They're lowering her in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It wasn't supposed to be like this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Flower for Mara is an improvisational play about death, loss, grief, and hope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In it, the cast members portray the immediate family of Mara, a woman who has died unexpectedly, during the first year after her death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will see them deal with their loss - will they be able to lay aside their grief and continue on with their lives, or will they be trapped by their sorrow, unable to move forward?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
