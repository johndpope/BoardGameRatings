			<description>Cube Hog is a 2-4 player family/party style card game all about using strategy, luck, and even slight of hand to &amp;quot;hog&amp;quot; more cubes than your opponents!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: Learning to play Cube Hog takes only a couple minutes. Each player is assigned a color (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) and given their color player cubes, 5 to each player. Cubes are all pink except the underside which has a hidden player color. Each color is given a value card facedown to dictate what each color cube is worth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example: If the blue player has a 1 on their value card, then the cubes that have blue on their hidden underside are each only worth 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns playing action cards to best their opposition. Action cards are used to steal, swap, and flip cubes over to reveal the underside. Action cards also can be used to look at other players value cards, flip over value cards for everyone to see, or even to change a value card. The player with the highest value of cubes at the end of the round wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cube Hog can be played in two ways. Quickplay is the fastest way to pick up and play. Quickplay games last about 10 minutes and a great for some quick fun. Competitive play consists of multiple games of Cube Hog with each game won rewards the player with a Gold Cube. Playing this takes about 45 minutes. This also adds the 'Gold Cube' card into the deck to add a new mechanic specifically designed for competitive play. First player to win 3 gold cubes wins the competitive play game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cube Hog rewards players who can remember which cube is which while the cubes slowly get shuffled around the table. However, players are also rewarded when they use sleight of hand to shuffle their own cubes to fool other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
