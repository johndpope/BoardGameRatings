							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Four Cinematic Lenses</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is perfect for anyone wanting to enjoy a cinematic or Anthropomorphic Mundi Animalia game. It can also be used on other games to put old things in a new light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A lens is a specific type of Mundi Animalia game that doesn't quite match up to others. It takes an 'old idea' and gives it a new twist, to get more mileage out of your current Mundi Animalia rulebook. The thing that makes these lenses so useful is how they allow the GM to use existing material already provided for Mundi Animalia, but in a slightly different format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Pink lens is all about cool. A pink animal must find a proper balance between being cool and being funny, all without saying a word. &lt;br/&gt;     The Red lens is all about happiness. It shines in the bright world of early childhood adventures that teach a lesson in happiness and sharing. [This is a &amp;quot;Kid-friendly&amp;quot; adventure.]&lt;br/&gt;     Conversely, the dark and morose humor of Blue lens animals can never be cloudy enough. These stories never end well for anyone involved. &lt;br/&gt;     Finally, the yellow lens highlights everything in a politically satirical slant. It is largely about allegory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes: 5 NPCs, 4 Linear Plot Outlines, 16 Plot hooks, and Directions for establishing 'Ambiance' for each lens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
