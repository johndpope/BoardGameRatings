							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Word Rummy</name>
									
			<description>An early game of rummy with words.  The deck has 78 letter cards -- the entire alphabet in each color (red, green, &amp;amp; blue).  Each letter has a point value from 1 to 5, commoner letters with higher values.  Deal 7 cards each for 6 or less players, 6 each for 7 players, 5 for 8 players, and turn up the top of the draw pile to start the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a turn of the Standard game, a player draws 1 from either pile, plays words to the table, and discards 1.  Each word must have at least 2 letters, and all must be of the same color, unless it has more than 1 of a certain letter.  If the word has more than one repeated letter (e.g. &amp;quot;refer&amp;quot;) the second 'e' and 'r' most both be of the same color.  Words on the table may not be added to or otherwise changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hand ends when a player empties his hand, or when the draw pile runs out.  Each player scores: for words on the table, the length of the word squared (e.g. 5 letters =&amp;gt; 25 points); for words in the hand, the simple length of the word (5 letters =&amp;gt; 5 points); and for each card in hand, the value of the card is subtracted.  The game is won at 150 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Advanced game has a yahtzee-like scoring pad.  There is a row for each word length from 2 to 8, and two scoring columns.  The first word scored for each length is written in the Primary column; and further words for that length are simply tallied in the Secondary column.  After a chosen length of time or number of hands, the player with the highest Primary total wins; ties are broken by the Secondary total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the Inverse game only scores penalties: at the end of the hand, players total the points left in their hands.  After a chosen number of deals, the lowest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
