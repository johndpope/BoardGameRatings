			<description>Have you ever smashed your best friend with a Full House? Crushed a foe with a Flush? Made your mate irate with a pair of 8s? The game you thought you knew has been reimagined as a game of combat, crafting killer hands, decisive moments, and non-stop fun with every turn of the cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Poker Assault, take control of the mysterious and maniacal Invaders, the ferocious and unrelenting Wolf Pack, the elegant and vicious Vampire Court, or the heroic aeronautical aces of the Rocket Patrol. Each team has its own custom suit theme and artwork. Play any deck versus any other deck, or even three- and four-player variants. While each deck is a legal 52-card poker deck, it's also so much more! Several cards in each deck have bonus abilities that can aid you while assaulting your opponent or defending against an assault. Additionally, if you can craft a Straight, Flush, Full House, or Four-of-a-Kind, you will earn an aptly named Power Card. These unique cards give you new strategies to pursue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chances are with your initial hand of five cards, you aren't going to have much of a poker hand. But by playing only one card at a time, and drawing a new card from your deck after each play, you can slowly build up to something great. How great is up to how risky you want to get. Craft a hand of at least a pair, and your assault is underway! Now your opponent must block your cards using the cards in their hand. The defending player likewise plays only one card at a time and draws a card from their deck after each play. To block an assaulting card, match the value (2 to Ace) or play a card of the same suit (Heart, Diamond, Club, Spade), but with a higher value. Each assaulting card that gets through knocks your opponent's hit points down by one. Bring your opponent's health to zero and you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
