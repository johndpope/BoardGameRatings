							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Missing King</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The King of Urland is young and inexperienced, but well loved by the people of his little kingdom. His father&amp;rsquo;s legacy holds the nation together, and peaceful borders have made King Pitre Urland&amp;rsquo;s experience easy. When King Borric Urland died at the young age of 42, his son was only 7 and while 4 years have since passed, the chamberlain and advisers have had to handle the day to day running of the kingdom while Pitre learns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All was well until a month ago when the king vanished from his keep. The mages are baffled, the King&amp;rsquo;s guards enraged and mortified, and the Chamberlain horrified. The king is the soul of Urland, and his lack is felt bitterly by all its people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
