							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Darkest Age</name>
									
			<description>website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;The Darkest Age is a Horror Role-Playing Game set in a grim, alternate history. Explore the gritty and dangerous world of Europe in 1350, as an unusual strain of the bubonic plague ravages the countryside and those afflicted don&amp;rsquo;t just die. They stand up and feast on the living&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gather your wits and your dice! Roll-up a character from the Second Viking Age, a Skald or Berserker. Maybe you want to play an alchemist obsessed with unraveling the secret of this dread disease? The Darkest Age Role Playing Game uses the d20 OGL game system so you already know how to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between waves of fear and a strange, uneasy compulsion to start playing The Darkest Age right now, you&amp;rsquo;re wondering what makes this game special? You&amp;rsquo;ve played a hundred d20 OGL games, but nothing like this! Written by veteran game designers who believe a role-playing system shouldn&amp;rsquo;t limit your creativity, The Darkest Age explores social and cultural conventions, as well as medieval role-playing tropes. In a world where life is precious and death walks the countryside, the role of women is changed profoundly. Whole orders of knights are founded by women who swear to rebuild society. The Midwife&amp;rsquo;s Guild commands respect on par with the Church.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highlights:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Available on eBook (Nook and Kindle). Take your role-playing materials everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;     A multitude of never before seen character classes, including Skald, Midwife, Physician, Alchemist, Mercenary, Merchant and many others.&lt;br/&gt;     The Great Plague has given rise to vile undead from the familiar zombie to creatures so abhorrent we don&amp;rsquo;t dare mention them here!&lt;br/&gt;     Includes detailed skills, new feats, locations, a history of undead-plagued Europe and much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
