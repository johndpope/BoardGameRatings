			<description>The new content in Reign of Giants touches all corners of the game and is focused on adding content throughout the entire upper world of Don&amp;rsquo;t Starve. This includes new characters, seasons, creatures, craftables and biomes, all of which will work together with the existing content of Don&amp;rsquo;t Starve to provide new challenges and play-styles. &lt;br/&gt;WHAT'S IN THE REIGN OF GIANTS EARLY-ACCESS BETA? &lt;br/&gt;At this point of the beta, we've included two brand new characters, new seasons, biomes, creatures, craftables and items.&lt;br/&gt;New Characters - Play as Webber, a unique creature who can befriend Spiders and even grow a dapper silk beard. Or play as Wigfrid, a powerful, carnivorous, Valkyrie who gains power from her fallen foes!&lt;br/&gt;Giants - Literally the biggest additions to the game are the Giants that you'll face at certain points of each season. Will you be able to adapt and overcome the dangerous new challenges each of them bring?&lt;br/&gt;New Seasons - Did you think Winter was dangerous in the core game? Wait until you try surviving the heavy rainfall in Spring and the extreme heat during Summer. Each new season presents unique new challenges and rewards for those willing to brave the elements.&lt;br/&gt;New Items and Craftables - To survive the new seasons, you'll have to use the new items and craftables including the Ice Hat, Ice Fling-O-Matic, Endothermic Fire, Rain Coat, Rain Hat, and much more!&lt;br/&gt;New Creatures - Interact with new creatures like the burrowing Moleworms, the supercharged Volt Goats. There's also new creatures you can befriend like the gift-giving Catcoon and the docile Glommer.&lt;br/&gt;New Save Slot - We've also added a new save slot into the game. Now, you'll be able to play through and survive five different worlds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
