			<description>A simple matching game for kids aged 3-7. There are two ways to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For younger players: place the cookie halves with the white &amp;quot;middles&amp;quot; into the cookie jar, and divide the brown halves among the players. The first player takes a cookie half from the cookie jar. If the shape matches one of their brown cookie halves, they can put the pieces together to make a whole Oreo and place them in their stack. If they do not match, the player must return the cream half to the jar and the next player takes their turn. Play continues until the cookie jar is empty and the player with the highest stack of cookies wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more advanced players: Place all of the cookie halves face down on the table. The first player turns two halves over. If they match to form a cookie, that player gets to add that cookie to their stack. If they don't match, both halves are turned back over and the next player goes. The game continues until all cookies have been matched and again, the player with the highest stack of cookies wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
