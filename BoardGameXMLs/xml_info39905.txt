			<description>This game looks like a tree, standing about 12&amp;quot; tall.  The goal is to get all of your squirrel's color marbles in your area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The base of the tree has four player areas.  Each player's area has a squirrel in one of four colors and four knot holes.  Players put colored marbles into the knot holes and use the squirrels to launch the balls into the canopy of the tree.  Baffles in the tree trunk bounce the balls around and they roll out of random holes in the base of the tree into the players areas.  The first player to get all of their colored marbles wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
