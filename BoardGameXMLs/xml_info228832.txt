			<description>Underlords is a 1-4 player fantasy game where players take on the role of the Underlords, hard done by masters of the dark who only want to make an innocent evil subterranean empire filled with minions and monsters. Alas these tranquil utopias find no peace as pesky adventurers keep turning up at the door trying to steal everything and killing every minion in sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Underlords players use tile placement to build a dungeon full of rooms and caves, into which minions and monsters are placed. Each turn the underlord push their luck by sending monsters out to raid villages, towns or cities to gather plunder which is used to recruit minions and build the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn one hero arrives at the dungeon seeking treasure. Depending on how hard the Underlord raided, this could be a plucky peasant or a gristle nemesis of evil. The hero travels through the dungeon in a tower defence fashion being battled on the way by the dungeons defenders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won by the player who accrues the most magic items from fallen hero's by the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
