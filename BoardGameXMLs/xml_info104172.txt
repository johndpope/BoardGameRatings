			<description>Combat Wings  is an air combat game set in the First World War.&lt;br/&gt;WWI period aircraft were rather fragile machines, with hardly any power or operational capacity, however suprisingly enough these handicaps were more than compensated for by their high degree of manoeuvrability.&lt;br/&gt;At the start of each game, players select an aircraft, which in turn forms part of a squadron. Each plane is different with its own aircraft&amp;rsquo;s characteristics with a series of specific manoeuvres and special abilities, hence making it distinguishable from the other members of the squadron. CW, allows players to customize both flight style and combat technique, consequently the same model of aircraft can perform a varied range of manoeuvres or be endowed with a series of specific special abilities, depending on the Plane Data Sheet (PDS). The sPDS of the squadrons are based on historical facts and list the characteristics, abilities and hardware of the most renowned squadrons of the FWW which, in combination with the mission allow players to recreate the entire history of the war.&lt;br/&gt;Throughout each game, players are awarded experience points which in turn permit a series of abilities or manoeuvres, the ultimate aim of which is to be awarded the category of ace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
