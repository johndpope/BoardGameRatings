							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Coop Da Chickens</name>
									
			<description>A chicken dropping, wild game to cluck about!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chickens have escaped their coops and its your duty to help return them to their homes but you&amp;rsquo;re not the only one the farmer asked for assistance. Its a race against time to collect and coop the most chickens, with help from your trusty dog and some other tricky tactics. In this fun and lighthearted game for the whole family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect and coop same color chickens to earn points. Strategically time the placement of your chickens to maximize your coops value. Different chickens do different things when played. Some may steal other players chickens or even randomly redistribute all chickens in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With many different kinds of chickens including; Raging Chickens, Wild Chickens, Fat Chickens, and Roosters. You'll be feeling like a real chicken farmer in no time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy to learn and fun for any age group, a great game for casual players and families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;Players start with a hand of 5 chickens and one dog per player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a players turn they will play a chicken into their yard face up and draw a card or coop chickens that are already in their yard which is done by turning the cards over and putting them in a separate pile. Once a chicken is cooped it is safe and cannot be stolen by a raging chicken or rooster. Most of the time you will only be able to coop chickens of the same color but using the dog card once per game, a player can ignore the same color rule. This comes in handy when you want to save a fat chicken. The game will continue until the deck is gone and all cards are out of player's hands. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
