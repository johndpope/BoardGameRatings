			<description>from the PDF introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to ZeFRS (Zeb&amp;rsquo;s Fantasy Roleplaying System), a complete rules set for gritty, cinematic, swashbuckling swords-and-sorcery role playing games. You won&amp;rsquo;t find pansy elves, drunken dwarves, or cutesy halflings or gnomes in these rules. Rather, here you&amp;rsquo;ll find hulking brutes of men throttling the unholy life from demons with their bare hands, voluptuous pirate women slicing foes to ribbons with rapiers as razor sharp as their wits, dark wizards who become just a little less human with every spell they cast, and monsters from the darkest bowels of Hell and beyond. This isn&amp;rsquo;t Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. This is Conan and Lankhmar. In fact, the original source for these rules was a wonderful game put out by TSR in the 1980&amp;rsquo;s, written by Dave &amp;ldquo;Zeb&amp;rdquo; Cook and based upon the Conan licensed property. That game endeavored to capture the feel of not only Howard&amp;rsquo;s original stories, but the Conan comic books that were so popular at the time. It did its job well, and in the process gave us a game that was well ahead of its time, and very underappreciated. These &amp;ldquo;obfuscated&amp;rdquo; rules are an effort to put that system, sans anyone&amp;rsquo;s intellectual properties, back out there for people to use and enjoy. We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed putting it together. See the credits page of this document for web links where you can find support and more information!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version combines the Rules and the Companion from the original ZeFRS rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
