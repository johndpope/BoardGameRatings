			<description>Quadtriple Word Game (Two Games in One)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Triple: Each player simultaneously and secretly forms words using 3 randomly selected letter tiles. Words can be any length but must contain all three letters. After the time is up, players in-turn read their word lists aloud. Players cross off words from their lists that match the words being read aloud. Each player scores points for words only he or she wrote down on their word pads. After playing nine rounds, the game is over and the player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quad: Same game as &amp;quot;Triple&amp;quot; only 4 letter tiles are randomly selected instead of three.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
