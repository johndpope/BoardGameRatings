			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blasphemous Knowledge, Forbidden Secrets, &amp;amp; Handy Information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New to Call of Cthulhu? A battle-scarred veteran of many campaigns? Here is essential background and references to help you host Call of Cthulhu games more easily and skillfully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Prohibition - 40+ pages detailing the alternately farcical and tragic Noble Experiment foisted upon the people of the United States. Prohibition is frequently referred to, but rarely discussed. Here is information on the Volstead Act, why so many were poisoned by bootleg liquor, how the product was made and distributed, what the local police and the Prohibition Bureau were up to, and some of the fascinating personalities who lent so much color to the Roaring Twenties.&lt;br/&gt;     LaVey, Satanism, and the Big Squid - How the concept of Lovecraft's fictional Cthulhu worship and its &amp;quot;great book&amp;quot;, the Necronomicon, were borrowed by a succession of occultists, and trumpeted as the truth.&lt;br/&gt;     The Keeper's List of Lists - More than 30 pages listing Call of Cthulhu scenarios sorted by era, by the forces opposing the investigators (such as bu the great race or elder things), by important heroes and villains, by cults and secret societies, by Mythos tomes, and by fictitious locations.&lt;br/&gt;     Iron - A survey of firearms that investigators might realistically come across in the course of adventures. Intelligent commentary includes two new skills, Handload and Gunsmith, and discusses more than two dozen firearms in considerable practical detail. Among the weapon stats are increased attacks per round, augmented damage by handloads, costs by era, malfunction number, noise, powder, reload rate, maintenance, and weapon weight.&lt;br/&gt;     The Mythos Collector - gathers ten previously uncollected Mythos tomes plus variants, sixteen new spells, and two new creatures, the nagaae and the tunnelers below.&lt;br/&gt;     Mythos Ex Machina - technical items created by various species and published in Call of Cthulhu adventures. Thirty-five entries split between deep ones, elder things, humans, Hyperborean humans, mi-go, insects from Shaggai, serpent people, and the Great Race of Yith.&lt;br/&gt;     Deep Ones - diary entries by Dr. Lippencot, selected by Sheriff Michael Drumberger; the full autopsy report produced by Henry Lippencot; as hort discussion of deep one reproduction and how hybrid deep ones can exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chapter &amp;quot;LaVey, Satanism, and the Big Squid&amp;quot; was first posted on the Strange-Aeons list in a slightly different form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
