			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galactic Adventures is a character driven game system. That is to say that all of the rules are derived from a core set of rules that are used to define the capabilities of the characters who inhabit the setting. These core rules cover the development of character backgrounds and the growth of skills through training and experience and the use of skills to accomplish tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action resolution utilizes a modified percentage of success target with the player &amp;quot;rolling under&amp;quot; their target.  The rules use &amp;quot;a wide variety of voluntary modifiers&amp;quot; to make success less likely in the event of what would otherwise be automatic success (but the success, if achieved, will be more spectacular).  The rules present a series of tiered difficulties .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have &amp;quot;Statistics&amp;quot; (Coordination, Discipline, Endurance, Logic, Perception, Reflexes, Strength, and Talent) which are generated with d100, adding 40 to results that are under 41.  Characters then spend point to purchase Skills, select a Career (much like Traveller) and engage in &amp;quot;lifepath&amp;quot; character generation within their Career(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
