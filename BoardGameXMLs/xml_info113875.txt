			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although mostly completed, Cheetahmen II was made, but it was never officially released. In 1996, however, 1,500 copies of the game were located in a warehouse, and eventually put on sale on the secondary market. All copies of the game were reused Action 52 cartridges, some with a small gold sticker reading &amp;quot;Cheetamen II&amp;quot;. This cartridge is now very hard to find, though numerous ROM images exist on the Internet. Copies of the game value at almost $1,000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Cheetahmen II the player again assumes the role of one of the three Cheetahmen (Aries, Apollo and Hercules); after defeating a boss at the end of the second level, they switch to the next Cheetahman for the following two levels, as in the Action 52 version. Due to a bug, it is impossible to get to the levels in which one plays Cheetahman Aries without altering the ROM image or experiencing a glitch that very rarely starts the game on these two levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cheetahmen II is famous for its music, and for its lack of quality in all other areas. Like Action 52, it was not licensed by Nintendo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cheetahmen&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
