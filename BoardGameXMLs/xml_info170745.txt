			<description>Lustige Reise durch Grossdeutschland (eng. &amp;quot;Funny traveling through Great Germany&amp;quot;)is typical roll and move game for children about Nazi motorway network, which includes current Germany, Austria, Poland and the Czech territories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first, who cross all route from Muenchen till Reichenberg (53 stations) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was published in Nazi Germany around 1939-1941, because the map shows the title &amp;quot;The General Government&amp;quot;. It was an occupied area of Poland that was under colonial administration of Nazi Germany during World War II, from 1939 to early 1945. The Nazi government designated the territory as a separate administrative region of the Third Reich. As of 1941 it included much of modern-day western Ukraine cities, which is not shown on the map. &lt;br/&gt;Game was published after 28 September  1939, after The Molotov-Ribbentrop revised version, when the German and Soviet representatives met again to take in the Soviet sphere Lithuania and entire central part of Poland came under exclusively German control. The game board shows it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
