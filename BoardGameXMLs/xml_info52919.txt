			<description>Produced by Waddingtons in the 1920's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two games in one; a jigsaw board of the world, combined with a general knowledge game where players have to correctly identify the locations of capitals of the world. However, the general knowledge part of the game cannot be played until the jigsaw board has been completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The jigsaw was 32&amp;quot; x 18&amp;quot;, and at the time of production was the largest cardboard jigsaw ever made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 map of the world in the form of a 32&amp;quot; x 18&amp;quot; jigsaw&lt;br/&gt;1 paper map of the world (as a reference for the jigsaw)&lt;br/&gt;4 sets of capital city counters (red, blue, green and white)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the general knowledge part of the game, each player in turn tries to correctly place a capital city on the jigsaw board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If they correctly place the capital city, they score 4 points.&lt;br/&gt;If they cannot place the capital city, they can put it to one side and score 0 points.&lt;br/&gt;If they incorrectly place the capital city, they lose 2 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was something of a rarity even when in production; it was expensive, and the general knowledge part of the game was an obvious afterthought. However, it is prized by collectors of vintage jigsaws, and has some curiosity value for the now-obsolete names used for countries on the map - for example Siam, Persia, Arabia and Ceylon. Definitely a remnant of the British Empire ;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
