							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thirty-Six Card Trick</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is played like any other pair matching game: to flip over pairs (18 pairs in this game) of cards (on the upper side has a picture that is shown on all the cards, and the underside has a certain picture that only appears twice in the set) such that two of the same image is shown. However, each game is timed and the cards sometimes switch places; in later levels, there are multiple swaps between each turn. There is also a limited number of times that a player can make a mistake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
