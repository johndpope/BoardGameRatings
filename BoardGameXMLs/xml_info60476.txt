			<description>User Notes: For evil characters, levels 7-9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city of Rahbaud has been at peace for generations. It is a prosperous city, built on the backs of hard-work and guided by the hand of a powerful overlord. The nobility lives in splendor, trading with local areas to increase their own wealth, and capturing and breeding slaves for the benefit of all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until a slave rebellion in the gladiator pits threatens to destroy the prosperity and stability of this noble city. In the service of Prince Sukhir Blackhammer, known as the Iron Fist of Law, you have been enlisted to crush the rebellion. Your duty is to destroy the slaves who threaten Rahbaud's security, and bring the rebel leaders to to the justice of the Iron Fist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There shall be no mercy for those who dare to break with order. No refuge for the murderers of peaceful merchants and nobility, for slaves who think to buy their freedom with the blood of decent citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An example must be set, to keep the peace and force the other slaves back into tranquility. If these treasonous serfs think to destroy generations of work with some false hope of 'freedom', then the Prince of Rahbaud shall give them their freedom...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
