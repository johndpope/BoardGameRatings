							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Archon Skirmish</name>
									
			<description>A game based on the classic action-strategy computer game of the same name. The game is played on an 8&amp;times;8 grid (such as a chess board.) Victory is achieved by occupying all four corner squares or by eliminating all enemy creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a unique set of eight fighting creatures, all of which are rated for hits, movement, and attack. The Light forces consist of the Wizard, Unicorn, Archer, Golem, Valkyrie, Djinni, Phoenix, and Knight. The Dark forces are the Sorceress, Basilisk, Manticore, Troll, Shapeshifter, Dragon, Banshee, and Goblin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card play is central to the game. The players draw a hand of cards from a common deck and the cards permit units to move, attack, and cast spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
