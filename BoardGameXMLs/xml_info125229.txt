							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flying Watchtower</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple watchtower built atop a floating island, this is a sight to behold, if you as a matter of fact get to see it as this towers and others in its vicinity are usually shrouded in clouds to avoid detection by anyone venturing too close. Usually you will only have a chance to notice the tower at a distance peaking out over its cloud camouflage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only if strong winds blow away the towers cloud cover faster than it regenerates does its supernatural nature become obvious. At night the strange glowing crystals keeping the rocky island airborne might be another clue that something is not quite right with those clouds overhead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tower itself is a simple affair. Beyond the sturdy door a spiral staircase leads up to the towers observation level with its many open windows all around its circumference that allow guards stationed here to observe the see below at a distance. The roof if the tower is covered in sturdy slate shingles to withstand the weather out at sea. Because of this weather and the open windows the observation level is almost always rather drafty making doing duty here rather unpopular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
