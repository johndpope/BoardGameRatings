							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elemental Mysteries</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fireballs. Lightning bolts. Armor of raw entropy. Swords of pure frost. Shields of thunder. Summoned elementals, demons, and devils. These are all stock-in-trade for a wizard. Do you have the Will required and the Lore necessary to master the eldritch arts of an elemental wizard?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;We wizards have always known what scientists are only beginning to understand: we are all composed of nothing but energy. Everything is. If you get down to the basic atoms, the fundamental building blocks of matter in our universe, and you break those open you will release energy and find only emptiness. Matter is nothing but energy made flesh. Energy is what the veil is made of. Energy is what the Darkness craves. Energy is what keeps the Darkness at bay. It&amp;rsquo;s complicated.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;As a wizard, only you can walk the weakening walls that guard our reality from the terrors beyond the veil.&lt;br/&gt;It is up to you... Fight the Darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elemental Mysteries is an expansion of the rules in [rpgitem/=168505 Modernity] (Fate Edition) and the core Modernity text is required to fully utilize Elemental Mysteries. It is fully compatible with other Fate Core products. All minor variations are documented in the core Modernity book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
