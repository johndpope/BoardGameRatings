							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Exciting Encounters - 1st Level Encounters</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;100 Exciting Encounters &amp;mdash; 1st Level Encounters provides the Castles &amp;amp; Crusades Castle Keeper with 100 ready-made encounters for use in any campaign. The encounters included on these tables are designed to be challenging for parties of three to eight characters where most if not all characters are 1st level. If you need an encounter for 1st level characters, simply roll d100 and consult the table! A range of numbers of creatures encountered is included; the low end for smaller parties (three to five characters), the high end for larger parties (six to eight characters). Note that some encounters are designed to be rather tough; however, at some point early in their careers all characters should learn that discretion is the better part of valor and that it is better to run away to live and fight another day!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encounter formats should also vary by environment. The encounters listed herein assume a dungeon environment, but most of them work for other environments. No standard treasures are included with these encounters, but you can readily add treasures using the related product series, 100 Treasure Troves, of the appropriate treasure types (which are listed with the encounter).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
