							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cave People</name>
									
			<description>Cave People is a game of prehistoric progress. Match resources to win techs, mix it up with mammoths, or steal hard-earned cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bazillions of years ago, cave people scrounged around looking for grubs and roots and stuff. Probably. Who could say for sure? We wanted to dramatize that struggle through the best story-telling medium ever created: card games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic idea is simple: gather and combine different resources to create and secure technologies for your cave person. Trade with your opponents or steal their hard-fought technologies outright. But watch out - the prehistoric world is rife with dangers like stampeding woolly mammoths and fiery balls of destruction from outer space. Also, religion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
