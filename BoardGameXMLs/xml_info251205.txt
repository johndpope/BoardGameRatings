							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ACE Lobbyist</name>
									
			<description>YOU are a lobbyist for a major firm. A bill vital to the firm's survival is scheduled for a vote in 5 (FIVE!) days. The balance is even. Four Representatives are still on the fence- and their votes will make or break the bill. Can you convince at least three of the Representatives to vote your way? Or will your nemesis- ACE Lobbyist- manage to derail your actions and kill the bill???? The cards are in your hands...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a standard deck of cards (including both Jokers) and is for a single player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During setup, the player will identify four representatives (Queens and/or Kings- one of each suit) and will stack the ACE Lobbyist with their cards. Play starts with the drawing of cards to determine the actions for the day. Cards are played above a representative to influence them your way, or can be played to investigate the target of the ACE Lobbyist. The ACE Lobbyist will then get a turn by revealing and matching a card from their deck- these cards work against your influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 5 turns (days) the game ends. If you have played enough cards (represented by the number of the card) to convince three of the four representatives to your side, you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
