			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Fox Adventures is an action-adventure video game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo GameCube as part of the Star Fox series. It was released in North America on 23 September 2002, Japan on 27 September 2002, Australia on 15 November 2002 and Europe on 22 November 2002. It was the final game developed by Rare for a Nintendo home video game system, before the company was acquired as a first-party developer for Microsoft's Xbox division. It is the third game in the series, succeeding Star Fox 64.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plot centers on the remote Dinosaur Planet (named &amp;quot;Sauria&amp;quot; in later games) of the Lylat System, where Fox McCloud is dispatched by General Pepper to restore the planet after pieces of it have broken off and pose a risk to the system. After arriving, Fox discovers a mystical staff from Krystal and sets off to rescue her and save the planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Star Fox Adventures uses a similar gameplay engine as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Its graphics were very sophisticated for its time, receiving particular attention for its real-time fur rendering. Like Ocarina of Time, Star Fox Adventures has a day-and-night phase, but a more accurate and gradual one.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
