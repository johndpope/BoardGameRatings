							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chicken Caesar: The Eggsclusive</name>
									
			<description>The Eggsclusive is a set of limited edition Rooster cards you can use in the Chicken Caesar game!  Players can replace some of their own roosters with these eager chickens during game setup.  The following roosters are included in this expansion:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Abus I - A somewhat familiar looking rooster for you history buffs.&lt;br/&gt;     Baro I - This is another one for the history buffs and Peanuts. The most famous fighter pilot of all time.&lt;br/&gt;     Plusho I - Plusho isn't exactly what you would expect from a Roman chicken politician, but sometimes just the &amp;quot;appearance&amp;quot; of leadership will do the trick.&lt;br/&gt;     Cucullo I - &amp;quot;Hood&amp;quot; in Latin; this particular chap might remind you of a certain vigilante who steals from the rich to give to the poor.&lt;br/&gt;     Magus I - This Rooster resembles a certain magic peddler who was once a little grey-er.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note:  Stevus I was removed from The Eggsclusive due to legal concerns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
