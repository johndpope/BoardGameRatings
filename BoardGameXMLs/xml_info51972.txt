							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bram Stoker&#039;s Dracula Role Playing Game</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dracula, the greatest of Vampires, came to London to create a new empire and to find his long-lost love. In spite of his powers, he was driven away and eventually destroyed by a band of Vampie Hunters led by Professor Abraham Van Helsing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dracula has been defeated, but he left behind a brood of newly created Vampires, just learning to use their powers. Older and stronger Vampires have also arrived from their ancient lands, drawn by the same life and energy that attracted Dracula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you must face the power of darkness. You must learn how to hunt and defeat Vampires and their allies, while protecting the innocent. As you pursue the Vampires, you will find yourself being hunted in turn, as they seek to convert or kill you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bram Stoker's Dracula Role Playing Game includes complete rules for Vampires and for settings from Medieval times to the present. Based on the hit Columbia Pictures move and featuring dozens of color and black-and-white photos, this game captures the romance, mystery, and adventure of the film, and is fully compatible with all film based games from Leading Edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
