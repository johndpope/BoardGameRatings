							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zwei Doofe ein Gedanke</name>
									
			<description>An animal at a zoo? A song from ABBA? A TV moderator? A pirat? Something which is used a little bit too long willingly?&lt;br/&gt;What do you think the others will answer?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zwei Doofe ein Gedanke is a trivia/word game with a high fun factor. In this game every player tries to give the same answer as the other players, the more the merrier. You will get as many points as players give the same answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In one turn, the current player reads the question out loud and let every player think about the answer for a short time. Then he counts back '3, 2, 1...' and then all players will give an answer instantly and simultaniously. Prepare yourself for a lot of fun, complete wrong appreciations and lots of funny answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zwei Doofe ein Gedanke is a crazy, fast and funny game with 440 categories. An ideal gift and souvenir for any opportunity, funny partys and convivial evenings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
