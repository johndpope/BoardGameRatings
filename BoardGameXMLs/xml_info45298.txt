							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Men In Black: The Roleplaying Game</name>
									
			<description>You're about to enter the dangerous world of Men In Black... Bring a sponge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're part of the mysterious quasi-governmental organization known only as the Men in Black - elite cops policing and patrolling the 1,500 aliens living amongst the people of Earth. You'll conform to the identity we give you. You will have no identifying marks of any kind. You will not stand out in any way. Your entire image is crafted to leave no lasting memory. You're a rumour, recongizable only as deja vu. You don't exist; you were never born. Anonymity is your name. Silence is your native tongue. You are above the system. Over it. Beyond it. Can you handle the truth? More importantly, can you handle an Arquillian Megasonic Destructor Ray? You can? Good. We've got a crazy Baltian loose in Manhattan. Take care of it. And remember... No earthlings must know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This features West End's easy-to-learn, customizable D6 System for action-packed, cinematic play!  Just grab some six-sided dice, a few friends and help protect the Earth from the scum of the Universe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A solitaire adventure to introduce the system&lt;br/&gt;     Character creation guidelines&lt;br/&gt;     Adventure design guildelines&lt;br/&gt;     Game statistics for various aliens from the films&lt;br/&gt;     Equipment for both MIBs and alien conspiracies&lt;br/&gt;     A starting-level adventure, Revenge of the Geek&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
