			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Follow the clues to crack the case! This game gets two teams racing to solve a mystery. The solution may only be revealed by the adorably detective-like Giant Mystery Decoder, which also keeps score. Want to try one? Here&amp;rsquo;s the case Jake is being chased by a buffalo stampede when he comes to a wide, deep river. To escape, he must cross the river, but there is no bridge and he has no boat. He cannot even swim. Nonetheless, he easily gets away and, although the river is full, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t even get wet. Why is Jake able to cross the river, and why don&amp;rsquo;t the buffalo follow? If you don&amp;rsquo;t know the answer, the clues will get you closer&amp;hellip; How many will you need? 1) Jake uses no equipment or tools to cross. 2) The buffalo weigh over 1,000 pounds each, but Jake weighs only 100 pounds. 3) It&amp;rsquo;s wintertime. Yes, the river is frozen! For 2 teams (but instructions for a 2-player game are also included).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
