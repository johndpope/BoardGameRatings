			<description>Infusion is a sci-fi fantasy deckbuilding game featuring some of the most popular characters in all of literature. Enlist help from characters featured in stories by The Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Anderson, Lewis Carroll, and more. Use your Recruits to complete Missions and score rewards.  The player with the most reward points at the end of the game wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To setup, players chose a Hero card, randomly choose 12 Reinforcement Recruits, and reveal three random Epic Missions.  The 12 Reinforcement Recruits and the Basic Recruit are used as a shared pool of cards available to all players.  Over the course of the game, players add to their deck from this shared pool of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players take turns Assigning their Recruits, Enlisting new Recruits, and Running Missions.  You can enlist the help of space pirates, hackers, artificial intelligence, and more!  These Recruits bring game text as well as Loyalty and Skill to a Hero, which are used to enhance your ability to enlist more Recruits and to run Missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beware though - players also have Exploits at their disposal, which can alter the course of the game.  You can use some Exploits to benefit yourself, while other Exploits can disrupt your opponents' turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The more Missions you complete, the more Reward Points you will earn.  Once your Recruits raise enough Skill, you will be able to complete Epic Missions as well, for far great Rewards &amp;ndash; such as more reward points and additional game text for your Hero.  When you complete an Epic Mission, it is immediately replaced with the top card of the Epic Mission pile.  Once a player has Run a total of three Epic Missions, the game ends.  Everyone counts up their Reward Points to determine the winner.  Whoever has the most Reward Points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The base set of the game comes with 480 cards and 12 unique oversized Hero cards, which allows for lots of variety and personalized game play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Click the following link for the rulebook!  &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxVI_PqfGZR0WWNOZzZ3QUxQVDQ/view&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxVI_PqfGZR0WWNOZzZ3QUxQVDQ...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
