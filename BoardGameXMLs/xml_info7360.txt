			<description>The Mating Game is a personality profile game which is supposed to compare your personality to that of your mate (or any other person) to see how compatible you are with each other.  It uses a set of four cards to determine your personality. Each card has questions from one of four categories; &amp;quot;The Real Me&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;For Love and Money&amp;quot; (Tastes and Attitudes), &amp;quot;Do Your Thing&amp;quot; (Interest and Activity Preferences) and &amp;quot;Let's Talk About the Scene&amp;quot; (Controversial Opinions). There are also blank cards included so that players can create their own questions. There are 20 questions on each card, each with three possible answers. For example, the first question under &amp;quot;The Real Me&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;I keep records of my expenditures; a)Yes, b)No, c)Sometimes&amp;quot;. There are a, b and c columns on each card. Players use special hole punches to punch out the column corresponding to their answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all players have punched their answers the cards are placed in pairs in the &amp;quot;reader&amp;quot; and the number of common answers are noted by checking to see where the punched holes overlap. The players with the most overlaps are considered to be the most compatible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
