			<description>For mature readers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore the supernatural as myth, the fantastic, or reality. Characters are created by choosing their pursuits in life, and those who have been tainted by the supernatural gain secret knowledges for their chosen pursuit. Explore such pursuits as empathy (Second Sight), faith (Divine Arts), magic (Sorcery), occult (Unholy Arts), science (Binding Lore), or vigilantism (Heritages of the Egis). Tangle with a variety of ghosts, embodied spirits, phantoms, and banes -- or mortal threats, such as rogue sorcerers, diabolists, mad scientists, and endowed cults. Solve the mysteries of Ghostories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghostories includes the genreDiversion i rules, which provides quick, flexible, and consistent mechanics by utilizing 2 six-sided dice, as well as special rules for handling investigations, fear and dementia, paranormal powers, and connections. The design of the PDF file has also been optimized, so you can download and print it more quickly than similarly-sized products. Numerous ready-to-use characters and horrors are provided, as are four scenarios to help jump right into the action, plus numerous story ideas to help create your own supernatural mystery stories. Ghostories is not only compatible with Active Exploits Diceless, it can also be combined with other genreDiversion i games, such as Coyote Trail for wild west horror or Mean Streets for film noir horror. Conversion notes are also provided to adapt Unbidden(tm) characters for use with Ghostories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Embrace Ghostories and weave tales of mystery and dread, where horrific spirits walk among the mortal world, haunting a moonlit landscape of ominous portents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
