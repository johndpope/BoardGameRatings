			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNLICENSED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is an unlicensed version of Jumpman (1983) and Jumpman Junior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1991, Jumpman Lives!, written by Dave Sharpless, was released by Apogee Software. In typical Apogee formula, the game consists of four &amp;quot;episodes&amp;quot;, each with twelve levels&amp;mdash;the first being free, the rest for sale. The game contains levels from Jumpman and Jumpman Jr., and a number of new levels. The game also includes an editor. Apogee was forced to withdraw the game soon after release at the request of Epyx, who still owned the rights to Jumpman (they reverted to Randy Glover in 1993).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Jumpman&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;In Jumpman Lives!, as in the Jumpman games, the protagonist rushes about each level collecting the planted bombs while avoiding the hazards of each area.  Jumpman is equipped with boots that let him jump great distances and can climb ropes and ladders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
