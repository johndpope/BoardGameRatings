			<description>Bit.Trip Complete is a compilation of six games in the Bit.Trip series, including Bit.Trip Beat, Bit.Trip Core, Bit.Trip Void, Bit.Trip Runner, Bit.Trip Fate, and Bit.Trip Flux. It was developed by Gaijin Games for the Wii and published by Aksys in North America and Rising Star Games in Europe. Included with the game is a music CD, titled Bit.Trip Soundtrack Sampler that contains pieces from all six games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes 20 extra &amp;quot;challenge levels&amp;quot; for each game, as well as bonus content related to the production of the games. These levels are completely new but are shorter than the already included levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bit.Trip Complete&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
