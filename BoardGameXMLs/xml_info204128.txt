							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Village of Eirie</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eirie was once a peaceful village like many other boring peaceful villages. Established by settlers from the civilized city states, the small farming settlement that traded with the then friendly natives grew into a small village. A missionary priest built a small chapel in which he taught the true gods to the natives. Then one day, Goopsa the necromancer came to town. Disguised as a retired merchant, he bought the village's only inn and became a distinguished citizen of the village. However, his real purpose for coming to the village was to find a great power trapped in the well of Carkinaxital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For characters of 5th - 7th level&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
