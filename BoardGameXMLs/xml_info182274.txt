			<description>NXS (pronounced &amp;quot;nexus&amp;quot;) is an abstract strategy game played on hexagonal boards with hexagonal pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has his or her own board.  Each player sets up their pieces on their board in either a short game (7 piece) or long game (13-14 piece) configuration.  Players push their boards together in either a two or three player arrangement.  Players alternately move their pieces (and rotate them) in an attempt to capture both enemy pieces, and enemy territory.  Enemy territory is captured by &amp;quot;surrounding&amp;quot; it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play continues until one player captures a predetermined amount of enemy territory (usually 10 spaces).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notes:&lt;br/&gt;Although there are official short and long game setups, players can choose any agreed upon starting position of pieces that they like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The amount of territory required to win can be adjusted for different types of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing advanced rules, a player may rotate his or her entire game board as a move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it is officially a 2-3 player game, 6 players could surround a 7th neutral board and play a fully balanced game.  Technically this makes it a two, three, or six player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
