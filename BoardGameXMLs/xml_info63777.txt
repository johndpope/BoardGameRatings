							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cartoon Action Hour: Season Two</name>
									
			<description>[From the Spectrum Game website]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cartoon Action Hour: Season 2 is the second edition of the game that was nominated for &amp;quot;Best Role-Playing Game&amp;quot; at the 2003 Origins Award ceremony. Completely revised, CAH:S2 is not just a universal RPG accompanied by genre-appropriate artwork. Every facet of the game was designed to flawlessly emulate the action-adventure cartoons of the 1980s, using &amp;quot;cartoon logic&amp;quot; as the foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast and Easy Character Creation: Gone is the massive amount of points-juggling of the first edition. Now, you can create your character in 15 minutes or less, thanks to an intuitive system that doesn't require a multitude of tables and lists to pour over. If you want your character to be good (or bad) at something, jot down what it is and assign a rating to it! That's the bulk of character creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Retro-Toon Combat: This is not traditional RPG combat! CAH:S2 takes a more abstract approach in keeping with the source material. Remember, in the cartoons of old, it was more common for the heroes to defeat the villains by trapping, delaying, frustrating or otherwise hindering them than it was for them to do defeat them by inflicting massive damage. This is represented in the game by giving your enemies Setback Tokens. A character that suffers its fourth Setback Token is defeated. For minor fight sequences, you can opt to use the &amp;ldquo;scene-based&amp;rdquo; combat rules, enabling you to determine the results of an entire fight in the matter of seconds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Series Creation: The rulebook features rules and guidelines for designing your own series to play in or run. After all, there&amp;rsquo;s a big difference between a series about a paramilitary team and a series that focuses on giant transforming robots!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Mastering Material Galore: Everything you need to know in order to run CAH:S2 is included in the rulebook, from implementing commercial breaks to setting up a rogues gallery. You&amp;rsquo;ll also find advice for keeping the game in the spirit of the retro-toons; sections include: Cartoon Logic, Cheese &amp;amp; How To Use It, After-Show Messages, Multiple Player Characters, 30-Minute Episodes, The Movie, The Star of the Show, and Cut Scenes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featured Series: The rulebook presents three ready-to-play series, spanning close to 45 pages! Warriors of the Cosmos, Strikeforce Freedom and Transbots are all detailed here, complete with more than 80 character write-ups!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
