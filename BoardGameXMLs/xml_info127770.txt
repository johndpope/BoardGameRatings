			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some say it&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;end times,&amp;rdquo; that the world will end with the close of the millennium &amp;mdash; or even before that. The dead are restless, ancient demigods strive to take over the world, and occasionally a giant marshmallow man or the Statue of Liberty strides through Manhattan. Even with the apocalypse nigh, plenty of folks want to get on with their ordinary lives, without inconvenient interruptions by the &amp;ldquo;living impaired.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s where the heroes come in, as members of a local Ghostbusters franchise. After all, not every haunt happens in New York City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, not every haunt involves full-torso apparitions or free-roaming vapors, let alone corporeal manifestations. Sometimes a Ghostbusting gig requires careful research and investigation, staking out a haunted site with cameras and various sensors to try to pinpoint the location of minor PKE spikes and ectoplasmic formation, before it&amp;rsquo;s time to switch on the proton packs and toss out the ghost traps. Therefore, a wide variety of skills is useful for a Ghostbusters team &amp;mdash; not just good aim with a neutrona wand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our story unfolds sometime circa the late 1980s or very early 1990s, after the events as portrayed in the movies Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II. The world has been saved from nigh- apocalyptic supernatural catastrophes twice by the original Ghostbusters gang, but paranormal activity is still on the rise. Best of all, customers are paying good money to have the  Ghostbusters do something about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, strap on your proton pack, make sure the light is green on your ghost trap, and check the batteries on your PKE meter and ecto-goggles. It&amp;rsquo;s time to bust some ghosts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
