			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder compatible adventure for four characters of 3rd level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The endless swamps and marshes of the Reedland region of the Fenian Triarchy, on the shores of the Opal Sea are a wild and fertile place, with many races living side-by-side in less than perfect harmony. Reptilian and amphibian sentient races especially like the warm waters and fecund life there, and squabble over territory, trade and religion much as their warm-blooded neighbours do, if much more, well, cold-bloodedly&amp;hellip; The boggards and grippli of the region are a particular case, the small and peaceful grippli often preyed upon by the larger and warlike boggards, who seek more land to support their grotesquely bloated leaders. The friendly tree-frog people desperately need allies to balance the scales in the Reedlands, for they would be very useful in keeping those swamps out of renegade Elementalist hands, or the sudden rise of a boggard leader who may grow bold enough to raid human lands, like the nearby City of Boats or Kama Rue. All it would take would be to find some fragment of powerful war-magic, left over from the world-shaking NewGod Wars to push the balance of power over to one side&amp;hellip; or the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
