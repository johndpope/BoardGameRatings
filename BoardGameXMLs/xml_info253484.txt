			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robot 1 in the ship of doom is a flick-screen platform action adventure for the ZX Spectrum. The player must navigate through various screens, dodging enemies and finding the four teleport keys to get out of the ship.&lt;br/&gt;The 128K version features AY muzak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ship is doomed. The crew have gone. They left you behind. I mean after all, you are just a low ranking service robot. The clock is ticking....     In five minutes the ship and everything in it will plunge into the nearby sun.&lt;br/&gt; Your mission is to locate all four teleport keys which are scattered about the ship to reactivate the teleporter and get to safety.&lt;br/&gt; Your batteries have a limited supply and so you will need to recharge at the wall sockets found throughout the ship.&lt;br/&gt; You might as well gather up as many of the smaller data keys too, they may come in handy. If you run out of time, you die. If you run out of batteries, you die. Don't die!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits&lt;br/&gt;Mat Recardo: design, gode, graphics&lt;br/&gt;Sergey Kosov: AY music&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
