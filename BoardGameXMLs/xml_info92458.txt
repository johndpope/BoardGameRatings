			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What can be said of the most prolific and archetypal love story in Western culture? That it is full of passion and tragedy, certainly. That it has moments of high comedy and skewering philosophical insights, most assuredly. But will it make a good role-playing game scenario? The author submits that it will. After all, it shares several traits with many a good adventure tale: there are the rival families, Capulet and Montague, waging an overt war on the streets and in the alleys of Verona; there is the love-struck hero, and the fair damsel imprisoned in their familial loyalties; there is intrigue, as the young lovers seek to hide their romance from the public eye, friend and foe alike; there is even the implication that supernatural forces are at work to shape the destinies of the &amp;ldquo;star-crossed lovers&amp;rdquo;. This RPG sourcebook focus on the history and setting of this well known Shakespeare piece and how to integrate it into your regular local gaming session. This sourcebook also comes with several adventures seed with different endings to this classic play. You have read the dramatic piece, now play the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
