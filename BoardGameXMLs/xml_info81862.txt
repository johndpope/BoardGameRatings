			<description>From the official website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;RUNE is a 3D action game developed by Human Head Studios Inc. to be published in Fall 2000 by Gathering Of Developers. Human Head is a development company based in Madison, Wisconsin and is comprised of veteran game developers from Raven Software and FASA Interactive. Gathering of Developers is the publisher of such games as, Railroad Tycoon II, Darkstone, Heavy Metal F.A.K.K.2 and KISS: Psycho Circus - The Nightmare Child.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In RUNE, players assume the role of Ragnar the Viking, mightiest warrior of a bygone age. In an age when might makes right, it is Ragnar who doles out justice on the blade of his massive battle-axe. Players will explore beautiful settings both above and below the mountains of the far north as Ragnar fights his way through several stunning and unique kingdoms to an ultimate confrontation with the Sark Amen, the shadowy warrior-masters of the netherworld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RUNE is a third-person perspective game of intense action and adventure steeped in a blend of Norse mythology and high fantasy. Players will have to use their brains as well as their massive brawn to survive as they explore the fully 3D game world fighting off fantastic creatures from both Norse legend and the fertile minds of the Human Head staff with their array of swords, axes and magical devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game focuses on equal parts melee combat and exploration, with levels ranging from a Viking town to the caverns of the Dwarves to a city in the mountains. Players will have access to a wide array of melee weapons based both in fact and fantasy as Ragnar delves deeper into the realms of myth and further from his old reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RUNE includes a full single player story game as well as several specially designed multi-player levels that allow players to cooperate or compete as Ragnar or another Viking warrior. The multi-player game will also include special handicap and team modes to widen the multi-player experience.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
