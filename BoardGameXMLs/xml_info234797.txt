							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yummy Yummy Pancake: Promo Boards</name>
									
			<description>Combine Yummy Yummy Pancake: Promo Boards with the Yummy Yummy Pancake base game to enjoy an even more exciting gaming experience!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What changes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The aim of the game when using boards changes: Be the first to complete your board with the appropriate pancakes.&lt;br/&gt;     During set-up, all pancakes are put face-up on the table, so the chef gets to choose which toppings will be placed in the frying pan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to use the boards?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Each player starts the game with a board and must complete it accordingly. The chocolate pancake is now a joker and can be used as any topping, but you can't move it once played on your board.&lt;br/&gt;     If you get pancakes you don't need, place them face-down in the designated space. If full, you must exchange three of them with one remaining pancake from the table to add to your board.&lt;br/&gt;     Small tip! For easy gameplay, use the board's face with only four tokens to match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
