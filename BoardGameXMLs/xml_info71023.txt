							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sanguine Covenant (OGL 3.5)</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sanguine Covenant grew from a simple religion worshiped in small villages to be the official religion of the Arman Protectorate and the Imperial Alliance. While not a truly universal religion, the covenant is the most widespread, and most powerful, single church in the world of NeoExodus. The Sanguine Covenant is a monotheistic religion that worships a single Sanguine Lord, the god named Tarac. The Sanguine Lord works through his outsider agents (the Venerates), and the avowed (his sworn servants). The primary goal of the Sanguine Covenant is to eliminate dark powers, most notably demons, devils, undead, and evil arcane spellcasters. Unfortunately, the covenant sometimes strays too far from this lofty goal, and becomes a force for fear and bigotry as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     History of Sanguine Covenant&lt;br/&gt;     Sanguine Hierarchy Structure&lt;br/&gt;     History of the Sanguine Lord and The Venerates&lt;br/&gt;     New Prestige Class: Covenant Daemonslayer&lt;br/&gt;     New Magic Items: Rod of Sins&lt;br/&gt;     Nearly 20 New Feats including Attached Soul, Devout, Fanatic, Heretic and Religious Scholar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All this, Plus added for free: Terrornomicon: Aneishi. The Aneishi resemble anthropomorphic spiders.  Between the slave races of Sobeka and humanoids and the ruling castes of Exodites and Khaynites, another race of First Ones holds sway. The Aneishi are neither slaves nor citizens of the dark empire that once ruled Exodus.  These sinister spider-folk exist on the fringes of First One society, prowling places too dark for even their colleagues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
