							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Succession: being a tale yet untold, of myth, might, and mystery</name>
									
			<description>From the designer's marketing materials:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Succession is a lightweight, narratively focused fantasy roleplaying game for creating and exploring a dark, dangerous world as your adventurers embark on their quests.  Setup and character creation is quick and straightforward, suitable for one-shot games, pickup games, and for play when your usual game is on hiatus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Succession, you play a mortal adventurer setting out on a quest, either given by your god, or in service to your home, or chosen freely for yourself.  The gods are the main element defined in the setting you and your friends will create, and while none is purely good or evil, each god has difficult tenets to adhere to, and in return each offers a chance for greatness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your god will strongly influence your life, as you overthrow tyrants, traverse and tame frightening landscapes, explore forgotten temples, and defend your home and people from conquest, plague, and worse.  While your god can make use of you no matter your skills, the relationship you forge (or break) with your faith and fellows will define you and your place in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simple, flexible, and clearly-written rules allow your group to explore many kinds of adventures, and the rules are designed to ensure that your adventurers can do anything their quest requires, if they risk and sacrifice enough.  Resolution uses ordinary six-sided dice, and a typical session lasts four hours, including setup and character creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Succession is intended for 'GMless' play, in which every player has some of the responsibilities and privileges of a traditional GM, however the rules will still work if your group prefers to use a more conventional GM/player division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you stand by as your world crumbles?  Or will you venture into the unknown and discover your fate?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
