							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">14 Non-Adventuring Magic Items</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not all magic items were created to help adventurers. Some were made for royalty or rich patrons to do tasks or grant effects that do little to nothing to help warriors and explorers. These items do not make a man stronger or smarter, they don&amp;rsquo;t help someone see farther, neither do they scare away goblins. They sweep, they clean, and they ensure a restful sleep. These are the items that could be found in abandoned castles or in a pile of treasure looted from a mansion. The adventurers may not keep them around, but then again maybe they will decide they want the magic music box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game masters wishing to place these items into their game should have them replace expensive art items in treasure the party finds. These items could be found anywhere normal magical items are discovered but they were originally commissioned for homes of the extravagantly rich or for royalty. If the party is going to be exploring a corrupt nobleman&amp;rsquo;s home, these would be great set pieces and props to show off his wealth. On the other hand, it would be just as interesting to have an orc chieftain sleeping on a Restful Bed he pillaged from a nearby estate, especially if it still had the pink silk sheets that came with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magical items for the Pathfinder Role Playing Game include the Restful Bed, Sweeping Broom, Cleaning Hair Brush, Tailor's Assistant, Shoe Shine Stand, A Good Mirror, Lasting Bed Warmer, Shifting Banner, Seasonal Tapestry, Magical Mixing Spoon, Paper Lantern Box, the Busyman's Reading Glasses, Self-cranking Music Box, and the Automated Shadow Stage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
