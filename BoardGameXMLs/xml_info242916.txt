							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Community Card Poker</name>
									
			<description>Community card poker refers to any game of poker that uses community cards (also called &amp;quot;shared cards&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;window cards&amp;quot;), which are cards dealt face up in the center of the table and shared by all players. In these games, each player is dealt privately an incomplete hand (&amp;quot;hole cards&amp;quot;), which are then combined with the community cards to make a complete hand. The set of community cards is called the &amp;quot;board&amp;quot;, and may be dealt in a simple line or arranged in a special pattern. Rules of each game determine how they may be combined with each player's private hand. The most popular community card game today is Texas hold 'em, originating sometime in the 1920s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also known as &amp;quot;flop poker&amp;quot;, community card poker is a variation of stud poker. Players are dealt an incomplete hand of face-down cards, and then a number of face-up community cards are dealt to the center of the table, each of which can be used by one or more of the players to make a 5-card hand. Texas hold 'em and Omaha are two well-known variants of the community card family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
