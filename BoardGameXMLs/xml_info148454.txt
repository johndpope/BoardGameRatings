			<description>Players try to gather Maja's friends together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player has a board with eight characters depicting Maja's friends. Each character has two slots for a colored pin to place in. The winner is the first player to place a pin in all sixteen slots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To place a pin, the current player spins the central spinner. There are spaces for the eight characters, Maja, and a lightning bolt. If Maja is the result, the player may place two pins in any slots. If the lightning bolt occurs, the player must remove two pins. If any of the eight characters are spun, the player places one pin on the character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may also place a pawn near one spinner space to potentially be able to place two pins on the character, if it is spun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
