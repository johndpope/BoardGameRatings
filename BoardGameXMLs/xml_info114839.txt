			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyberpunk by R.Talsorian Games has been around since 1988. Cyberpunk used a variation of the Interlock system introduced for R.Talsorian's other game, Mekton II. In 1990, the second edition of Cyberpunk, called Cyberpunk 2020, made several changes to its version of Interlock. Almost all of the rules were completely redone and retooled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;R.Talsorian has promised a third edition of Cyberpunk, and with it further changes to the rules. This time around, the rules have also changed names. The Interlock system is now called the Fuzion system, so-named because it introduces elements from another popular game system, the HERO system, and &amp;quot;fuses&amp;quot; the two together. Fuzion, itself, has undergone several variations, similar to its previous Interlock incarnation. Each Fuzion variant is as similar to, and as different from, each other as the Interlock-based as Cyberpunk, Mekton, and Cybergeneration variations of Interlock were. Fuzion offers a lot of customizable options. Using a system of &amp;quot;switches&amp;quot;, allowing certain rules to be &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;off&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;dials&amp;quot;, allowing settings to be changed from genre to genre; and &amp;quot;plug-ins&amp;quot;, entire rules-sets that may be used in a game at a GM's discretion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This built-in customization allows Fuzion to be molded, adapted, and modified to fit any genre. The &amp;quot;Core&amp;quot; Fuzion rules, without customization, can do a good job of approximating the feel of most genres, but not very well. Therefore, each Fuzion game must be customized to fit its genre and setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CyberFuzion is my attempt to provide a sneak preview of the kinds of changes, modifications, and customizations to expect from the upcoming new edition. This is in an attempt to assuage the fears a lot of Cyberpunk fans have that the next edition will be ruined, and to dispel a lot of misconceptions some have about Fuzion based on rash judgments and plain old stubbornness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
