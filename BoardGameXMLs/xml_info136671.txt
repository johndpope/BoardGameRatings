							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aliens (1982/CP/M)</name>
									
			<description>Aliens is a text-only clone of Space Invaders written for the CP/M operating system and made to be operated on the early Kaypro line of luggable computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aliens was made within the limitations of Kaypro's early text-only computers. As a result, the aliens are made of letters and punctuation marks. Each level was given a name, displayed on top of the screen, such as Blood Bath and We Come in Peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with Star Trek, CatChum and Ladder, Aliens was one of the games that came with the software bundle of the early Kaypro computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Aliens (Kaypro video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
