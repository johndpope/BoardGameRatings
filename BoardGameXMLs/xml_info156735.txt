							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City of Shiran E14: Bull Ring Tavern</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bull Ring Tavern is located in the cellar of a nondescript warehouse in the Kobar District, home to many of Shiran's poorer residents. Although most popular with ordinary folk, the Bull Ring is also frequented by members of wealthy land-owning clans seeking a taste of the forbidden. Some patrons appreciate the poor illumination and the lack of questions as long as one&amp;rsquo;s coin is good. Some activities demand privacy and discretion. The tavern features a fighting pit, where men and animals fight for the entertainment of the crowd. The Bull Ring is a nasty, merciless place, and is owned by Goril of Ardair, the head of the local Lia-Kavair (Thieves' Guild).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This location expansion is intended for use with the City of Shiran article (COL #5790). It describes the establishment, its proprietor, and the sordid events that take place. Full-color plans of the building are included, along with several adventure hooks the GM can use to bring the location into play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
