							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Down to New England Town (6e)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will be driving through a small New England town on their way to some other place when they will encounter a police road block. There will be two police cars and four officers. They are armed with 9mm pistols. They are stopping every car and are searching it carefully. When the Investigators reach their turn, one of them will recognize Officer Jennifer Hansen (she went to high school with the investigator and they were friends for a while).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
