			<description>Subtitled: The Universal Cinematic Role Playing Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Qi focuses on better role-playing and the fastest gameplay around. With systems for managing reputation, infamy, personal honor, and character development, Qi inspires character growth and promotes role play. Skill use is setup to keep a low profile during gameplay that does not interfere with the acting. Checking for success is handled by a fast, one test system. The combat system is instinctive and simultaneous, so even large scale combats can be handled quickly. Maneuvers and mechanics are designed to control the flow of combat or stop it before it starts. Grappling or covering an opponent makes the threat of violence as effective and dramatic as charging in guns blazing. --publisher's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
