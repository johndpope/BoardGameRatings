			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gamemaster&amp;rsquo;s Role!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swift Saga RPG relies on one player acting as the Gamemaster, or GM. The role of a GM can be divided into two&lt;br/&gt;main jobs: Designing Adventures and Running Adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designing Adventures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a GM, one of your jobs is to design adventures. It's tricky to get the hang of it at first, so many GMs start with&lt;br/&gt;published adventures or adapt stories they're fond of. There isn't a Right Way to design a fun adventure, but the&lt;br/&gt;game system will certainly get in your way if you're trying to design an adventure for which it isn't well-suited. Swift&lt;br/&gt;Saga was designed with a certain adventure in mind. More on this in a bit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Running Adventures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Running an adventure can be seen as directing a play, except you're also acting as a few of the extras, the set&lt;br/&gt;designer, and the guy in charge of lights and sound. You set the stage, give the players their cues, and respond to&lt;br/&gt;their actions. Depending on what they do, you may have to hastily create new locations or new non-Player&lt;br/&gt;Characters (NPCs) for them to interact with. Collaborative entertainment is the goal! Remain open to ideas from your&lt;br/&gt;players and you'll end up experiencing a story none of you expected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
