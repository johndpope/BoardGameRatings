			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game for three to five players. One player takes the role of the Hero and fulfills many of the GMish duties that the game requires. The other players take the role of someone close to the Hero who know their secret identity and cares about who they are when they take off their mask.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game about people dealing with someone they care about who has decided to do something dangerous and illegal but, ultimately, intended to help others. It is also about the toll of dealing with the Hero and the ramifications of their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
