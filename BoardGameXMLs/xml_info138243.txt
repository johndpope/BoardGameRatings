							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Omen: A Reign of War â€“ Echoes of Myth</name>
									
			<description>The fires of war have begun to smolder, and it's clear that an end to the Reign of War is in sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Echoes of Myth, the final planned expansion for Omen: A Reign of War, introduces twelve brand new units, including an all new unit type: Spirits. When a Spirit enters a City, it has two different abilities, and you choose which one you will use. However, you have the option of paying the Spirit's cost, plus a little extra, and discarding it from your hand to use both abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
