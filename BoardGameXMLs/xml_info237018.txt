			<description>A One-Round Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two days ago your band was exploring the depths of Undermountain, the fabled dungeon under the City of Waterdeep. Then disaster struck. You finally discovered a secret stairway leading deeper into the dungeon, when lurking in the next chamber was a beholder and its ogre servants. The ensuing battle was fast and furious, ending in the unfortunate demise of the party's bard Rinnin. Shortly after, the priest Abbot was hit by the paralyzation eye of the dreaded beast. Needless to say, a strategic retreat was in order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your band scampered out the nearest door, with Abbot slung over Nordicia's shoulder, and hastily escaped the remaining ogres. After three right turns your party was suddenly enveloped in a brilliant, violet flash... and you found yourselves floundering in the shifting sands of a desert!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is distributed as two separate files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        24-page DOC scenario&lt;br/&gt;        17-page pre-generated characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
