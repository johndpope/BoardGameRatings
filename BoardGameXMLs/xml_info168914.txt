							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sjov Gennem Danmark</name>
									
			<description>Travel through Denmark to become the first to reach the goal and thereby be declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;But be carefull! Landing on an orange spot can be good or bad news for you (move to another place or wait some turns). If you land on a red place you take one of the 24 Chance cards, which is random and unforseen; it could be good - but it could also be bad!.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An exciting drive through Denmark. Family game also for the little ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
