			<description>SIDELINE FOOTBALL by FTP Sports Games is a full simulation of the game of Professional or College football.  The game engine is designed around an individual player's ability or inability to win battles or one-on-one matchups.  Each play from scrimmage calls on one or more players to make a play that will influence the result.  Offensive players will block, read defenses, read holes, get open, pass, catch and run, all in an attempt to make a positive play for the offense. Defensive players will play the run, tackle, hit, rush the passer, sack the passer, defend pass routes, intercept the ball and force fumbles all in an attempt to make a positive play for the defense.  The task(s) on each play and the player(s) involved are determined by a GAME CENTER Chart which serves as the centerpiece for game play. A double-sided Play Result Card deck is used in conjunction with the GAME CENTER to determine who is involved on the play and what the result of the play is.  Nearly all plays from scrimmage come from the Play Result Deck, GAME CENTER Chart and individual player cards.  Long Gains, Special Teams, Trick Plays, Turnovers and Injuries get their results from a series of supplemental charts.  On any given play, an offensive player, defensive player or a combination of the two can influence the result.  This gives each individual game a full flavor of the quality of the players from both teams as each individual player will be involved in many play results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
