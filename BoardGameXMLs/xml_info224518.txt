			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here be Pendragons...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ancient Britain is a land like no other. Shaped by gods, faeries, giants, and the iron will of human invaders, the very landscape bears witness to the enduring legacy of magic, fire, and steel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This digital download bundle includes over forty maps for use with the King Arthur Pendragon roleplaying game. It marks the first-ever such collection in the game's illustrious history and includes all of the maps from the Book of the Estate (2013), the Book of the Warlord (2014) and the Book of Uther (2015). Like the work of the Victorian cartographers who inspired them, these maps are presented in their original black-and-white but in high resolution suitable for printing or for use with virtual tabletops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The maps span the Early Phase of The Great Pendragon Campaign and detail castle sites (including a few authentic motte-and-bailey plans), political and ecclesiastical power-bases in the Kingdom of Logres, a new and updated vision of County Salisbury, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
