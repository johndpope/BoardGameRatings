			<description>Collect the ladybugs and katydids while avoiding stink bugs and other destructive bugs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game play mechanics are simple. It's a collecting game that involves 52 cards of mostly insects and other creatures of the yard. What makes this game unique and different from your average trick taking game is that you don't just add your points up when all cards have been played. There's a damage phase that takes place when scoring and certain cards (or bugs) will eat other bugs. There are many different combinations of scoring that can happen depending on what you collect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
