			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Munchkin is not a drinking game. Really.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But don't let that stop you from showing your love of Munchkin with the Munchkin 10th Anniversary Shot Glass. These 1.5 oz glasses are black with the Munchkin 10th Anniversary logo in gold. It's a treasure that any munchkin would be happy to find in his dungeon haul... especially since they come with a special rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Munchkin 10th Anniversary Shot Glass Rule&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Munchkin 10th Anniversary Shot Glass may be used in any Munchkin game or its sequels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When fighting a monster on your turn, you may take one complete shot of Strength Potion* from the Munchkin 10th Anniversary Shot Glass to get a +10 combat bonus. You may do this as many times as you like during a game, but every drink of Strength Potion after the first costs you a level. You may only benefit from one Strength Potion per combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The owner of the Shot Glass is the sole judge of what liquid(s) will make up the Strength Potion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the Munchkin series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
