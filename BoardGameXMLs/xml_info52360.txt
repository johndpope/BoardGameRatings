							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">One Last Riddle</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the great sphinx Ujaset is slain, his ghost offers treasure to any heroes brave enough to avenge his death. Can your party solve his One Last Riddle to discover and defeat his killers? Game designer David Eckelberry offers the latest in our series of monthly free adventures. This original Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons scenario is suitable for a party of four to six characters of 5th to 7th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Preview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The great sphinx Ujaset died last night. Before that time, the people of the surrounding land reported the occasional appearance of a translucent winged leonine figure in the skies above. Local folklore held that this beast sometimes halted the progress of travelers to trouble them with its clever questions, generously rewarding those who could answer the sphinx?s riddles. Perhaps it?s this very legend that has drawn the player characters to the region. . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The road stretches out as it has for the last hour. A cold wind brushes across your face, and while you look for its source, a low moan echoes. Staring into the twilight ahead, a pale, flickering form can be seen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first you see a the noble visage of a bearded man?s head, twisted with sorrow. Then it?s the body of a powerful lion, ten feet long and complete with swishing tail. Finally there?s the great hawklike wings greater than any bird. The form twinkles, transculent, coalescing into a single being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Now you dare the last riddle of Ujaset,&amp;quot; moans the voice. . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
