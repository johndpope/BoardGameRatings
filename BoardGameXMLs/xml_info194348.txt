							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fields of Blood</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The endless fields of waving grains and scrub brush&amp;mdash;many see them as featureless wastes, places to be crossed in a journey with little to catch the eye or divert the attention, but these vast seas of grass play home to many terrible beasts, deadly challenges, and amazing tales all hiding just beneath the thin veneer of featureless expanses. Fields of Blood takes a close look at these lands often taken for granted as realms of excitement and mystery and injects them with new life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With cultural elements and traditions taken from the American Great Plains, the African Savannah, and the Mongolian Steppes, Fields of Blood provides new rules for plains environments, hazards, travel, skills and feats, equipment, monsters, deities, spells, and archetypes. In addition, Fields of Blood includes three ready-to-play adventures for introducing your players into the endless expanse of the grassy sea with &amp;ldquo;Feast of Fury&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Red Wedding&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Madness Grows&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fields of Blood provides rules and options for any plains campaign. While its adventures can easily be set in any plains campaign, they are, however, official Lost Lands setting adventures intended for characters of levels 1&amp;ndash;7+. They include plains terrain, dungeon, and village encounters and are written for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
