							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Campaign 1814</name>
									
			<description>After the decisive Battle of Leipzig the French retreated to the Rhine and beyond into France. Following them were the victorious forces of the Sixth Coalition. Napoleon positioned his forces on the Rhine, in Holland and in Belgium and then left for Paris to build new field commands. Eugene was in northern Italy facing an Austrian army under Bellegarde. And of course the war in Spain was winding down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Allies did not wait for Napoleon to bring up his new army and began to cross the Rhine at several points. The understrength French corps were no match for the Allied juggernaut and retired by stages closer to the west. By the end of January the Allies had advanced to within one hundred miles of Paris!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What followed from that point, until the end of the campaign, was one of Napoleon's most remarkable campaigns. Fielding an army one third the size of the Allied forces he won one stunning victory after another. Unfortunately he was never able to achieve a decisive victory. The Allied armies gradually ground down the outnumbered French forces and after the Battle of Paris he was forced to abdicate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As either Napoleon, Emperor of the French and King of Italy, or as Schwarzenberg and Bl&amp;uuml;cher, field commanders of the Allied legions, you can relive those exciting days! With over four hundred scenarios, and more than ten campaigns, all of the major actions of the 1814 Campaign in northwest France are covered in detail. Units such as the Gendarmes d'Espanol and the Baden Guard Grenadiers have been added to the 1813-14 inventory for the players to command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come experience the drama of the campaign as your men shiver in the cold waiting for your next command. Will you, as Napoleon, keep your throne, or will you as the Allied commanders, march victoriously into Paris? The choice is yours as you ride off into destiny!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
