			<description>&amp;quot;An exciting game of skill and chance as you make your way through the ups &amp;amp; downs of employment &amp;amp; unemployment to the ultimate Golden Handshake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The winner of the game is the first player to achieve 'THE GOLDEN HANDSHAKE AWARD,' or in the event of no player achieving this, the winner is the player with the most money.  This is to be achieved by each player successfully completing either of their chosen career paths, each having its own pitfalls, and thus accumulating enough money to go for 'THE GOLDEN HANDSHAKE AWARD'.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
