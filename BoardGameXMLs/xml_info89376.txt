			<description>Fr&amp;uuml;her oder Sp&amp;auml;ter is a card game issued by the Bundeszentrale f&amp;uuml;r politische Bildung of Germany. The game has 61 cards, each one depicting one event of German history from 1949-2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains two variants. The first variant is a simple guessing game if the hidden card from the top of your stack is earlier or later than the current open card. The second game is a bit more interesting for gamers. One player reads an event and the other players offer one of their events which should be as close as possible to the first event. The first player then decides which event is closest to his event. If he's right, he and the other player can keep the card. Otherwise, only the player who has played the closest card, can keep his card. Winner is the player who first gets 5 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
