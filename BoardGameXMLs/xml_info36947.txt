			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free the lost souls!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lots of lost souls wander around the old Aztec's pyramid. As a chief, you have to earn your right to rest in that pyramid. Free as many souls as you can to obtain your last sleep's place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a chief and two slaves. The chief moves very slowly but can steal collected souls from other player's slaves. The slaves are fast and can collect souls to bring them to their chief. But the pyramid's maze is changing with every turn and your just-so-well-constructed escape-way is not blocked. Keep cool, because the more souls you deliver to your chief at once, the more score. But be warned: If you're too greedy, it may be over too fast and you'll end up with nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aztekz is a very complex collecting-game with very simple rules and a lot of strategic possibilities. Quick to learn, always tricky and challenging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
