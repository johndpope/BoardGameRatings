							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City Ruins</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a prosperous city must have stood in this place. Today though all that remains are ruins. Parts of the foundation walls, archways, a few empty and broken window frames, the occasional wooden beam as well as piles of stone and fragments of plaster are all that remains. Their arrangement suggests that this must once have been the backyard of a residential area with a well at its center. The ruins leave few hints, if any, at the fate of the city and its citizens. The absence of soot, charred wood and heat cracked stone at least suggests that it was no fire that eradicated the city from the landscape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
