			<description>Present Drop was the winning entry in the BoardGameCamp 2010 game jam, for a game that fitted entirely on a sheet of A4. The prize was it being printed on the back of every Cadbury selection box the following year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a Christmas tile-placing game for 2-4 players in which presents fall down chimneys into hearths. However, the path of falling presents does not always run smoothly and players may divert presents into their own hearths by altering the course of the chimneys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chimney tiles are positioned each turn by players hoping to funnel presents into their hearths or away from other players'. The chimneys may split, curve or even multiply the number of presents that fall through them. Some chimney tiles have presents on them that signal a drop. Before those tiles are placed, presents fall down each column and into the hearths. Each present is worth a point. At the end of the game there is a final present drop and the players total up their points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
