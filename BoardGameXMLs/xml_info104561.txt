							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Atomic Beast</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1954, and the time of the Atom is upon us. Since the H-bombs were dropped during WWII the world has been a different place. Fear of both the Red Menace and the devastating power of the A-bomb runs deep in the hearts of the everyday American citizen. The government is working to ensure the safety and security of the country. Selfless men and women toil in the southwestern United States to develop weapons to keep the Commies at bay. The progress is slow, and some fear that we may be losing ground, but that just makes the dedicated scientists work even harder, and take even greater risks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A great adventure by master Keeper Bob Geis, in honor of the 30th Anniversary edition of Call of Cthulhu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
