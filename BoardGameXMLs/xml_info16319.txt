			<description>'The New Property Development Board Game': in contrast to Monopoly presumably. Play comprises two stages.  In stage one players travel around a a perimeter track, 'the inner ring road' on the roll of two dice, collect income on one corner and pay taxes on another.  Each space represents a parking space.  These give either an option to purchase either property  or pick up a card and follow the instructions on it. The object is to collect a complete site made up of ten back-land plots together with a drainage easement.  When a player has achieved this, movement moves to the outer (ring road?) track that is meant to represent the process of obtaining Planning Approval for the development. This is achieved by firstly collecting cards giving recommendations for approval from three separate local authority departments and then being the first to land on the town hall space: yes, on the roll of the dice and, yes, doubles mean another go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
