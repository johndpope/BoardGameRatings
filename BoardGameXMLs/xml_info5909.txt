			<description>A very simple card game.  The game consists of a deck of 42 cards, seven cards each of numbers 1 through 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt a hand of three cards and plays one to a central pile, then refills his hand.  If the total of all the cards in the pile is a multiple of 10, the player scores one point for each multiple (e.g. 10 scores one point, 30 scores three).  Points are tallied by chips, 50 of which are provided.  When all the chips are drawn, the game is over and the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
