This is a database that various government agencies are starting to use to keep track of all the various villains and heroes. Over the last few years the number of super-powered individuals has skyrocketed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has become a full time job to try and keep track of them as well as update information about the, that is the purpose of this database. The database is designed to give law enforcement as much information as possible on supervillains or superheroes they may need to call for help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This installment will introduce a new anti-mutant organization The Purity Knights, originally presented in Villainy Codex I.
