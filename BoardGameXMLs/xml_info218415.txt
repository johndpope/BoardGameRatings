			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smoke and Mirrors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From childhood, Clinton Sear wanted to be a true magician, but discovered all magic was nothing more than tricks and special effects. He made it his goal to prove that not only magicians, but also heroes and villains with great powers, were nothing more than tricksters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He focused on the exploits of the most popular hero of the people: Recluse! Clinton used his special effects knowledge to simulate all of Recluse&amp;rsquo;s powers and abilities; framing the spiderpowered hero for a series of robberies in the process. Recluse eventually caught Clinton and cleared his name. In prison, Clinton joined the Crime Cartel. Now out of jail as the Magician (PL 9), he is the Cartel&amp;rsquo;s master of misdirection, executing distractions that lead away from the true goals of the Cartel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powered Legends. Because sometimes what you need is a character everyone will recognize, even if they&amp;rsquo;ve never met her before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
