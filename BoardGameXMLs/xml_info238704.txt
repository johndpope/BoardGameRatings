			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You know that moment when your players have slain the bad guy and his minions ... the moment where the normally upright and righteous characters become total fiends and loot the still cooling dead bodies ... well, this is for those moments. And let's face it those moments come along a lot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This list contains 20 trinkets and curiosities that will make the pilfering more interesting. Not a gold coin or gemstone amongst them this list of items contains more unusual items - mysterious notes, items, potions, keys, items of clothing ... the list goes on.*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All handily laid out in a numbered 1-20 table so you can roll a d20 (because we both know you want to) each time a character loots a corpse and surprise them with something they just wouldn't have seen coming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The items have few in-game mechanical effects (although see below) but they are rife with story hook potentials ... what does the key open ... who brewed that potion ... who's disgusting handkerchief is this?*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You get the idea!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one unusually contains two specific magic items - written for 5th edition dungeons and dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     At The Grinning Frog, we have written over 30 of these lists - most generic with a few themed. That's over 600 different items that players might find in pockets or backpacks ... the examples listed above aren't guaranteed to be in this specific list but they might be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This list has a seashore / seaside theme so suitable for any coastal, aquatic or naval adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
