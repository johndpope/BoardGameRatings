If during a turn a player doesn't hit any oppenent's marble, then his marble is put in the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the marbles in front of a player correspond exactly to the colors indicated on one of his goal card he flip it over to indicate that this goal has been met.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as a player has finished his third goal card, he is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
