							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Safari Fun</name>
									
			<description>Safari Fun is a children's spin-and-move board game given away at McDonald's restaurants. The game consists of a single sheet of thick paper with various punch-out elements that serve as the spinner, game pieces and 3-dimensional scenery. Play is standard for this type of game, with players moving along a track from start to finish, with some spaces that may move them forward or backward or cause gain or loss of a turn. Some spaces also call for the player to complete an action such as waving arms to chase away flies or pretending to swim across a river. Others feature animal facts. The first player to reach the finish wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
