			<description>Pepper: a whole new ball game! This &amp;quot;innovative new card game that sends the action in all directions! Throw a ball to anyone&amp;rsquo;s territory and see if they have what it takes to respond. Find players that can&amp;rsquo;t handle your throws and win!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of Out of the Box's &amp;quot;Fun to Go&amp;quot; series, the 52 card Pepper game consists a small tin of ten cards of five colors: blue, green, orange, purple, and yellow. Each color set contains two cards of each number: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Blue and yellow also have one card numbered 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 5 cards and the rest of the cards are not used in the game. The cards represent balls being thrown from player to player, with the card's number showing its speed. The dealer places one face-up card in front of another player. That player then places one of their cards in front of another player. They may choose a higher-numbered card or a card of the same color from their hand. Alternatively, they may pick up all the cards in front of them, add them to their hand, then choose to play any of the cards in their hand. The winner is the first player to play the last card from their hand to a player who is unable to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
