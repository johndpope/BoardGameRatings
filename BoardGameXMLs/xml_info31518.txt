			<description>Aim of the game is to be last own who still got a hidden animal. Preparation of the game is that every player gets 3 animal tiles (bushes on the reverse side) and 5 other tiles with bushes on each side. Starting with the first player every player places a tile face down,so that a matrix is built. after every one has played his or her cards, starting player place his figure and can turn over an adjacent tile.
