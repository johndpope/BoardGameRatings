			<description>An educational card game consisting of 24 matching pairs of cards. Players take turns drawing from a pile of white cards on which is printed a scripture passage that tells an incident in the Bible. Green cards that describe the incident are held in the players' hands. If a card drawn can be matched with one of the player's green cards, the pair is set aside. The first player to match all his green cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
