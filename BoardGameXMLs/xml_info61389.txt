			<description>One-Time Path is a really simple 2-players dice game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You just need a die, 5 coasters, 12 coins (or chips or counters...) and a glass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Put the 5 coasters forming a path between both players and the glass over the middle coaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In every turn, the two players (Up and Down) show at the same time several coins (from 1 to 6) and add them to obtain the 'threshold' (the 'threshold' should be a number between 1 and 6 so if the 'threshold' is greater than 6 you must subtract 6).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, one of the players rolls a die and moves the glass following this instructions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     If the die punctuation is greater than the 'threshold' the glass is moved one position towards the Up player.&lt;br/&gt;     If the die punctuation is less than the 'threshold' the glass is moved one position towards the Down player.&lt;br/&gt;     Is the die punctuation is equal to the 'threshold' the glass is not moved at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the glass reaches one of the players the game is over and this player has lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obviously the Down player wants to have a 'threshold' of 1 or 2 and the Up players prefers a 'threshold' of 5 or 6 so both players are trying to guess what the other thinks to adjust their coins in consequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you can guess how many coins the adversary is going to show you can have better chances to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One-Time Path it's a interesting drinking game. Just fill the glass with some liquor and force the loser to drink it ;-)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
