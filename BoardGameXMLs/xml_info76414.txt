			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was written for the 24 hour RPG project. I heard of the project a while ago and thought it was a great way of trying out new RPG ideas. The motivation/inspiration for this particular game came out of a number of things: (1) liking Ars Magica, but getting tired of the complexity and enormous amounts of bookkeeping required by the system; (2) wondering what an Ars game would look like set in modern times, (3) the &amp;quot;high die&amp;quot; version of Risus: The Anything RPG, and (4) a game like The Pool that gives more power to the players. And here's the result, such as it is.  I wasn't able to do everything I wanted to; in particular, I started writing it as a &amp;quot;traditional&amp;quot; RPG with the assumption of only one GM - with the intention of going back and writing in an option for more player power - but then I ran out of time! Such is life, I guess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the best I could do in 24 hours. One thing I learned from the experience: I'm no longer 18; these days, getting only 3 hours of sleep adversely - and noticeably - affects my overall state of well being. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, I'd very much appreciate knowing what you think about this attempt, and any advice you have on any aspect of the game; in particular, do you think it's worth my making a Beta version of it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
