			<description>From Publisher's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Timeline 300 is a tabletop wargame, designed to be played between two or more players, that uses collectable miniatures which are intended to be built, painted, and personalised by each player so that she can construct a personal army of her (or perhaps, his) very own. Your tactical skill, and a random factor determined by the roll of dice, shall decide who wins your own &amp;ldquo;wars that never were&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game depicts a Martian invasion of earth during steam technology era.  Players generate resources from specific units (such as mining units) each turn that can be used to 'purchase' combat units for use in the battle portion of the game.  It simulates the type of action found in many real-time-strategy (RTS) games where resources and facilities help guide what type of forces each player can bring to bear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
