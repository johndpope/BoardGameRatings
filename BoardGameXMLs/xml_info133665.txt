			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNLICENSED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is an unlicensed version of Time Pilot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Pilot is an excellent clone of the arcade classic &amp;quot;Time Pilot&amp;quot; written by Peter Johnson and David Lovekin for the BBC Micro, released by Superior Software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The user pilots a spacecraft jumping through time. The ship is always in the centre of the screen and the player can rotate clockwise or anticlockwise. The ship is armed with a fast firing machine gun. The game is played in a blue sky (except the 1999 level set in space) with white clouds that can hide enemies. In each level the objective is to clear a certain number of opponents. When the number has been reached, a boss aircraft appears which requires multiple shots to kill. At this point, your craft jumps to the next timezone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of aircraft required to make the boss appear is indicated by four aircraft symbols in the top left of the screen. When a quarter of the required aircraft have been destroyed, one symbol disappears. When half have been destroyed, the second symbol disappears, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your opponents vary depending on the time period as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1916 - World War I: Biplanes - No shots, throw grenades. Boss - Zeppelin, unarmed.&lt;br/&gt;1940 - World War II: Monoplanes - Forward firing machine guns and Light bombers - 360&amp;deg; gun turrets. Boss - Heavy bomber 360&amp;deg; gun turrets.&lt;br/&gt;1970 - Vietnam: Helicopters - 360&amp;deg; guns, Missiles. Boss - Chinook.&lt;br/&gt;1984 - Modern: Jets - Missiles. Boss - Jet Bomber 360&amp;deg; guns.&lt;br/&gt;1999 - Future: Set in space. UFOs - Missiles. Boss - Mothership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonus points can be obtained by picking up parachutists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player starts with three lives and additional lives are awarded every 10,000 points&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
