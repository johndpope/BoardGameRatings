			<description>The Players travel from a predetermined starting point to a predetermined destination city. The players get to choose their own route. When they get to city with a red number, the players get a game marker. Most of the rules are left open to agreement by the players before the start of the game. To win the game, the player either has to be the first to reach the Destination, or get the most game markers. Which goal is used has to be agreed upon before the game starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in the 1930s/1940s, so the game board shows the German borders of this time. The goal was to teach children the geography and borders of the 3rd Reich.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
