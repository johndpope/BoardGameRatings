			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Jim Webster, Hellfire is a unique set of 6mm SF wargames rules. Generic in nature, Hellfire differs from other products in this field in that it is scenario driven rather than points based - the emphasis being on putting the fun back into gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A very comprehensive set of rules, Hellfire allow you to play the game you want to play, in the setting you want to play it in. by covering a wide range of possibilities from troop reactions at night and nuclear warfare to psionics and machine intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ground breaking reaction system that governs exactly how your troops behave on the battlefield accurately simulates how prolonged exposure to combat saps at even the best of troops emotional resilience and reflects the grind of real war. Additionally the system allows you to have aliens and androids that act in an un-human fashion and not as men in rubber suits or tin cladding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook also contains four diverse scenarios illustrating the flexibility of the system and appendices on models and figure availability for the game, and SF combat literature as a source of scenario ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
