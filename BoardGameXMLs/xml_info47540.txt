							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">RDF Accelerated Training Program</name>
									
			<description>From the front cover: &amp;quot;A sourcebook for Macross with a dozen adventures and ideas for dozens more.  Includes over 20 random tables.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From page 4, Introduction: &amp;quot;Welcome to the Robotech Defense Force Accelerated Training Program!  The RDF Training Program is a supplement to the Robotech Role-Playing Game.  Please note that I said supplement, as this book is designed to be used in conjunction with the other Robotech books.  It is not intended to stand on its own.  Frequent referrals to the Robotech Role-Playing game, as well as other books in the Robotech series, will be necessary to get the full benefit of the material contained within these pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The promise of this book is exactly what the name implies -- a training manual.  Players utilizing this supplement will be asked to stretch their characters to the limit;  test new, unknown, or unused (!) abilities, and sharpen the character's skills.  Participants in RDF Accelerated Training will be more confident and resourceful than their &amp;quot;untrained&amp;quot; counterparts, thus encouraging adventures which are more stimulating.  As a consequence, game masters will be challenged by their characters' skills and inventiveness, thus offering a greater diversity in most situations.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
