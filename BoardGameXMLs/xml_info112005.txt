			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nal Sagath is a town standing on a hill in the middle of&lt;br/&gt;large swamp, in the western part of the Borderlands. A&lt;br/&gt;former Tricarnian outpost, it was conquered and razed by&lt;br/&gt;the Iron Empire during the wars, and later reconstructed&lt;br/&gt;on its very same foundations. What the people of Nal Sagath&lt;br/&gt;no longer know is that a colony of old, twisted creatures&lt;br/&gt;lives in the dark tunnels under the town. They are the&lt;br/&gt;descendants of a group of slaves who hid there to escape&lt;br/&gt;the fury of the conquerors. They call themselves Palemen,&lt;br/&gt;because their skin has become grayish after so many long&lt;br/&gt;years spent underground, and they live off the waste of the&lt;br/&gt;town and the strange fungi growing in the tunnels. The&lt;br/&gt;Palemen constantly spy on the townspeople through sewer&lt;br/&gt;grates and hidden passages. In particular, they are obsessed&lt;br/&gt;with Dalla, the beautiful blonde daughter of the innkeeper,&lt;br/&gt;and wonder how great it would be to have such a precious&lt;br/&gt;gem in their dark kingdom...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User's summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second adventure of a campaign for Beasts &amp;amp; Barbarians&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
