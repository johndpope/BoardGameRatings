							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War Prime</name>
									
			<description>War Prime is a sci-fi miniatures war game set in a distant future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The human empire has explored the stars and taken thousands of systems as their own.  But their expiation has made many enemies and their draconian rule has created unrest within their own boarders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A terrible cosmic anomaly ripped its way though the human empire forcing those from the many planets in its path to evacuate, abandoning homes and resources. This disaster gives the Empire's enemies the opportunity they need to invade and drive the ruling aristocracy out of power.  Earth has fallen and humanity is fractured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game of War Prime allows players to take up one of many sides in this galactic battle.  The initial release of rules includes the divided Humans, the savage Kelk, and the mysterious Amerant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
