			<description>Fast-Action Games created many &amp;quot;quick-play&amp;quot; sports simulations where the outcome of a contest could be decided with just one or two dice rolls.  These games made it easy to play an entire series of games in a matter of just a few minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game covers professional basketball.  Like all of the team sports games in this line, a few simple numbers, devised from team statistics, enable the player to recreate an entire season in a short period of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes NBA, BBA, ABA, NBL, ABL, WPBT, and PBLA and NPBL leagues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
