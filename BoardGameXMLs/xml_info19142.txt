			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is a quality assurance agent in a factory that makes goofy gadgets from widgets of questionable quality.  But they're no ordinary inspectors -- they're SECRET quality assurance agents with their own agenda!  The object of the game is to ship as many of your own widgets as possible while scrapping other players' widgets so you can secretly resell them.  The catch is that if another player exposes your secret inspector identity (which can be deduced from which items you are allowed to take off the assembly line), you're fired!  The player with the biggest widget hoard at the end of the game wins.  Optional rules adjust the ferocity of gameplay and the difficulty of deduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
