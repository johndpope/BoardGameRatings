							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sumo Dice</name>
									
			<description>Sumo Dice is a 2-player tactical microgame that uses a couple of d6 to simulate a Sumo fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls a die that represents a Sumo fighter. When the die moves, it changes its face-up side, and if you land your die adjacent to your opponent with a face-up number greater than his, you push it a certain number of spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game you basically must throw the adversary out of the board. You also win if your opponent receives 3 damage, that is usually caused by terrain features like a pit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
