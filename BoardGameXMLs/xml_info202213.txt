							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Men &amp; Monsters of the Aegean</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Men &amp;amp; Monsters of the Aegean is Skirmisher Publishing's first title for the BASH Fantasy role-playing game system. It presents a dozen player character races and 30 types of monster, with multiple variants for many of them, all inspired by the myths and legends of the Classical world and each with an Adventure Hook and background information integrating it into the setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New races include the hulking Antaeans, the Myrmidons who followed Achilles in the Trojan War, and the dog-head Cynocephalians. Monsters include everything from familiar creatures like the Cyclops, Manticore, Pegasus, and Sphinx to more exotic ones like the Drakon, Empusa, Hippalectryon, Ophiotaurus, and Sea Leopard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fully-illustrated manual also includes sections on using existing creatures in an Aegean campaign, encounter tables, and new items, powers, advantages, and disadvantages for the BASH system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the monsters presented in this book are associated with the system-free Swords of Kos Fantasy Campaign Setting, a milieu is set in a re-imagined Mediterranean, and can be easily incorporated into games that use it or other settings altogether. Here, the Gods of Olympus reign, their heroes acting as agents of their will or exemplars of their glory. A century before, the Titans began a war that nearly destroyed the world and this Cataclysm changed everything, returning monsters to the earth, allowing the dead to roam, sinking islands, shattering cities, upsetting the cosmic balance. As the monsters returned, so too did the Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, Elementals, Giants, Dragons, Satyrs, Goblins, and Orcs, striding, creeping, skulking or marching back into the world from distant realms or deep fastness, rejoining the world they had left behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
