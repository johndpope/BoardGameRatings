			<description>For now the game is a prototype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Italika box contains:&lt;br/&gt;1 playing board representing Italy split  into   20 regions /&lt;br/&gt;8 political party kits consisting of - 1 party plate - 7 vote tokens - 15 party markers and 18 &amp;quot;media weapons&amp;quot; / 20 regional cards / 36 event cards / 1 printed pad for the electoral campaign&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Italika is based on the pure essence of politics.&lt;br/&gt;Dialogue, promises and concessions are necessary instruments of playing, compromises are the very heart of the game.&lt;br/&gt;Everything is allowed, only the electors's conviction is important. Actually the parties should garner as many votes as possible in each region.&lt;br/&gt;But will be the opponents to allow this? Indeed on each game turn all players have to vote for someone of their opponents.... now try to persuade them to vote for you!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
