			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An entry for Ludum Dare 32, The Reviewer puts you into the shoes of a student trying to get hired by a video game review website. You're playing games and, based on your own on-screen comments (and later, public opinion, or constraints from the publisher), must submit an appropriate review within the deadlines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Reviewer is intended as a parody, making fun of the pressures faced by professional game reviewers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
