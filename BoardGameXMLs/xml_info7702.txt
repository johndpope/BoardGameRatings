			<description>Race your cutout of Bill Clinton along the board, trying to keep ahead of Clinton's Past!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The storm cloud cutout figure for &amp;quot;The Past&amp;quot; starts on the board a few turns behind everyone else. Players can spend votes to keep ahead of The Past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to be the player with the most votes who reaches the end of the board's track. However, it is also possible that The Past will catch up to everyone. In this case, no one wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
