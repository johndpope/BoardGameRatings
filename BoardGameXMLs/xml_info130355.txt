							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Man of The Match</name>
									
			<description>Man of The Match is a soccer card game that can be played by 2-4 players. Each player becomes a coach, manages a soccer team and competes against the other coaches' teams in order to win the Championship and Cup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game and after each match, the coaches buy and sell soccer players in order to create a strong and competitive team. The coach that handles better his economics, will sign in the new soccer star!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the match the home team coach gets 6 Attack and 6 Defence cards and the away team coach gets 5 Attack and 5 Defence cards. The home team coach attacks first using one of his Attack cards and the away team coach tries to defend his team using one of his Defence cards. Then the away team coach makes his move using one of his Attack cards and the home team coach uses his Defence cards. Each Attack card describes an event, for example &amp;quot;Injury&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Goal&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Penalty&amp;quot; etc. and the Defence cards deactivate the Attack cards. When all attacks have ended, the coach who has scored more goals is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played for as many seasons as you like and never ends. Every match is different than the previous and this is what makes this game really exciting! One season lasts about 1 hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Man of The Match is a very entertaining, easy-to-play, fast and funny game which can be played by people of all ages. It is very addictive to those who love soccer, but people who don't even watch soccer show a lot of excitement playing it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
