							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strawberry Shortcake Labyrinth</name>
									
			<description>Explore the labyrinth and try to collect the greatest berry treasure of all. Spin the spinner and move to the next flower of that type on your path; if there is a berry token, you may pick it up. Beware of the berry thief, though! You can head for the finish line whenever you want to, but everyone's berry treasures stay hidden - you won't know how many berries your opponents have until it's time to reveal them at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The modular labyrinth consists of large puzzle pieces, so every game is different. The game is easy to learn and full of exciting twists and turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
