			<description>&amp;quot;Burnout Paradise is the seventh game in the Burnout racing video game series. It was developed by Criterion Games and published by Electronic Arts. It was released in January 2008 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and on February 5, 2009 for Microsoft Windows. It was also released on the PlayStation Store in September 2008 and via Xbox Live Marketplace's Games on Demand in August 2009. It was later added to the library of Greatest Hits titles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Burnout Paradise's gameplay is set in the fictional &amp;quot;Paradise City&amp;quot;, an open world in which players can compete in several types of races. Players can also compete online, which includes additional game modes, such as &amp;quot;Cops and Robbers&amp;quot;, in which players drive over gold bars and attempt to return them to the police station and hideout, respectively. Burnout Paradise features several free updates that introduce new features such as a time-of-day cycle, and motorcycles. It also features paid downloadable content in the form of new cars and the fictional &amp;quot;Big Surf Island&amp;quot;. The song &amp;quot;Paradise City&amp;quot; by Guns N' Roses is featured as the game's theme song.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Burnout_Paradise,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
