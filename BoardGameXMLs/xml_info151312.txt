			<description>Each player starts with four dice of each of six types (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20), and the first to lose all twenty-four dice loses the game.  Each battle is different according to the terrain dice thrown, which determine how many and which dice may battle, if any are modified/doubled, and how many actions each player may take per turn.  Each type of die has basic abilities (resurrection/banishment, mimicry, split attacks, join-forces, re-roll opponent die/dice, re-roll own die/dice), and all but the d4 have special abilities activated by rolling pairs (or more) of the same number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with initiative (usually lower total roll) takes one, two, or three actions (based on the throw of the terrain dice) before the opponent has a chance to respond. Actions include one die attacking another or activating abilities, or activating abilities and then attacking an opponent's die (most common).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a balance between thinking through the possibilities and over-thinking what your opponent may do, particularly in the selection of which dice to roll at the beginning of each battle.  Each battle will consist of different combinations of dice, resulting in different abilities interacting, keeping the game fresh and interesting throughout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
