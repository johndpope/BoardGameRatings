							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kingdom of Graves</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Kingdom of Graves, the second in our line of Mythic Menagerie monster books for use with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Each volume in this line presents a small set of monsters tied to a single theme, but spread over a range of CRs. For the Kingdom of Graves, that theme is undead with a place at court. Rather than a random collection of tomb-dusters, author Sam Hing has put together an awesome set of cold ones that tie into twisted versions of the common fantasy kingdom. We have lords, knights, maidens-in-waiting, couriers, and even siege engines, all from the black courts of the dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collection can be helpful to GMs in many different ways. Since the foes within range from CR 3 to CR 15, they can simply be used to augment the ranks of any undead encounter with something the players haven't seen before. However, they can also form the frame for a whole new threat should the GM decide to create a literal kingdom of graves. Whether it's a single castle that suffered some horrid deathless fate, a land that toils under undead horrors that openly rule mortal subjects, or a more subtle threat where a few undead lords have begun to infiltrate the lands of the living, the kingdom of graves can provide an ongoing problem for a group of PCs. Augmented with zombie soldiers, ghoul squires, and wight generals, the monsters provided here can form the backbone of an entire campaign arc, if a GM chooses to employ them in such a manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However you choose to terrorize your players, we're hopeful you'll find something useful in our second Mythic Menagerie. Now, ready yourself for the first course of the Feast of Flesh; the lich tyrant is calling for order, the dark messengers have brought news from abroad, and the bloodknights are looking for a fellow knight to challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
