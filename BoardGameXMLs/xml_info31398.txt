							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hungry Huey</name>
									
			<description>Hungry  Huey is a purple monster with an open mouth into which players reach to extract a particular set of &amp;quot;grubs.&amp;quot;  If the players disturb Huey while they are reaching into his mouth, Huey responds by vomiting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher: &amp;quot;Reach into Huey's 'real feel' gooey guts and risk vomtastic gastric action as you try and rescue your ghastly grubs from Huey's bloated tum.  You need to get the right four grubs to win, but watch out - if he vomits - you'll have to put one back!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
