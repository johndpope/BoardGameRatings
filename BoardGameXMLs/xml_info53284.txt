			<description>The players are small animals trying to steal seeds from an angry woodpecker by hiding under the eggs in its nest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play starts by releasing the woodpecker. As it slides down towards the nest, players take turn rolling a die. Using the symbol revealed the players move one egg around the nest. Just be sure to remember which egg your animal is hiding under.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the woodpecker reaches the nest, the player holding the die is caught and gets nothing that round. If the other players are alone in part of the nest, then they receive one seed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The woodpecker is released again and a new round begins. This repeats until all the seeds have been stolen. The player with the most wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
