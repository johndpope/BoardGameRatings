							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cabalist</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Both divine and arcane, the magic of a cabalist is bound into words and signs, crafted by the intricate weaving of rituals and ancient intonations. A cabalist can seek to explore the mysteries of the planes and beings of infinite power on his own or join with a circle of like-minded seekers to work even greater rites in the name of entities that were old when life first emerged from the seas and will exist long after the sun becomes a cinder in the lifeless heavens. Cabalists walk in the shadows of truly unimaginable beings, drawing upon the merest echoes of their attention and working grand magic with their stolen power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the eleventh book of the Power Classes series from Mongoose Publishing. Designed to be seamlessly slotted into any fantasy-based d20 system game, each of these mini-supplements introduces an entirely new core character class, adding a whole new dimension to campaigns. Players will find full details on how to use the new character class, greatly increasing the wealth of options they are presented with by the core rulebooks while Games Masters may revel in the wide variety of new classes they have at their disposal for non-player characters in their campaigns. Each Power Class booklet can provide hours of gaming enjoyment at an all-new low cost.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
