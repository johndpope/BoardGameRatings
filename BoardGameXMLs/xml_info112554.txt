							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Saint Seiya: Legacy of the Saints</name>
									
			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;[T]his [is] my tribute to what was the first anime I knew as such. Just don't scare becuase of what I said, Saint Seiya isn't really bad(not that bad at least!), and the concept is propituous to a really good RPG. The main reason I'm writing this is because during my first year in&lt;br/&gt;PnP RPGs saw a lot of tries of adapting SS characters with TSR rules, Palladium rules (Palladium rules aren't bad, specially with Ninjas&amp;amp;Superspies around) and so on...sadly, all that tries have been futile due to the lack of an RPG that captures the the true escence of anime and I have found Thrash just perfect for the job and here I am, presenting you this book (or what intends to be). This book was writen thinking on all that SS fans around, but principally to all of you who are not familiar with SS in order to introduce you into the SS universe. I could have just writen the new rules, maneuvers and so for playing SS characters on Thrash(after all, any SS fan already knows the story and stuff),but what of the people who just doesn't know SS? besides, what I'm trying to present here is a sourcebook in the most serious possible way, so I'm presenting in this book as much information on SS(and Greek mythology)as possible for me.Hope you all enjoy as much playing it as I(and every people that helped me) did writing it...enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
