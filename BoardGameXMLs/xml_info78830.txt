							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Batman: The Video Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Batman is a video game inspired by the eponymous 1989 film. It was released in 1989 for the Nintendo Entertainment System and developed by Sunsoft. The NES version of Batman is a platform action game that features locations from the 1989 movie. It contains five levels culminating in a showdown with the Joker in the bell tower of Gotham Cathedral. It was received well despite changes from the movie it's based upon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a feature that was unusual to side-scrolling platform games at the time, largely to the NES itself. Unlike the other Batman game that was released for the Mega Drive/Genesis, Batman has the ability to wall jump, which is reminiscent of Ryu Hayabusa's wall scaling in Ninja Gaiden. He is also able to use three projectile weapons: the batarang, batdisk, and bat speargun, which are powered by pellet cartridges.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Batman (Nintendo Entertainment System) , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
