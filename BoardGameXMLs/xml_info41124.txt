			<description>A pure memory game for kids: players have 45 seconds to memorize the pattern of symbols shown on a card, then to reconstruct it upon a 25 squares grid by arranging tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board consists of a wooden frame with five poles, each pole showing five wooden cubes (so a 5 x 5 grid is formed). Each of the four cube sides that can be on top (all except the two with the pole running through it) has a symbol (one of five).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cubes are randomly set up, then a player (or a team of players) has a minute to look at the pattern. The grid is then covered and the player(s) have to reproduce the pattern with wooden chips that have to be placed in the same order as seen. The player(s) with the best memory is/are the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
