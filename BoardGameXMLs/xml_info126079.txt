			<description>Maya is a Pachisi inspired racing game with a Mayan theme. Each player has four pieces of identical colors (red, green, blue, or yellow), each marked with a specific symbol (sun, moon, cloud, spears). The board consists of an outer square track and two additional paths, perpendicular to each others, connecting the center tiles of opposing sides of the outer track, thereby subdividing the board into four squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces start (sorted according to symbols) at four specific positions at the board. On turn, each player throw two standard D6 dies and accordingly move one or more pieces along the tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to get all four pieces (of same color) into the corresponding home (located at a specific corner of the board).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
