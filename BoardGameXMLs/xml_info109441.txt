			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Howl at the Moon, the seventh in our Mythic Menagerie line of monster books. Each volume in this line presents a small set of monsters tied to a single theme, but spread over a range of CRs. For Howl at the Moon that theme is weremonsters and shapechangers more exotic than the typical werewolf or wererat. In addition to playing with less common choices, we&amp;rsquo;ve made an effort to find iconic weremonsters for various environments. Within these pages you will find a wide assortment of creatures that fear silver, from the swamp&amp;rsquo;s CR 3 werefrog to the ocean&amp;rsquo;s CR 10 wereorca and finally the monstrous CR 19 therianthropic beast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because weremonsters are shapechangers, most of these entries include two stat blocks: one for the creature&amp;rsquo;s humanoid (or monstrous humanoid) form, and another for its hybrid form. A GM wishing to use these monsters will be well rewarded for taking the time to become familiar with the &amp;ldquo;Lycanthrope&amp;rdquo; entry in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary. This will also provide information on how to run these creatures in their animal form, which, as with the bestiary, is not provided within this product for reasons of space and clarity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re confident that you&amp;rsquo;ll find something useful in this, our seventh Mythic Menagerie. Now draw your silvered blade, and ready yourself for the onslaught! The wereowls are circling overhead, the werescorpions are skittering in from across the desert, and the weretyrannosaurus is in a rage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
