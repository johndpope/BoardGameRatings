			<description>Magical Powers and Technology Clash!&lt;br/&gt;Lead your Magibots to Victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the near future, humanity has discovered a new element in their search for renewable energy: Magicore. Using &amp;quot;cauldrons&amp;quot; to refine the element, humans successfully create magic, and mages are born.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All is not well, though. As magic becomes more widespread, new creatures dubbed 'spectres' begin to appear. In hopes of training mages to fight spectres and form an army of Holy Mages, TEOS, the ruling magic agency, hosts a high stakes tournament: The Magical Battle Festa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magical Battle Festa is an arena-based fighting game with support for up to 4 players. Use devastating combos, special moves and incredible super moves to pummel your foes into submission. Easy to learn but challenging to master, Magical Battle Festa relies on your ability to dodge enemy attacks and use your attacks at the right time without sapping all your mana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gain the edge in battle by using your magibots! These helpful robotic helpers follow you around the arena. Order them into formations to give you higher attack, higher defense, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mages from all walks of life have flocked to the Magical Battle Festa, from assassins to students and seasoned warriors. A dark plot is afoot, however. Who will discover the truth behind the tournament?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
