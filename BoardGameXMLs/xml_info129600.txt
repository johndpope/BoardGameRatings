			<description>The aim of the game is to remove the traffic sign cards from the game board. The player who has gathered most cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before starting to play, shuffle the 24 cards well and place them on the fields with the blue side upwards and with the poles of the sign posts pointing all in the same direction. No card should be placed on the field with the traffic lights. This field is used to place the pieces. Now agree on a player who starts, and then alternate clockwise. The player whose turn it is throws the dice and forwards his piece on the game board by the number of pips. After starting the game, the field with the traffic lights must not be entered again. You may move in all directions but not diagonally. During a move you may change the direction as often as you want. However, you have to keep two things in mind: you must not move on to a field twice during a move, and at the end of the move you must not arrive at the starting field. Bad luck, if you throw a six, because you will have to miss this turn. If a move ends on a field with a card, you have to guess which of the two signs shown on the blue side is displayed on the yellow side of the card. Subsequently look whether the traffic sign you think is shown on the yellow side. If the guess was correct, the player may take the card. The player places this card with the blue side upwards in front of himself. If the guess was wrong, the player has to return the card to the same place on the game board. If one card only is left on the game board, the player whose turn it is may throw the dice twice and move. If this card has been removed as well, every player counts his cards. The winner is who has most cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
