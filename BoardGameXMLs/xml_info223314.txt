			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is just a game, so there is no need to be afraid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or maybe you should be&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you remember the time when any shadow could turn into a monster? Do you remember the strange noises against your window on windy nights? What about when you closed your eyes and hid underneath the bed covers so you couldn&amp;rsquo;t see what was poking through the slightly-ajar closet door? Would you like to go back? Would you dare?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are waiting for you&amp;hellip; and they are hungry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innocents is a role playing game about imagination and fear; about monsters under your bed, abandoned houses plagued with ghosts, and shadows forming odd shapes in the darkness. Innocents is a game starring children, but it is not a child&amp;rsquo;s game: it is a roleplaying game for adults willing to let their imagination fly back to their childhood, to experience horror as only children can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innocents is, above all, a roleplaying game and follows most of the usual conventions; but it is not a game for newcomers, so the book doesn't explain RPGs and how they are played. Instead, it tries to show you how to play differently; far from epic action, it leans towards the darkest corners of the most primal fears, emotions, and psychodrama. Despite this, Innocents is played as any other roleplaying game: a group of players playing their characters, a Gamemaster acting as the rest of the world, and a story they all develop together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
