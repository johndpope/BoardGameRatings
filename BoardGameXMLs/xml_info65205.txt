							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Skool Rools</name>
									
			<description>From The Introducshun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This game is inspired, firstly by the magnificent &amp;quot;Molesworth&amp;quot; books of Geoffrey Willans and Ronald Searle, and almost as much by Shy and Searle's &amp;quot;St Trinian's&amp;quot; creation, the TV &amp;quot;Ripping Yarns&amp;quot; episode Tomkinson's Schooldays, and various other fond memories. However, it is respectfully dedicated to Matthew Arnold (of Rugby) and all his successors, imitators and devotees, without whom the British Empire would certainly not be where it is today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting for this game is somewhere in the British Public School system, some time in the twentieth century, when bold noble and fearless BOYS (cheers cheers cheers) are confronted by horrors fit to chill the blood of H.P.Lovecraft - to wit, countless masters, swots, creeps, toadies, bullies, parents, lessons and SKOOL DINNERS.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
