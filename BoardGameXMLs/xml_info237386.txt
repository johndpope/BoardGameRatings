			<description>Umbra is a tabletop rogue-like set in a dungeon. Players choose between 4 classes or playing the monsters. The classes include the wizard,, who moves like a knight from chess and can pass over other pieces or walls; the warrior, who moves parallel with the edges and can move two spaces; the rogue, who moves diagonally and may leave or re-enter the game; and the princess who may choose how she moves.&lt;br/&gt;The monsters are kobolds and goblins. Kobolds move parallel to the edges of the board. Goblins move diagonally. The monster player gets a piece for each player, and may move each piece 1 time per turn. Monsters controlled by another player can hunt players for points. Each player is worth 5 points to the monster player.&lt;br/&gt;Players control peices that navigate an 8&amp;quot;x8&amp;quot; board using dice to determine if a space is a trap, a wall, or a hall. Sometimes player obtain treasure or gold. Gold is used to determine points at the end of the game. Treasure is represented by cards drawn from the treasure deck. Players determine the effect a treasure has when it is used. This causes the treasures to change each game. The game concludes after all players have exited or have been captured. The surviving player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
