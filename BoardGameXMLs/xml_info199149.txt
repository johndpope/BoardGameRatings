			<description>This is a deck of 50 cards that uses the Versatiletters system. Each card displays a letter, which becomes a different letter with a different point value when the card is rotated 180 degrees. The instructions include rules for:&lt;br/&gt;i) The Final Word, in which two players take turns forming words from a selection of 12 cards. The player who forms the final word keeps the cards that were used to form it. Twelve more cards are drawn; the process is repeated; and the player with more cards after four rounds wins;&lt;br/&gt;ii) Finders Stealers, in which 3 to 6 players each play two cards simultaneously face up onto the table. The player who is able to form the longest word within 30 seconds keeps the cards used to form that word, and the player with the most cards after three rounds wins;&lt;br/&gt;iii) Word Wars I.II.III, which has its own BGG entry; and&lt;br/&gt;iv) Solitaire Dare, in which each of five columns contains ten overlapping cards, with only the bottom card in each column face up. Make a word with the letters on the face-up cards, set aside the used letters, flip the uncovered cards, and repeat. Win if no unused cards remain at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
