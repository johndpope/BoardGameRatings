			<description>A Competitive Card Game to Slayer Monsters and Mess with Other Players! In Cute Pixel Art!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Super Mini Adventure, players lead parties of powerful heroes and delve deep into the dungeons to slay foul monsters, all in the name of honor, glory, and shinning loot! But wait! For the biggest danger comes not from the monsters, but your fellow adventures! Watch out for their back-stabs and sabotages, as everyone frantically competes to slay the monsters and claim the prizes. Let the slaying begin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to earn Coins by defeating Monsters. Players do this by forming up to two adventuring parties of Heroes, assigning 1 Champion and 1 Companion role to each. Players then attempt to defeat the monsters by matching up to their stats (STR, MAG, and DEX), all the while playing different Hero cards and utilizing abilities to block other players from making the kill. At the end, when all the Monsters are defeated, the most courageous (and cunning) player with the most Coins wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Mini Adventure is a Take That! style card game. Players play out combinations of different Hero cards to defeat monsters, while utilizing the different abilities on those cards to gain the upper hand. Construct combos and chain abilities, to set yourself up not only for the kill, but also to block and prevent your opponent from doing the same. Simple to learn, but with deep layers of strategies that will have you coming back for more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
