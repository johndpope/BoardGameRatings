			<description>You're controlling the railroad today! Build tracks and guide trains to their stations, keep the rail yard collision-free. Control the railroad switches and signals to lead trains from Point A to Point B to rake in money and earn achievements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build tracks between stations and optimize the routes to get the trains to their stations on time.  Manage the railroad switches and control the railway signals to keep trains on course and crash-free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;12 different trains keep you on your toes as you progress through the game. Trains with a long line of cargo, those with time bombs, vigilante trains that won't stop, and many others!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
