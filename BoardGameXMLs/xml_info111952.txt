			<description>The Raposa village has been in peace for a long time until items from the city start disappearing. Mari (now the mayor) asks the Creator to draw a new hero for help. Jowee (Mari's close friend) believes that Zsasha (a well known thief) has stolen the items and gone off to Jangala. The hero and Jowee (who loves adventure) go off to Jangala to find Zsasha, who has been held captive for days by the monkey king. Shadow walkers appear; invading Jangala. After the hero defeats them and saves Zsasha, the monkey king gives them a strage mask (which will later be important to the story). Mari realizes Zsasha did not steal the items. Mari and her assistant Circi wonder who the thief is. Mari believes Wilfre might be the thief. To make sure if Wilfre is alive Mari sends the hero (and Jowee) to Shadow City. Soon the hero finds the ink factory working again creating shadows. The hero then finds Wilfre's journal which holds a plot to destroy the Creator. They must get; branches from the tree of ages, the eternal furnace, a pen and pencil, (which they already have) and a magic mask (which they also have, given to them by the monkey king). Mari sends the hero to Icy Wastes to find the eternal furnace. While there, a strange shadow creature appears stealing it. The shadow creature is unknown but resembles a Raposa girl. Soon in the Eastern Winds the tree of ages is in danger. After fighting off the shadow creatures the hero saves the tree. Mari is happy Wilfre's plan has failed till Circi reveals she's Wilfre's wife. She uses the items that the hero had found to make creation ink and recreate Wilfre, but she can't remember what he looks like. She keeps on drawing pictures of him but they don't resemble Wilfre. After throwing away the pictures they begin to combine together creating a monster. The items used for creating the monster combine into it too. The village is flooded with ink and the monster. The hero fights the dark monster in a final showdown defeating it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Drawn to Life: The Next Chapter&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
