							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Pyromancer (Revised)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pyromancer: The discovery of fire is hailed by many as one of the most important discoveries in all the worlds. Those arcane practitioners who &amp;ldquo;find the fire within&amp;rdquo; are known as pyromancers. The burning desire to delve further into the pyromantic arts consumes many; stories tell of wild, undisciplined practitioners whose star burned bright and short, quite literally. Yet others channel the burning inferno of magical potential into a focus rivaled by few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether through study or self-discovery, a pyromancer&amp;rsquo;s power grows with time. Like a natural fire, that power goes through bright spots of discovery followed by a tamer period of refinement. Eventually, a pyromancer becomes deceptively deadly, like embers amongst the ashes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role: A pyromancer is a gifted spellcaster of firebased magic. Eventually, a pyromancer becomes so exceptional at casting fire based magic that they become a destructive, yet necessary force, unto themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
