							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spook House / Toxic Dumpsite Double Feature</name>
									
			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is it -- the blockbusting debut of the long-awaited Graphic Adventures! Now, your TRS-80 can hobnob with the best of 'em. Over 50 full screens of sharp, quality graphics breathe a realism and vitality into Adventuring, the likes of which you've yet to see on the TRS-80. Both Graphic Adventures feature game save, extensive vocabulary, real-time action (yes -- we said real-time!) and accept FULL sentences! Exclusive play area showings brought to you by Adventure International. Now playing at a TRS-80 near you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spook House&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horrors! A deranged madman has locked your unconscious form inside of a deserted creep house at a crazy carnival. You awake to some sobering facts: a bomb is set to explode, and only 30 real-time minutes stand between you and eternity. Somewhere, somehow you must locate and defuse the explosive -- but we'd be less than honest if we thought you had more than a ghost of a chance! Brrrr -- a real cliffhanger!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toxic Dumpsite&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something's gone very, very wrong at the Toxic Dumpsite where the treatment and burial of deadly contaminants take place. The entire plant will explode like the Fourth of July in less than 30 minutes -- unless you can avoid the many traps and protection systems and shut the plant down in time. Of course, time is the one luxury you haven't got...!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
