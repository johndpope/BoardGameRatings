			<description>In That's How We Do It! players will do some ridiculous things while laughing uncontrollably! If you draw an Always card you will do the wacky thing on your card every time it's your turn. A Whenever card directs you to do what the card says whenever another player does something specific. One wacky thing definitely leads to another in this zany game of craziness!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SET UP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     3 players randomly choose a prop card&lt;br/&gt;     Shuffle the action cards and put them facedown in a pile within reach of all players&lt;br/&gt;     Decide how many rounds to play. With 4-5 players, 8 rounds are recommended. With more players, less rounds. With less players, more rounds. When every player has picked an action card that is one round. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     On your turn, draw an action card from the top of the deck and place it face up in front of you. Each time you draw an action card, add it to the row of action cards in front of you.&lt;br/&gt;     Read the action card aloud to all the players very carefully. Each card has a point value 1-12 based on the zaniness of the action.  &lt;br/&gt;     There are two types of action cards:&lt;br/&gt;         Always-if you draw an always card, do the zany thing immediately. Then repeat that zany thing every time it's your turn. &lt;br/&gt;         Whenever-if you draw a whenever card, do nothing right now. However read the card carefully because you will need to do whatever zany thing is on the card whenever another player does a specific zany thing.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Don't forget to read the Prop Cards and pass them around throughout the game. There are 3 different prop cards:&lt;br/&gt;         Funny Glasses-when you have this card, wear the glasses until someone stands for any reason. Then pretend you're a teacher and say something really smart. Then pass the glasses and card to the player on your left. &lt;br/&gt;         Microphone-when you have this card, hold the microphone until someone sings. Then sing into the microphone along with them. When you're done singing, pass the Microphone and Card to the person on your left. &lt;br/&gt;         Engagement Ring-when you have this card, wear the ring until someone kisses anything. Then run over, get down on one knee, and give the kisser the ring.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Once during the game, each player can pick one of his or her action cards and give to another player. But remember that in addition to giving that player something really zany to do, you are also givin g him or her points. And that might cause you to lose the game. &lt;br/&gt;     It's ok to remind players if they forget to do one of the things on the action cards in front of them. After all, the whole point of the game is to see everyone act really silly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WINNING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     After the agreed upon number of rounds, players add up the points on the action cards. The player with the highest score wins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
