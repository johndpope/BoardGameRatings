			<description>Starting at home, following the happy highway, the goal is to be the first to reach the Last Resort at the shore of Lucky Lake. On the way you pass falling rocks, short cuts, Funny Forest, Dusty Town, Camp Gitchigouch, Moon Mountain, and of course Stuckey's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is done by a die, but impacted by cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was sold by the Stuckey's Convenience Markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
