							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bearly There</name>
									
			<description>A set of five six-sided dice in a tube with a leaflet containing rules for Bearly There and two other games (Accumulation and Horse)&lt;br/&gt;The dice are identical, each having have a bear and the  numbers from two to six.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Bearly There is to roll the dice, totaling the numbers and pushing your luck to reach a specific total.&lt;br/&gt;Although it looks like a cuddly teddy, the bear is, in fact, wild. The twist is that you have the option to either add or subtract the wild values from your accumulated total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other two games are equally simple, if not more so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
