			<description>Midway Arcade Treasures 3 is a compilation of arcade and racing games for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube. It is the third and final installment following Midway Arcade Treasures and Midway Arcade Treasures 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike in previous installments, Midway Arcade Treasures 3 only features arcade racing games unless stated otherwise. They include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Badlands&lt;br/&gt;Off Road Thunder&lt;br/&gt;Race Drivin'&lt;br/&gt;San Francisco Rush The Rock: Alcatraz Edition&lt;br/&gt;S.T.U.N. Runner&lt;br/&gt;Super Off Road (including its upgrade/add-on pack, Super Off Road Track Pack)&lt;br/&gt;Hydro Thunder (console version)&lt;br/&gt;San Francisco Rush 2049 (console version)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, while most of the games in this collection are emulations or recreations of the arcade versions, Hydro Thunder and Rush 2049 are based on the console versions, specifically ports of the Sega Dreamcast releases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Off Road/Track Pack is the only game on this collection, and in the entire trilogy, that was not developed by Williams, Midway, or Atari Games. It was developed and published by The Leland Corporation. For legal reasons, the image of &amp;quot;Ironman&amp;quot; Ivan Stewart has been altered in the two Super Off Road games; he now has sunglasses and a moustache and both games are now known as simply &amp;quot;Super Off Road&amp;quot; (the original arcade versions were known fully as &amp;quot;Ironman Ivan Stewart's Super Off Road&amp;quot;). &amp;quot;Ironman's&amp;quot; Speed Shop was re-named Off-Road Speed Shop, and Ivan himself (the gray, AI-controlled racer) was renamed &amp;quot;Lightning&amp;quot; Kevin Lydy. Ivan's name does, however, remain intact on the high score list (&amp;quot;IVN&amp;quot;) and game credits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Midway Arcade Treasures 3&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
