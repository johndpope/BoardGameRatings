			<description>Want to challenge yourself with an original and mind-bending puzzle game for your iPhone/iPod Touch, which you can play at your own pace? Then Litho is for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective in this game is to take each piece available from the right side of the screen and place it on the board, dragging and rotating the piece with your fingers as necessary. If the piece fits, it will snap into place when you lift your finger and the symbols will light up. To detach a piece from the board, double-tap it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all pieces are placed correctly, the game is won. There is no time limit, but your first and best times will be recorded for bragging rights, as well as the number of pieces you placed correctly on the first try.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think you are up to the challenge? Then step up, and give your best shot at solving all the puzzles in Litho! There are 50 of them, each with a different set of pieces, which should keep you occupied for quite some time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;50 different puzzles for your amusement. &lt;br/&gt;Clean, fluid and stylish graphics. &lt;br/&gt;Original soundtrack &lt;br/&gt;Resume from where you left off after quitting the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
