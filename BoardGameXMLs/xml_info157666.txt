							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1862: Retreat to Harrison&#039;s Landing</name>
									
			<description>The eighteenth battle in the American Civil Wargames in 3D series. The Confederate Army is continuing its attack on the Union army, who are retreating towards the safety of Harrisons Landing. This is the largest set battle to date comprising of three battlefields, White Oak Swamp, Glendale and Malvern Hill. The battle is fought over two consecutive days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historically it was the best chance that General Robert E Lee would have to break the Union army. The forces are evenly balanced but the Confederates are facing the largest concentration of artillery that the Civil War would see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Retreat to Harrisons Landing initially has a time limit of 36 bounds in which the Confederates must attack and gain objective ground, the game also comes with additional play options. The games design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game within a 6-8 hour period of continuous play. The game gives a flavour of the American Civil War period and a simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit. You don&amp;rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&amp;rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally. The 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- information from Wargame Shop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
