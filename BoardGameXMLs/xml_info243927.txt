			<description>The rules are simple: each player has four towers, three pieces high, that can &amp;quot;boom&amp;quot; (fire) or &amp;quot;zoom&amp;quot; (move) a number of spaces equal to the tower's height. But with those deceptively simple ingredients, veteran designer Ty Bomba has created his masterpiece, the game that he himself acknowledges as his own best design. The trick is that the game ends when only one player's pieces remain on the board, and the player who managed to exit the most pieces off of the opponent's side of the map wins. Because of this, players can't concentrate on just blocking/attacking or just advancing, but must strike a difficult and subtle balance between the two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first edition of Mr. Bomba's game was significantly altered by its publisher. Here, all unnecessary ornamentation has been stripped away, presenting the designer's original vision as he had always intended, in a handsome format utilizing chunky 40mm x 40mm x 16mm wooden blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
