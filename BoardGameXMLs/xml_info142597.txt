							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shahida</name>
									
			<description>From the first chapter of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shahida (Arabic, شهد, دلى بشهادته) means to bear witness or as a noun (شاهد, شهادة, الشاهد) a female witness. It is also the root for two more words: Sha:hid, meaning gravestone, epitaph; and Shahi:d, meaning martyr.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But who is the witness? The ordinary citizen caught in the war zone, the ordinary soldier wondering why he&amp;rsquo;s fighting or even where he is, the guerrilla or militia fighter wondering the same thing, the prisoner who smuggles out a manuscript, the novelist fearing both the invading army and his or her own government, the journalist defying editorial policy, the veteran turned resister, the aid worker whose days are filled with gunfire and espionage, the young person keeping a diary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher website&lt;br/&gt;Shahida is both a historical-political essay that will make you  reconsider your knowledge about one of the longest and cruelest war of the 20th century, and at the same time a game that will place you in the middle of that war, struggling to have a &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; life, and being dragged into awful acts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last game by Ron Edwards, author of Sorcerer, Trollbabe, S/Lay w/Me. Shahida is the second game of the &amp;quot;Story Now&amp;quot; series, along with Spione: Story Now in Cold War Berlin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
