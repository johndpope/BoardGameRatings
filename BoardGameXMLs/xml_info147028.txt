			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steamroller was a game for ColecoVision by David Rolfe. It was ment to be released by Activion in 1984, but because of the videogame crash it wasn't released until 2000 by Retrotopia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to clean streets from bouncing heads with your Steamroller. When all the streets are clean, you go on to the next level. The levels are seen from above. There is also another steamroller in the game. If you crash with the other steamroller, or drive into a bomb, you lose a life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
