			<description>Subtitled in the rules as &amp;quot;A Game of Family Supplies&amp;quot;, this 1889 card game is based on the familiar mechanics of Happy Families, where players try to assemble sets of cards by asking each other for cards related to ones they already hold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this case, the 40-card deck is divided into 10 sets (called orders) comprised of a variety of household ingredients. Order 8, for instance, includes Prunes, Oatmeal, Cloves, Chicago Yeast Powder and Mustard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has two distinct features. First, the order sets vary both in size and point value. The ten orders include four of 3 cards worth 5 points if completed, three of 4 cards worth 10 points, two of 5 cards worth 15 points, and one of 6 cards worth 20 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More importantly, the game has an educational focus. Each card lists three facts about the title ingredient, and three key words related to the facts on each other ingredient card in the order. If player A asks player B for the card &amp;quot;Citron&amp;quot; and B holds it, B says &amp;quot;What of It?&amp;quot; and A must then provide one of the three facts about Citron before taking the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
