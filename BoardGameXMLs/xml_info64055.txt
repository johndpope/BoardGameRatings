							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doctor Who: Adventures in Time and Space â€“ Player&#039;s Guide</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine you could go anywhere. This world or countless others, encountering strange alien races, new cultures or hostile environments. Now imagine you could travel to any time. See the pyramids and the Sphinx (back when she had a nose!), discover who (or what) really built Stonehenge, meet the first Emperor of Japan, or travel into the far future as humanity spreads to the stars. Where would you go?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Doctor Who: Adventures in Time and Space, the power is in your hands! You can go anywhere or anywhen in the universe. It's not going to be easy. It'll probably be dangerous. The universe is a hostile place, full of Daleks, Slitheen, Krillitane, Sontarans, Plasmavores, Cybermen, Sycorax, Judoon and worse. There will be fear, heartbreak and excitement, but above all, it'll be the trip of a lifetime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctor Who: Adventures in Time and Space is a roleplaying game set in the universe of the world's longest running science fiction show on TV - the BBC's Doctor Who.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player's Guide tells you eveything you need to know to play the game, and is taken from the Doctor Who: Adventures in Time and Space core rules set (sold seperately). This product is just the Player's Guide - the full core rules set (which includes the Player's Guide) is sold separately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
