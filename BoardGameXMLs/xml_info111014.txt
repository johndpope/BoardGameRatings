			<description>The year is 2164. Mankind has self-actualized enough to realize that we are creatures of violence. Centuries of denying one of our base instincts has not led to a more civilized society. Technological advances have given unprecedented scales of damage potential to our conflicts. In 2153, the Council of Restraint was formed in response to the particularly devastating aftermath of a conflict between the United African Republic and Pacific Rim Conglomerate. Three years later the Conflict Resolution Accords were ratified. Now when conflicts arise, the involved states or ideological groups can settle the dispute in a manner that mitigates widespread destruction. Large, mechanized military machines meet to do battle of epic proportion. These battles are waged in controlled arenas to contain the violence and damage. Armored Terran Systems Corporation manufactures base machines called Mechs and combatants configure their Mech with armaments and options in preparation for combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Earth Shook is a game where each player assumes the role of a large mechanized military class robot. Where man once waged war across the globe on epic proportions, machines now resolve the conflict in controlled arenas. Build your machine, defend your ideology, and destroy the others. Be the last machine standing on the field of battle; to the victor go the spoils of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players each receive a basic identical Mech from the factory. They have a set amount of points that they can use to buy modules for the Mech. These modules adjust the ratings for Evasion, Shields, Armor, Speed, Maneuverability, Weapon Damage, Rate of Fire, and more. Once the modules have been purchased, the Mech stats are adjusted to reflect the module choices and teh game can commence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is similar to RoboRally or Wings of War in that each player will select 6 Move/Maneuver actions for their Mech each turn. In this manner, a turn is played out in six rounds as the Mechs execute their programmed moves. Can you out-maneuver your opponent? Do you risk an all out frontal attack. Each player will approach the battle differently, hoping to draw upon the strengths of their configured Mech.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build &amp;amp; Battle. The game is on...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
