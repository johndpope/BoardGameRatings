			<description>SCRAM!'' is an exciting strategy game for the entire family! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In SCRAM! up to 4 players are represented by a color on the game board. Players share from a common pool of tokens - each with their own special ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns placing tokens to create chain-reactions that move their tokens into scoring position and send opponent's tokens scrambling away... or make their token SCRAM! by driving it off the game board!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest value tokens on their own color at the end of the game wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
