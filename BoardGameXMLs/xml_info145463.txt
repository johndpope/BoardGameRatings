			<description> User Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start with meager resources and a dilapidated, small store in a creepy neighborhood. You must feel your customers' needs and provide them with the type of music they want to listen to. Advertise, so you'll become better known, participate in various events in town and keep your customers happy by providing them the best service possible and shorter waiting queues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With proper handling and management you will have enough money to move to a larger store. Ultimately, you will move to the largest store in the shiniest part of town, which you must outfit with new objects to attract more and richer customers, thus selling hundreds of items daily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
