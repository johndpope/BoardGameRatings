							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monopoly Junior: Planes</name>
									
			<description>A version of Monopoly Junior based on the Disney movie Planes. Collect the most and best characters (properties), and earn the most fuel (money) to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is 7 x 7, with 4 characters (properties) per side, two per color, plus the standard Go, Free Parking, Go to Jail and Jail corners, and finally 2 &amp;quot;Race Challenges&amp;quot; and 2 &amp;quot;Prize Fund&amp;quot; locations (where the railroads would be, but correspond to the Community Chest or Chance cards in the original game). Race Challenges will often have you contribute money to the Prize Fund, which then goes to the next person who lands on those locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the game begins, each location has a corresponding card placed on it. As each player lands on those locations and &amp;quot;buys&amp;quot; them, they take the card and mark the location on the board with one of their 10 hangars (houses/hotels, sort of, but that simply mark ownership of locations on the board). Then like in classic Monopoly, other players must pay the fuel cost for that location if they land there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variants on the basic game allow for monopoly pricing, scoring per the fuel cost on each card (property) instead of simply 1 point per card, and card (property) swaps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
