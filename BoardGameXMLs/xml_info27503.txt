			<description>Vilajet is a Hungarian game about the Turkish-Hungarian Wars set in the medieval times. Unfortunately it is only Hungarian language, but easily translated into English.&lt;br/&gt; The game map represents about 100x100 km territory near Lake Balaton, and shows little villages, towns and cities. In those times between these two countries there at peace, but there were a lot of border disputes which eventually caused a battle to be fought. Those are simulated in this game.&lt;br/&gt; The players should build armies in their castles, improve their current defenses and collect taxes from villages, while trying to work against the enemy opponent.&lt;br/&gt; Battles are one of the unique features that this game has. When you have a battle you take the &amp;quot;battle&amp;quot; map, and place your army there. On the strategic map you only have one counter, which shows only the name of the army, but you have to administrate, what kind of troops that army consists of (250 Hussars, 85 Infantry...etc). On the battle map you take the corresponding counters, and play battles with them, writing down casualties. Every unit has different fighting/moving values. The sieges are also great! Another map is used (there are about 6 different castles), and modified by the defenses you have built since the start of the game. It also has some extra rules, which make sieges fun. (for example when you go for a siege, you have to decide how much grain you will bring with you)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The good side of the game is that the Hungarian and the Turkish sides really differ from each other, and need completely different playing styles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, the game has a downside. The amount of administration needed to play might cause the casual player to never sit down and play a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is great in Hungarian history, and shows those times, which were so full with death, battles and instability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
