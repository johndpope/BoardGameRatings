			<description>This started as a reworking of the Meka Tac - Giant Stompy Robots Edition rules into a starship combat game, along with the grafting of elements from a lifetime of pushing miniatures around a table while rolling dice.&lt;br/&gt;That didn&amp;rsquo;t work as planned; the rules did the job, but not well enough to command anything more than a task force of a half-dozen ships per player. The ultimate goal was to handle the battle of fleets but still make the individual ship and how it was maneuvered matter. Some compromises were made, other things were simplified, and few items simply tossed out. The desire was to have a game that would entice new players to starship combat gaming and give an option for battles with larger numbers of ships to those who have fleets at the ready.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
