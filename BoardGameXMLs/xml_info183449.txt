			<description>Duel List is a competitive knowledge listing game in which players simultaneously list as many items in a topic as they can in 60 seconds on a piece of paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: On a turn, the active player picks one of the 9 knowledge decks and rolls 2 dice.  1st die chooses category, 2nd die chooses specific topic.  Players have 60 seconds to list as many items as they can in that topic on a piece of paper.  Once the time is up, the active player starts to list out the items they wrote. Players list out their answers in clockwise order, scoring as needed. If any other player shared an answer, every player score 1 point for that answer.  Otherwise, the player receives 2 points for every valid, unique answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End of game: Once every player has had the chance to be the active player and choose a knowledge deck, then the game is over. Count up points, whoever has the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
