			<description>Two players start at opposing ends of the game board, which is made from wood and depicts an asparagus field which contains little wooden asparagus. The players now roll dice and move along certain tracks, in opposing directions (without getting into each others way), following instructions on certain fields or just harvesting the asparagus. When one player reaches his or her destination, the player with most asparagus wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
