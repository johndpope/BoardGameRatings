							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Perilous Journeys: Skill Based Fantasy Role Playing</name>
									
			<description>introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Perilous Journeys is a skill based role-playing game that attempts to mimic the feel, but not the mechanics, of OD&amp;amp;D.  Over the  30+ years of gaming, rules have become complicated, partly out of necessity, to address many issues that have come out during that time.   Perilous Journeys hopes to be a game that is simple like OD&amp;amp;D, but at the same time, offers players more options than what they have in  their current favorite game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perilous Journeys' goal is to have a simple and easy skill-based game that will appeal to those who are a fan of skill-based games,  as well to those who are not.  This game has streamlined and flexible mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;Perilous Journeys provides a list of skills that are used to build characters.  The skills are broad in nature as well as methods to  limit the breadth of skills if the GM desires.  The game provides archetypal types of characters as templates.  These archetypes closely  match the abilities of classes that are found in class-based games.  At the same time, players can choose any set of abilities they want to  build unique characters if they so choose.  Like other skill-based games, character creation is done with points, although there is a random  die option.  There is an &amp;quot;edges and flaws system.&amp;quot;  There are rules for creating contacts.  Perilous Journeys uses standard rpg terminology  whenever possible to make playing the game a smooth transition instead of a game that is lost in translation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
