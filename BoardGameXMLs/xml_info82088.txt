			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The worldwide popularity of tennis has been boosted in recent years by the emergence of true super-stars earning fabulous dums [sic] in the form of prize money.  As a board game for the entire family &amp;quot;TENNIS&amp;quot; brings all of the excitement of a hectic international tennis season to your living room table.  You are the &amp;quot;pro&amp;quot; who has his ups and downs as one tournament succeeds another across the globe.  Like the tennis stars themselves, you'll need both luck and skill in order to end up a big winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will try to qualify for as many Tournaments as he can, win as many Exhibition Matches as possible, rise to the big-money hights [sic] of the World Rankings and make it to the finals of the Davis Cup.  Above all each will try to accumulate the maximum prize money.  The player who has earned the most at the end of the game is the season's winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
