			<description>Subtitled &amp;quot;Wargame Rules for London Firefighting 1940 - 41&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rulebook introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is a low level operational game about firefighting during the London Blitz in 1940/41. The basic premise is that the player(s) represent fire officers trying to combat fires and deal with emergencies in the critical period of the first London Blitz of September 1940 to May 1941. It is a &amp;lsquo;tactical skirmish&amp;rsquo; game - with individual models representing individual vehicles, and stands of figures representing small groups of fire-fighters and emergency workers.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It also requires a model (or at least a detailed ground plan) of the appropriate scale or the buildings involved. To keep the game manageable I have defined buildings as covering a number of &amp;lsquo;zones&amp;rsquo; - both vertically and in area - and these might cover more than one floor of a building, and ignore much the detail of the internal layout. I have done this to make the game reasonably fast-moving and to keep it simple - there is a wealth of detail; that could be represented, but in my view this would slow the game down considerably.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This game is unusual in that there is no &amp;lsquo;enemy&amp;rsquo; played as such. Player cooperate to solve a difficult (or even insoluble) problem with limited resources - I guess this could be called a &amp;lsquo;multi-player solo game&amp;rsquo;. The opposition comes in the form of randomly generated bombs and fires and damage that occur according to the games&amp;rsquo; simple fire propagation model.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
