							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grave Robber</name>
									
			<description>In the 19th Century, Medical Schools needed Cadavers to further their knowledge but there weren&amp;rsquo;t that many available. This is where you come in. Your job is to dig up graves to provide the Medical schools with enough body parts so they can continue their research. But it isn&amp;rsquo;t that easy, the police are trying to stop you and of course you have to be careful because there are more than just dead bodies in the graveyard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grave Robber is a fun family game for 2 - 4 players where players try and dig up and sell body parts with the aim of making the most money. Each player takes the role of a grave robber (body snatcher) and on their turn they roll two dice and move both their piece to try to dig up/sell body parts and a Police figure to try and hinder/arrest other players.  You can visit the Tavern to get help in the form of Tavern Cards and there's a choice of two medical schools - one pays a little more if you're lucky. The church is their in case of trouble with the monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
