							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quidnam</name>
									
			<description>Find answers to eternal questions or get insight into burning issues such as life, the universe and everything, whether the earth will exist in 2013, or what really happened to Atlantis.  Quidnam is not just a game; it&amp;rsquo;s a mirror on life and the totality of human existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quidnam is a unique card deck that can be used for contemplation and illuminating solitaire meditation or in a groupthink party game.  The heart of Quidnam is the deck of 64 insightful cards developed from fundamental principles of human existence using Set Theory.  Each card has lore and art to provide verbal and visual suggestions as to their meaning.  There are 4 suits of 16 cards.  These suits represent the 4 planes of existence - physical,  biological, cognitive, and social.  Each plane (suit) has 4 unique elements and a color; each card in the suit is composed of a combination of those four elements from zero to four.   The mix of elements is shown on each card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meditation.  To meditate, simply decide on a topic, shuffle the deck, deal some cards using a pattern or method to your liking, and study the result.  You can do this alone or with family and friends.  Some patterns for reading are shown in the action shots.  You can create your own patterns and methods.  The topic is up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Quidnam deck can be used to play the Groupthink game.  This party game is best played with at least 4 players; the more the better.  A question or issue is chosen at the beginning of play.  Play consists of one or more rounds.  For each round, one player serves as a judge.  The role of judge rotates from round to round.  Shuffle the deck and deal some cards using a pattern or method that the group likes.  All players look at these cards and develop a secret reading which they write down and give to the judge.  The judge picks the best reading and the winner gets a point.  Several rounds should be played.  The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Important note.  Quidnam forms the foundation for the exciting game of Totality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Totality also shows how the set theoretical design maps the cards to the I Ching and Zodiac.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
