			<description>I See What You Did There is a game about convincing your friends that you're clever. Convince them by relating the cards using any means of interpretation necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every card has a word on the top half and a game instruction on the bottom half.  Players either use the abilities detailed on the bottom half card (ex: While this card is in play, players must repeat the last word of their sentence sentence) or try to connect 3 of their cards together (ex: Penis, Kindness, STD).   Successfully convincing your fellow players that 3 of your cards are connected earns you a stack; first player to 3 stacks wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I See What You Did There is NOT responsible for any shenanigans you and your friends get into. (Including prank calls or murder)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
