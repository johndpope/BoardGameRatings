			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Candle works evenings, carrying a torch to light the way for local London pedestrians (a role historically known as a &amp;ldquo;link-boy&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Glym Jack&amp;rdquo;). Candle currently works the area between the East India Docks on the River Thames, and the East India House. Despite earning a meager subsistence, Candle feels great empathy for others, and often keeps tabs on familiar clients in case they need a hand. Edony, an older sibling who was more like a parent, died shielding Candle with their body when their ramshackle slum collapsed, and Candle has always sought to earn that sacrifice. The beatific smile on Edony&amp;rsquo;s pale and bleeding lips has served Candle like a warm beacon through dark nights, tough times, and temptation, encouraging Candle to do the right thing in Edony&amp;rsquo;s memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
