							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Four Wizards</name>
									
			<description>Four Wizards is a new version of a classic card-shedding game. Players draw and discard their way to an empty hand, laying down a variety of cards designed around a medieval theme. Each deck comes with 72 cards and supports a game of 2-4 players. Included are 48 Medieval Unit Cards (4 Colored Factions: Blue Cross, Green Star, Red &amp;amp; Gold, and Purple Chevron).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the 48 Unit cards, there are 16 Wizards (4 different classes for each colored faction), and 6 Plague Cards. Plague Cards do not belong to any color; therefore, they cannot be discarded, ONLY PURGED. Plague Cards were created to prevent you from getting rid of all your cards. There are several ways to remove these cards from your hand (see Wizard Cards). Part of the fun is discovering these various methods of &amp;quot;purging&amp;quot; the Plague.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wizard Cards are played in the same manner as the other Colored Units. For example, a Blue Wizard can be played on top of any Blue Unit or on top of any other Wizard. There are four types of Wizard Cards, each with their own unique action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swap-A-Hand Wizard - When you play this Wizard, swap your hand with the hand of another player. The choice of which player to Swap-A- Hand with is yours. Once the &amp;ldquo;swap&amp;rdquo; has occurred, play continues to the next player in turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Draw Two Wizard - When you play this Wizard, the next player must draw 2 cards. The player who draws the additional cards will still be able to play their turn. If they do not have a playable card after Drawing Two, they must continue to Draw until they draw a card that can be played. A turn is determined complete when a card has been played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Purge-A-Card Wizard - When you play this Wizard, you may discard ANY card of your choice from your hand. Place the card of your choice facedown on the tabletop, thus removing it from the game completely. The card has now been PURGED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Purge-The-Plague Wizard - When you play this Wizard, you may discard ONLY Plague Cards from your hand. However there is no limit to how many Plague Cards you can discard. Place the Plague Card(s) face up on the tabletop, thus removing it from the game completely. *The two &amp;quot;Purge&amp;quot; Wizard cards are the ONLY cards that can remove Plague Cards from your hand and therefore the game. Also important is the ability of the &amp;quot;Purge-A-Card&amp;quot; Wizard to remove ANY card from the game. The ability to remove Any card allows various opportunities to develop. In fact, sometimes the best play might not be to PURGE a Plague card. The choice is yours...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
