			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A thieves' guild on the threshold of dimensions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes &amp;quot;Bring Me The Head of Alfredo Fonnori&amp;quot;, a 10th level mini-adventure by John Simcoe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a minor smuggler miscast a teleportation spell, he found the key to grreater fortune in the Crawlspace, a small pocket dimension full of maze-like tunnels that sprung from a central courtyard. As he explored this strange new dark and dusty reality, he discovered that at the end of each tunnel was a plane-jumping portal that opened up to a new secret location on his home world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realizing what he had found, the smuggler began recruiting members for a whole new thieves' guild - one protected from every law, one hidden from every guardsman, one unconstrained by any border - because it was in a different dimension. With that, The Labyrinth was born.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you stop it? Will you join it? It's up to you: choose a side!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
