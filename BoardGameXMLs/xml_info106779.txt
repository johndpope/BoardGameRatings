							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pyramids in my pocket</name>
									
			<description>One player, the Disciple, must find out which pyramids the other has hidden in his pocket, while the other, the Master, tries to prevent the first from guessing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, the disciple asks for a certain color or size. If available, the Master gives them a matching pyramid which they must drop in an Icehouse tube.&lt;br/&gt;On the Master turn, they will give the Disciple any pyramid to drop into the tube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends either when the Disciple guesses which three pyramids the master has hidden or when the stack of pyramids reaches over the edge of the tube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
