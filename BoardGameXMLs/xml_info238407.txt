							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Winner Winner Chicken Dinner</name>
									
			<description>Players take on the role of foxes trying to steal as many chickens as they can from the hen house, then cooked up into delicious fried chicken dinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will take on a specific character fox, each with a unique ability to be used once during the game. Players roll dice to steal chickens from the coop, collect action cards to help themselves or hinder others, and convert their chickens into dinner. Watch out for Toby the farm dog! Rolling poorly too many times and he might scare the chickens out of your bag or could end the game. Action cards can be used to steal from other players, influence dice rolls, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who has the most fried chicken dinners and chickens in their bag at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
