							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">On Vampires: an explanatory essay</name>
									
			<description>From the Essay's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a small essay on my roleplaying game Vampires. It serves two purposes: to explain what I had in mind in designing it, and to persuade those who feel that only a monster could have written such a horrible game that, well, perhaps things aren&amp;rsquo;t so black and white. But before you read any further, please know that doing so will ensure that you can never play Vampires again as it was meant to be played. It is designed to give you an experience which you can no longer have after reading this essay. So, please decide whether you wish to try out the game, or rather read about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
