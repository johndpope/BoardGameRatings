							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Vaults of Obryn Sapravda (1E)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not long ago, a powerful wizard, seeking a remote location from which to conduct his experiments, set off into the wilderness with a team of dwarves and trusty servants.  A suitable location was found, deep in the mountains, and construction began, expanding the old ruins found there.  Messages were sent to the various schools of magic, informing them that the great Obryn Sapravda, Master of the Animative Arts, was almost ready to open his research laboratory, and would be taking petitions from wealthy families to apprentice their children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But then all correspondence ceased.  The dwarven laborers were dismissed, but would say nothing of what had happened to the great wizard, nor would they reveal the location of his laboratory in the mountains.  Rumors began in the circles of wizardry that Master Obryn had delved too deeply into the dark arts, and that he had gone insane.  Others suggested that he had summoned a creature from beyond the pale, only to become its slave, still others that his animated constructs had gone berserk and torn him to shreds.  No one seemed interested in the truth, all were content to accept one rumor or another, and soon the once powerful wizard faded from memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now the long lost abode of Obryn Sapravda has been found!  Your band of brave adventurers has been hired to explore their depths, and learn the fate of the legendary mage.  Your mission is frought with secrecy and intrigue.  Can you unravel all the mysteries of The Vaults of Obryn Sapravda?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Complete room descriptions with new monsters, traps, treasures, and more!&lt;br/&gt;     Complete floor plans for every room and encounter area!&lt;br/&gt;     Several puzzle encounters to test your players skills and wits!&lt;br/&gt;     Three separate scenarios, with twenty unique encounters!  Play all three as one long adventure, or divide them up and drop them into your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;     FREE 3-dimensional map set (included within) of every room in 1&amp;quot; = 5' scale! &lt;br/&gt;     No need to fumble thru generic tiles to create each encounter, simply print and play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
