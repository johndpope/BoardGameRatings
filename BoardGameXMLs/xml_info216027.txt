			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement provides an alternate method of equipping new characters for play under the Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Below you will find a variety of pre-selected equipment packs which will permit players to quickly equip their characters. The total weight of each pack has been included for further convenience (less the weight of any gold included). Choosing equipment in this way replaces the standard method of rolling for starting money; if you use this system, do not also use the starting money roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All characters start with the Basic Pack and a class-based pack of their choice. They may also spend their additional gold on the bonus packs, on items in the normal equipment list or to upgrade weapons or armor in their class pack. With the GM's approval, a character may swap a given weapon for one of similar power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
