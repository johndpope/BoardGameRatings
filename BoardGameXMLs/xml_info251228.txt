							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Radetzky&#039;s March: The Hundred Hours Campaign</name>
									
			<description>This game allows you to fight the 1849 campaign and the bloody battle of Novara&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;March 20th, 1849: the Piedmontese forces, about 85,000 men with just over a hundred guns, are positioned around Novara, ready to to cross the Ticino river and invade the Austrian territory, moving towards Milan, in an attempt to regain it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field Marshal Radetzky, commander in chief of the Austrian forces, 83 years old, conceives a daring plan: to concentrate all his forces, about 75,000 men with over 200 guns, right around Pavia, ready to cross the Ticino, quickly invade Piedmont and force the piedmontese army to a decisive battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Counters represent all the military forces of the time: Hussars, Uhlans, Dragoons, Line infantry, Grenzer, J&amp;auml;ger, Artillery, Bersaglieri, Pontoon Crew, Commanders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a very accurate map that took years of research, Austrians and Piedmontese troops engage in bloody attacks and retreats, cavalry charges, strategic movement, pontoon building ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All these actions are performed by the players alternatively, but not in a conventional two-turn system. The game features a random activation mechanism that makes it always compelling and different, creating chaos and uncertainty, in a realistic and tense simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heart of the system is the command: simply check how many points you have in the turn, choose the formations you will activate, put them inside a mug;  your opponent does the same, then mix and draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME SCALE&lt;br/&gt;- Complexity: 2 out of 5 &lt;br/&gt;- Solitaire Suitability: 4 out of 5 &lt;br/&gt;- Time Scale: Three hours turn&lt;br/&gt;- Map Scale: 1km/hex &lt;br/&gt;- Unit Scale: Regiments with their guns, battalions, two squadrons of cavalry&lt;br/&gt;- Players: one or two &lt;br/&gt;- Playing Time: two to six hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT'S IN THE BOX?&lt;br/&gt;- One 22 x 34 inch map (55,8 x 86,5 cm)&lt;br/&gt;- 216 counters  &lt;br/&gt;- Two player aid, colored cardboard (Terrain effect chart and Fast placement sheet) &lt;br/&gt;- Rule Booklet (with complete order of battle, game tips, campaign history and sources) &lt;br/&gt;- One 6-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included scenarios  - In addition to the basic game, there are some scenarios and variants that allow for shorter games and explore other strategies:&lt;br/&gt;- Mortara and the Sforzesca, the Piedmontese attempt to stop the Austrian advance &lt;br/&gt;- Novara, the bloody final battle &lt;br/&gt;- Ramorino obeys orders; this scenario allows the Piedmontese to deploy the V division at the beginning of the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
