			<description>&amp;quot;Each player controls a team of 4 Super Fast Hover Cycles. Each player has a set of 4 models that share a unique team color and design. Each cycle within a team is numbered 1 through 4.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The track length is divided into 100 spaces. The track has a width of a single space. Each space needs to be big enough to hold 1 Tile and several cycles. Multiple cycles can occupy a single space. At the beginning of the track there should be a Start Zone.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set of 100 Terrain Tiles are randomly distributed randomly to form a different track for each game. The set consists of 5 tiles for each of the twenty terrain types. Despite their name, the Terrain Tiles have a number of different abstract effects on gameplay and are not all named to describe different types of terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two decks of standard playing cards are also required to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are scored based on the order in which a cycle reaches the finish line. The player scoring the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
