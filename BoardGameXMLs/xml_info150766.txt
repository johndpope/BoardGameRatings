			<description>A game of robot combat for 2 &amp;ndash; 4 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robot Combat is a game of arena-style robot combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Robot Combat you randomly pick a combat style robot, which you will maintain, upgrade and fight within the Robot Combat arena. You start with a basic level 1 combat robot and your goal is to improve upon your robot design by upgrading to the strongest level 3 robot and winning the championship. You can do this by winning auctions for new or used robot parts or winning a robot combat match! &lt;br/&gt;You are given a chassis type, an initial drive train, armor, a weapon systems, a motor system, and 12 voltage batteries for each system; everything! During phases of the game you can either bid on new types of Robot Parts for a better deal OR bid on used parts directly from players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You begin with a small amount of funds to help you upgrade your robot. When you are ready and your robot is fully functional, you can place your robot on the competition circuit and fight against other robots for prizes or money! In the end there can only be one combat champion robot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During combat you will use movement cards to control your robot's drive system within the combat arena to help maneuver your robot into the best fighting position with your weapon. Watch out though, as you move or get knocked around the arena, the combat arena has offensive and defensive weapon systems of its own such as; spikes, ramps, saws, lifters, hammers, etc... these systems try to destroy or inhibit your robot! If your robot becomes immobile, you lose and the match is over!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat arena is a hex style attack grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you move your robot around the arena you will try to make contact with your opponent which will cause either LIGHT, MEDIUM, OR HEAVY damage.  The damage to your opponent&amp;rsquo;s robot will depend on the level of your weapon or the level of the robot!  Also, when you make contact you can cause different issues with the robots such as; power failure, loss of control, loss of maneuverability, electronic failure, motor failure, battery failure, etc...   These different issues will cause robot part to breakdown.  When a breakdown occurs, you can repair the part or replace it with another part.  Each part has a life span and can only be repaired once, the second time the part breaks down it&amp;rsquo;s destroyed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robot Combat is a turn-based system with rounds and phases. In between matches you will be able to sell or buy new or used parts for your robot to help fix or repair the broken parts before the next match; if you can't fix your robot before the next match, you will have to sit out of the competition until your robot is fully functional.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning each match earns you a trophy and money or parts, if you can upgrade your robot to the highest level and win the most matches; you will earn glory and prestige to become the Robot Combat Champion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
