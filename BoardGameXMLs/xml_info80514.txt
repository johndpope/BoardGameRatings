			<description>From the back of the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tigers on the Prowl is detailed.  It's unlike anything you've ever experienced before.  The scope is the ENTIRE Eastern Front in World War II, from the invasion of Poland in 1939 to the fall of Berlin in 1945 - including ALL of the Armies involved!  German, SS, Luftwaffe, Soviet, Guards, and Axis satellites.  Forces are chosen from hundreds of fighting vehicles, weapons, aircraft, and force structures that were or even could have been used on the Eastern Front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tigers on the Prowl is realistic.  Set at one of the most demanding combat scales, (above company and below division), both strategy AND tactics must be meshed to achieve success.  With each player commanding up to a brigade-level task force, inicluding supporting units such as artillery and aircraft, the options and challenges are endless.  Combat orders must be issued through a &amp;quot;chain of command&amp;quot; to subordinate company, platoon and section sized units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tigers on the Prowl is accurate.  Combat is resolved by detailed calculations based on the same principals used by the U.S. Army Ballistics Research Lab and combat planners.  These calculations take into account actual armor thickness and round penetration at the instant of impact, weight of explosive, fragmentation effects, environmental conditions, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tigers on the Prowl is easy to use.  Designed for all levels of wargamers, Tigers on the Prowl includes 5 scenarios, a built-in scenario builder, and three levels of difficulty.  It also includes automatic set-ip, movement and targeting options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tigers on the Prowl is as real as you can get without being there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Addendum:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game box for Tigers on the Prowl 2 (and hence, the text above) is the same as the original Tigers on the Prowl, but with a small, round &amp;quot;Version 2&amp;quot; sticker attached to the front of the box.&lt;br/&gt;Tigers on the Prowl 2 uses the same game manual as its sister game, Panthers in the Shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
