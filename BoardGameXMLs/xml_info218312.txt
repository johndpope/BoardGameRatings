			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This live-action roleplaying event was help from December 29, 2004 through January 1, 2005, at Burg Bilstein bei Olpe (Castle Bilstein), in Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LARP had an unusually heavy emphasis on professional preparation; participants were expected to utilize LARP-specific costumes, weapons, and armors designed and manufactured by the game production company.  Onsite professionals were used for make-up and hair styling.  A final approval check was made by a &amp;quot;visagist&amp;quot;.  The LARP plot was derived from a novel in the Wraeththu series and provided by the author of the novels.  Event support was derived from Immanion Press, Larp-Zeit Magazine, and Twilight.  The event was photographically documented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
