			<description>In this cooperative &amp;quot;RPG-lite&amp;quot; game designed by a middle schooler, players take on the role of heroes who must quest around the kingdom to find the gemstones they need to enter the castle, where the evil Chimera is gathering his strength.  If they can't defeat it before it becomes powerful enough, the kingdom is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player rolls a die to see how far he can move, moves up to that distance, and then takes an action wherever he lands (which usually involves drawing a card to see what encounter he has).  During play, players will collect &amp;quot;Quest&amp;quot; cards, which challenge them to travel to specific mysterious locations on the board and confront special monsters there.  Doing so earns them gemstones, and they need three to enter the castle to challenge the Chimera.  If a player rolls a &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; on the movement die, a strength token is added to the Chimera, and if the Chimera gets 11 tokens, it wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a simple advancement system for the characters; the players earn money for defeating enemies, and they can spend that money in the training hall to buy new skills for their characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is handled with a simple die roll.  Each monster has a target roll the player must hit; rolling the target number or higher harms the monster, rolling below harms the player's character.  Once characters have advanced their skills, they can start to roll two or more dice instead of just one to see if they can roll a die that meets or beats the target number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the players manage to get into the castle and defeat the Chimera before it gets 11 tokens, they win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
