			<description>Based upon the Swedish original TV competition &amp;quot;Survivor&amp;quot;, where the participants stay on a desert island for several weeks, competing in games and trying to get enough food to survive.&lt;br/&gt;Through bluffing  you should make your opponents  believe that your Robinson characters are someone else than those that you have!&lt;br/&gt;The games in the game are both trivia and dexterity types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn is a day on the island, which consists of 4 actions: Choice of Robinson character to move (it doesn't need to be your own, as you may bluff the other here), Investigation of the island, A Robinson competition and The island council (where you elect which character has to leave the game this turn). The characters may also disappear out of the game through &amp;quot;illness&amp;quot; - a special symbol tile, which you might find during the exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
