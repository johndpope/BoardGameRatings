							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Star-Struck City</name>
									
			<description>The Star-Struck City sets players in the sunken ruins of Casa-Omnicidi, now called Perditus; a Primavantor city of incredible wealth recently risen from the seabed. Treasure and danger alike await your warbands, as they travel through the waterlogged city in search of the shards of the meteor that struck down the once-mighty port city and drove it beneath the waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star-Struck City is a skirmish game, designed around playing with small warbands of 5-15 models on a 4&amp;prime; x 4&amp;prime; table loaded with terrain. Warband members advance, gaining new skills, equipment, and injuries as they survive the rigors of battle in this deadly locale. Climb up buildings and run between rooftops, leap down to ambush enemies from above, hire war machines and epic heroes from the Kings of War armies, and build your warband&amp;rsquo;s reputation as the fiercest and toughest fighters in all of Mantica.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are based heavily on Kings of War, so players of the full-size wargame should feel right at home. It&amp;rsquo;s heavily inspired by other skirmish games such as Mordheim, but with the ease-of-play the Kings of War rules provide so gameplay is quick and decisive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the surviving veterans of The Star-Struck City have said: Perditus now only offers riches or death. What will you find?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
