							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Baptism of Fire II</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baptism of Fire II, BoF II, is a complete revision and overhaul of the original &amp;lsquo;Baptism of Fire&amp;rsquo; (BoF) and &amp;lsquo;Wild Fire&amp;rsquo; (WF) miniature wargames. The result will seem familiar to players of these first games, but in many of the mechanisms and details there has been change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The changes have made for standardized systems, which are both easy to teach and remember in play. The text is clearer with more and better examples. It has also been organized by a group of players like yourself, so hopefully finding information in a hurry will be easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BoF II continues as a leading miniature skirmish game, for games of Squads up to reinforced Platoon level from WW2 to present day. It includes rules for all manner of infantry and vehicle operations. There are additional optional rules to further enhance the gaming experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are aimed to create as authentic a battlefield experience as possible, players are encouraged to utilize real life battlefield strategies and tactics as these will give great success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BoF II continues using a similar system as Baptism of Fire and Wild Fire to create a highly interactive, unpredictable, yet the player can try and exert a degree of control and planning to implement his strategies and tactics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
