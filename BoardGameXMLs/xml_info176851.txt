			<description>From Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People are dying by the millions&amp;mdash; but they aren't staying dead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It began just as every other day. Then the news reports started. Hospitals and emergency personnel were overwhelmed by patients complaining of severe, flu-like symptoms. It wasn't long before reports of death came across the various media outlets, followed quickly by confused reports of cannibalistic attacks across a majority of the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within hours, the city in which you live was overwhelmed. Thousands of cannibals attacked the living, turning the victims into new cannibals and quickly spreading whatever disease or virus was causing the transformation. Law enforcement was in disarray. Riots erupted. Mass looting and violence exploded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city had become a war zone worse than anything portrayed on television or in films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A war zone that would launch a whole new kind of war&amp;mdash; a War of the Dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War of the Dead: Alternate Beginnings provides a new introduction to the popular saga, placing the characters at ground zero of the outbreak, right in the middle of a major city. Designed to link with the original Chapter One (Week 7) of the series, War of the Dead: Alternate Beginnings provides additional conflicts, tough choices, and new twists on familiar faces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains six brand new adventures, providing an alternate War of the Dead: Chapter One (Week 1 through Week 6) beginning storyline, and requires the Savage Worlds RPG by Pinnacle Entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Note: Reprints setting notes and setting rules from the original War of the Dead: Chapter One for completeness.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
