			<description>Subtitled &amp;quot;Brigade Level Combat - Western Front 1916&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A command post game about commanding brigades and divisions in WW1 - particularly focused on 1916. The rules are intended to be run in real time, and by umpires - who then write messages to the HQ players in the form they would have been historically, and subject to the delays and inaccuracies that would have existed at the time.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The players never see the rules at all, and must work from a map (ideally in a smelly cellar by the light of a flickering oil lantern while umpires chuck buckets of earth at then).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Players must not be allowed to use game counters, plastic overlays or any modern aids. If a telephone is available it must be unreliable.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The basic player team is probably a Brigade HQ - but with a few more players it can be expanded to a division of 2-3 brigades.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The rules are simplistic and built around a few, hopefully easy to remember, die rolls - because umpires will need to spend time writing as well as adjudicating. Verbal reports from junior officers are possible, but rarely happened - the HQ builds its picture of the battle from a collection of highly unreliable information sources.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
