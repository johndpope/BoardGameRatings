							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legends of the Ancient World: Ebon Rebirth</name>
									
			<description>Ebon Rebirth is a programmed adventure using Dark City Games Legends of the Ancient World rule set. These rules provide gameplay very similar to that of Melee and Wizard from Metagaming. This adventure is compatible with those games as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles are fought with counters on a hex map that is included with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;...You are here for one simple reason; these are lean times. Resources are scarce, not enough for the various peoples of the Wildlands to survive, much less the scavengers. Symbonn has a reputation for providing opportunity to the desperate. It will take some bloody work, but you are confident that you will rise to the challenges that you will face, and survive...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
