			<description>The next in the series was released in March 2004 on PS2 and Xbox, and added a variety of enhancements to the match, as well as new commentary in the post-match highlights voiced by renowned commentator Barry Davies and analysed by Lineker and Hansen as before. New 'Fantasy Team' mode (replacing the 'Challenge Mode' in earlier games) whereby users could build up a team from scratch using a preallocated budget, based loosely on the popular fantasy football game. Once the user had compiled a squad and selected a team name, stadium and kit, the newly-created club would compete in one of the leagues in the game. Another new feature in this version was the option (on Xbox only) of issuing tactical instructions to your team via the Xbox Communicator headset during a match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game had its downsides also. If a player in your team improved over a season, his wage would reflect his improvement in the following season, even if there is no contract renewal. When managing a smaller club these non-negotiated wage rises of a squad the size of twenty for example, can put your budgets in the red and result in having to offload your best players, which can be very frustrating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;LMA Manager series&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
