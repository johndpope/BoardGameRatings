			<description>Sikarra, a volcano island rich in a rare resource that could launch your corporation years ahead in their research&amp;hellip;or one of the multiple other companies that are racing to find it before you. Extracting the resources from Sikarra will not be an easy job; it is rife with dangers; cannibals, pterodactyls, and the volatile volcano itself. The slopes of the volcano are covered in a dense jungle that is very difficult for modern machinery to penetrate. The only people able to move through this difficult terrain easily are the local tribe&amp;hellip;rumor has it they may even be able to travel on the backs of the great winged pterodactyls that circle the volcano. Befriending the tribe may be the only way for your corporation to be the first to reach the rare resources and come out on top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jungle power rules Sikarra.
