							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Duck Hunter</name>
									
			<description>The whole family can experience real-life hunting &amp;ndash; rules, safety, decoys, waterfowl identities, fun, excitement, laughs! Great fun for a hunter, birdwatcher, or anyone interested in waterfowl because it involves 2-4 players in hunting strategy, bird identification, and safety practices used by good sportsmen. The object is to be the first player back to the Clubhouse with the &amp;quot;bag limit&amp;quot; of birds (at least 4 bird pictures with matching description cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting at the clubhouse, roll the dice and move that number of colored spaces. You may move either way on the board, and you may choose to take an inside path to reach the color space that you want. At each space you collect a card of the matching color: Green for a bird picture, orange for a bird description, or yellow for a situation card which explains a safety tip or legal point. When drawing a situation card, follow the instructions; it may send you to the Dog Training School, Sporting Goods Store, or Skeet Shooting Field! (The tan square has no matching deck, so no card is drawn.) When you have collected four different bird cards and their matching descriptions, hurry back to the Club House to claim your win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duck Hunter is packaged in a handsome, full-color box which contains the game board, instructions, four tokens, two dice and three card decks. One deck contains beautifully executed, full-color pictures of birds, the second deck has full descriptions of birds and their habitats and the third deck contains situation cards which remind players of proper hunting procedures, present comedic pitfalls, and provide penalties and bonuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bird pictures are by internationally renowned wildlife artist Bob Hines. He was the only National Wildlife Artist to be employed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
