			<description>Complete Onside Soccer is a football simulation game programmed by Elite for PC and PlayStation, released in 1996 in Europe and 1998 in Japan. It was published by Telstar Electronic Studios in 1996.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game centres on team management and on-pitch play using British and European football teams of the 96/97 season. The game was generally not as popular or innovative as similar FIFA products but despite relatively poor graphics it can be rewarding with both 11-a-side or indoor 5-a-side. It supports a single player through tournaments and leagues or 2 players for versus play, with weather options and commentary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay features a typical two-button layout, with one button to play low balls and other to kick higher balls (including crosses and shooting on goal), and by holding both the player can sprint, making him much harder to stop. It's possible to score goals from most situations, from distance kicks, crosses, outpacing the goalkeeper and from dead ball situations, where the player can also tweak player positions in a blackboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Complete Onside Soccer&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
