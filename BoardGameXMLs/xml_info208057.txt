							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Panda Pursuit</name>
									
			<description>A hungry panda has escaped the zoo in search of better food and the only way to get him back is to gather the bamboo that he likes best.  That's where you come in!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Panda Pursuit, each player is a zookeeper trying to lure Panda back to his enclosure and keep him happy.  You'll have to watch what he eats and make sure you stock up on his favorite bamboo to stop him from escaping again.  Meanwhile, a sneaky photographer is also chasing Panda to get the perfect set of photos.  Could Panda secretly want to be a star?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn players will roll custom dice and apply their results to Panda and their Zookeeper or Panda and the Photographer.  When Panda stops on bamboo, he eats it.  When a Zookeper stops on bamboo, he collects it.  And when the Photographer stops in the same row or column as Panda, he snaps a photo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Race the other zookeepers to the best bamboo and help or hinder the photographer trying to capture Panda in a variety of poses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find the right combination of food and photos to keep Panda happy and home in his enclosure in Panda Pursuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
