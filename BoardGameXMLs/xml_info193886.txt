							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Secret Of The Atomic Bomb</name>
									
			<description>The goal of the game is to built an atomic bomb.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in three phases. In the first phase the players try to collect 4 cards of one country by exchanging cards between neighboring players by the roll of an even number. If a player collects 4 cards of a country he contolls this country and enters phase two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second phase the players move around the game board, starting at their own country. Some spaces hinder or benefit the players. They collect fissionable material (atoms) to build an atomic bomb by placing two atoms on any space he occupies in any country that has entered phase two. If a player has collected 11 atoms, his country enters phase three.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the third phase the players build an atomic bomb by moving the 11 collected atoms from the white dots inside the factory to the blue dots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to finish his atomic bomb, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game was published between late 1945 and 1947.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
