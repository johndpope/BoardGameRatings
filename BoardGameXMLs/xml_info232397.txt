							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City at the Center of the Earth</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since inventors Edison and Armstrong set out on their first journey to Mars in 1870, mankind has been enthused by the worlds lying beyond the Ether, and nations and enterprises, inventors and explorers have ventured into the depths of space. German inventor Elke Eggers, however, has no interest in going up. Driven by her memories of the fantastic tales her grandfather Ansgar used to tell her about underground civilizations, she has dedicated her life to seeking ways to voyage underground and find the mysterious City at the Center of the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is set on Earth and&amp;mdash;in particular&amp;mdash;inside it. On an adventurous journey &amp;agrave; la Jules Verne&amp;rsquo;s Journey to the Center of the Earth and in particular Edgar Rice Burrough&amp;rsquo;s Pellucidar novels, the characters join Elke Eggers in her giant Mole Drill, digging its way towards the Earth&amp;rsquo;s core. But sabotage and unknown threats make the voyage challenging and dangerous. Will they reach the mysterious city Elke Egger is convinced exists down there? And if so, which mysteries and secrets await the adventurers there? What creatures live in the gigantic caverns deep down in the center of the Earth? And, where do the inhabitants&amp;mdash;and possibly even builders&amp;mdash;of this &amp;lsquo;World beneath the World&amp;rsquo; come from?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventurers can be of any nationality, even if the starting point of the journey is set in the German Empire. The events in this adventure challenge various character archetypes with tasks matching their expertise: Academics, Scientists, and Explorers are best suited for this endeavor, of course, but Engineers, Mechanics, or Soldiers will be useful as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
