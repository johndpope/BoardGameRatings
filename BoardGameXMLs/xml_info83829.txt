			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blackdirge Publishing takes a closer look at an often-ignored weapon in the newest installment of the Master at Arms series: the knight of staves. Despite its versatility, the quarterstaff is not often found in the hands of skilled warriors, and is usually relegated to serving mages and sorcerers as a backup weapon. The knight of staves, however, has mastered this simple and effective weapon. With his trusty staff, he can dispatch foes with a fusillade of lightning-quick strikes, crush them with mighty two-handed blows, or deflect their weapons with elaborate, spinning parries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knight of staves is a noble wanderer, an unassuming warrior armed only with a humble staff. He travels the land with only a few meager belongings, aiding those in need, and bringing justice and retribution to the wicked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So give your PCs and NPCs a little clandestine firepower and help rescue the quarterstaff from obscurity with Blackdirge Publishing and Master at Arms: Knight of Staves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Master at Arms - Knight of Staves includes 7 pages of new d20 material, which includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A historical look at the quarterstaff&lt;br/&gt;     Author's design notes&lt;br/&gt;     The knight of staves prestige class&lt;br/&gt;     Nerrod Garomar, a renegade drow elf knight of staves&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
