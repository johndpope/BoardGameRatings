							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heist (2013)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heist is a roleplaying game with a small social footprint as its main feature. You should be able to pick it up sight unseen, start reading, and play. You learn the rules as you read along, and different players&amp;rsquo; varying comfort level with acting in character is supported until the group gets their bearings. Once your group has completed the first play through and internalized the rules, you can replay it (with drastically different results), write your own playset, or download and play someone else&amp;rsquo;s. Included in this version is an intro playset, Fort Neuby, based on a standard dungeon crawl formula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game requires a stripped pack of French playing cards as well as the Heist: Mystery Cards provided as a separate document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
