			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each pre-generated character has a print-and-play character sheet included in the rules.  Players name their characters and may take notes, but everything else is already established for their role.  The game does not use dice but states they may be used if the players find it helpful to generate ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is resolved entirely through narration and there is no opposed action resolution mechanism provided.  As the characters are all crew on the same ship, presumably they will share the same basic goals - whatever those may be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
