			<description>A fast paced, &amp;quot;in your face card game&amp;quot; or slow down and teach the kids strategy, math and decision making skills. Skip and hit any other player on the table, lay down long runs like in rummy. Go out with big points. Get caught with the Deck Master and you're the dealer. If you've ever liked UNO, Then you'll love DD Mau!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck consists of 80 playing cards, 52 of which are numbered 1 - 13 in four colors.  The remaining 28 cards are &amp;ldquo;Power Cards&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players get rid of their cards by following the color, matching the number of the card on the discard pile or by playing a &amp;ldquo;POWER CARD&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hand is over when any player gets rid of all the cards in his or her hand. That player SUBTRACTS the total points from the card or cards that player went out with from their base score. All other players ADD the total of the card or cards in their hand and add it to their base score. The game is over when any player's score EXCEEDS 505 points. In the event that a player's score is 500, 501, 502, 503, 504 or 505 then that player's score is reduced to 400 and play resumes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the lowest score at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
