							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carpet of Flying</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once in a great while, there is an invention that makes the world seem a bit less mysterious. These items somehow bridge some intangible barrier and let men, elves, dwarves, and all the other races of the world become a little more in touch with the world as a whole. The carpet of flying is one of these items, bridging the barrier between bird and man. The very common nature of the carpets of flying has allowed hundreds of men to question the nature of something more than themselves. Recent discovery of a book penned by Reghuld the Warden, perhaps a journal or diary, outlines a very different creation myth than that held by the &amp;lsquo;Wanderers.&amp;rsquo; It details a period of time when the only histories available have come from stories past down over three thousand years. Until this work, it has been widely believed that Reghuld was a truly wicked man, but there is now some hints as to a truer history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement has includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Creator Of the Carpet of Flying&lt;br/&gt;     History Of the Carpet of Flying&lt;br/&gt;     New Magic Item: Boat of Flying&lt;br/&gt;     New Minor Artifact: Floating Island&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
