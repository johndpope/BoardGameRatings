			<description>When the undead attacked we weren&amp;rsquo;t ready. Thinking back, we were never fully ready for this.&lt;br/&gt;The whole outbreak started over two weeks ago and it&amp;rsquo;s been getting worse ever since.&lt;br/&gt;This time we&amp;rsquo;ve barely made it. &lt;br/&gt;We got away, but Bill got bitten. We both knew what that meant&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;We decided to stay in this abandoned building for a while. We needed to rest and sleep.&lt;br/&gt;A huge horde of the living dead is coming this way&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;They will reach us by the sunset.&lt;br/&gt;I have to lock this place up before that happens and maybe &amp;ndash; just maybe &amp;ndash; I will live to see another day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like in part one of Don&amp;rsquo;t Escape, instead of breaking free out of the room you have to lock yourself in. This time around you are not alone &amp;ndash; there are people around that might help you if you help them. Explore various locations and find things you will need to secure your hideout. Just be aware of the passing time&amp;hellip; The undead horde is approaching and they won&amp;rsquo;t wait forever for you to be ready&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
