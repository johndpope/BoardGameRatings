			<description>In this board game adaptation of the popular video game franchise, players take turns as they attempt to be the first player to cross the finish line, after completing two laps.  To do this, players take control of the steering wheel which acts as dice in the game.  Depending on which of three colors your playing piece is sitting on the game board, that indicates how many times you turn the steering wheel left or right.  The steering wheel will then tell you how many spaces to move your playing piece.  As in the video game, item boxes are scattered around the game board which grants items as players land on them.  Some are instant use items, while others are used later.The steering wheel is also used to determine if items are used successfully against opponents.  When hit by an item, players spin the steering wheel six times and the wheel will tell you if the outcome is successful or not.  Successful hits push the affected player to the edge of the game board marked by blue spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
