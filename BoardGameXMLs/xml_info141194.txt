			<description>ANT RUN PRO is a fast paced arcade game where your goal is to keep the ant running through the ant tunnels. You only have 8 seconds before the ant will emerge from the starting hole and begin racing through the tunnels. Your goal is to choose one of the many shaped passageways, connect it, and keep one step ahead of the ant so that he never reaches a dead end. Filled with special bonus grids and other obstacles, gain extra points in your quest to move onto the next level. Packed with features and educational ant facts, Ant Run Pro is arcade strategy fun for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
