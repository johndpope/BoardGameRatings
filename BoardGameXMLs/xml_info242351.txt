							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Baker&#039;s Dozen of Dungeon Rooms III</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially produced classic dungeons and megadungeons often have rooms that aren't detailed. These may be intentionally left blank, or for the GameMaster to flesh out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collection of thirteen different rooms that can be dropped into such a dungeon, or used to help build your own. Each is described in detail, and some have threats or potential threats listed. The rooms are system neutral so that they can be dropped into any game system. Although each room's dimensions are given, these can be changed to make the room fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rooms vary in size from galleries to large open areas and types from natural chambers to artificial ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a brief overview of a room:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forest: A natural pine forest is somehow growing inside a huge cave, with wildlife and what looks like a genuine sky,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover, one the front matter, half a page is the introduction and one page is ads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
