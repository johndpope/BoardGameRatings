			<description>Each card in a deck shows a different geometric pattern. A card is drawn. The player then takes his four thin, transparent, identically-shaped pieces and tries to arrange them - usually with some overlapping necessary - to match the pattern on the card that is drawn. This game can be played solitaire or as a two-player race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
