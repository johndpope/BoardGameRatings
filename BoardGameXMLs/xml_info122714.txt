			<description>Each player draws 10 letters from the bag, then take turns trying to form the longest word.&lt;br/&gt;Each letter has its own value showed on the chip. Once a new word is formed, the player adds the points for letters of that word. Words must be interrelated.&lt;br/&gt;The round ends when a player has placed all of its 10 letters. The scores are counted and the first player to reach the score of 100 points (several rounds) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
