			<description>&amp;quot;Super Juegos&amp;quot; was a pioneer Spanish magazine about both, board and computer games, which was published between 1984-1985. Every issue included a board game inside (two in issues 7 and 8), with rules and cut-out counters. As far as I know only eight numbers were published, at least in its first epoch (another publication with the same name would appear years later, this time focusing on computer games only).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the games included in issue 7 was El arc&amp;oacute;n del pirata (&amp;quot;The Chest of the Pirate&amp;quot;). Set in the Piracy age, one player with the Spaniards tried to reach the edge of the board with his galleons (full of silver), while the other with the Pirates tried to board the enemy ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
