			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes rules supplements read like the world-setting bible of frustrated novelists. While solid world- building is a useful skill, you don&amp;rsquo;t always need four paragraphs of flavor text to tell you swords are cool, magic is power, shadows are scary, and orcs are savage. Sometimes a GM doesn&amp;rsquo;t have time to slog through a page of history for every magic weapon. Sometimes all that&amp;rsquo;s needed are a few cool ideas, with just enough information to use them in a game. Sometimes, all you need are bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1 With A Bullet Point is a line of very short, cheap PDFs each of which gives the bare bones of a set of related options. It may be five spells, six feats, eight magic weapon special abilities, or any other short set of related rules we can cram into about a page. Short and simple, these PDFs are for GMs and players who know how to integrate new ideas into their campaigns without any hand-holding, and just need fresh ideas and the rules to support them. No in-character fiction setting the game world. No charts and tables. No sidebars of explanations and optional rules. Just one sentence of explanation for the High Concept of the PDF, then bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The High Concept: Seven feats designed to augment the options and utility of war masters (from The Genius Guide to the War Master) or, if war masters aren&amp;rsquo;t being used in a campaign, that can be taken by classes that receive bonus combat or teamwork feats as class features (using their class levels as war master levels for prerequisites) or characters that have the Leadership feat (using their character level as war master levels for prerequisites). This is the latest in a series of products to celebrate the &amp;quot;Summer of Bullets&amp;quot; event!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The feats included are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Defensive Spell Focus: You can maximize the benefit of your defensive spells.&lt;br/&gt;    Deflective Armor: Your defensive force spells can cause attacks to slide off it before they get close enough to have touched you.&lt;br/&gt;    Eldritch Armor: You can attune your defensive force spells to protect against efforts to dismiss your personal magic.&lt;br/&gt;    Explosive Mage Armor: You can dispel your mage armor in a wave of outward force.&lt;br/&gt;    Heighten Mage Armor (Metamagic): You can cast more effective versions of mage armor as higher-level spells.&lt;br/&gt;    Mage Armor Properties: You can add the magic properties of mage armor to your mage armor spell.&lt;br/&gt;    Shapeable Mage Armor: You can alter and mold the shape of your mage armor.&lt;br/&gt;    Slick Armor: Your mage armor makes you hard to grasp.&lt;br/&gt;    Summoner Armor: You can conjure armor to protect your conjured allies.&lt;br/&gt;    Witch Armor: Your mage armor is also effective against supernatural forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
