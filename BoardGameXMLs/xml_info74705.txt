							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vampires: a postmodern roleplaying game</name>
									
			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a roleplaying game about vampires. Not about vampires engaged in intricate plots concerning ancient works of art and forbidden knowledge. Not about vampires that are addicted to blood for its own sake, and constantly agonise about the immorality of drinking it. Not about vampires who seek to rescue their soul from damnation, or wish to achieve the eternal rest denied to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, vampires are constantly engaged in a violent physical struggle for power, respect and security. To avoid being a beaten-up loser, you need blood. You get blood by biting women you are intimate with. 'Intimate', as in 'love'. Only for you, it's not love anymore - for you, it's ruthless exploitation. The question is: can you exploit enough women to survive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make up a vampire. He must be male, and he must have pointy teeth. The rest is up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're ready, if you're serious, make yourself as a vampire. (Unless you are a woman. In which case, make your identical twin brother as a vampire.) But if you're not ready, I won't hold it against you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, make up an environment. There must be other vampires, ready to fight you over something. What is that something? Power? Prestige? The favour of the King? The right to exhort the most shopkeepers in the neighbourhood? The possession of the most beautiful women? It's all up to you: time, place, technology, the supernatural.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
