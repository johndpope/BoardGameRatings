			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE MOST DANGEROUS COLLECTION OF HOSTILE ALIEN LIFE FORMS EVER UNLEASHED ON THE UNIVERSE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mad scientist Uncle Ernie has one thing in mind, destroy the infra-structure of society at any cost, and thereby bring the Alliance to its knees. The problem is, he really isn't mad at all. He is the greatest bio-cyber geneticist the universe has ever known. And he has a plan, bring chaos to your doorstep, free of charge! He and his followers, the Anarchist Rebellion Movement, also known as ARM, are wreaking havoc across space, seeding the galaxy with hostile life-forms. Worlds are being destroyed. Millions of people are being slaughtered, and the only thing in this renegade's way, is a mercenary, a guy who looks just like you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
