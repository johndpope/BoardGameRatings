			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future Shadows takes place within the Milky Way Galaxy in the 35th century. In this fictional future universe the Empire rules the majority of the explored galaxy, uniting the majority of known races. The core of the Empire is densely populated, and is spread ever thinner to the colonies and fringe worlds of farthest reached of explored space. The Empire is filled with competing races and mega corporations that spar with politics, violence, and philosophy. These spars have left many scattered through out the Empire, unemployed and destitute. They are called the dispossessed and live very meagerly sustaining themselves on the Empires charity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the Empire are several races that have chosen not to be part of the Empire. Nearer the center of the galaxy the Koranda have invaded from another Galaxy. From beyond our dimension there is ancient threat that seeps through the rifts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Living in the shadows of this mixture of events, trying to survive and thrive is the core of the adventures you will find in Future Shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
