			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The islands of New Zealand are in the southern Pacific ocean, and are an independent country with a population of approximately 4.6 million people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maori is a Polynesian language, known as Te Reo, related to Tahitian, Cook Islands Maori and Tuamotuan. Around 30,000 adults are considered to be very fluent in the language, but it is considered to be endangered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement lists 100 female Maori first names that are suitable for both players and NPCs in a Polynesian-inspired region. Each name has details on their meaning, and other notes, if known, as well as any alternate spellings, if there are any. With the alternate meanings, there are more than the 100 base names listed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page of the supplement is the cover and one page the introduction and front matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is an example from the table:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Name: Hile Meaning: Girl or daughter. Alternatives: Hinemoa&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
