			<description>&amp;quot;Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven is a computer role-playing game developed by New World Computing and published by 3DO in 1998. It is the sixth installment in the Might and Magic series, the sequel to Might and Magic V: Darkside of Xeen and the first of the Might and Magic titles to take place in the same world as Heroes of Might and Magic. It continues the storyline of Heroes of Might and Magic II, and is followed by Heroes of Might and Magic III in the series chronology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Might and Magic VI, the player takes control of four adventurers and, starting with the lowest attributes, guides them to be mighty heroes to save the fictional land of Enroth. The player is allowed full roam over the terrain, as opposed to the grid-based maps of the previous titles, allowing scaleable mountains and fully-explorable maps. Battles can be conducted either in real time or in a turn-based mode, where the player can take time determining what enemies to attack or what spells to cast. However, the player's movement is severely limited in turn-based mode. As in the rest of the series, all action is shown through the eyes of the party, in first person view. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Might_and_Magic_VI:_The_Mandate_of_Heaven,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
