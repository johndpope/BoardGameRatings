			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a sports version of the comedic pop-culture quiz show with the brash host and is free for play. There's different categories such as Pro Athletes &amp;amp; Other Large Corporations and Gibberish Questions where you must decipher a common sports clich&amp;eacute;, term, etc. from a sentence that makes no sense. One time per round you can &amp;quot;screw your neighbor&amp;quot; by forcing an opponent to answer a question and if they answer wrong, they lose points. But if they answer correctly then you lose the points. There's three rounds of 14 questions and a Jack Attack lightning round. Whoever has the most points at the end, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
