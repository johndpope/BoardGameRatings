							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">So What&#039;s It Called, Anyway?</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having returned from their most recent adventure, the PCs rest and recuperate in a nearby town. Of course, being adventurers it&amp;rsquo;s not long before they start to explore every nook and cranny of their new home in search of adventure! Before the hard-worked GM knows it, they are exploring every un-detailed portion of the town and asking questions like &amp;ldquo;So what&amp;rsquo;s that tavern called, anyway?&amp;rdquo; Instead of panicking, or using the same old names again and again, a GM using the tables within can quickly name dozens (if not hundreds) of taverns, inns, shops, locations and even other organizations and groups. Alternatively, the GM can use these tables ahead of time to create interesting and evocative names to pique the PCs&amp;rsquo; interest and to breathe life into his campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
