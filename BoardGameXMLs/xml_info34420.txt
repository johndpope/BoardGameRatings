			<description>(From the back of the box) Republocrat is a game which combines a basic knowledge of American History along with luck and skill. Players travel around a circle of spaces named Democracy Boulevard to work towards their ultimate goal: Election to the Presidency.  the spaces on the board allow the players to consecutively move into 5 offices prior to reaching the final stage of the game.  The final stage of the game finds players at the National Convention and the White House.  The offices that players must pass through are: City Council, State Senate, US House of Representitives, Governor of the State and US Senate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may suffer setbacks or gain sudden rewards during the game. Depending if the player answers the question correctly determines if the player moves ahead. In addition, when a player receives a &amp;quot;Republocrat Card&amp;quot;, it may require the player to move ahead or go back as indicated on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Republocrat not only entertains, it challenges and informs those seeking election to the presidency. The 240 United States of America questions will allow people to play the game many, many times and enjoy a new experience each time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
