			<description>Football Fury (ウルティメイト フットボール &amp;quot;Ultimate Football&amp;quot;) is fully called Ultimate Football: Try Formation! in Japanese.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay takes place in a playoffs system of a fictional American football league. Gameplay involves the usual football fare of choosing a play and attempting to execute it.  On offense, when throwing the football, a meter appears which measures the strength of the passer's throw.  On defense, the player controls a defensive player and tries to tackle the opposing ball carrier or attempt to break up a pass play. There is an option to either play with or without background music.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With its fictitious teams, the designers were giving up any pretense of their game being an authentic simulation of the NFL.  The designers who made Football Fury were trying to invent almost 30 new teams from scratch, in a limited amount of time.  A lot of the logos used in this game are nonsensical like the rifle used for the Hunters team, for example. There are two conferences: the United States Football Conference (USFC) and the American All-Star Football Conference (AAFC). Even though the teams are fictional, they use the cities of the actual NFL teams of the early 1990s.   Passwords allow saved games to be restored while a news report is made after each game through the fictional cable television network ZIFN.  A halftime show of cheerleaders adds to the realism of the American football atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Football Fury&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
