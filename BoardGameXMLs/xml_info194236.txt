							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anatolian Fleet</name>
									
			<description>Anatolian Fleet is a simulation game of modern day combat for control of the eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea-Balkan sub-theatre by Naval Task groups. NATO, Russian and Turkish Fleets are pitted against each other and the other minor navies of the region. You must form your ships into Task Forces and attempt to cripple the enemy&amp;rsquo;s capital ships, carriers, and submarines. Your air assets must be carefully assigned to defensive and offensive missions. Most important, you must protect your supply and replenishment ships, or your fleet will be unable to maintain combat effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each 8-hour game turn is broken into 3 distinct phases (sub, surface, and air) and each player takes turns choosing which phase they wish to conduct. Ex. if the NATO player chooses &amp;quot;Air&amp;quot;, they conduct all bombing, shipping strikes, anti-sub, and interception actions for all their aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players also use their units to attempt to &amp;quot;detect&amp;quot; enemy forces so that an attack can be made. Ships and aircraft are always detected once a unit moves close enough to them, but players have to roll to try to detect subs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optional rules include nuclear weapons and logistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anatolian Fleet is a comprehensive simulation of the myriad elements involved in modern naval command and control. From Technical Term Game Company Anatolian Fleet continues the line of naval games originally from Victory Games Fleet Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
