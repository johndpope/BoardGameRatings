			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lost Dutchman Mine is a non-linear  adventure game which puts the player in the role of a gold miner, circa 1860. The game was the biggest success for its publisher, Magnetic Images.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player was free to roam around the desert and town at will constrained only by the need to make sure they had enough food to eat and a safe place to sleep. Earning money could be accomplished in a variety of ways including panning for gold in a river, mining for gold in a cave, or capturing a wanted bandit. Food could be purchased or caught from a river if the player had previously acquired fishing gear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game became well-known for its breezy, free-flowing nature. The game was also notable for not having a single environment for the player to operate in; the location of mines and rivers, and the details of characters a player could meet were different each time the game was played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
