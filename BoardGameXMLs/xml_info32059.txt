			<description>A real 2-player game gem from the early post war days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game consists of the game board, 20 tiny, hand painted tin locomotives in a pre-war design, a dice cup and a dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player has 3 express trains (dark and light red), 3 passenger trains(dark and light green), 3 goods trains (dark and light blue) and a special train (yellow).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game is to send all your trains from the starting station to the end station on the opposite side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;Every kind of train has a fixed movement allowance: Expresses 4 squares, passengers 3 sq. and goods 2 sq.&lt;br/&gt;The die only shows how many of your trains you can move, which ones you take is for your own decision.&lt;br/&gt;If you pass on your throw you can move any given train one square back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cracker of the game is the name-giving special train lurking in the backyard of your starting station: This can be triggered by your opponent !!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once he has done this (or you have done this to him) by throwing a six at any time in the game (your choice), no one stops the special train.&lt;br/&gt;No matter what your throw is, the special train always moves six squares.&lt;br/&gt;So everyone off into the sideways - but these are shared with your opponent, and only one train can occupy a sideway at any time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beware: If there is at any time the special train blocked by one of your own trains so it cannot move its 6 squares - you have lost the game...&lt;br/&gt;And if you think you have managed to avoid the yellow monster - it returns a second time !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
