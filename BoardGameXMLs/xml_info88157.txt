			<description>From the &amp;quot;Introduction&amp;quot; on the web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brutal Physics&lt;br/&gt;Blood spurts from enemies, right where your twin blades sliced. Enemies fall, only to become corpses you can hoist and brandish as sadistic weapons. Watch as walls crumble and whole buildings topple, providing you with new toys in the battlefield. With Source Engine physics and destructible, interactive environments, Vindictus redefines everything you thought you knew about &amp;quot;free-to-play.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Party Play&lt;br/&gt;When a spider three times your height skitters toward you, you'll want one party member to whip a chain around its legs to pin it in place and another to distract it by flinging debris from a nearby pile of rubble, all so you can sneak behind and unleash insane damage with your blade. On the sidelines, your final party member casts healing spells. Dungeons change each time you enter them, so you'll never get bored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Customize Gear&lt;br/&gt;Next, personalize your newly crafted gear with stats via the Enchant system and color via the Dye system. In the end, your character will be clad in gear that's powerful, stylish, and unique. Just be careful when picking your undergarments -- too much fighting can break your gear, revealing what you're wearing underneath!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Story&lt;br/&gt;The air is thick with despair, and the battles never cease. Rain falls, yet the land is barren, as if the earth has been drenched in too much bloodshed to bear fruit. Monstrous creatures lurk in every trench, cave, and valley. To survive, people have huddled together, forming ramshackle towns with high walls. Yet, cowering behind those walls does not guarantee safety...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What has become of the outside world? Few people know. Fewer care to find out. As the common folk trudge from one empty day into the next, only one thought keeps them going: the Legend. The Legend will come to pass. The people yearn for it, pray for it. They hope and believe. And because they believe, they know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One day, they will be in Erinn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
