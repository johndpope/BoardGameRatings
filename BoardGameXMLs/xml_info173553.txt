							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Customer Clues</name>
									
			<description>Customer Clues is a re-theme of Clue distributed to U.S. Bank Employees as a training tool.  It plays nearly the same as Clue, but adds a deck of Mystery Product Cards.  These cards have questions about bank products, sales techniques, etc. that must be answered when players land on certain marked spaces on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like Clue, players move from room to room making guesses as to the cards in the mystery envelope, but in this rethemed version they move around a bank branch, and must deduce which product was sold to which customer in which room.  As mentioned above, as players move around the board, they may land on spaces which will force them to answer questions about bank accounts, policies and procedures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
