			<description>Your objective is to win enough votes to get a majority of the 250 seats in the Portuguese Parliament. &lt;br/&gt;This game is about as realistic as it's possible to be. There are no dice, only cards. Who ever heard of an election with dice?&lt;br/&gt;And if you have to make a few promises . . . well that's politics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
