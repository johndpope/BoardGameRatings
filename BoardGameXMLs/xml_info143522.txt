							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Leelawadee: Fat Bumblebee</name>
									
			<description>Leelawadee was crowdfunded through Spieleschmiede, and this &amp;quot;cute, fat bumblebee start player token&amp;quot; was offered as &amp;quot;an exclusive reward for the smithies that contribute to the project right from the start&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was originally planned to be an overblown start player token, but by the time the rules were printed, it had evolved into a fancy piece for a variant of the game.  Although it's not listed in the contents, the rules for its use are in the rulebook, albeit with an illustration of a generic cube to represent the gamepiece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Quotations taken from the funding page.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
