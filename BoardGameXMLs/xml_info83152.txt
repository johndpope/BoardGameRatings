			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nameless Streets is a game of mysteries and the paranormal beings who investigate them. Powered by the flexible and dynamic HeroQuest game system, players take on such roles as a famous vampire detective, his werewolf muscle, and the necromancer who helps to solve murders. Set amidst the narrow, rain-soaked streets of Portland, Oregon, Nameless Streets  handles classic mysteries, like the Locked Room, and more esoteric struggles with equal ease. You might locate a missing person one week, and get caught in the crossfire between warring sorcerer guilds the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this book, you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Optional HeroQuest rules in which characters' baser natures might get the better of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Full Keywords for a wide variety of supernatural creature types, from human magicians, to vampires and werewolves, all the way to lamia and djinn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Five different magical traditions, including Witchcraft, Necromancy, and the explosive art of Wizardry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A selection of pre-configured mystery scenarios, suitable for an evening's play, as well as a longer-term mystery that will span several sessions.
