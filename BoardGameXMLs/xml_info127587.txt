			<description>Who will be the Breakfast-King? A game with a message for children - eat wisely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board features a pathway with white, yellow, orange and blue spaces. If you land on any colour other than white, you must draw a card from the deck of that colour. The cards either tell you something positive or something negative. Examples:&lt;br/&gt;Blue card - Bad choice of meal, hamburger with Pommes Frites. This is 'not good' so you have to go back three spaces.&lt;br/&gt;Orange card - various breakfasts you might have. A healthy one illustrated, might move you forward two spaces.&lt;br/&gt;Yellow card - Cleaning your teeth after a meal - very good, go forward two spaces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, some cards show an activity that must also be obeyed. This will be one of four instructions:&lt;br/&gt;3 x three jumps on the spot.&lt;br/&gt;1 x run round the table&lt;br/&gt;1 x hop round the table&lt;br/&gt;1 x stand on one leg and count to 10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to reach the end of the track and a crown is included for the victor to wear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published for the Zentralverband des Deutschen B&amp;auml;ckerhandwerks, a kind of organisation to promote different German bakeries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
