			<description>An entry for the Black Industries Scenario of the Year contest.  The scenario was published on the Black Industries website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Dog Eat Dog World takes place at the village of Dunkelbild, which has an recurring problem with hounds that have infested the village. In years past Baron Vornamen Otterbaugh of Dunkelbild was one of the Hound Masters to Karl Franz. He is well known for his skill with all manner of beasts, in particular the famed breeds of Middenland Wolfhounds. These hounds grew a legendary reputation and the dogs were sought after by the nobility of the Empire as loyal companions. The Wolfhounds are greatly prized for their size, strength and loyalty. As the years past, the Baron&amp;rsquo;s love for the breed only increased, and sadly he grew&lt;br/&gt;senile in his old age. He made sure his loyal dogs would never be harmed through a plethora of absurd laws which protected the dogs more than the villagers themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
