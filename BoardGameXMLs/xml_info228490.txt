			<description>Translated from Dutch:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cheerful Christmas game is a wonderfully fun game for under the Christmas tree, especially for everyone who wants to enjoy that ultimate Chistmas feeling during these days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A humorous and dynamic game to play during these wonderful Christmas days with your friends or the whole family!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Christmas wheel of Adventure&amp;quot; adds to the tension and continuously causes hilarious situations. With the &amp;quot; Rudolph, the red-nosed&amp;quot;-assignments you will roll off your chairs laughing. In contrast, the &amp;quot;Christmas memorybreakers&amp;quot; will test your knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;But during the &amp;quot;Cheerful Christmas song&amp;quot; you will find out who sings the best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
