							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mad Marbles</name>
									
			<description>Game comes in a 14 1/2&amp;quot; x 14 1/2&amp;quot; x 2 1/2&amp;quot; box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The orange plastic gameboard (similar dimensions to the box) resembles a square with rounded corners &amp;amp; concave sides. Each corner has a plastic 'gate' which is used to trap marbles &amp;amp; score points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, marbles are introduced one at a time into a rotating transparent plastic chamber which occupies the center of the gameboard. As they roll wildly and with great speed around the board players attempt to trap them with their plastic gate. Although it is possible to squeeze more marbles behind the gate, there are only enough small depressions to safely hold three at any one time. There are eight marbles per turn - seven white (worth 1 point) and a single red marble worth 6 points which is always introduced into the rotating chamber last. At the end of each turn scores are tallied and the next player spins the central chamber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach 12 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
