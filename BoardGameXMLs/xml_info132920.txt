			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kick Inside is a scenario about different stages in life and how we cope with changes. Mayor themes are identity, choices and acceptance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We get to meet four people - Agnes, Marcus, Olivia and Thomas - and follow them through three different stages in life. Three parallell, sepa- rate stories, each running through four acts. All stories take place in cabins that are curiously alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the Players Booklet. Each player needs one. If you want to you can access this booklet at any time during the game but you do not need to know it by heart. The important thing is not to get all nuances right but for you to explore your character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
