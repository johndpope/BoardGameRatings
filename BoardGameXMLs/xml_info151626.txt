			<description>The Macaluso is a limited edition character playbook for Apocalypse World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the apocalypse came, it did not come as they&lt;br/&gt;expected it. Oh, they expected their world to break&lt;br/&gt;down - feared it would, denied it would, planned for&lt;br/&gt;it, planned against it, whatever. But they looked at their&lt;br/&gt;future and they could only see their own monsters. They&lt;br/&gt;couldn&amp;rsquo;t see, couldn&amp;rsquo;t even guess, the creatures that&lt;br/&gt;would come that were not them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
