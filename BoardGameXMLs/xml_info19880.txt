							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Snap Judgment</name>
									
			<description>Based on the 1967-69 game show and made for two teams of two players, although the rules give variations for three and six players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One member of each team is given a separate list of five words. Each player given a list writes down a response for each word on the list. A player earns the team $10 for guessing the response on the first round. If a second round of guessing is needed, the players get to know how many words are in the correct response and the response's first letter. A correct answer is now worth $20.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team that has more money after ten words plays a bonus round where one player has to guess five of the partner's responses to the bonus word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similarities to Password aren't surprising: not only did both games came from the same production company (Goodson-Todman), but for its last three months Snap Judgment changed its rules and set to Password.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
