			<description>The Cracked Jewel Saga VIII&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A One-Round Living City Tournament Set in Procampur&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City of Procampur has changed greatly since Alamondh has assumed temporary control of the city. Daily arrests by the new police force of the city, the Guardians of the Star Sapphire, are announced in the Procampur Shining Jewel. Some of the city's most influential organizations have been closed due to their connections to criminal activities. Alamondh's popularity has grown with his ability to bring greater lawfulness and order to the city, and some people have even started talking about the Hamayarch being the successor to the Thultyrlship if Rendeth does not recover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All this causes you to wonder why you were summoned to the offices of the Commander of the Star Guard, Lord Alaric Grimm. You ponder this as you sit in the waiting room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
