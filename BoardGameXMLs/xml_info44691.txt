			<description>In the fourteenth century, the Pope declared the knights of the Order of Christ and the Temple of Solomon&amp;mdash;better known as &amp;quot;the Knights Templar&amp;quot;&amp;mdash;to be heretics. Their lands and lives were forfeit. But when the Inquisition came to claim the riches rumored to be held in the Order's coffers, they found... nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thirty is a roleplaying game where you'll take on the roles of thirty Templar Knights as they carry a secret treasure, become lost in a magical mist and try to find your way home. The story you tell together with your friends is the story of that journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where did they go? And what did they take with them? The answers are more dangerous than you can imagine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
