			<description>Any number can play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three dice are used. One has letters on each side in batches of four (Example; ABCD) Another has numbers from 1 to 6. And the third has subjects (Example: Music, Theater, Literature and so on). There are four Subjects Dice included in the game so the players must choose which one to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decide a start player. All three dice are thrown and players simultaneously have to think of a relevant answer. The dice determine the subject and the letter that the answer must begin with. Example: ABCD on the letter face, 3 on the number face and Music on the Subject die. The three determines that the answer must begin with a C (the third letter out of the four on the die). A possible answer would be Chopin. The first to answer correctly gets 5 points. If a 5 is thrown, the answer may begin with any of the four letters on the letter die. If a six is thrown, the dice roller gets 5 points (then the dice are passed to the next player, in a clockwise direction, for the next throw).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first to get 100 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four books are included, each with several answers for each subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
