							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Valcapone</name>
									
			<description>Valcapone is a clever pun for an economic gangster game. Of course the name sounds like Al Capone, but this game is by Valentin Herman so &amp;quot;Valcapone&amp;quot; fits well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a more recent Fanfor design and that means it is a DTP publication that was printed in very limited edition and comes as a kit to cut out. Like most of Herman's games, this one is a business and economic game, although this time the theme is the gangster underworld as each player tries to make the most money illegally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
