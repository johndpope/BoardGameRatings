							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Side of the Desert</name>
									
			<description>Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Within the desolate Bric-Cact Desert lies the isolated town of Branis. Founded upon an oasis, this border town in Annelsia is the only civilization found along the trek between the rumored wild people of Sanris in the north and the aristocrats at Caer Annelsia in the southern shores. Ruled by a corrupt mayor appointed by his sister the Countess Belinda Gratia, ruler of Annelsia, Branis has become a dangerous town for both locals and travelers. However, you somehow find your way into this remote settlement looking for work and new adventures. But you will need all your wits about you! The Bric-Cact can easily take its toll upon you, the sands sapping your strength and leaving you lost within the Dark Side of the Desert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
