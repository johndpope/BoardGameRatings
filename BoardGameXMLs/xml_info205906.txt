							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Secret</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is intended to be played out in one to three sessions, with the story being divided into three acts: 1. Before the Reveal; 2. After the Reveal; and 3. The Climax. The Reveal is when the Protagonist&amp;rsquo;s Secret Identity comes to the forefront and the narrative explodes. Before the Reveal builds up toward the Reveal (it is also the phase where the players get used to their Traits) and After the Reveal should move to resolve what happens due to the revelation of the Secret Identity, culminating eventually in The Climax. Each act is divided up into a series of scenes. Special mechanics govern each act in  different ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was various titled The Man I Used to Be and Dark Secret during development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
