			<description>Yesterday's War: The Salvage is a small box worker placement game set in a sci-fi post-apocalypse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been fifty years since the War ended, and two hundred and thirty since the War began. The city of Elysium stands bright and shining in a sea of ashes and rubble. It's the largest city on Earth and the only place where air can be safely breathed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything in Elysium is built from recycled parts from the War. You and up to three other players are salvage workers who wander the wasteland in search of old war machines that can be scrapped for parts. Each salvage worker has four mechs to gather resources and a special ability that gives them an advantage in the game. Salvage workers will fulfill contracts, achieve objectives, earn rewards, and fight raiders - all in the pursuit of sweet, sweet victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
