			<description>&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Battlelords of the Twenty-Third Century is a paper and pencil science fiction role-playing game designed by Lawrence R. Sims and first published in 1990. The game's tagline is Roleplaying in a dangerous future. The Battlelords of the Twenty-Third Century license was later sold by Optimus Design Systems (ODS) to SSDC, Inc. in September 1999.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battlelords of the Twenty-Third Century is set in the year 2279. The territory of the Galactic Alliance, spanning several galaxies, is the primary setting for the game. The Galactic Alliance is made up of twelve races (including Humans), and is run behind the scenes by huge mega-corporations seeking to exploit the farthest reaches of space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player characters usually assume the role of Battlelords, mercenaries employed by the corporations to further their business by any means, legal or otherwise. They face various challenges, including rival mercenaries, Rebels, hostile alien lifeforms on unexplored worlds, and the alien race known as the Arachnids.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher &amp;quot;Battlelords of the Twenty-Third Century is a deep space roleplaying system that focuses on the Alliance of 27 alien races who desperately seek to ward off the threat of internal destruction while simultaneously exploring the vast uncharted regions of space. For the Battlelord, loyalty is to the company, yet corporate devotion never exceeds allegiance to your friends. The mercenary team embodies everything that is valued in society: esprit de corps, honor, and valor. At least that is what the papers say! Your job is a simple one, do anything and everything to stay alive. The company gets all the press. You get to pick up a paycheck. No one cares about methods, but in the 23rd century, everybody needs a hero! It is a battlefield without boundaries, a cemetery without grounds. It is a land whose beauty is shrouded in mystery and danger. Space offers up its treasures only to those brave enough to challenge themselves. And this is Battlelords Country! &amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Battlelords_of_the_23rd_Century,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
