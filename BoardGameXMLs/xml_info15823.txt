			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CLASSIC GOLF is a quick-play game that lets players replay actual tournaments. Here is your chance to recreate history. How would Tom Watson fare against Jack Nicklaus in a repeat of their famous 1982 U.S. Open duel at Pebble Beach? Could Tiger repeat his incredible run of six consecutive victories over the 2000-2001 seasons? These and other questions wait to be answered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are rated according to scoring average, top-10 finishes, and winning percentages. Tournaments are rated according to actual course statistics for a given year. Players can have hot and cold streaks. Weather can impact the tournament field at varying times. An action chart and a pair of dice determine a player&amp;rsquo;s 18-hole score for a round, but on the final day, the top players can attempt a rally to catch-up or put away the field. You can complete a four-round tournament in as little as two hours. Replay complete seasons or create your own circuit. Play medal or match-play formats. Use the inter-year feature for all-time great tournaments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
