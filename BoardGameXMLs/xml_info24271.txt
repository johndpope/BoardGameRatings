							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</name>
									
			<description>This game was designed by Sid Sackson for Alfred A. Knofp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic game is in principle a roll and move with players trying to get through the factory. The dice have been replaced with numbered cards. There are numerous special spaces on the board along the way to represent events in the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The illustrations are whimsical and very brightly colored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
