			<description>Contents&lt;br/&gt;1 Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;1 Game board&lt;br/&gt;15 Light color wooden chips (huts)&lt;br/&gt;15 Dark color wooden chips (huts)&lt;br/&gt;8 Wooden yellow pawns (guards)&lt;br/&gt;2 Wooden red pawns (guards)&lt;br/&gt;2 Sheets of tactics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;This year the Massai celebrate the beginning of the rainy season with a big party. The best architects in the two neighboring villages show up at the dry river bed and will try to join the two towns together with a series of huts.. The first who manages to do so will become the architect of the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives 15 huts of his/her color, 4 yellow pawns used as guards in order to protect some of the huts. and 1 red pawn and 1 tactic sheet which contains the plan for the game seen from either side of the board.  Each player secretly sets up his huts on a tactic sheet. Once both players have done this the tactic sheets are exposed and then the huts are transferred from the tactic sheet to the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has two possible moves on his turn. He may either build a new hut or he may attack an opponent's hut.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to win an architect must establish an uninterrupted chain of 6 huts between the 2 dry river beds or an architect can also win if his opponent has no huts on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is part of the Abacus wood box series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
