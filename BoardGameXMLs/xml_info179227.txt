							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">3 Seeds: Reap Where You Sow</name>
									
			<description>Intro:&lt;br/&gt;In 3 Seeds, your goal is to earn the most points by placing your limited seeds into crops with high returns. To win, you will need to observe the actions of others, remember obtained insights, and strategically use powerful abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch carefully though! Crops and their values can change when you least expect it. Adapt to changes and alter your strategy to come out the victor. With only 3 seeds in hand, where will you sow?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given a deck of 6 Seed cards consisting of 2 time, 2 money, and 2 labor cards. During your turn, you will draw the top 3 Seed cards from your deck. You will try gain insight into one of the return/harvest values assigned to the crops in play. With that information and the seeds you have in-hand, you will play 2 of the 3 seeds in your hand on any of the crops in play. Special earned event cards may also be played during your turn to further your success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seeds you play on crops will be returned to you once the crop receives enough seeds on it to be completed/harvested. Once a crop is completed, players will receive points equal to the crop's harvest number multiplied by the number of seeds they played on that crop. Once a crop is complete, a new Harvest and Crop card is drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when the a crop is completed and there are no more Crop cards in the deck. The player with the most points at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
