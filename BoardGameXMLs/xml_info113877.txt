							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Campaign Leipzig</name>
									
			<description>The dynamic battles of the Spring Campaign of 1813 had seen the French victorious at both Lutzen (May 2nd) and Bautzen (May 20-21). However, they lacked all of the essential elements of a great army to bring the war to a successful conclusion. This was due to the severe cavalry losses in Russia and the lack of Napoleon's subordinate commanders to successfully operate on their own. Shortly after Bautzen an armistice was agreed upon and both sides used the time to rebuild their forces. During this period Austria and Sweden joined the Sixth Coalition and the numbers tipped dramatically in the Allies' favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you can refight the famous battles of the Fall Campaign of 1813 such as Leipzig and Dresden. March in the steps of the young French conscripts or lead the Prussian landwehr towards the French lines with Blucher's famous cry of &amp;quot;Vorwarts mein kinder!&amp;quot; All of the armies of the 1813 Fall Campaign await your command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Campaign Leipzig is the product of three years of research and design. The scenarios represent the titanic struggle that engulfed Germany during the Fall Campaign of 1813. A large assortment of units are represented such as the vaunted Prussian Leib Hussars and La Grande Armee's Old Guard. New program features help to accurately portray the unique features of this campaign. Players can wage the entire Fall Campaign as well as five other, subsidiary campaigns ranging from the efforts to take Berlin to MacDonald's failed attempt to defeat the Army of Silesia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can read more about the game including a brief history of the war from the Scenario Designer Notes.&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over four hundred scenarios to include the battles of Leipzig, Dresden, Katzbach, Grossbeeren, Dennewitz and Kulm.
