			<description>(from Simulations Workshop website:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The German offensive against France was decided by the swift advance of the Panzer columns through the Ardennes forest and a quick crossing of the Meuse River. One of the leading divisions was the 7th Panzer lead by a young Erwin Rommel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One 11 by 16 inch color map, 186 color counters, rules, organizational charts, and tables. Units are battalions and companies, each map hex represents 1.5 kilometers, and turns represent 4 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple combat system, with rules covering river crossings, combined arms, refugees, and Rommel. The French have several tough formations, including their best armored division, so that history does not have to be repeated. 2nd edition map and counters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
