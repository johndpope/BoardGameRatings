			<description>In In the Loop, you are a product producing company who must meet customer demands. Navigating through resource mines and unpredictable markets will involve making economic, social, political, and environmental trade-offs. You will have to make difficult strategic decisions: should you collaborate with your competitors, invest in mining new materials, or change your business model?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Loop gamifies the complex, global supply chain in less than 90 minutes. As the game unravels, players will learn about product lifecycle as well as resource efficient and effective solutions. And they will be ready to come up with their own resourceful strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How it works:&lt;br/&gt;In the Loop is a turn-based game. Players roll dice to move around the board in order to collect material tokens needed to make their products. Event cards occur at intervals throughout the game and hinder or help players' abilities to obtain material tokens. Players can choose to purchase strategy cards to combat these events. The first player to make three products wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
