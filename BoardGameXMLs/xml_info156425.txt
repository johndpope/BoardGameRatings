			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My Shops is a web browser game where the player builds and runs shops.  More shops become available as a player levels-up through the game.  Items that a customer wishes to purchase have to be obtained from a supplier and the quicker a customer is served, the happier they are.  If a customer is 'delighted' then further customers are unlocked.  The quality of goods can be improved using a factory and this can increase a player's revenue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
