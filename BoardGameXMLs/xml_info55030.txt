			<description>We need an ambulance! Call the police! The building is on fire! A pipe is broken and the street is flooded. There is a blackout. The phone is dead. When will that letter arrive?&lt;br/&gt;As the director-general of a public service department, you are responsible for sending service vehicles to the places where their help is required, but in a city without street signs, this might be close to impossible. Fortunately, the local government has launched a street addressing program, and as street signs are placed all around the city, giving directions will become easier.&lt;br/&gt;Players collaborate developing the street addressing program, and compete to get the highest score by being the best at giving and following directions through the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
