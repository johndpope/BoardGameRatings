			<description>From the Scenario's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The small town of Foxfield is located northwest of Arkham, along the Aylesbury Pike. The popular, and long-standing township supervisor, Henry Barnes has reportedly received death threats, most likely from someone within the community. The struggling population, now numbering less than a thousand people, is usually in accord, but developments over the past year have driven a wedge between members of the formerly tight knit community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A lumber company has offered to lease a large tract of undeveloped township land in the hills north of town. There they hope to harvest top quality hardwoods from the stands of oak and maple. This deal would prove an economic boon for the struggling community. Not only would the lease pay the township well, the new industry would provide a fresh economic base for businesses in the town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supervisor Barnes, the head of the local Unitarian Church and a student of naturalist John Muir, at first backed the proposal but now stands four-square against it, citing the &amp;quot;desecration of God's domain&amp;quot; as his main concern. His position has until now received the support of two of the three town council members and a small majority of the townsfolk. Unbeknownst to Barnes, however, one of the council members is thinking of changing her position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While no one can prove the source of the death threat, most suspect Ike Copley, a local farmer and long time political opponent of Barnes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
