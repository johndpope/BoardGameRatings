			<description>Taiga 3rd Edition / International Version&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover&lt;br/&gt;The Western Civilization has failed. The modern world has collapsed into barbarism, over which two superpowers, on the brink of global nuclear war, snarl at each other. 92% of the population are &amp;quot;statistical surplus population&amp;quot; that doesn't even exist in the eyes of the law. Happy New Year world. 2039AD is going to be a killer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a land called Taiga rich people live in isolated and well-protected Central Sectors. A sea of anarchy surrounds these islands of stability. Roadgangs, streetgangs, terrorists, mafia, emerging mutated species and devil-worshipping cultists are fighting for power. And the ecocatastrophe runs rampant, drowning the once-fertile lands of the northern hemisphere into salty sand.&lt;br/&gt;They build cybernetic eyes in Tokyo but light their cigarettes with flint and steel in Karaganda. Technology is marching backwards. But according to the politicians, there is no risk at all, 2039 will be just another triumphant year for the Western Civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From page 123&lt;br/&gt;A list of future products was added in the following order (note that no product numbers were assigned)&lt;br/&gt;Sweet Home Karaganda&lt;br/&gt;Raider's Handbook&lt;br/&gt;Witchdrum of Denim&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: International Version was only released in North America and was published by Renaissance Ink for Burger Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
