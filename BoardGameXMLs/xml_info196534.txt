			<description>Stikbold! A Dodgeball Adventure is an over-the-top action sportsgame with strong resemblance to dodgeball. Stikbold is a glorious and intense sport, which will surely put your friendships to the test with fast-paced, hard-hitting and occasionally hilariously unfair gameplay. Go on an exciting co-op adventure through the charming story campaign, or test your skills against friends and family, in the definitive battle of the living room. Be victorious or go out with a BAM!&amp;hellip; and have your revenge from beyond!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stikbold is the name of a playground/folk game of Scandinavian origin, often played during recess or as part of physical education. Like most folk games, Stikbold has a ton of variations and abbreviations, but is always a type of tag involving one or more balls. Stikbold! A Dodgeball Adventure is a very loose interpretation of the original playground version of Stikbold, mostly focused on maintaining the very basics and capturing the spirit of the playground version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
