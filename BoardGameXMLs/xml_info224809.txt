							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gomo Guide: Thoneport</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complete revamp of the previously released GOMO GUIDE TO THONEPORT. Reorganized, re-edited, new art from a new artist, available from DriveThruRPG in print and PDF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jorune is a world of many races. Thantier is a human based culture that resists influence or present of all the other races. The largest trading city is Thantis and one district of Thantis is open to 'thone'. Non-humans. Aliens. Mutants. The native Shantha. The genetically manipulated Iscin races. Thoneport is a hotbed of criminal, political, and social agendas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is intended as a sertting for beginners to the world of Jorune. Three commercial editions created a following of devoted Jorunis, and dozens of fan-created support materials have been released to the web. We have permission to begin a stream of reprints of the fan-materials and issue new publoications that are not part of the official Jorune mythos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Create your own Jorune for your gaming group. Start them off in a human land and give them a chance to encounter the races, the cultures, the mysteries of &amp;quot;Isho&amp;quot;, with 3,500 years of history to mine for new advantures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Return to Jorune. Leave your world behind - again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
