			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Persians have sacked Athens and the citizens look to their leaders to rebuild their city. As a demagogue of one of the ten tribes, it is your duty to increase both their power and your influence over them. The more powerful the people is, the more new citizens will come to Athens, but they will only come to the most influential demagogue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who first plays all of his or her citizens to Athens wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demokratia is played in rounds divided into five phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Rhetorics: Argue, negotiate and bribe for your cause.&lt;br/&gt;2) Ekklesia (Assembly): Play secret votes.&lt;br/&gt;3) Archon: Play citizens to the city of Athens OR to&lt;br/&gt;the Boule (Council) OR to a Monument/Rhetor.&lt;br/&gt;4) Phylai: Reveal votes and distribute new citizens.&lt;br/&gt;5) Ostracism: Play citizens to temporarily exile a demagogue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take turns to play their citizens to Athens. During each round, the power and the influence will rise and fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The colors of the cast votes and the erected buildings in Athens determine the tribe power, which in turn determine how many new citizens will come to Athens.&lt;br/&gt;     The citizens in the Boule determine the tribe influence, which in turn determine the share of the new citizens each player will get.&lt;br/&gt;     The players may also claim Monuments or Rhetors, each with a unique ability to influence the democratic game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win Demokratia, you must not only favor your own tribes but also maintain your influence over them so that no other player grow more influential and gets the power of your effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demokratia is a double majority game, where you must be the strongest in the strongest tribe. In addition, the ostracism mechanism is a double catch-up mechanism: the second player can spend a citizen to exile the first player, giving the third and the fourth player a chance to catch up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
