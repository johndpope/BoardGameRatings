			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time Wizards uses player-imposed rules called Doctrines, or honor codes. Before the game is played or characters are created, each player submits a Doctrine in clockwise order until everyone agrees to finish. Doctrines can be social (&amp;ldquo;no Monty Python references this game!&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;No looking at your cell phone while at the table!&amp;rdquo;) or game-related (&amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t make a half-pony half-orc half-elf catboy because that&amp;rsquo;s just wrong!&amp;rdquo;). Each proposed Doctrine can be challenged, and is then put before a vote. All Doctrines are subject to approval by the [Time Master], as are all punishments for violating one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version of the rules was published in October 2013, and despite the title is not the first edition of the rules.  It appears to be primarily based upon Time Wizards Barebones System, with various innovations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
