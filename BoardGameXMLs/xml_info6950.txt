							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cinderella Game</name>
									
			<description>In this children's game based on the popular fairytale and cartoon movie, players take turns spinning the game spinner, and move their playing pawns accordingly. The board tells the classic tale with words and pictures, and there are special pumpkin and slipper squares placed throughout the board. A player landing on one of these squares either moves back 6 squares for a pumpkin, or forward 7 squares for a slipper, and also takes a card representing that item(if that particular item has already been taken, a player either takes a rose card or takes another turn). The first player to reach the finish at end of the board or collect all three cards(rose, pumpkin and slipper) wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
