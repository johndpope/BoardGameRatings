			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play as young prince Dario and your goal is to restore your father's great empire that has been torn asunder by evil  Mordred, his dark general Kerberos and their minions. It is your courage and resourcefulness along with your companions' unswerving loyalty that will help you throughout your long journey. You must foil evil schemes, face perilous challenges and defeat ferocious barbarians before you can claim the throne and reinstate your empire's former glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fifth installment of this challenging video game somewhat moves players away from economic micromanagement, towards real time strategic warfare, so there is a great emphasis on building a multitude of military units starting early in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
