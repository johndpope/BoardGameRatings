							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Second World War at Sea: Transports</name>
									
			<description>From the Avalanche Press website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workhorses of the sea, the lowly transport made operations possible: hauling fuel and supplies for fleets and armies, bringing invasion forces to their beachheads, and carrying the trade that kept economies running. In Second World War at Sea games they&amp;rsquo;re fittingly anonymous, blue-gray pieces used by all nationalities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That changes with Transports: 280 &amp;ldquo;long&amp;rdquo; pieces, in American, Japanese, British, German, Italian, Dutch, Soviet and Norwegian colors &amp;ndash; both large and small models, each on a full-sized piece with the top-down drawings that brought you to Second World War at Sea in the first place. This is a great add-on for any Second World War at Sea fan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transports is sold exclusively via .pdf download. The playing pieces are not die-cut-and-mounted, nor are the scenario book or the ship data printed. Instead it comes as a series of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game's components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
