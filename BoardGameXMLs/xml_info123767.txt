			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Camelot Cosmos Players Guide is a role-playing setting book designed for use by players of the FATE role-playing system; though it can be easily converted to other systems if required. This book gives all the information players need to create characters and to explore the realms that make up the Camelot Cosmos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first section describes the rules system being used, and subsequent sections cover the places, personages and other key features of the setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A companion volume, the Camelot Cosmos Games Master&amp;rsquo;s Guide, goes into even greater detail and describes the setting secrets and game mechanics necessary to create adventures and run games focused on this unique setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book details the Camelot Cosmos, a section of space containing a collection of planets which have been very heavily influenced by the Arthurian legends of King Arthur, Merlin, Uther Pendragon, Lancelot and all the other characters familiar to us from the literature of Sir Thomas Mallory and the romances of the Middle Ages. These legends have, however, been confused with real people and events in the imagined history of the setting so that the understanding of the deeds of King Arthur held by a well-informed reader today may differ markedly from the legend as presented in these pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine a world where loyal knights of King Gawain XXIII fight an endless battle against the android soldiers of an undying Morgan le Fay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine a world where magical Doors transport spies and armies between distant planets in the blink of an eye and where thousands of humans from a lost technological civilisation sleep in cryogenic stasis deep beneath the surface of a green and pleasant land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine a future that sees our own time as a lost golden age, and that is slowly rebuilding human civilisation after its near extinction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine a world where monks pick through irradiated shopping centres for the secrets of the ancients, and where skill in the joust can decide a man&amp;rsquo;s social status.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine Arthurian knights in space, and you have some sense of what the Camelot Cosmos is intended to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Camelot Cosmos Players Guide offers a new roleplaying setting and a user-friendly version of the FATE RPG system. The Players Book contains everything you need to know in order to create characters and select from hundreds of options. The setting combines Arthurian and post-apocalyptic elements as players take sides in an epic conflict between the forces of King Gawain and the dreaded Queen Morgan le Fay. AI, combat cyborgs, and VR meet mages, knights and holy relics in a game that breaks all the old genre barriers.&lt;br/&gt;The Players Guide is packed with info including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A streamlined version of the FATE system. Quicker, deadlier, easier than other FATE versions.&lt;br/&gt;     13 described Realms in an extensive Gazetteer of the setting.&lt;br/&gt;     A Players version of the History of the setting.&lt;br/&gt;     Scores of new playable Races with unique characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;     Over 200 fully described Aspects and 100 Skills. &lt;br/&gt;     Simple character creation and combat rules ensure that you can be playing within 20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
