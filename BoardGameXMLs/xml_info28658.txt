							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The First Battle of Alamein: July 1st to 27th 1942</name>
									
			<description>When speaking of &amp;lsquo;The battle of Alamein&amp;rsquo; it is generally assumed that one is referring to the battle which finally saw Britain&amp;rsquo;s Eighth Army defeat Rommel&amp;rsquo;s much vaunted Panzerarmee Afrika in October/November 1942. However this was, in fact, the third battle fought at the Alamein position over a period of five months. The second battle, sometimes referred to as the &amp;lsquo;Battle of Alam Halfa&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Rommel&amp;rsquo;s last dash&amp;rsquo;, is seen as a necessary holding action which blunted the offensive capability of the Axis forces. The &amp;lsquo;First Battle of Alamein&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;July Battles&amp;rsquo; which concerns us presently has been given a comparatively negligent amount of historical attention; at times referenced as a hideously complex standstill or fatuously dismissed as insignificant. However, it was this battle which put a stop to Rommel&amp;rsquo;s gallop to Alexandria and began the change in Eighth Army&amp;rsquo;s fortunes that would eventually lead it to victory in November 1942.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game map is a simple reproduction of the battle field of El Alamein in North Africa, from the Mediterranean Sea in the North to the impassable Qattara Depression in the South.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Commonwealth player controls the units on the board which are Light Blue.&lt;br/&gt;German Units are represented in Grey, and Italian units are represented in Green.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
