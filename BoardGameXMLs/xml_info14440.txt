			<description>Marknadsspelet presents itself as &amp;quot;the modern finance game for the entire family&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are allotted 5.000.000 to start with. By getting production capacity and distribution channels for various goods and collecting interest on their money, the first player to amass 20.000.000 wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has a track to move around like Monopoly. Many of the squares are blank, but others have fixed events. There is also a stack of event cards. Players are allowed to buy and sell production capacity and distribution channels among themselves at any price they can negotiate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
