			<description>A game to make a long car journey a little easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player (hopefully not including the driver!) is given a 5 x 5 bingo card. The cards feature various things you might see out of the windows during the trip. If you see something, announce it to the other players (who can check that you aren't cheating), and then mark the item on your card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A long game could be all the 25 items on your card. But a shorter game should be that the winner is the first player to complete a line of items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Made by Gulf, the oil and petrol supplier, and mailed out in an envelope so no box needed. As the bingo cards need to be cut up into single cards, I would guess this is a pretty rare item to find in its complete, original shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
