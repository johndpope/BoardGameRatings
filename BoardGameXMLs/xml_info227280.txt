			<description>&amp;lsquo;Are You An ALiEN?&amp;rsquo;is a tactical question and answer card game, but don&amp;rsquo;t panic, it&amp;rsquo;s NOT a trivia quiz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The earth is being invaded by ALiENs!&lt;br/&gt;Not in a &amp;lsquo;Zap! Bang! Crash!&amp;rsquo; way, but slowly and silently&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;Unknown to most they are secretly replacing us with exact copies of the people we know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOW ANYONE COULD BE AN ALiEN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately, it has become apparent that the copies take time to fully assimilate our thoughts and memories.&lt;br/&gt;Following extensive background research and testimonies from family, friends and acquaintances the authorities have compiled a set of questions with verified responses designed to expose the galactic imposters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr Doombar, Mrs Mayhem, Lord Uppercrust, Professor Banana, Lady Toff, Mrs Ditch, Doctor Butt, Harry, Otto, Norma and many others are all under suspicion.&lt;br/&gt;Everyone will be asked one critical question - failure to respond with the established answer will reveal the ALiEN within!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lsquo;Are You An ALiEN?&amp;rsquo; is a card game for 2-6 players.&lt;br/&gt;The deck is made up of 180 cards. On each turn players have a simple choice;- draw a number of cards from the deck or select a card belonging to another player and ask them a question.&lt;br/&gt;As a human Subject suspected of being an ALiEN you must try to answer your question correctly.&lt;br/&gt;However, you will also assume the role of an interrogation Agent with the 'ALiEN Imposter Detection Unit'.&lt;br/&gt;In all, the cards feature over 300 different types of question and answer, after a quick look you will have to remember all the information on your drawn card(s) before placing them face-down in front of you. The more details you can remember the greater the chance of answering your question correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
