			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coyote is a story roleplaying game about immigrants being smuggled into a new nation of opportunity. This game deals with themes of prejudice and segregation, while shining a light on work ethics and cultural division. Though the game is designed to take place in an industrialized society, it also has flexibility for fantasy or science fiction settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Protocol game series uses vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles to tell a story. Each story explores disparate characters dealing with adversity and isolation in a dramatic fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coyote is a zero-prep game for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. Home requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This series presumes some understanding of GMless game protocol: &lt;br/&gt;scene-framing, shared authority, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
