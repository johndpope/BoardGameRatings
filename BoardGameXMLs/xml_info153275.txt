			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters have all somehow incurred a hefty debt to the Prince of Shadows, be it a literal debt or a figurative one. Whether it was for a good reason, bad reason, or just pure luck, the Prince isn't one to let something like that slide. The Prince wants the characters to put their skills and talents to work and they will do so, if they know what's good for them. The Prince doesn't have to be this generous, after all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dark Jester Tavern is located down a dark staircase in an otherwise unremarkable alley and if it weren't for the sign hanging outside it would likely be overlooked entirely. For the regulars there, the tavern is all the better for that. The people who do find their way into The Dark Jester find that despite its appearance as a complete dive it does in fact stock a good selection of drinks under the bar. Some of the best musicians, bards, and minstrels in the Dragon Empire have played the tavern when traveling through Shadow Port and aspiring musicians sometimes seek it out as a good luck token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is where the adventure begins...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
