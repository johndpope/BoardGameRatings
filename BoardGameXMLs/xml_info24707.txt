			<description>The goal of The Beautiful Game is to collect a full side of 11 players and make it to the World Cup final.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you progress in the game, your team will change.  Players may be booked on a red or yellow card.  Poor players may be sent to the bench until they improve.  Injuries?  You betcha!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many ways to gain or lose players.  Answering World Cup trivia, solving puzzles, and performing tasks are just some of the things you'll find yourself doing to improve your team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
