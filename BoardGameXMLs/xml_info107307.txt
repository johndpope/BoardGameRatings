			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was just another ordinary night in the life of Hurford Schlitzting...  until his room, and himself inside it, was hijacked by an alien ship!  Now Hurford has to figure out why they want him and just what is going on in this bizarre alien world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Out of Order, Hungry Software has used their free-to-use SLUDGE system to create an adventure game in the style of well-known classics like Monkey Island and Full Throttle.  Combining a stylized sci-fi environment with a goofy sense of humor, Out of Order presents a challenging and interesting game that should please any fan of old-school adventure games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
