							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Marvel Trivia Game</name>
									
			<description>The Marvel Trivia Game comes with 200 trivia cards, each with five questions relating to Marvel Comics' various superheroes.  The questions are assigned to five categories, although these categories (Strength, Ultimate Intelligence, Power, Energy Control, and Resistance) are not clearly defined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also comes with 24 &amp;quot;Super Tokens,&amp;quot; small chits with one of the categories printed on it.  Each turn, the player draws one of these &amp;quot;Super Tokens&amp;quot; to determine which question they will answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scores are recorded on a special scoring sheet with five scoring tracks for each player, one for each category.  If a player correctly answers a question, he gets two points on the scoring track for that category.  If a player incorrectly answers a question, all of his opponents score one point on the scoring track for that category.  The winner of the game is the first player to score five points in all of the five categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
