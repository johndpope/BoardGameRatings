							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TriYang</name>
									
			<description>The game consists of triangular tiles on which each corner is colored. There are five basic colors, plus orange as a joker color. In his/her turn, a player places a new triangle to the game area, trying to form color areas that are as large as possible. Interestingly, a triangle cannot only placed with full contact to another triangle, but also with half contact, so the game area can take a rather unusual shape. For each color area that a player adds to, a point is scored for each corner involved (including orange corners). The goal is to score the highest number of points this way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
