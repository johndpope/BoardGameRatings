							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dice Brewing: Upgrade Kit</name>
									
			<description>If you have first edition of Dice Brewing and you don't want to buy second edition of this game, but still you are interested in changes and new components, we have a special set of elements for you.&lt;br/&gt;We have decided to prepare a Dice Brewing: Upgrade kit, where you can find 4 new player boards (bigger ones and with new rule about getting the blue die) and 3 sets of tokens. All new materials are high quality, well made (with exacly the same materials as basic, second edition of Dice Brewing) and of course they are an effect of players comments for the first edition of Dice Brewing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
