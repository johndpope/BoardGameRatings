			<description>Just Get Through is a randomly generated platformer featuring upgrades, explosions, traps, walljumping and much more. You play as a dude trapped somewhere in jungle-like environment. You try to escape but there is no exit - only those portals. And everytime you jump through one of them, you just land in another jungle-like dungeon with even more traps. Maybe, maybe someday you will get teleported home, away from all those deadly traps and this bad weather. Maybe...but probably not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the randomly generated dungeons there is also a powerful sandbox mode where you can build your own levels or where you can just have fun. You can save your custom level and publish it to the cloud. So there are not only randomly generated levels but also user-generated ones to explore.*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Consistent Style&lt;br/&gt;- Beautiful particles and effects&lt;br/&gt;- Achievements&lt;br/&gt;- Sandbox Mode&lt;br/&gt;- Save and Play Custom Levels !&lt;br/&gt;- Unlockable Colorpalettes&lt;br/&gt;- Throwable TNT to destroy walls or traps&lt;br/&gt;- Online Highscore&lt;br/&gt;- Gamepad Support&lt;br/&gt;- Endless fun in different randomly generated levels&lt;br/&gt;- Upgrades&lt;br/&gt;- Destructible Environment&lt;br/&gt;- Permadeath&lt;br/&gt;- and much more&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use your TNT and your Skill to get as far as you can. Avoid traps, explosions and other deadly dangers. Have fun and don't give up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
