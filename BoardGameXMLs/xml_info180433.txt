							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chi Warrior</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of stories and fables alike, all history remembers the acts of a true hero. Adventurers at heart, a chi warrior is rarely found idle, instead going out to leave their mark on the world in whatever way they can. There are those who love challenging the impossible, slaying dragons and demons alike while bringing back exotic trophies of their slaughtered foes. Others work to overthrow oppression, rarely abiding a tyrant in their lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most chi warriors feel right at home with barbarians and rogues, finding a great deal in common through their travels. A bard and a chi warrior can have a friendship that is as legendary as their accomplishments, each complimenting the other. Chi warriors are often at odds with monks and lawful divine characters, their rigid codes rub the more free spirited chi warrior the wrong way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chi warriors generally pay little attention to the gods, seeing them more as inspiring idols than objects of veneration. Terrestrial affairs concern them far more, chi warriors sometimes keep a journal to chronicle honorable opponents and glory won in battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vain and prideful, chi warriors can be reckless in battle, proving a touch too wild for allies. But rarely will they go as far as to put their comrades in danger, preferring to face the most dangerous challenges themselves. Drawn to trouble like moths to a flame, chi warriors are rarely wanting for combat, finding the experience invigorating as they use their opponent as a canvas for their artistic expression. As long as chi warriors can walk, they can fight, often pushing the body to the breaking point and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chi Warrior is a new full-BAB base class for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
