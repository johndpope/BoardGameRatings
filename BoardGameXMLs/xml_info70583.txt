			<description>&amp;quot;Slaves to Armok: God of Blood Chapter II: Dwarf Fortress (Dwarf Fortress for short) is a freeware  computer game by Bay 12 Games for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X  set in a high fantasy universe that combines aspects of roguelike  and city-building games. The title of the game is inspired by its primary focus on the construction, management, and exploration of dwarven fortresses within the game world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game offers two play modes: &amp;quot;Dwarf Fortress&amp;quot; mode, in which the player builds a dwarven settlement, and &amp;quot;Adventurer&amp;quot; mode, in which the player controls a single character in a generally roguelike manner. Only one mode at a time can be actively played in a given game world, although adventurers can visit abandoned or demolished fortresses built in prior games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game difficulty is variable, but its slant towards difficulty is reflected in the game's motto, &amp;quot;Losing is Fun&amp;quot;. The first few attempts for newer players can often end in disaster. However, as time progresses, and the user's fortress grows, the game presents fewer late-game challenges.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dwarf_Fortress,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
