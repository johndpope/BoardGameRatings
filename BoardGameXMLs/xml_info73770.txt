							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cat &amp; Mouseoid</name>
									
			<description>In the near future, the luxury home will come complete with a C.A.T. (Computer Aided Tabby). These little metal friends roam the house picking up dropped objects and returning them to a control spot.&lt;br/&gt;The C.A.T. though is not alone in vying for the affections of it&amp;rsquo;s masters, there are Mouseoids present. They want nothing more than to show the C.A.T. to be an inferior model by beating it at it&amp;rsquo;s own game.&lt;br/&gt;Things can get pretty heated in this struggle for dominance, and it&amp;rsquo;s not unheard of for a C.A.T. or Mouseoid to upgrade it&amp;rsquo;s technology to laser guns or rocket launcher's to be numero uno.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 2 - 4 players (4 being best) racing around a board depicting the future home as either the C.A.T. or Mouseoid. Players race to active portals which will upgrade weaponry, give better wheel systems and also locate precious objects that will win them the game as they are returned to the master room.&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 ways to win the game:&lt;br/&gt;Return 6 objects to the master room...or&lt;br/&gt;Disable your opponents with miniguns, lasers, rockets or whatever you find along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
