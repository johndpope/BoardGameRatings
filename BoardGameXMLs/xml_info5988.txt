							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wings Over France</name>
									
			<description>Wings Over France is a solitaire WWI wargame, simulating the day-to-day operations of a RFC Squadron during the month of April 1917, known as &amp;quot;Bloody April&amp;quot; because of the heavy losses suffered by the allied air force. The game puts the player in control of 1 to 3 RFC Flights based in Arras, France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to sweep the skies clear of Huns in support of the Arras ground offensive, but just surviving would be an achievement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each squadron has to undertake a number of missions each day (determined randomly), but with limited resources and personnel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The various missions include rece's, bombing raids, destroying enemy balloons etc - but all will involve dogfights with enemy aircraft - with the game easily capable of handling over 20 aircraft fighting in the skies simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
