							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lucky Race Game</name>
									
			<description>A horseracing themed game in which the first player to successfully avoid the obstacles and reach the finish space wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published by Bennet of Birmingham, England, who registered the design in 1919. The folding gameboard was made of sheet metal. A metal container accompanying the board served both as a container for the pieces and as a dice cup. According to the Great Board Games book, it is not known whether the game was packaged in a box or a slip-case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
