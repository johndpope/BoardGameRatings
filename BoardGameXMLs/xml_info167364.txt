			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE MOST FANTASTIC WOMAN TO HAVE EVER LIVED!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantomah, the mystery woman of the jungle, possesses vast supernatural powers that she uses to protect animals and people from evil. Those who enter her realm intent on doing harm will suffer punishments beyond their worst nightmares!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantomah first appeared in the pages of Jungle Comics #2 (Fiction House, 1940) and most comics historians identify her as the first female superhero. Over the course of 49 issues, the character went through three distinct stages that were so different from each other that it was almost as if three different characters were presented under the same name. In The Three Lives of Fantomah, NUELOW Games presents highlights from this often over-looked piece of comics history, together with roleplaying game material inspired by it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Three Lives of Fantomah: Book One presents a sampling of the bizarre comics of writer/artist Fletcher Hanks, together with a new OGL d20 System prestige class, feats and more. The rules are designed to capture the vast and fluid power of Fantomah, as well as anticipate the changes the character went through as the series evolved. Unlike most comic book characters, Fantomah got less powerful as time went by, something that led to some interesting and unusual game mechanics from Steve Miller (best known for contributions to the Ravenloft setting and several editions of Star Wars roleplaying games).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
