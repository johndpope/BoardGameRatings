			<description>designer's comments:&lt;br/&gt;To use this document you will need the Savage Worlds rules as well as a copy of Skyrealms of Jorune. My primary source for this conversion has been the Third Edition, but it should be just as useable if you have the Second Edition rules (now out of print). In order to cut down on the wordiness of this document, I have assumed that the reader is familiar with many of the Joruni terms from the setting and have not attempted to explain them. In converting this setting I have tried to follow the Savage Worlds philosophy of &amp;ldquo;convert the setting, not the rules.&amp;rdquo; I have no doubt that this conversion will not be Joruni enough for some, and not Savage enough for others, but I hope it will be a start for those who want to explore the world of Jorune through the Savage Worlds system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
