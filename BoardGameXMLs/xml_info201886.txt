			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Bamsers Mod, a short free-form about a boy Anders who is about to die, and his teddy bears which no longer are able to protect him from his nightmare.  The scenario takes place in our world, but in our world where children's fantasies are real.  Childhood fantasy creatures and teddy bears are alive, and they are brave warriors who fight with children's nightmares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At some point we grow up, though, and have more faith in our nightmares, uncertainties, and weaknesses, than in our dreams and our teddy bears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was presented for international play at Fastaval 2013.  The game document is available only in Danish, though the game handouts are available in Danish (included in the game document) and English (as a separate document).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
