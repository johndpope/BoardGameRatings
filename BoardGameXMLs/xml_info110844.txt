			<description>The tree liana made up from two trunks and one cross-bar is set up and each player receives six animals: elephant, zebra, giraffe, monkey, crocodile and snake. Then in turn you use the symbol die: Depending on the symbol you must put one of your animals onto the bar or another animal, miss a turn, place an animal in a certain way, swap an animal with another player, or place an animal chosen by your neighbor. You first place animals underneath each other till the row nearly touches the surface, this must not be touched! Then you place animals anywhere in the chain and may use only one hand. You always have only one try to hand an animal, when the animal drops off you take it back.  When more animals drop you need only take two of them, the others go out of the game. When you could place all your animals you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
