			<description>A card game based on the table snooker ball game.  Each player starts with seven card(ball)s.  The top cardball from the deck is turned over and becomes the 'option cardball'.  A player then takes either the option cardball or the top card from the deck and then places a card on top of the option cardball.  A player may then make a break.  A minimum break consists of a white cardball, a red cardball and a colored card ball (following the rules of snooker).  As the red cards are played they are placed in the pockets in the snookard box.  Later the colored balls will also be played into these pockets.  A player replenishes back to seven cards.  A scoreboard is also provided.  The winner of the frame is the player with the highest number of points when the final black is potted.  There are also special cards: miscue, snooker, foul, safety shot and free ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
