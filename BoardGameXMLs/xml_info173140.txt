Investigating further, they uncover a village under a bane's tyranical rule. Clearly the two are connected, but how? They must uncover the root of the problem and defeat  the Witches' servants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grove Point is a 1-Sheet style scenario that focuses on the adventures of a band of Witchmarked heroes in the Accursed game setting.
