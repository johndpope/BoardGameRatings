			<description>The board game Diplomacy was originally designed by Allan B. Calhamer and released in 1959. It is set just prior to World War I, and focuses on inter-player communication and guile over dice or other random chance elements. It was one of the first games published to be playable over mail, and consequently one of the first to be playable over email as well. It is reportedly among the favorite games of John F. Kennedy and Henry Kissinger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several web-based versions of the game available, and Backstabbr is designed to bring some modern sensibilities and functionality to that space. It is purely a product of passion, made by players who enjoyed the game and wanted to spread it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We strongly encourage everyone who enjoys the Backstabbr experience to own a copy of the board game. Although our site enables you to play with friends and strangers from around the world, we believe there are few experiences in life more fun than sitting around a table with friends over a good game...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Note&lt;br/&gt;Backstabbr was formally found at PlayDiplomacyOnline.com in 2010 and was changed to Backstabbr in 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
