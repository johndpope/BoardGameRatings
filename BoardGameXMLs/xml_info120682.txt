			<description>From publisher's website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the years leading up to 1917 the ground conflict of the Great War was proving costly to both sides, and the battles fought in the air were equally as intense as technological advances and better tactics were developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The air war reached its peak between 1917 and 1918 as aircraft became fast, highly manoeuvrable machines; each pilot determined to attain a superior position for the fleeting seconds in which a target might pass through a gun sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Richthofen's Flying Circus, written by Owen Branham, is a detailed rules set that allows players to recreate this fast-paced aerial combat with one or more miniature aircraft. Each game turn represents a snapshot of the action as the machines move across the aerial battlefield and fire upon their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This full-colour, 80-page soft back rulebook contains rules for playing aerial combat games with 1/72 scale model aircraft, and can also be used with 1/144 to 1/32 scale models. Scenarios are provided for such missions as Dogfights, Balloon Bursting and Bombing, as well as rules for playing both narrative campaigns or 'top gun'-style leagues. Also included is a technical gallery and aircraft background information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
