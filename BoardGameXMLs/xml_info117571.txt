			<description>Time to play Cookie Monster! In Kookiz, players want to grab as many different types of cookies as possible, preferably big stacks of cookies to keep them out of the hands of other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck in Kookiz consists of 80 cards, with eight cards of ten types of cookies. Before starting the game, shuffle the cards, deal each player a hand of four cookies, place four(if there are 2 or 4 players) or five(if there are 3 or 5 players) cookies in the center of the table, then deal out the other cards evenly to form face-down draw stacks for each player. This is a real-time game, there are no player turns. Everyone plays simultaneously at the same time (as fast as they can :D ), and performs one of the following actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    You can place two or more cookies of the SAME type in a face-up stack in front of you.&lt;br/&gt;    You can play a single cookie from your hand on top of a card in the center of the table, then place that stack before you. You can only take this action if you are holding ONE copy of the card.&lt;br/&gt;    You can play a single cookie from your hand on top of another player's stack to claim that stack and place it before you. You can only take this action if you are holding ONE copy of the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After any action, refill your hand to four cookies, drawing from your own face-down stack. The round ends when a player has played all of her cards; this player scores three bonus points for ending the round. Everyone else scores one point for each type of cookie they have before them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest score after five rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
