			<description>The Deck of Change is a deck of 64-cards with 8 numbers and 8 symbols. It is an open game system designed primarily for fun. It is versatile, multipurpose, and mathematically satisfying to play around with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cards might just bring out the most fun you can ever have with your  family, friends, and even strangers. Kids from age 7 to 107 can enjoy the different games for 1 to 16 players. The deck has 64 cards, 8 numbers (0-7), and 8 symbols (yin, energy, force, space, matter, entropy, time, yang).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 versions of the deck. They are practically the same deck. The main difference is in the visuals. Deck #1: The AiTiA is designed for functionality. Deck #2: The Gauntlet is designed for imagination featuring artwork by Patrick Enrique. And, Deck #3: The Cauldron has bigger cards designed for creativity and brainstorming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
