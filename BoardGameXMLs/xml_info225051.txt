							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Assassin&#039;s Guild</name>
									
			<description>A push your luck your luck card game where players compete to eliminate marks and collect bounties set by the Assassin's Guild.&lt;br/&gt;The player with the biggest pile of gold at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a set of quick rounds, mark cards go up on the Guild notice board each with a variable bounty depending on which method is used to dispose of the target. Players have 4 cards representing different kill methods and 3 attempts per round to eliminate the marks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assassins play their attempt face down so everyone knows who your going for but not how. Using a gun is quicker but is worth little, while arranging an accident pays much better, but takes more time. The quickest assassin to get to a mark wins the bounty. Should two assassins use the same method however thing get awkward and neither gets the kill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players also compete to complete several missions laid out by the guild so that they an become assassin of the month and have the power to tip off the fuzz to harass their rivals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
