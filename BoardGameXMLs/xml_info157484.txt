							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stamps: Postzegelverzamelspel</name>
									
			<description>Object of the game is to complete a collection of postage stamps. A collection is complete when you have 8 stamps (cards) with at least 3 of the same characteristics (such as stamped, large format, issued before 1945, coming from The Netherlands, etc.). In their turn, players throw a dice and move their pawn across the board in any direction. On the board are locations where you can get stamps or lose them. This can be done by exchanging with other players or on the market, by buying, selling or taking a chance card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
