							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">John Drake Secret Agent Game</name>
									
			<description>John Drake Secret Agent is based on the television show Danger Man from the 1960's starring Patrick McGoohan. The series  would debut in Great Britain in October 1964 and would eventually find its way to the United States. In America the series was renamed Secret Agent in hopes of capitalizing on the growing spy craze. It was also given a new theme song, &amp;quot;Secret Agent Man,&amp;quot; sang by Johnny Rivers. The game itself is a chase game where your secret agent tries to be first to catch the bad guys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
