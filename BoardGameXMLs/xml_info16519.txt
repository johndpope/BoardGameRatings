			<description>The goal of Energie 21 - Mit Energie in die Zukunft (Energy 21 - With Energy into the Future) is to produce as much energy as possible from renewable resources. Each player starts with a county that produces energy from coal, oil and nuclear plants including complete with factories, office buildings, residential areas and stores. All of these consume energy that has to be supplied. In the game it is not only important to plan and build carefully, but also work together with other players to realize large projects more effective through cooperation. Players can trade and haggle with power plants, victory points or leftover energy, but beware of the environmental assessment.&lt;br/&gt;The game was designed for a German government agency to raise awareness of renewable energy planning on a communal level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
