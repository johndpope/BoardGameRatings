							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Elven Union Pitch</name>
									
			<description>A double-sided card Blood Bowl pitch, complete with matching dug-outs, this is the perfect place for your Elven Union teams to play. One side features a perfectly manicured grass pitch with an Elven Union symbol delicately mown into the centre, the other is a frozen field entirely covered in ice by the swirling winds of magic. The dug-outs are themed to match, with opulent marble boxes and gems everywhere &amp;ndash; they feature score trackers, reserves, Knocked Out and Serious Injury boxes, Down trackers for both halves, and a re-roll tracker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pitch is made to the same specifications as the board included with the Blood Bowl boxed game, and includes rules for playing on a frozen pitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
