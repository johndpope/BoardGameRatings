							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">UNIVERSAL: Epic Fantasy</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Epic Fantasy: Lord of the Rings, Dragonlance, and Future&amp;rsquo;s End: Past&amp;rsquo;s Beginning. These are but a few of the classic titles that epitomize the Genre of Epic Fantasy. Epic Fantasy consists of the following commonalities: medieval technical development, antediluvian setting when the Earth was full of Elves, Dwarves, Goblins and Dragons, good and powerful Wizards wielding spells, evil Sorcerers embrace by darkness that are determined to rule the world, and epic battles. Epic Fantasy usually builds on a single plot line. Each adventure adds to the conclusion of a great goal: to stop the forces of darkness from controlling the world.   Heroes start off inexperienced and often young. As they continue to fight for the salvation of the world, often under the direction of an immensely powerful and good Wizard, they grow in character, in toughness and in morality. The final end of a campaign is the bloodiest of all of their battles with the entire planet as the prize. Fire balls, Elfish arrows, Dwarfish Axes and magical swords from both sides create an orchestra of destruction as pure good and pure evil meet to ultimately decide the fate of mankind, elfkind, dwarfkind and Magic itself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
