			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Machine: Overdrive is an epic role-playing game where players adventure in the near future during a time of great struggle. Mighty Corporations war against the genetically engineered Tribe. The towers of steel Cells, an expanse of Raft Cities and the under-sea colonies are the backdrop of these battles. Armored mecha walk into battle and nukes fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vast Arcology Cells  of the American and Asian continents rise above the landscape as the buzz of flight commuter traffic and notorious hover-bike gangs fill the air. These mega-cities are home to humans, sentient robots and the uplifted species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Australian Archipelagian and Hawaiian Raft Cities are a sprawl of simple fishing communities, floating cities and corporate naval power. The Ottorn species holds much sway here as these seal risen sentients are master of all above and all below the surface of Pacifica. The Oceanic Corporation undercarrier is also a powerful force in these waters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Japan and the neighboring water is now known as Pacifica. The Pacifica colony along the Marianas Trench is the greatest of all undersea colonies, a massive ocean-floor country built around the Naga Geo-thermal Power complex. The Tribe has been worked to the point of no return and these Cat, Seal, Aguan and Ratta people are rising against the Cross Corporation  Pacifican Lords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Matrix connects all in this future Earth as the wire of communication and avatar society. The Netscape is now both a work zone, a playground and a field of battle. Some say Net born avatar A.I. has been discovered. These Cyberneticals are the first true artificial life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the adventure of Machine: Overdrive some will rise and many will fall...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
