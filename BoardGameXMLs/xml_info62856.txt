							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mecanisburgo: Expansion 1 – Moon and Ceres</name>
									
			<description>As the war intensifies the corporations are looking beyond our planet to gather allies and resources for their plans for domination.  Their most obvious targets are the Moon and Ceres, where recently found Golden Cavorita deposits of extraordinary quality have created the &amp;quot;Cavor Fever&amp;quot; in entrepreneurs and executives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion adds two planetary boards and new markers to the game.  Players can now explore the Moon and Ceres by sending agents using two government spaciobuses to travel there.  The Moon includes 3 locations to visit and control.  Ceres includes 1 new location to control.  Also agents can become Directors or Consuls for several locations which give political benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion also includes markers for Golden Cavorita and Victory Points that are awarded for control of several of the locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
