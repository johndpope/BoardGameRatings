							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Experimental Technical Readout: Kurita</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kuritan Finesse&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battered by the Jihad, but never broken, House Kurita&amp;rsquo;s Draconis Combine is crawling from the ashes of devastation. The Black Pearl lies in ruins, taking with it many of the Draconis Combine&amp;rsquo;s greatest innovations. But as the Dragon fights on, research and development teams across the realm have scrambled to recover the technological edge that helped House Kurita keep the Clans at bay for so long. In factories and test sites deep within their borders, they have developed powerful new secret weapons in the war against the Word of Blake&amp;mdash;or anyone else who would bring the Combine low.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental Technical Readout: Kurita samples the custom and prototype designs that have begun to turn up in testing labs and top-secret proving grounds of the Draconis Combine. Each design featured in this book incorporates some of the latest technologies developed by the realms of the Inner Sphere as the war against the Word of Blake continues. These technologies&amp;mdash;first described in Tactical Operations&amp;mdash;have yet to achieve widespread production, but each has been prototyped and rushed to the field for their desperate consumers. Statistics and Record Sheets are included for 13 new experimental BattleMechs, vehicles, aerospace units, and battle armor designs presented in this book, ready for play in advanced BattleTech games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
