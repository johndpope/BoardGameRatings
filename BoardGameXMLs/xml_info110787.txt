			<description>&amp;quot;Gamer Geeks, this game is going to rip you a new one, in a good way!&amp;quot; - Father Geek&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Overall, this game is just phenomenal. It brings a fresh type to the table top and hours of replayability. I cannot wait to be playing the finished product in my living room.&amp;quot; - Demo Player Richard Nava&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I'm not a game player in general and I was surprised how much I got into (Specimen), playing the first time. I was PISSED when my flamethrower was going to be used against me. PISSED. And I was thrilled for the player next to me when she went for a move that was balls out ballsy&amp;hellip;these guys are the real deal&amp;hellip;FUN STUFF, FOLKS!&amp;quot; - Demo Player Rebecca L&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SPECIMEN is a two-player card-driven board game that pits a group of human astronauts against a predatory extraterrestrial life form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn comprises four action rounds, where each player can perform one of several possible game actions. The Monster's movements are hidden from the Crew player behind a game screen, and the Monster's location is only revealed when the Monster attacks...or if the crew is lucky (or unlucky) enough to find it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of play, a mysterious specimen in the cargo hold has been let loose as a result of the damage caused by a meteor collision. This SPECIMEN is in an embryonic stage and evolves throughout the game, becoming more difficult to kill as the turns progress. In addition to attempting to kill the crew, the monster can also destroy sections of the ship, forcing the human players to divide their efforts between defense and structural repair. The monster can win the game by either killing all seven members of the crew or damaging enough sections of the ship that it breaks apart. Adding the destruction of the ship as an alternate victory condition allows for varied strategies on the part of both players. The human player can use tools to effect repairs, construct weapons and trackers to hunt down the monster&amp;hellip;or ultimately blow up the ship if all seems lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SPECIMEN player constructs his/her monster from a selection of 25 different attributes (offensive, defensive, or special abilities), providing new and different threats to the human player each game. This constantly changing monster, combined with 90 event cards driving game play, allows for infinite replayability. No two games should ever be the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
