In modern games this is made even tougher because there is no accepted baseline (as there is in fantasy). One group might be seeking things &amp;quot;man was not meant to know&amp;quot; while the other searches for terrorists in the mountains of Afghanistan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abducted, an adventure scenario for Modern d20, attempts to wrestle with this problem by presenting a problem: the abduction of a little girl.
