			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;No need to Justify. No need to Explain. We are as we are. Such is Becoming.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Empyrean lies in ruins. Covered by the devouring fog of Aether, it is only a matter of time before the world dies without the sustaining power of Grand Cornerstone. As an Eidolon - an immortal force of nature - your path is clear. Find the lost fragments of Grand Cornerstone and rebuild the world according to your own design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mystic Empyrean is a roleplaying game of social character development, creation, and puzzle solving. Players must work together to rebuild the world from a few tattered remains, and then explore their own creations in order to find more pieces of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters, Eidolons, are beings of immense power, granted a body of pure life energy and formed by the desires and designs of their hearts. Eidolons develop new powers based upon their personalities. To be consumed by greed will give an Eidolon the power to create gold with a touch. To be fearful and furtive will grant the power to dissolve into shadow. Traits develop based upon how characters are role-played, rather than the assignment of experience or gaining of levels. This means that Eidolons will gain powers that reflect their actions and desires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Empyrean, the game builds itself as you play. No GM is responsible for creating encounters in advance of the game. Instead, players use the tools presented in the game guide, as well as their own imaginations, to create an adventure that is wholly unique for every group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This preview contains everything you need to play a short game of Mystic Empyrean. You will get to see characters evolve and develop new powers based upon your roleplaying, as well as use the encounter seeds in the included guide to grow your own adventure organically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The preview game requires only 10-sided dice to play. To use the Balance, Mystic Empyrean's unique resolution system, check out &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.mysticempyrean.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.mysticempyrean.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
