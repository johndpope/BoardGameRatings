			<description>Anno Domini 1213. This is a time of the greatest economical boom since the fall of the  Roman Empire. Townsfolk, merchants and craftsmen from the whole Europe migrate to Silesia, their promised land. In the next 100 years near 100 cities will be founded and almost every city is located on the Magdeburg Law. That means each city is built in the same way. Market square is a heart of the city with the most important municipal buildings around it. Along the streets, running from the market to the city gates, merchants and craftsmen have their houses, shops and workshops. To stay above water in hard medieval economy they gather together in  guilds. Cities always need security, which is granted by the band of strong walls with defense towers. Behind them citizens and newcomers can feel safe protected by the city guard.&lt;br/&gt;In Staadt,  2 to 4 players take the role of medieval city builders in Silesia. Prince Kazimierz and bishop Wawrzyniec gives you a mission of great importance &amp;ndash; to build the gratest and the wealthiest city in Silesia in just 4 years. The one who will develop his district better and quicker than his opponents will receive the golden chain of Major of the City and the eternal favour of the Prince. &lt;br/&gt;Amen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     3D game experience&lt;br/&gt;     Realistic economy model&lt;br/&gt;     Wooden box/board&lt;br/&gt;     Great replayability&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;English book of rules under construction!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
