							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Negamco Pro Golf Game</name>
									
			<description>a 1962 Golf game with 25 individually rated golfers of the time by Nemadji Game Company of Duquette Minnesota. There are several charts (Tee-off, Fairway, Off-Green) that you (representing the golfer) use to move your golf ball (marked by a Tee) down the 9-hole course. The individual player cards are only used once you are on the green. There is a spinner in the bottom of the box where you get a result of 1 to 25 and look up a result on a chart or on the player card. &lt;br/&gt;Some of the golfers included: 1942 Byron Nelson, 1937 Byron Nelson, 49 Sam Snead, 54 Snead, 53 Ben Hogan, 51 Hogan, 35 Gene Sarazen. I think this was a set of All-stars and might have been an extra option. There is also a set of 1962 golfers: Weiskopf, Crampton, Dent, Wadkins, Watson, Player, Floyd, Nicklaus, Trevino and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
