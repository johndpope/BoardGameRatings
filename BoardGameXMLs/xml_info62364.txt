			<description>This game is played with a standard deck of cards without the Tens. Some counters are also needed, a full set of Reversis equipment cotains 36 units called fish, 24 counters worth 6 fish each, and 6 &amp;quot;contracts&amp;quot; worth 8 counters each, making a total equivalent to 468 fish. The main object is to avoid taking tricks containing penalty cards. The winner of the round is who gets the least penalty points. That player (normally) gets the talon, but there are payments during the game as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
