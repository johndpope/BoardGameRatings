							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deadly Delves 1: Fane of the Undying Sleeper</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protected by the roiling waters of the ocean, the Fane of the Undying Sleeper lies at the top of a set of stone steps only exposed at the lowest ebb of the lowest spring tides. Protected by impregnable stone doors, the fane has lain undisturbed for centuries. Once the lair of a heretical and degenerate demon-worshipping cult the benighted, profane place has never known the tread of human feet. None have yet penetrated the fane, but nevertheless wild and outlandish rumours speak of terrible dangers and glittering treasures to be found beyond the impregnable doors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a tide low enough to reveal the fane&amp;rsquo;s entrance fast approaching, are the PCs brave enough to dare the terrors of the Fane of the Undying Sleeper?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Deadly Delve for 3rd-level characters by Creighton Broadhurst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deadly Delves are short, self-contained richly detailed adventures. Designed specifically to be both easy to insert into almost any GM&amp;rsquo;s home campaign and to be completed in one session, Deadly Delves include everything you need for a great dungeon bash. Each Deadly Delve features a new layout designed expressly to make the GM&amp;rsquo;s job as easy as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a Dual Format PDF. The downloadable ZIP file contains two versions, one optimised for printing and use on a normal computer and one optimised for use on a mobile device such as an iPad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
