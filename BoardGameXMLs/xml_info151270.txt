							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Divvy: The Pirate Loot Game</name>
									
			<description>Being a pirate is dangerous, filled with adventure and wonders to be seen. However all of that is not why we do what we do. We do it for the loot, the gold gems that sparkle and drive us insane. All the bloodthirsty pillaging, all the cannon fire, it's all to get the loot. Once the voyage is over, it's what we wait for, the Divvying of the loot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Divvy, you take the role of pirates on a voyage. Each round is a voyage to obtain loot for the crew. On your turn, you pick a mission for the crew to go on, and attempt to complete the mission. Completed missions give you infamy among the crew and places money through the hold of the ship. At the end of the voyage pirates take their share of the loot, and voyage once more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first pirate to have enough gold to retire from the violent lifestyle wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
