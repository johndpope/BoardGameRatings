			<description>At some time in the future, garbage collection and processing will become completely automated. Small earthmoving robots will work in garbage dumps, all connected via wifi. The robots will be designed to modify their own programming, eventually becoming the most efficient and effective machines on the planet.&lt;br/&gt;For about three weeks, then things will start to get weird.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RoboTrash is a game about picking up garbage. To do that you'll have to make the best of random events, make a strategy, then deal with people messing it up. This is the new version of and old game, Recycler. The graphics have been changed to be a little less ink-heavy and the playing pieces and board are larger and easier to assemble. The rules have also changed to take care of issues that have come up in play testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
