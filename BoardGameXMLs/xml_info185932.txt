			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a full-color, 32 inch by 30 inch, floor plan of a SciFi Crew Quarters, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Zip File includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play) and a 360 degree view of the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;If this experiment works we should be able to view a lifeform from another world for study without any dangers to our scientists and students.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Research Biophysicist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SciFi Research Lab is a large interior map of a one floor futuristic research lab suitable for military, corporate, or educational purposes (i.e. a military or corporate research &amp;amp; development lab or a high tech university laboratory). This product includes a 360-degree panoramic view from the north side of the center of the lab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SciFi Research Lab is intended for use in near or far-future science fiction. This could also be a secret high tech facility in a modern game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intensive Study: Biophysicists at a research &amp;amp; development lab have developed something they call the Tinted Window. This technology allows them to witness other worlds and dimensions for study without leaving the safety of the lab. This window views the subject and allows for observations to be made about the alien flora or fauna being studied without the subject being aware of being observed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initial tests were made with life indigenous to the planet. This kind of data could be obtained with a time delay via satellites. However the device could be used to observe the same information except in real time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studying alien worlds followed with similar positive results as the scientists studied planets throughout the galaxy. One effect that was seen was that the view became increasingly hazy the more light years away the targeted planet was from their world. Like viewing from a real world window, the farther the subject was in distance, the harder it became to discern details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the biophysicists have set their sights on viewing another dimension. The initial tests have seen strange results compared to the other tests. The view seen is nearly opaque with the only movement seen as grey clouds moving in almost utter darkness. The scientists theorize this may be due to distance between dimensions being greater than anything in our universe. But something has been observing the scientists back. The next time the scientists open the window to look at the dimension, a thick grey mist diffuses through a gateway and starts killing the scientists by asphyxiating them. Security protocols are triggered and the group as military or corporate security is sent inside to deal with this bizarre gaseous monster from another realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternatively, the entire building is soon filled with gas as the grey mist diffuses throughout and then starts pouring out into the surrounding town through gaps in doorways or open windows. The group may be inside the town as this mist roils through and suffocates those who try to breathe inside the mist. The group needs to escape or find a way to survive traversing through the mist to stop it at its source.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
