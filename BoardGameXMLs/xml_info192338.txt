							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadows in Focus: City by Shadow - San Francisco Metroplex</name>
									
			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Lights Go Down&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Money? Check. Political turmoil leading to scrambling for power? You bet. Megacorps jockeying for position while working to take their rivals down a notch? Of course! A festering hive of corruption set next to one of the most scenic bays ever colonized by humans? Absolutely! San Francisco has all of the ingredients needed to make a nice, festering stew for shadowrunners. With the former imperialistic fascist General Saito out of power and the entire bay area united as a single sprawl, there is power and money to be had, which means business in the shadows is booming. San Francisco is a shadowrunner&amp;rsquo;s guide to the people, places, and plots that make up this city, providing the paydata they need to navigate the hilly streets and cruel back roads of a sprawl whose aura of sophistication can&amp;rsquo;t mask its deadly heart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With information on getting into and around the city, notable locations across the sprawl, and plot hooks to keep runners busy, San Francisco is an indispensable aid to Shadowrun players looking to bring their skills to the city by the bay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;San Francisco is part of the City by Shadow series of e-books focusing on cities across the Sixth World and is for use with Shadowrun, Fifth Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
