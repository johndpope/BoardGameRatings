			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you and a few friends get together in order to role-play out the experiences of someone who has been deleted by God, and is damned to turn into the base components of a human body in a few days time, if they don't find God and ask him or force him to undo it. This can be harder than it seems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player will play the Devil, and God, and Everything in between (aka the rest of the world), while the rest of the players will take on these characters who are having their lives shattered&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
