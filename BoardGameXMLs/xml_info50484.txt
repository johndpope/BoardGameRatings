							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Way of Shadow</name>
									
			<description>Both a sourcebook and a set of adventures dealing with the Lying Darkness in Rokugan. An extensive first person narrative takes up the majority of the volume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Over a decade ago, an Imperial Magistrate vanished on his way to the Dragon lands. His eta servant carried his journal back to his Clan, but he has never been heard from again. His records mention strange figures in the night, shadows with no faces, and the deepest secret of Rokugan's most dangerous enemy... the Ninja. Now, the lie is exposed: the mystery of the true Ninja is revealed. Adventures of horror and madness await you, and at the end, you and your players will look upon the face of the Goju, the truth behind the Ninja and their Master, the Immortal Shadow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The journal of Kitsuki Kaagi is the most mysterious manuscript in Rokugan, and the most heavily protected. Surrounded by crystal and buried within the depths of Mirumoto Castle, the few Kitsuki who have volunteered to be exposed to its secrets have become shadow... faceless and forever lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Living Darkness: The history of the Ninja, from the thin shred of Nothing that hid from the Sun and Moon, to the servants of Shadow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Goju: Meet the minions of the Darkness, and discover those who have sacrificed their identities - their very souls - for power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Nameless One: Delve into the history of Isawa Ujina, destined to become the Nameless One, his identity stolen by the Darkness that bore his only daughter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Dreams and Night Horrors: Learn how the Ninja initiate their members, the hidden connection between the Darkness and the Scorpion Shadow brands, and why a true Ninja has no face. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
