							<name primary="true" sortindex="2">&quot;GOAL&quot;</name>
									
			<description>Objective: score most goals (450 points or more) during a 2 x 6 matches lasting game&lt;br/&gt; - acting by turns - &lt;br/&gt;2 or 4 players (in this case you need two sets/games with 4 different colours) are dealt 5 cards each (from their own 32 cards deck); trying to score most points in a trick-taking procedure you earn bonus points regarding the values of the cards (within their won tricks); special card combinations (center-forward &amp;amp; goal &amp;amp; Joker) give additional points. After each trick you must refill your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;notes: likely published mid/end 1930's due to Joker card 'Sindelar': Team captain of the Austrian Wunderteam - died Jan. 1939 under mysterious circumstances&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
