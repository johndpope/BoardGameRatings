							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Black Dragon&#039;s Curse</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A young woodsman, your job is to protect the trees of the forest. One day, you stumble across what looks like a dead sapling. Yanking it out of the ground, you discover it is the Black Dragon staff, an ancient tool of magic with the head of a snarling dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Caught by the staff's spell, you cannot put it down. Suddenly, the dragon begins to speak, placing a terrible curse on your village that can only be removed by returning the staff to the evil wizard Malthus. But you just have the Black Dragon's word that the wicked wizard will take back the curse. Should you journey to Malthus castle, hoping he'll save your people from doom? Or should you seek a way to destroy the Black Dragon staff yourself?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dangers are great but the rewards are too. Will you fall victim to hidden traps and perils or choose wisely and find both fame and fortune?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's up to you to make the choices and explore the many roads to magical adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
