							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">FPS Arena</name>
									
			<description>FPS Arena brings the world of first-person-shooter video games to a fast-paced card game. Players use weapons, ammunition, and other equipment to battle each other in a high caliber fight to the finish. They can compete one-on-one, as teams, or in all-out free-for-all deathmatch games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FPS Arena includes a 72-card Master Deck and three 36-card Weapon Decks.  Each Weapon Deck includes weapons and ammo of a particular type, while the Master Deck includes the game's armor, gear, and action cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players accumulate cards in their hand and in their Resource Pile.  Cards played from a player's hand have a resource cost (usually from 1-10) that indicates the number of cards the player's Resource Pile must contain in order to play that card.  Players may draw cards from their Resource Piles at any time, but may not put cards from their hands onto their Resource Piles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player's turn has two phases: a Main Phase and a Combat Phase.  Each phase has different allowable effects.  The Main Phase is generally used by the player to play equipment cards and ready for combat, while the Combat Phase is when the player engages other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;May the greatest fragger win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
