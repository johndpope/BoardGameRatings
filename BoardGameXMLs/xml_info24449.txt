							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Five-Hole Crokinole</name>
									
			<description>Five-Hole Crokinole is played on a specially-drilled board and was popular in Canada in the late 1800s. The board is sized like a standard board, but in addition to the center hole it has a hole in the center of each 10-point area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is similar to standard Crokinole, except that any disk pocketed in one of the 10-point area holes is removed from play and counts -10 points. This allows for both offensive attack and makes tricky shots more risky. As a result, scoring is usually more chaotic and variable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can be bought in five-hole form, or often a standard board can be retrofitted to make this version. That retrofit is almost always one-way, though!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
