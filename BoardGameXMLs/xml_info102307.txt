			<description>Shin Megami Tensei: if... (真・女神転生if..., Shin Megami Tensei ifu?) is a Japanese console role-playing game that was released for the Super Famicom in 1994. It is a side story to the Shin Megami Tensei series, rather than a direct sequel, and is part of the larger Megami Tensei series. The game concerns a &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot; situation in which the final events of Shin Megami Tensei were different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was remade for the PlayStation and featured updated graphics and a DVD with an interview from the creators. There was also a cellphone game, which was a one chapter side story to the plot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;if... is a console role-playing game that features many of the same gameplay aspects of previous games in the series. Players must navigate through first-person dungeons, fighting demons in turn-based random encounters. To help the hero there will be different companions and the always-present minions recruited by the usual demon-negotiation process or the fusion process into a Jakyou. This game introduced the possibility to acquire Guardian Spirits. When the hero dies in combat, he or she is given a Guardian Spirit that will alter the characters stats when he or she gains an experience level. Depending on the enemy that the party was fighting when the hero died, the stat growth can either be boosted or negative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_if&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_if&lt;/a&gt;...
