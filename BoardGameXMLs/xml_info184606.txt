			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Description-Based RPG System is a conceptual roleplaying game that embodies the design goal of defining characters through characterization and narration instead of a matrix of numeric values.  Character creation involves a six-step process of narration, beginning with creation of a Concept Line and continuing with Defining Elements, Innate Capabilities (inherent abilities), Developed Capabilities (learned abilities), a Weakness, and then the First Session rule.  The First Session rule allows revision to character concepts and aspects subsequent to the game's first session.  Then, the character is considered final.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Event resolution uses dice.  The GM assigns an &amp;quot;Event Density&amp;quot; to the confrontation--this ranges from &amp;quot;automatic success&amp;quot; for trivial events to dramatic events requiring multiple stages of action (such as combat).  The GM and character then make a Success Assessment, though the final assessment is up to the GM.  The final assessment should fall into a range of narrative possibilities, from &amp;quot;Automatic Success&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Near-Certain Success&amp;quot;, to &amp;quot;Even Odds&amp;quot;, and then to &amp;quot;Near-Certain Failure&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Certain Failure&amp;quot;.  Two d10 are then rolled and compared to two columns in a matrix.  Note the d10 may be numeric but the number represents only a position in the matrix not a numeric value--in fact, dice with colored faces are preferred by the rules.  The GM then takes the two descriptive results form the matrix and incorporates them into the game's narrative flow.  The rules note &amp;quot;the interpretation of the Action Result Table is highly subjective&amp;quot;, and must be done by the GM with the goal of furthering the narrative action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
