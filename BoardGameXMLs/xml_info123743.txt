							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Adventure 3: The Lost Books (fan expansion for HeroQuest)</name>
									
			<description>In this third adventure we set out to create for the Wizard some more spells that He could use. The challenge was to make Him more of a valuable member to the team, without making Him too powerful and becoming God like. In this adventure the Wizard asks His friends to join Him on a quest to recover ancient spells that have become lost. Once found, these spells will help the Heroes battle against Zargon and His evil plans. Two new elements, Wood and Spirit, are added to the game. Giving the Heroes 18 new spells to use. All of these spells are used in future games. This is what is so amazing about the adventure series. The game keeps growing, making it more fun to play. We hope that you and your fiends will enjoy your adventure.&lt;br/&gt;This game's pdf files are available for downloading. They are made in a way that will allow you to make the books and cards. The pages are available at &amp;quot;Dragonkingdoms.co.uk&amp;quot; and yahoo's group site &amp;quot;Hero Quest Game board&amp;quot; for free. You do need to join the group to access the file's section where they are stored. The photo section of this site will allow you to read the story and look at the maps to see if this game is something you would like to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
