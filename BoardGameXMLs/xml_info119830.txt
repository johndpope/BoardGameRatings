			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This smallish book offers a new approach to handling roleplaying skills and encounters -- and should work in any d20 System based game, even most of the ones that no longer use the logo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules take a different approach in an effort to make it feel more like the character's skills have a direct impact on the way the roleplaying of the scene plays out, without reducing the entire exchange to a die roll. The idea is to help the player be a better negotiator, by giving them special benefits based on their character's skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic premise is that each of the major interaction skills, Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive, offer a variety of special talking actions. While roleplaying out an encounter, the player can make a skill check for their character and, if it succeeds, gain some special benefit during the roleplaying of the encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, if Talarn tells the leader of a barbarian tribe that Talarn's group just took out the goblins in the nearby hills, then realizes that the barbarians were actually quite friendly with those goblins (perhaps by noticing all the weapons being drawn), then Talarn could use the Bluff skill's Take Back action to make it as if Talarn had never said that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
