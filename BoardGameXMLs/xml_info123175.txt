			<description>Granny's Garden is an educational adventure game created for the BBC Micro in 1983. It served as a first introduction to computers for many schoolchildren in the United Kingdom during the 1980s and 1990s. The software is still used today in many schools worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created by Mike Matson for 4Mation, the game takes place in the Kingdom of the Mountains. The aim is to find the six missing children of the King and Queen (Esther, Tom, Clare, Anna, Jessica, and Daniel), while avoiding the evil witch, by way of a few logic puzzles (and some that are less logical).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was ported to other systems including the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. Later versions with updated graphics and sound were produced for 16- and 32-bit platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac OS. There is now a port with the original graphics for Windows.  The familiar theme music to the program is a traditional Irish folk tune called &amp;quot;The King of the Fairies&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Granny's Garden&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
