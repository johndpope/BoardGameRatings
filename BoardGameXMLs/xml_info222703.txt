			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight for survival during the Solar Conflict. This is Delmer E. Esau's Blak Dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Techno-Communists have razed the Earth. The former NATO group, now known as the Rogue Army, face the Cyborg Uprising in a thrilling 3D competitive tactical board game series. Also play as the Techno-Communists, the Zero-G Mafia, the Corporates or the Settlers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a biopunk cyber-tactical military board-game. At the dawn of the 22nd century the ambush assault at the hands of the Machine Communists destroyed much of the planet Earth. NATO and others hold on to honour while others like the Zero-G Mafia and Corporates do it for cash. The Settlers, Martians and other Solar communities fend for their land titles and spatial positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game features cutting-edge game technology like layered board modules, dry erase record keeping, character units and multi-theatre elements. Fight it out in orbit while waging a ground campaign at the same time. Large Junkspace orbital cities are often the battleground depicted by map-tile layers that players can record damage, fuel and ammunition supplies on. Virtually any hotspot in Sol system will be supported with full mapping and engineering information; in-game attributes provided on the boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Typically a Blak Dragon mission has players' fielding a capitol vessel, with garrisons and hangers bays, against each-other. Players field these capitol ships complete with square 3D map-boards that depict the vessels deck plan and attributes on cards provided (attributes like space travel movement). Also, capitol vessels are represented by a large unit piece on hexagonal map-boards that has three layers that allow three-dimensional fighting in outer space. A vessel's action is planned three moves ahead with secret Command and Network cards being played face down. The vessel's movement, weapons, and network abilities are declared this way. Players will have to guess ahead to what their opponents Commands will be, simulating slow-acting-commands and fog-of-war. Network digital hacks can be assisted by netrunners deployed along with other space infantry units in boarding parties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALL vessels from capitol ships to fighter craft are combined with dry erase playing card markers. Fuel, ammo and air are recorded and spendable. Fighters, gunships, mecha, all can move on the main board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genre conflict elements include nuclear weapons, cluster missile pods, recoiless A.I. automatics, lasers and hand-to-hand blade and martial arts. Fighter-craft, robotic weapon systems, gunships and stealth units are deployable. Send fighter craft, gunships and mecha to assault enemy vessels in zero gravity space and wage infantry battles with your boarding parties. Die rolling and skill attributes compared with die-rolling, armor and dodge determine damage and or loss of units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, the Uplift Community, everyone from the Dolphins to the Dawgs, will be represented. Dolphin Settlers have a stake-hold on Mars with their backs to the Earth investment, now vital. Dawg mercenary  infantry companies  are deployed across theatre. The space breather group once known as shipbuilders rebel at lost fees and exile and are now called the &amp;quot;Zero-G Mafia&amp;quot;. Cockroachers stake-held Saturn as well having better fared the scourge of stolen ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters exist in Blak Dragon with special abilities and strengths. You will recognize them from the novel Blak Dragon released in 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Look forward to more incredible news about the Blak Dragon Era in the &amp;quot;Infantry&amp;quot; expandable hybrid media universe soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
