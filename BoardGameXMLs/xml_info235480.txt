							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Neighbor of the Beast</name>
									
			<description>Each player is in charge of a different color group of houses in the neighborhood.This game uses territory control and &amp;quot;Take-that!&amp;quot; game mechanics. Every time The Beast is moved to a different house or is annoyed by his neighbors, he gets angrier and angrier. The cards present methods of moving The Beast or rearranging the layout of houses in the neighborhood, and have different anger values for each such method. When The Beast's total anger value reaches the breaking point, he RAGES and destroys all houses adjacent to his.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player must manage when and where The Beast rages, thus destroying the houses around him. The ultimate goal is to have more of your opponents' houses destroyed than yours. When The Beast lives in one of your houses, you actually gain points. When The Beast lives next to one of your houses, there's risk of him destroying them in a fit of rage, costing you points. All other houses out of harm's way (not adjacent to The Beast) tally point values as well. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
