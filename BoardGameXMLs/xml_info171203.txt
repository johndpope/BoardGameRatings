			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I shot my answering machine today. Took out the old twelve gauge my father left me, and blew it to pieces. A silly, futile gesture, I know, but it illustrates my present state of mind, I think.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Paul F. Wilson, &amp;lsquo;The Barrens&amp;rsquo; (1989)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigator Weapons for Call of Cthulhu in the Modern Era is a comprehensive collection of weapons available to stalwart investigators of the Cthulhu Mythos and their crazed cultist opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigator Weapons 2 covers handguns, rifles and assault rifles, shotguns, submachine guns and personal defence weapons, machine guns, grenade launchers, rocket launchers, melee weapons, explosives, and special ammunition; and gathers together all the spot rules for injury, environmental conditions, and firearms combat in one place, as well as introducing many optional rules for enhanced play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hans-Christian Vortisch (author of Investigator Weapons 1, GURPS Covert Ops, GURPS High-Tech, and GURPS Tactical Shooting) has selected many dozens of the most typical or iconic weapons available to the discerning shooter today. These range from the famous Glock 17 pistol, H&amp;amp;K MP5 submachine gun, and Kalashnikov assault rifle to many lesser known, but even more widespread firearms &amp;ndash; as well as specialized designs developed for assassins, combat divers, and special forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each weapon is illustrated and described in detail, as are numerous variant models, each with its own statistics bar. Significantly, each weapon's operation is described, allowing the Keeper and his players to convincingly portray its use and effect. Accompanying every weapon description is a comprehensive list of the movies where it appears &amp;ndash; so that you can see and hear it in action!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nor is the Keeper forgotten! Typical weapons for non-player characters are suggested, as are likely weapons for cultists from around the world. A Keeper&amp;rsquo;s chapter examines the consequences of magic on firearms and ammunition, and the effect of firearms on Mythos creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigator Weapons 2 &amp;ndash; The essential modern weapons book for Keeper and players of all editions of Call of Cthulhu and other RPGs of Lovecraftian investigative horror in the modern age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
