							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Saratoga 1777</name>
									
			<description>The Saratoga 1777 campaign of the American Revolution resulted in a British defeat that was so shocking that it changed the course of the war.  What started as a grand campaign by three British armies to end the rebellion resulted in the defeat of two of them and the capture of the third and largest army.  Historically, the Americans had the odds stacked against them and yet pulled off a crushing victory over the greatest military power in the world. Can you as the British player defeat the American Continental army and its militia in the back woods along Lake Champlain and Lake George?  Or as the American player can you, like Green Mountain boys and the farmers of those back woods defend your homeland and change the course of the war?  The decisions are yours&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is Volume III of the Great Campaigns of the American Revolution which includes NY 1776, and TRENTON 1776.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game includes hard mounted game board, 70+ blocks, labels, battle board, rules, and dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing time is 1 to 2 hours.  For ages 13+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
