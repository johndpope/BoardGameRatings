							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ruined City: Mission 1</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ruined City is the first official campaign set in the world of the Runed Age. What starts off as a regular mission will take the players' characters through a story of murders, mysteries and horrors as they stay seemingly caught in the eye of the Ruined Man's storm. Not only will the players have to survive the Ruined Man, but the very city will start tearing itself apart in the fear left in his wake. It will be all the can do to survive and still finish their missions to put a well deserved coin in their pocket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This item is the separately published first mission (only) extracted from The Ruined City: A Runed Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
