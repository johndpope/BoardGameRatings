			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Xpress System is designed to be a modular set of 'generic' roleplaying rules with variable 'plug and play' options. Each rule is designed to be supplemented or swapped out by additional or replacement rules. While some of these will be stylistic alterations for different genres it will also allow you to build your own version of the rules suited to your own particular preference in gaming and depth of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Xpress System is designed, as much as possible, to be a one-roll game with a quick resolution mechanic providing for scalable levels of success. This assists GMs in describing the outcomes of rolls and events while also allowing for a relatively streamlined mode of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xpress uses dice pools because the number of dice you pick up creates an immediate indication and physical feel for how good a character is at something as well as providing a 'horror' factor in players once they see how many dice their opponents can use. Re-rolling is also an integral mechanic, backing up the physical number of dice with another 'feel good' factor in the play of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specialisations, merits and flaws allow deeper character customisation and a greater feel for a character, something which can be lacking in rules-light games. Rather than an exhaustive list of merits and flaws the core game provides rules for creating your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
