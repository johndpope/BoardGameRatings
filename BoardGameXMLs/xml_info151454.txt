			<description>Engage: Spaceship Combat is a miniature wargame that allows players to control and battle one or more starships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players alternate in choosing one of their ships and completing three actions with it; these actions can be to attack with various weapon systems, move, repair, transfer power etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each ship has its own small play card showing its key systems; to which damage and extra power tokens are added making it easy for the players to see what condition and power level the ship's various systems are currently at.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has several pre-set missions with victory conditions allowing players to win a Combat Victory (destroying more of the enemy fleet than their own) and/or Objective Victory (completing the mission objectives).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
