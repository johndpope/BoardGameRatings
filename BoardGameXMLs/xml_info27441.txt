			<description>Casino, &amp;quot;The Incredible All-In-One Game&amp;quot;, was published in the Philippines in 1981.  The components is composed of a gameboard, various cards, play money, tokens, dice, and a rule sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameboard has tracks around it wherein the tokens can traverse upon the roll of the dice just like in Monopoly.  But there are subtle differences: instead of streets the tracks are mostly illustrations of different Casino-related games.  When a player lands on a track with a specified game, he must play that game by placing a bet using play money and drawing the related card.  The card drawn will show the &amp;quot;summarized&amp;quot; result whether the player wins money or loses them.  There are also other types of tracks wherein any player who lands on them automatically loses money or gains some.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to win the largest amount of play money and avoid becoming bankrupt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
