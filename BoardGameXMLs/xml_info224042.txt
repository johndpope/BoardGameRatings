							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Min-Max Monsters</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Want to spice up your encounters? Min-Max Monsters is a treatise on finding and unlocking the potential of your favorite creatures. Chalk full of suggestions for both novice and experienced DMs, this book will provide you with new ideas for use in your games. While there are a handful of suggested new rules, they are not the focus of the book, nor are any new rules required to use the vast majority of the treatise. Rather, a careful look has been taken at the existing rules in fifth edition D&amp;amp;D so you can start putting them all to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy putting the hurt on your players in fun, new, and exciting ways. Take a look!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
