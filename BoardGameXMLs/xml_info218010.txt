			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A scrolling beat 'em up that was scheduled for release on the Super Nintendo.  It is based on the Prime character from Malibu comics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was originally envisioned as a SNES game but was never completed. It was eventually released as a Sega CD title as a pack-in with Microcosm, a game that was released separately before. The game design has the typical SNES feel, with no changes made to match the advanced options of the Sega CD platform. Compared to the SNES prototype, even though the graphics style is the same, the fighting style is slightly different and a 7-minute rock theme song was added along with the bonus features mentioned above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
