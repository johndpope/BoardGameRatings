			<description>Sail Simulator 5&lt;br/&gt;In 2009 Stentec proudly presented the latest version of the Sail Simulator 5 at HISWA: an extremely realistic sailing experience on your computer. Ideal for learning purposes or getting through the offseason.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learning how to sail&lt;br/&gt;Make a calm start with an optimist on the Frisian Fluessen and get a feeling of the wind in your sails. Operating the big lap and the helm is a big deal to start with!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next, choose a more flashy model such as a Laser, Splash or Flash and experience how the ship is slanting or even overturns! No worries, with the press of a button your ship will turn upright again. Make a voyage on the Northsea, set your wind a bit higher and choose a catamaran, 29&amp;rsquo;er or 49&amp;rsquo;er. Or, if you are still learning about bigger sea waves, choose a Bavaria 36 or YD 40. You can even plot a course to learn how to navigate or how to sail into a harbour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you really got a hang of it you can get everything out of your ship by trimming the sails, controlling the sword and crew and maintaing the correct course and sail setups. The Regatta Valk or the fast Olympic 470 are excellent for this experience as these are no ships for beginners. Even if you don't have full control of these ships you are ready for the online gameplay. Racing against other players from all over the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regattas&lt;br/&gt;Most sailors will know the feeling: sailing alone is about enjoying the wind through your hair and the beautiful sights. But when another ship comes along side it can turn into a race quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can now sail regattas when on your home computer, with Sail Simulator 5. You will be challenged to get even more out of your ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Create a (offline) LAN network and compete with friends and family. Choosing to compete online gives you the opportunity to race against players from all over the world! Your sailing performances are saved on your own personal account and will be visible on the rankings list. The ranking list can be found via the Sail Simulator community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regattas are updated regularly and new regattas are added by other Sail Simulator 5 players. Subscribe to these regattas or create your own regatta and others will participate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highlights&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy and flexible user interface.&lt;br/&gt;    Stable multiplayer server for long distance regattas.&lt;br/&gt;    Realistic aerodynamics with wind shear and twist.&lt;br/&gt;    True to nature wave field and sea wearthiness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sailing areas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cabrera: Group of island south of Mallorca in the Mediterranean Sea. Protected nature area with sheltered bay on the main Cabrera island (Goat Island).&lt;br/&gt;    Koh Hong: Sailing between tropical islands in Thailand. Clear blue water and steep cliffs. Beware of the rocks on the seabed and sudden wind drops behind the islands.&lt;br/&gt;    Scheveningen, Den Haag: City, beach, pier and harbour are highly detailed for an unsurpassed sailing experience.&lt;br/&gt;    Treasure Island: Fantasy island with buried treasure, made specifically for regattas. Lots of water, wind and little land. Beware of the shallows at the northeast side of the island!&lt;br/&gt;    Fluessen: The home port for Stentec in Friesland. This freshwater area is perfect for youth boat matches. Available in the Add on - 'Boat Set 1'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
