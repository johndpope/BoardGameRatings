			<description>In The Howard Hughes Game players move via die roll on a two-dimensional grid, drawing or trading cards when they land on the appropriate spaces. The goal is to get cards of the different types (Luck, Inheritance, and Corporate Know-How) for each of the eight phases of Hughes' life (as defined by the game) in turn. The phases are entered via &amp;quot;doors&amp;quot; on the board and the cards are turned in for money, which is tracked on a small board for each player. In true Hughes style, players may purchase injunctions to prevent movement through certain areas of the board. The object is to amass $2.5 billion dollars, the publisher's estimate of Hughes' fortune at the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the rules, the &amp;quot;Study Guide&amp;quot; booklet contains 21 pages of material on the life and investments of Howard Hughes and an extensive bibliography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the name &amp;quot;Urban Systems&amp;quot; does not appear on the game, this is presumably the game in the case Rosemont Enterprises, Inc. v. Urban Systems, Inc. (72 Misc.2d 788, 789-90, 340 N.Y.S.2d 144, 145-46 [Sup.Ct.], modified, 42&lt;br/&gt;App.Div.2d 544, 345 N.Y.S.2d 17 [App.Div.1973]). This case resulted in a judgement for Hughes against the game publisher, requiring them to withdraw the game from sale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
