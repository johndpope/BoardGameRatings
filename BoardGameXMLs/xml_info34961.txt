			<description>This early Parker Brothers Game might be one of the earliest games (outside of Bingo) to give each player their own board.  Everyone is trying to develop their own district with residences, churches, public buildings, and a 5-story skyscraper.  The components include painted/colored wood blocks for the buildings!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer published the game himself, and then Parker Brothers bought it and reprinted it. It is not known if the two versions differ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
