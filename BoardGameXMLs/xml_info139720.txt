			<description>These rules are for use with Modern micro armor miniatures in 1/285th and 1/300th scale. The rules are suitable for use with HO scale models if adjustments are made to the sizes of the artillery and bomb grids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ground scale is 1&amp;quot;=50 yds (1:1800) and each turn represents about 1 minute. 6, 12 and 20 sided dice, rulers and playing pieces are required for play. Sighting distances in unobstructed areas range from 40&amp;quot; to 80&amp;quot;, so the playing area should take this into account. Players provide their own terrain as required by their scenario instuctions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules concisely cover movement, sighting, vehicles, infantry, artillery, chemical weapons, smoke, minefields, aircraft, helicopters and antiaircraft artillery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the information in the military organization section, players can deploy a military force based on a country's actual military practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
