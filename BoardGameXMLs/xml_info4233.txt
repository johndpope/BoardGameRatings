			<description>Holiday USA challenges players ages 8 - adult to follow a calendar board and be the player to have the most points at the end of the year (game) Players collect red, white and blue point chips as they correctly answer one of 1100 trivia questions covering the history and traditions of American holidays and observances. Each question card has a kid question on it so all ages and ability levels can easily play together. Spaces on the board also give players a chance to gain and lose points (So it's not just the genius trivia buff that's getting all the points!)and spin the gift wheel for gifts that will help them win the game(a free roll or extra points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
