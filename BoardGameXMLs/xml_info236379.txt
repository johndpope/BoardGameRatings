			<description>From back of box&lt;br/&gt;For eons our small colony has struggled to penetrate the outer POLON defences. Alas, countless deaths attest to the futility of our attempts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bu we must persist. For somewhere deep within enemy lines, lies the Mothership. The scourge of our universe. And until we destroy herm we are nothing more than slaves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What was that you muttered? You'd like to give it a shot? My foolish friend. The POLON weaponry goes on forever. At best you'll face layer after layer of resistrance. Even if you somehow build up your ship's power and speed enough to teleport across their system, there's no telling what you'll face once you annihilate the tyrant vessel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frankly, my naive heri, pilots much more skilled than you have never come back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But of cause they wouldn't listen either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
