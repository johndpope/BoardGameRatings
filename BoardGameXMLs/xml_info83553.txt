							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Over Flanders Fields: Between Heaven and Hell</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World War I in the Air&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OFF is flight simulation dedicated to the dawn of Air Combat - it will bring you face-to-face with the reality of what many young pilots felt fighting for their lives close up in their wood and canvas machines high above the trenches of Eastern France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OFF has stunning WW1 sights and sounds, and unique dynamic WW1 air campaign engine, with each campaign mission being unique, with other flights on their own real missions.  OFF will immerse you in a world long gone: the sights, sounds and memories of the skies over France and Flanders, soaring over the gentle landscapes scarred by the trenches, craters and mud of the Great War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SOME USER COMMENTS from customers and forum users:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I think the game is absolutely terrific. I am an ex RAF University Air Squadron pilot and have flown many old biplanes in the UK Tiger Club so I know something of how these aircraft should feel and I find the game so realistic.&amp;quot;  - Guy L.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Best sim I have ever flown&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;This aint a sweeping statement I assure you!&lt;br/&gt;The sim just captures the 'feel' of flying a Stick and string biplane against other crates!&lt;br/&gt;- WidowmakerUK&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is by far the best WWI sim ever made! &lt;br/&gt;I too have fond memories of climbing into the old 80's Red Baron video game and ku'chuncking a quarter into it so that I could fly against the Red Baron! ...&lt;br/&gt;Incredible!  - Markimus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
