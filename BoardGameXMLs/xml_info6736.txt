			<description>great campaign of Napoleon from 1806 to 1812&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonaparte is a game of strategy in which players simulate all the Napoleonic campaigns in Europe starting from 1807, from that time on, in fact, the conflict between France and England was decidedly in the hands of Napoleon. All the various campaigns (Spain, Portugal, Prussia, Austria, etc) were not considered separate and isolated from one another, as they were in reality. The necessity to count battles on two, three, or four fronts as all being connected is dictated by several historical assumptions: the numbers of enemies to face, the blocking off of England, which was likely to become a way to isolate France on the continent, and the British tenacity in arousing national anti-French sentiments. Napoleon's goal is to conquer all of Europe, without which the financial possibilities of the English would render impossible the existence of the empire. The play of alliances, created according to the political and military mechanisms which are always unstable, is an instrument equally valid foe either player to use in order to obtain a victory which only the forces of the two individual countries could not obtain, even in theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
