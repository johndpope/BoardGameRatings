							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fate of the World</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fate of the World contains four playbooks of player classes for Dungeon World that has gorgeous cover art done by Nick Ladd. This pack features the figures that rise to the challenge of saving the world when darkness falls upon the land. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Fated Hero: You are a figure who is at the heart of every myth and fairy tale. You are the knight in shining armor; you are the hero who will save the world! You and your allies go on whirlwind adventures, traveling to forgotten cities, busy capitals and devious dungeons for the sake of saving the world.&lt;br/&gt;     The Mentor: You are the wise and enigmatic senior of great understanding who oversees the training and guidance of new adventures out on their quests across the realm. You offer them insight and guidance in fluid and often poetic life lessons. However, when things get rough, you are no slouch in a fight. Use your aged intellect to direct you younger allies, and failing that, you have a few tricks up your sleeves to deal with whatever the world throws your way.&lt;br/&gt;     The Prophet: Nothing can spare you from the visions the gods mercilessly grant you, but if the fate of the world will ever be fought for, you will be the first to know. Use your visions of things that may come to warn your fellow adventures before it it&amp;rsquo;s too late or see great tragedies about to befall the world. Religiously raised folk see these visions as a blessing and holy duty they must attend as others suffer it as a punishment from above and try to shun it.&lt;br/&gt;     The Fateless Hero: You have spent your life dreaming of the day when you would become an exalted hero, saving the world from utter ruin and fulfilling prophecies. However, the acrimonious truth is that you are unseen by the threads of destiny and are cursed to be forever forgotten. The gods have no plan for you. There is no greater force in the universe that has included you in their design. You lie to yourself and promise to do great things, but almost mockingly; all the glory and recognition you seek seem to slip through your fingers and is given to others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
