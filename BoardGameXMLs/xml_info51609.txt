							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Salamanca: Wellington&#039;s Masterpiece</name>
									
			<description>(from LPD's website:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wellington defeats Marmont in a maneuver battle that tests each player's imagination. Salamanca stretches the BNE system nearly to its limit with hidden deployment, leader orders and initiative and a complex set of victory conditions. Is your opponent trying to beat you on the battlefield, cut you off from your line of communications, capture or destroy your Army Train or simply gobble up your pickets and screening forces? You'll need to keep all those possibilities, as well as your own operational concept, in mind to win this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
