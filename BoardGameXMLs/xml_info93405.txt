			<description>A card game with dice, where the players create their own amusement parks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five different groups of cards with amusement park attractions.The player in turn plays one card with an attraction of a particular group and the other players have to follow with a card of the same group or pass. The card indicate how strong it is. Mostly the player has to roll a number of dice. When none wants to play more cards of that group, it is closed and it is checked who reached most points of that group. After that, it continues in the same way with next player playing a card of another group. Every group is worth a particular number of points, and there is also a bonus for having won most groups.
