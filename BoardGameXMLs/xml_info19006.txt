			<description>The Persian Princes sit in the caf&amp;eacute; and enjoy their Mokka.  They drink lots and lots of Mokka.  Every evening they sit there and drink their Mokka&amp;hellip;because in the caf&amp;eacute;, Fatimah appears&amp;mdash;Fatimah, the most beautiful belly dancer in all the lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Princes are in love with her.  Fatimah likes all of the Princes, as well, but she does not know whom among them she wishes to marry.  Then she has an idea:  The one Prince who will be worthy of her is the one who can recognize her not simply by her beauty but also by her fragrance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus, she proposes a task to the Princes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each of the following 12 evenings she will wear a different perfume, and she will hide each perfume bottle in one of the houses in the city.  The princes are to find out in which house she has hidden the perfumes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prince who first correctly identifies three of the perfumes will become her husband.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duftende Spuren took 8th place in the 1991 Deutscher Spielepreis (DSP) voting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
