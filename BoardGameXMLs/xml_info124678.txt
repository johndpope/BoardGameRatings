			<description>From Published Material&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AFTER THE END OF THE WORLD...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MAY 23, 1974...A mix of biological, nuclear and thermonuclear weapons fall on North America in the apocalyptic climax to World War III.  Smoke and debris from thousands of nuclear fireballs blots out the sun for over two years, bringing on an ecological catastrophe - THE LONG WINTER.  When the sun finally returns, it reveals a desolate landscape barely capable of supporting the few pockets of ragged humanity that remain, teetering on the edge of oblivion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1980...Six years after the war that nearly ended life on earth, the heroic actions of a few can either save the future of the human race, or push it over the brink into extinction.  Such heroes will be hard men and women, products of the toughest times mankind has ever known.  They are...SURVIVORS OF THE FIRE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book covers all the rules and systems needed to play tough and gritty adventurers trying to survive in a shattered future that never was.  Rules for character creation, combat, weapons, vehicles, equipment, potential combatants and the other hazards of the Post World War III world are covered.  In addition, there is a campaign setting, a sample adventure and several more adventure and campaign ideas.  Whether you're interested in just a session or two of rapid-fire action, or wish to take part in an epic campaign to bring humanity back from the brink, this game can take you there!  All that is required is a set of five six-sided dice for each person, some scratch paper, a writing instrument or two and your imagination for hours of enjoyable play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
