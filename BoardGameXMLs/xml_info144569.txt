							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super RPS: Rock • Paper • Scissors</name>
									
			<description>In this card game, players will have to duck, dodge, and morph to avoid combat and to attack their enemies. The classic hand game Rock Paper Scissors is taken to new heights of intensity and competitiveness. Clever timing divides the winner from the loser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It all starts with having 3 &amp;quot;Soldiers&amp;quot; to use during the game. Each Soldier represents a blunt Rock, a piece of Paper, or sharp pair Scissors. The standard rules of combat engagement are enforced that only allow Rock to attack Scissors, Scissors to attack Paper, and Paper to attack Rock. But player can change their form to attack otherwise unreachable opponents or avoid combat altogether. And all the rules can be bent or broken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in turns with no set number of turns in a game. After a player loses all their Soldiers, they are out of the game. The last player with at least 1 Soldier left wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
