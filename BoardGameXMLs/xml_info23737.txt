			<description>From their website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Favored of Zeus is a card game for two to five people in which you take the place of one of the gods of Olympus. Zeus has declared a challenge among his gods and goddesses to be the first to gather one-hundred thousand followers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To aid you in this task, you are allowed to choose one amongst the mortals who will champion your cause. This mortal will fight off the obstacles placed in your way by competitors as well as quest to increase your reputation. Along the way your hero can encounter allies to aid him, and you may take control of mighty Creatures that can make your obstacles more difficult for opponents or attack opponents' followers directly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All you need to play are the cards, two six-sided dice, the game boards for each god, and something to use as a counter for each player (a penny or dime works well). An average game takes 30-60 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
