							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Deep</name>
									
			<description>A group of friends enters a cave, which is something more than what it really seems. The cave has some supernatural abilities. Legends and tales say that the cave could fulfill a person's ambitions, but there would always be a price. Our group of friends however doesn't know the exact nature of this place and they start being overwhelmed by hallucinations and weird experiences. When they will finally fathom what this situation is all about -themselves- it will be too late. Some of them have already started to lose their sanity...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Deep, is a game in which players try gain experience cards through bidding and try to surpass challenges and events of a deck of cards called The Road. Some challenges might make the game co-operative for just a second, but don't be fooled! In a place like The Deep it's every man for himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second deck with Events and Conditions called The Book, makes the game more interesting, as players may draw cards from The Book by paying sanity. The Book cards may help you win the game, but a couple of experiences must also be earned, or else The Book might not be as useful as hoped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game turn is divided in 4 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Road: Road cards are revealed.&lt;br/&gt;    The Experience: Experience cards are revealed and auctioned.&lt;br/&gt;    The Silence: Players play experience cards.&lt;br/&gt;    The Book: Players may pay sanity to draw Book cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends if a player has fulfilled 3 experiences, or if a player has no sanity left. The ambitions of each player are then revealed and the player with the most points is the winner. In case of a tie, the player among the tied that has the most sanity left is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all, a madman cannot always win...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
