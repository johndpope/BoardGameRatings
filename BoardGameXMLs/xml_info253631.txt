			<description>&amp;quot;11:58&amp;quot; is a hand-management/voting card game with social deduction elements. Players take the roles of agents during a conflict between two fictional superpowers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn a global event card is flipped. Every global event card reveals a crisis which can tick the doomsday clock (represented by eight scoring cards) closer or further from humanity's destruction - these global events also affect the relationship between the two superpowers. Players vote to determine the outcome of each global event card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With these votes players must balance two (sometimes conflicting) goals - players must both ensure humanity's survival and complete their own unique hidden agenda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the doomsday clock reads entirely red (signalling humanity's destruction) or entirely blue (signalling humanity's salvation). At this point each player reveals their hidden objective; players who have completed all their objectives win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
