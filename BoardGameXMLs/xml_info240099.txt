							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sly Knight Seekers</name>
									
			<description>Oops! The robber escaped into the town! The knights start seeking clues from the people of the town. Fortunately, the knights have got a lot of information. But it&amp;rsquo;s not complete and the knights are not satisfied. Now they try to grab more clues from each other!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players have cards in their hands as clues on the robbery. Then, the players sort their hand cards into an ascending order. Now, the turn player plays one card face-up to another player, seeking an answer. If that player has the same card at the end of their hand, they must give it to the turn player along with the played card. So, the players start to detect the other hand cards from seeking clues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have 2 or 3 players, it&amp;rsquo;s a competition to win.&lt;br/&gt;If you have 4 players, it&amp;rsquo;s a two partnership game to win.&lt;br/&gt;If you have 5 players, one player is solo, and the other four are two partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
