							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Talon: Bounty Hunter</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mordechai Hawke is a ruthless bounty hunter known throughout the border worlds. His ship, called &amp;quot;Talon&amp;quot;, is a surplus Lelantos-class search and destroy vessel which has been upgraded with cutting edge technology. The ship's registered name is &amp;quot;Lex Talionis&amp;quot; - Latin for the Law of Revenge. This is the ancient source of the &amp;quot;eye for an eye&amp;quot; concept of justice - something Mordechai has embraced fully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lelantos-class was developed early in the war to fill a variety of roles. With an fair sized bay, it could easily carry a small craft, troops, and supplies. It was also well armed and armored, and was exceptionally maneuverable both in space and atmosphere. With a pair of Serena-class fighters in the bay this class of ship proved very effective at long range search-and-destroy operations. By the end of the war, this was the official military classification for the Lelantos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the post-war era, the design has been adopted for non-military use as a general cargo transport. The unmodified bay is designed to hold and secure two standard HMT-337 cargo containers side by side. With the entire lower deck cleared out for maximum cargo space, four more can be carried. This is another mid-sized ship designed to support a group of players in a variety of campaigns and maps are provided for both the prisoner transport and cargo versions. As a sample bounty, the &amp;quot;Wyvern&amp;quot; is also included in it's own complete document. This is a Valkyrn interceptor turned into a bio-organic alien hybrid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     16 page PDF file detailing the ship, interior areas, and crew.&lt;br/&gt;     8 page PDF file detailing Wyvern in the same way.&lt;br/&gt;     Open Game License stats provided for the vessel and crew.&lt;br/&gt;     Map Book&lt;br/&gt;         Full-color 22 page PDF file containing complete interior maps.&lt;br/&gt;         Includes miniature-scale maps for tactical combat.&lt;br/&gt;         Miniature-scale composite map of the ship interior.&lt;br/&gt;         A poster-sized, 24x36 inch, 150 dpi, color JPEG image.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
