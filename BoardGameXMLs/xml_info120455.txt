							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ghost Town</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just in time for Halloween &amp;ndash; A spooky western scenario&lt;br/&gt;Ghost Town was written especially for the Halloween season and involves the characters stumbling upon and exploring a haunted town. In order to give your players a realistic in-game scare, certain supernatural elements are utilized in this scenario. Purists may take umbrage at the inclusion of these &amp;ldquo;fantasy&amp;rdquo; elements in Aces &amp;amp; Eights but it was necessary to do so in order to recreate the horror elements required for a good spooky tale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Essential to gameplay is a mechanic unique to this scenario called &amp;ldquo;Fear Level&amp;rdquo;. This represents how each individual is slowly broken down emotionally by the accumulation of frightening and unexplainable events he witnesses. As the PCs become more scared, this will manifest itself physiologically.&lt;br/&gt;A perfect scenario for your All Hallows Eve roundup.&lt;br/&gt;(15 pages, full color)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
