							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Infra Arcana</name>
									
			<description>Infra Arcana is a Roguelike computer role-playing game set in the early 20th century. The goal is to explore the lair of a dreaded cult called The Church of Starry Wisdom. Buried deep beneath their hallowed grounds lies an artifact called The Shining Trapezohedron - a window to all secrets of the universe. Your ultimate goal is to unearth this artifact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme and inspiration for this game comes mainly from the horror fiction writer H.P. Lovecraft. It's not a pure H. P. Lovecraft game though, as it also draws flavor from various B-horror movies, as well as the 1997 first-person shooter Blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a Roguelike - the game adheres to the virtues of the genre, such as high replay value and challenging tactical game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
