			<description>Ultra Simple Engine for Miniature Engagements. &lt;br/&gt;Simple miniatures skirmish rules designed for fast playing 15mm or 20mm games. Most mechanics are based on the roll of a six-sided die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than six settings have been published, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Sci Fi&lt;br/&gt;    Fantasy&lt;br/&gt;    WW2&lt;br/&gt;    Modern &lt;br/&gt;    American Civil War&lt;br/&gt;    Starship Combat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.15mm.co.uk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.15mm.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;br/&gt;The Turn Sequence of the game follows a simple path of firstly the Initiative Phase where all players roll 1D6 and the highest roll wins the initiative for the turn (important later on!). Then the main part of the turn, the In Play Phase where all characters in the game are activated not by the side upon which they fight but by their Elan Rating. This means better troops and vehicles move and fight before poorer quality troops and vehicles and within each Elan banding from 6 to 1 activation begins with the initiative holding player. When activated each character can choose TWO actions, these include move, ranged fire, melee, hunker down, special action, unique action. The character may choose two different actions OR the same one twice with a modifier; very flexible in battle. Ranged fire and melee are based on opposed single D6 rolls with modifiers for troop type and weapon ratings. This super fast system results in targets being Killed, Struck or Winged by attacks. Killed removes them from play while the other two results negatively effect their further performance in the game. The hunker down action allows characters to take cover against attack while special actions cover those things detailed in the USE ME Advanced Rules and unique actions are created when needed for a scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
