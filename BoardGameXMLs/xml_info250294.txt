			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the shadow of the Galena Mountains, outside the Glumpen forest, the scars of the ancient war with the kingdom of the Witch King still lay fresh and exposed to the night air. A trade route between the regions of Vaasa and Damara have, through the years, created a crossroads at Aetherglen. The people who live there have an abiding honor for their dead, and the graveyards are shrines to their forebears. As you pass through, however, you are waylaid by a mysterious man who tells you that the dead are restless, and something worse may be stirring &amp;lsquo;neath the huge Gulthias trees of the forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
