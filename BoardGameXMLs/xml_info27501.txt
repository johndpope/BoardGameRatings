			<description>Media Magnate is a game of strategy and chance in which players acquire power and wealth through buying and running newspapers and magazines, radio and television stations and international media networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It accurately reflects the real and unpredictable world of media wheeling and dealing from the newspapers to the boardroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game involves all players every time the dice is thrown. The first player to acquire a complete Media Empire is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
