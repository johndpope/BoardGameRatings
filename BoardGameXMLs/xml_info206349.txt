			<description>This is a two-player Soviet-era wargame played with plastic game pieces on a map with an 8 x 12 square grid. Each player receives 11 pieces: five soldiers, five tanks, and one missile launcher. The map graphics include a road, a railway, towns, bridges, a river, streams, swamps, lakes, woods and many contour lines, but these play no role in the game. The only relevant markings are the diagonal lines across the middle two rows, which is a neutral zone or &amp;quot;no-man's land&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may set up their pieces freely on their side of the neutral zone. They move alternately, one piece at a time, and each piece may move only a single space orthogonally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A piece captures an enemy piece by moving next to it, but the required direction changes depending on the nature mix of pieces. Like pieces (infantry vs. infantry, tank vs. tank) can capture from any of the four directions. Infantry can only kill a tank from its side or rear. A tank can only kill infantry if the target is directly in front of it. The missile launcher may kill any one piece at any distance, but then turns into another tank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to get a piece onto his opponent's back row. The game says it is for children aged 7 to 10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
