							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">You Gotta Be Kitten Me! Deluxe Edition</name>
									
			<description>You Gotta Be Kitten Me! is a Liar's Dice-style bluffing game in which players each hold cards that feature animals with some kind of accessory, such as hats, glasses and bow ties. Each turn, you try to guess &amp;mdash; or at least claim &amp;mdash; how many cards are in play with a certain color or accessory, either by raising the current bid or challenging another player. Whoever's wrong loses a card, then you start a new round of play. The last player with cards remaining wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Gotta Be Kitten Me! Deluxe Edition contains the 55 cards of the original game as well as a new 55-card bonus deck with new cards and new animals. The game also includes ten colored meeples and score trackers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
