			<description>KQJ is a point trick-taking card game for up to 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you like trick-taking games like Belote or Hearts and want to play with 6 players, this game is for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are very close to &amp;quot;Belote&amp;quot;, except that there are 4 new cards (Hero) in addition to the classical King, Queen and Jack (KQJ). The game is played by team, 3 vs 3 or 2 vs 2 vs 2. You can choose to play with or without auctions, and choose your preferred victory conditions (500 / 1000 / 2000 points): as you can see, this game gives you a lot of flexibility to enjoy the best trick-taking games you'd like to have with your friends!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play and goal :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KQJ is a game of tricks in several rounds.&lt;br/&gt;- A Round is the deal of cards to each player and all tricks up to the exhaustion of the cards.&lt;br/&gt;- A Trick is a batch of cards made of one card from each player, it is won by the one who plays the &amp;quot;Master&amp;quot; card.&lt;br/&gt;- The &amp;quot;Master&amp;quot; card of a trick is the highest card of the requested series or the highest Trump card if any.&lt;br/&gt;- Each card of the trick has a value: added to the others, it allows to determine the winner of the Round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When launching the game, players place around the table randomly and teams are formed. The players of the same team are &amp;quot;partners&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 5 cards and can watch them in his/her hand.&lt;br/&gt;Then another card is dealed and revealed in the middle of the table: the Return.&lt;br/&gt;Each team must make more points than the opposing team.&lt;br/&gt;Each player can &amp;quot;take&amp;quot; when his/her turn comes: choose the Trump according to his/her cards in hand!&lt;br/&gt;During the first lap each player can, starting with the Opener:&lt;br/&gt;- Say &amp;quot;Pass&amp;quot; and defer to the next player,&lt;br/&gt;- Or Take choosing the suit of the Return as the Trump. For example, &amp;quot;Spade&amp;quot; if the Return is a spade.&lt;br/&gt;If all players have passed, then there is a 2nd lap and each player can:&lt;br/&gt;- Say &amp;quot;Pass&amp;quot; again,&lt;br/&gt;- Or Take choosing Trump in the suit of his/her choice (even the suit of the Return).&lt;br/&gt;If everyone passes 2 times, the round is closed.&lt;br/&gt;On the other hand, if a player Takes, he/she becomes the Sender, his/her team becomes the contracting team, the other team becomes the defending team.&lt;br/&gt;Once a player Takes, he/she collects the Return in his/her hand.&lt;br/&gt;Then each player receives 3 cards, except the Sender who only receives 2 cards (he/she took the Return).&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the Deal, each player has 8 cards in his/her hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Opener starts the 1rst Trick and puts at the center of the table a card from his/her hand face up. Then, when his/her turn comes, each player must play one card face up.&lt;br/&gt;The one who starts may play any card from his/her hand, the suit of this card is the &amp;quot;requested&amp;quot; suit.&lt;br/&gt;The other players follow the rules below:&lt;br/&gt;- When you have the requested suit&lt;br/&gt;--- You must play a card of the suit and if the Trump is requested, if possible, you must play a Trump card that beats all previous ones.&lt;br/&gt;- When you don't have the requested suit and one of your partners is &amp;quot;Master&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;--- You can play any card of your choice,&lt;br/&gt;--- Or, in order to become &amp;quot;Master&amp;quot;, you can Trump (play a Trump card) or Over-trump if someone has already played a Trump card.&lt;br/&gt;- When you don't have the required series and the opposing team is &amp;quot;Master&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;--- If you can become &amp;quot;Master&amp;quot; you must Trump or Over-trump,&lt;br/&gt;--- If you can't become &amp;quot;Master&amp;quot;, you can play any card of your choice.&lt;br/&gt;3 principles to determine the &amp;quot;Master&amp;quot; card:&lt;br/&gt;- The Trump prevails against normal suits.&lt;br/&gt;- Among the suits of the same rank, the requested suit wins.&lt;br/&gt;- In the same suit, the card of higher rank wins.&lt;br/&gt;Normal suits&lt;br/&gt;Rank&lt;br/&gt;    A     10     H     K     Q     J     9     8     7     6     5     4&lt;br/&gt;Value&lt;br/&gt;    12 pts     10 pts     7 pts     5 pts     4 pts     3 pts     2 pts     1 pt     0 pt     0 pt     0 pt     0 pt&lt;br/&gt;The Trump&lt;br/&gt;Rank&lt;br/&gt;    9     8     7     A     10     H     K     Q     J     6     5     4&lt;br/&gt;Value&lt;br/&gt;    27 pts     22 pts     14 pts     12 pts     10 pts     7 pts     5 pts     4 pts     3 pts     0 pt     0 pt     0 pt&lt;br/&gt;The sum of the points is (3 x 44 pts) + 104 pts = 236 pts.&lt;br/&gt;When a Trick is finished, the one who played the &amp;quot;Master&amp;quot; card wins, puts the trick with hidden face in front of him/her and begins the next trick.&lt;br/&gt;When the players have no cards left, it is the end of the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Bonus is an event, announced or not, which corresponds to a number of points that a team will add to its tricks points: The Bonuses help to fulfill the Contract.&lt;br/&gt;- The Ten additional: 10 pts which are always awarded to the team that wins the last trick.&lt;br/&gt;- The Capot: 154 pts awarded to a team which wins all the tricks.&lt;br/&gt;- The KQ: 20 pts for the team of the player who has announced &amp;quot;KQ&amp;quot; during the round. The bonus is confirmed if:&lt;br/&gt;--- A player had the Trump cards King (K) and Queen (Q) in his/her hand,&lt;br/&gt;--- These cards have been played in this order: the King then the Queen,&lt;br/&gt;--- This player has said &amp;quot;K&amp;quot; playing the King and &amp;quot;KQ&amp;quot; playing the Queen.&lt;br/&gt;- The KQJ: 50 pts for the team of the player who has announced &amp;quot;KQJ&amp;quot; during the round. The bonus is validated if:&lt;br/&gt;--- A player had the 3 Trump cards King (K), Queen (Q) and Jack (J) in his/her hand,&lt;br/&gt;--- These cards have been played in this order: the King then the Queen then the Jack,&lt;br/&gt;--- This player has said &amp;quot;K&amp;quot; playing the King, &amp;quot;KQ&amp;quot; playing the Queen and finally &amp;quot;KQJ&amp;quot; playing the Jack.&lt;br/&gt;KQ provides no point when there is a KQJ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the last trick is picked up, the values of the cards in the tricks of each team are counted.&lt;br/&gt;Then bonuses are added to the scores of the teams who have won some. At least, one of the teams wins the Ten additional.&lt;br/&gt;The team with the highest points at that time, fulfills the contract and wins the round!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only the team that fulfills the contract scores its points rounded to the nearest ten:&lt;br/&gt;- The totals which end between 1 and 4 are rounded to the under nearest ten (154 becomes 150).&lt;br/&gt;- The totals which end between 5 and 9 are rounded to the upper nearest ten (155 becomes 160).&lt;br/&gt;Finally, scores are added to previous scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the next round, Opener (left of the Dealer) becomes the new Dealer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In general, a game of KQJ is played in 1000 pts.&lt;br/&gt;Once a team reaches or exceeds 1000 pts at the end of a round, the game is over: this team wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
