							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Captain Archon</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No retreat, no surrender... Captain Archon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 11 Rival, Captain Archon is a United States Air Force captain with an unusually broad mandate. She is both research subject and Public Relations champion, in addition to her active military role fighting meta-humans at home and abroad. Captain Archon is an iconic figure in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Captain Archon is a technologically enhanced superhuman whose battlesuit is powered by her own innate super-powers. Her special qualities helped her rise through the ranks, but she takes her role very, very seriously. As a result, she is uncompromising when dealing with superheroes unaffiliated with an official group, and may often come into conflict with them. A prefect Rival for heroes who like to challenge the system, she represents both patriot and defender of order. Built under the same guidelines for a Power Level 11 Player Character, she can also be used as a handy &amp;quot;Guest Star&amp;quot; for a player visiting your game who doesn't have a character ready.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
