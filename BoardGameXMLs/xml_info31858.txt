			<description>Geominos, the number puzzle strategy game, is played with a set of 21 geometrically-shaped tiles, sectioned and numbered like dominos. You select a tile and place it on the board, matching it to another tile (as in dominos) before time runs out. Play as much of your tile as you can on the dark squares. You're assessed points for any pips (spots) on the light squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Try to score as few points as possible, but don't leave your opponent a good move. When all the tiles have been placed, the player with the lowest score wins. Game play calls for number, shape and spatial skills. A typical game takes 20-30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game contains:&lt;br/&gt;- Board&lt;br/&gt;- 21 Unique, double-sided Geominos tiles&lt;br/&gt;- 21 Cards, depicting each individual tile&lt;br/&gt;- Two one-minute sand timers&lt;br/&gt;- Storage bag&lt;br/&gt;- Scorepad&lt;br/&gt;- Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
