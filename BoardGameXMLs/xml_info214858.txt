							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Catriculan Hound</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catriculan hounds are lanky, wily dogs five feet at the shoulder and nearly ten feet from snout to tail. Though they bear superficial resemblance to normal hounds, they are of a foul disposition and temperament. If kept well fed and treated fairly, though, they&amp;rsquo;ll almost never turn on their owners. Almost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;t is not known what the moniker &amp;ldquo;Catriculan&amp;rdquo; is in reference to - perhaps some long-forgotten city where the creatures were bred, or a wizard who created them from whole cloth. Some scholars theorize that they are domesticated dire wolves, much as a normal dog is a domesticated wolf&amp;hellip; though that does not explain their foul demeanor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
