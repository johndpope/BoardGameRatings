							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Relic Expedition: Villages and Markets Expansion</name>
									
			<description>This expansion contains two new types of jungle tiles: villages and markets. Villages contain relics for which players must trade supplies; they make some relics more costly to obtain, and they give players a reason to carry duplicate supplies. Markets contain supplies for which players must trade relics; they give players another way to obtain the supplies they need, and they give players the opportunity to remove from the game a relic that their opponents need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains x4 of each new tile type, an additional standard supply token of each type (marked with red text), and 9 green triangular curse tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
