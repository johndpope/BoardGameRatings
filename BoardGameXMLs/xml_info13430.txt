							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The A-Team: The Adventures with B.A. Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This game is based on the popular 80s TV show. A series of Track Cards are laid out to form a road that acts as the game board. Players are dealt 4 Number Cards and a number of Vehicle Markers depending on the number of players. On a turn, a player places a Vehicle Marker on the next empty Track Card and follows the directions on the card. These allow you to draw a Number Card, ask another player for a specific type of Number Card, or to look at another player's hand and take the Number Card you want. If you have a pair of matching numbers, you place them in the discard pile and go again. Instead of placing a Vehicle Marker on the next Track Card, you may instead give it to another player. The game ends when someone plays their last Vehicle Marker, or when the End Card is reached on the track, in which case the player with the fewest Markers wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
