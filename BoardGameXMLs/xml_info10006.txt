			<description>TICK TACK MATH does for arithmetic what word games do for vocabulary. It is quickly learned and easily played, combining a mixture of strategy and luck. TICK TACK MATH is played on a board using numerical cards. Cards are dealt to both players and to the board. Players take turns making combinations of cards from their hands to match the board's cards. Colored chips are placed on board cards that have been matched. The first player to cover three in a row (across, down or diagonally) wins the game.TICK TACK MATH is challenging, suspenseful sic, thought-provoking FUN for children and ADULTS. It's an ideal parent-child game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
