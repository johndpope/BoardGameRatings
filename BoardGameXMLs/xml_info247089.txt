							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Greed (1979)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greed is a game for two players.  On each of their ten turns, the players throw the dice and add the result to their scores.  Players may throw the dice as many times as they like but if the first result of the turn is repeated, their score for that turn is zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program plays at varying skill levels.  It plays the best at level 100 (average score about 300) and the worst at level 0 (average score about 150).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greed as written by Ronald G. Ragsdale and published as type-in source code in Creative Computing Vol. 5, No. 6, June 1979.  It is noted as similar to NOTONE (and was submitted to the same competition).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
