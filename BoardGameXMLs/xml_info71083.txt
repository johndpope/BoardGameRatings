			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deck of Dice is not a single game so much as a game system.  By using a unique set of dice players can adapt any classic card game into a dice game!  The games play much faster and have twists that only dice can bring (like being able to re-roll your hand.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set of six dice per player allows for the potential of any combination of 6 values in six suits to be rolled.  The suits in Deck of Dice are Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs, Coins, and Blanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a sheet of labels to attach to standard six-sided dice allowing for 2-6 players (each with their own distinct colour) along with a die for rolling trump (in those games requiring it) and player screens for keeping player's hands secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the base rule booklet are adaptations of seven classic card games: Hearts, Euchre, Knockout Whist, Crazy Eights, Go Fish, My Ship Sails and Red Dog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
