			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Codename: Panzers Phase two was released a year after Codename: Panzers Phase one, and as such it offers more of the same. It is a tactical-style real-time strategy game, which means that the player doesn't have to fool around with resource gathering, base building, or unit production. Instead, it focuses wholly on guiding a small group of military units, mostly and preferably tanks and blowing large chunks of Europe and North Africa off the map. &lt;br/&gt;Like Phase One, Phase Two is divided into three different campaigns. In Phase Two the player gets to play as the Italians in North Africa (an often overlooked subject in games), the Americans in Sicily and Italy, and the Yugoslav partisans. Units gain experience (so it pays off to keep them alive). In between missions, the player can upgrade existing units or, within limits, purchase new ones, using the 'honour' deserved in the previous scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
