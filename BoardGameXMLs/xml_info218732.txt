							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Princess Remedy in a World of Hurt</name>
									
			<description>Remedy, a recent graduate from the Saturnian healing school, must descend to Hurtland and use her powers to heal everyone from stray ducks to dark lords, and finally cure the ailing Prince Hingst. It's a short, whimsical adventure with plenty of heart(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was one of Ludosity's entries in the Games Against Ebola charity game jam, made in four days of livestreamed development. Anton made the graphics, Mattias and Stefan made the music, and I did the rest. This version was made after the jam to include options, multiple savefiles, more difficulty levels, and gamepad support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
