			<description>Infamous 2 is a 2011 open world video game for the PlayStation 3 video game console developed by Sucker Punch Productions and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. The game is the sequel to the 2009 video game Infamous and will feature support for the PlayStation Move motion controller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game follows the events of Infamous with Cole McGrath as the main protagonist again. The game will take place in a new city called New Marais, a New Orleans-inspired city, and will involve Cole opposing the Beast. The game begins with Cole fighting the Beast and barely escaping with his life. He, along with his friend Zeke, flees to New Marais and prepares for Cole's inevitable encounter with the Beast while combating The Militia, a shadowy group led by a man named Bertrand. The Militia has taken over New Marais in an attempt to keep all superpowered or abnormal things away. Cole will combat the Militia, explore New Marais, and learn about himself, Kessler, and The First Sons along the way while gaining new abilities to confront the Beast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Infamous 2, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
