			<description>user summary:&lt;br/&gt;A fan-produced sourcebook on necromancy in  WFRP2.  Part of Liber Fanatica's Necromancy Project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;In this work I compiled, edited, and created what I believe to be a decent attempt in fleshing out one area of WFRP that we all love yet have very little to work with. Necromancy. Though this information will probably find far more use by Game Masters than Players it is here for both. In the beginning I only intended to use this work for my own campaign but over the last few weeks there has been a few others besides myself asking about the lack of official works on Necromancy and the fact that Night's Dark Masters is geared for Vampires and not Necromancers. I figured why keep what I am making to myself so I decided to share it with all of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
