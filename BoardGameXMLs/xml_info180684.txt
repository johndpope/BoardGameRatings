							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Prodigy</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Bard Class for OSRIC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even the poorest performer can feel the primal mystique of music when their art makes someone smile. But some serve as a natural lightning rod for that primal energy, forging it into something akin to magick. These bardic prodigies find themselves as wandering, na'er do well rogues, because this same energy spurs them to adventure. Less happily, their natural power can burn them if they stay in the same place for too long...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This OSR Bard class is designed for use with OSRIC and is compatible with the 1st advanced edition of the world's most famous fantasy role-playing game! Designed to be different from any version of the bard so far, yet familiar enough to grasp. More importantly, it's designed to be FUN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
