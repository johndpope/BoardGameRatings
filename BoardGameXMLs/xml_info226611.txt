			<description>Chemikum is a journey of discovery into the world of elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2-6 players from 10 to 99 years. Playing time: 4 players approx. 40 min.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemikum - a communication game that aims to inspire children and young people for chemistry. With fun, joy and happiness, step by step knowledge points are collected to reach the Bachelor or Master's degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemikum is a very simple board game that integrated the periodic table of the elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a unique mix of knowledge and advice game, up to 6 players fight to get points for a bachelor's degree. In another round, the Master's degree can be earned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two-sided printed schedule offers 2 difficulty levels:&lt;br/&gt;PSE with long name (lighter) or PSE only with short description of the elements. CHEMIKUM also provides the incentive, for all levels of knowledge, to take the opportunity to discover the chemistry, together with the possibility of compiling the difficulty level by selecting the question cards themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In four card categories, a wide range of chemistry is presented:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PASSWORD:&lt;br/&gt;Difficult to pronounce chemical compounds (for correct pronouncement one gets points), which are briefly explained on the map;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACTION:&lt;br/&gt;simple way to collect points or lose, there is reward and with luck you can get closer to the target field&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PSE-KNOWLEDGE:&lt;br/&gt;This question category is linked to the PSE indoor playfield&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALLTAGS-WISSEN-CHEMIE:&lt;br/&gt;Questions about the chemistry.
