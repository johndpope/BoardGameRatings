							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Football Field</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple football field it measures 360 by 160 ft and is mostly plain if you disregard that it is built with a slightest crown to allow excess water to flow off towards the sides and from the field. The lawn is kept short and no expense is spared to make sure it is in good condition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field has the markings you would expect from any professional field. Sidelines, goal lines, end lines,  numbered yard lines and hash marks. While the lines are chalked white, the lawn of the end zones between goal and end lines is decorated with the names of the teams sharing this particular field with the background held in the teams colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For any match one of the end zones will be decorated with name and colors or the logo of the opposing team instead. Just outside the rear end of both end zones stand T shaped the goal posts made of stainless steel. On either side of the field a number of hardwood benches are arranged at the sidelines to accommodate the coaching staff and the players currently out of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
