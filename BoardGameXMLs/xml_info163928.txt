							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bake the Cake!</name>
									
			<description>In Bake the Cake!, the players both cooperate and compete to bake the best cake. Players score by buying ingredients, preparing parts and baking cakes. Although the cakes belong to specific players, the players may freely use each others' ingredients and parts to bake them. All players participating in a cake will score but only when it is completed and only if the cake wins the final contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bake the Cake! is not about baking your own cake first but rather contribute most to the winning cake. To stop other players, you may take the ingredients they want, use the kitchen tools they need and even eat their ingredients (but not too many or you will get a stomache ache).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is quick and intensive as the players fight to get hold of the ingredients and the tools, not unlike what it would be in a real kitchen with too many bakers. Behind the playful theme hides a tactical game where each player must play her cards well to spread her colors to all cakes and at the same get as many other players to them as possible. Please don't try the game recipes at home and don't eat the winning cake!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game meachanisms include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Economy: The players use ingredients and tools to accomplish their objective. &lt;br/&gt;Interdependence: The players compete about the same resources but may also earn points for each other. &lt;br/&gt;Take that: Players may interfere each other by blocking tools or eating ingredients. &lt;br/&gt;Balanced victory condition: To win, a player must ensure that other players score as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
