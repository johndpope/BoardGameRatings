							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle Roll</name>
									
			<description>Battle Roll is a 2 player dueling dice game! It's quick, addictive, portable, and loads of fun! It comes with eight beautiful precision engraved and painted dice with incredible detail. It only takes about 5-10 minutes to play, making this a great game to pull out in an airport, waiting room, or anywhere else! Because of the short game length it's also great for using in a tournament scenario with groups of people. Don't let the game length and portability fool you into thinking that there isn't a lot of depth or variety in playing Battle Roll. The outcomes are nearly endless! A game could range from a complete blow-out, to a neck-and-neck down to the last roll, sudden death victory! It all depends on how the dice fall! Battle Roll is really fun to play, but it also looks cool! The combination of  custom polyhedral dice and acrylic life-stones are sure to attract attention and questions like &amp;quot;What are you playing?&amp;quot; It all fits nicely into a custom zippered pouch making it easy for Battle Rollers on the go to sneak in a quick game wherever they are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
