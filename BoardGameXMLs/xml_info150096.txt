			<description>RPG Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;laquo;Extra Edition!&amp;raquo; players form the editorial staff of a popular newspaper of the 50s: each of them will be the journalist responsible for a certain page, for instance the crime news, local news, showbiz news, sports news or whatever else they like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player wishes to be the photograph, he&amp;rsquo;s allowed to do it: there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be more than one photograph in the game though, as his task is simply to take one or two perfect photos to be published in the page, not pick up pieces of information (although he may help the other reporters with his contacts).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in any proper RPG, the players will cooperate, each one for his own competence area, to pick up pieces of information about a specific news event that has only just occurred and cover it with an article or two in an extra edition soon to be printed. It goes without saying that this event needs to have some exceptionality and the potential to shake the town quiet: a wicked murder or an extraordinary robbery are the obvious favorites but obviously the event could be anything the GM likes it to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
