							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Microlite74 Extended Edition</name>
									
			<description>From the Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microlite74 games are trimmed-down miniature versions of the Primary Fantasy SRD rules designed to be quick and easy to play, especially when compared to modern incarnations of the game. The goal of Microlite74 games is to recreate the style and feel of that very first (&quot;0e&quot;) fantasy roleplaying game published back in 1974 without giving up all of the clearer mechanics of modern D20-based versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Microlite74 Extended rules are based on the 1974 0e edition of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular fantasy roleplaying game with its supplements and material from 0e magazine articles, some 0e third party material, some of the house rules the author used in the 1970s, and selected ideas from other roleplaying games. These rules are not intended to be a clone of the 0e rules, but rather a conversion of them to a rules-lite D20-based system that encourages old-school play without strictly old-school rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains the complete rules for Microlite74 Extended. This book includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Simple Character Creation Rules: Roll 4 attributes and select a race, class, background, and alignment.&lt;br/&gt;     Standard Classes: Fighter, Ranger, Paladin, Monk, Magic-User, Illusionist, Cleric, Druid, and Thief&lt;br/&gt;     Simple and fast-playing combat system that tracks physical damage (aka body points) separately from luck/skill/fatigue (aka hit point) damage.&lt;br/&gt;     Hit points recover with a night's rest. Spells cost hit points to cast. Actual wounds recover more slowly.&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for hirelings, monster reactions (not every monster wants to fight), morale (not every monster fights to the death), and more.&lt;br/&gt;     A complete list of spells and monsters.&lt;br/&gt;     Compatible with most other 0e based games and adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other versions include Microlite74 Basic and Microlite74 Standard. Microlite74 Basic rules are complete but basic: There are only three classes (Fighter, Magic-User, and Cleric). Spells are limited and levels top out at 12 to 14. Microlite74 Standard includes many more classes and spells - all over those included in the original edition and its supplements. Microlite74 Companion volumes add even more options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
