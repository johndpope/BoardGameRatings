			<description>The core of codingFarmers is a standard roll-and-move race.  However, instead of simply moving the distance rolled, you choose one of two code cards you draw and obey its instructions.  Most cards refer to the die roll you made and will move you.  Advanced cards involve simple loops and conditionals.  The cards are expressed in Java code, so the act of deciding which of the two cards to use requires you to parse simple Java.  The board has features (trees, rivers, rocks, etc) that have a normal meaning, and which can be referred to by conditional cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;codingFarmers is the first ever board game to introduce kids to real programming. It is created exclusively by three high school students (Kikhil, Vineet and Anika) who are very passionate about programming and wanted to spread the awareness among kids. In this game, you are the coding farmer. After a long day at work, you decide to race to the barn with your friends. Since you code, your tractors operate on code cards.  You have to strategically decode and use the correct set of cards to reach the bard first. This game provides two sets of cards. Action cards have instructions in English as well as Java code.  code cards have instructions only in Java code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
