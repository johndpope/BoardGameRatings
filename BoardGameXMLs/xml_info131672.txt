			<description>An educational game aimed at teaching the rules of conduct on ski pistes (&amp;quot;Pistenregeln&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game combines roll-and-move elements with trivia game elements. The board shows four different skiing areas. Players move their player tokens up the ski lift according to their die roll results. Once they've reached the top, they can ski downhill (again using die roll results), but first they have to answer a question connected with skiing, such as &amp;quot;What is forbidden on a chair lift?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;What is important when overtaking other skiers?&amp;quot; etc. Apart from questions on the rules of conduct, there are general skiing trivia questions like &amp;quot;Where was skiing invented?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;When did the first skiing race in Central Europe take place?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete four downhill races wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
