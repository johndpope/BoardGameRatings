			<description>It's a game for two players.&lt;br/&gt;On a 9X8 checkered board they must move their colored pieces (4 blue, 4 yellow and 4 red) to capture their opponent's pieces; but during the game for every enemy piece captured, you have on the board one new piece of a complementary color (orange, green or purple. &lt;br/&gt;From then on what you can capture and with what is decided by a complex color chart. When a complementary color is captured, you can obtain a new black piece (the chameleon)with special rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
