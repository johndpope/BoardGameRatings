			<description>Let's Play Tag simulates the classic children game of Tag on a board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose their own playing pieces and one of them (he or she who spins the lowest number) becomes &amp;quot;It&amp;quot;.  The &amp;quot;It&amp;quot; sets aside his or her piece and uses the &amp;quot;It&amp;quot; arrow-shaped marker instead, placing it in the central Safety Zone.  The other players start off in the red squares marked with S.  The players take turns to play, spinning the dial twice to obtain the number of moves they can make.  Players can move their pieces in any direction; &amp;quot;It&amp;quot;, however, must move in the direction of its arrow until it reaches a red square, whereupon it can turn in any direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If &amp;quot;It&amp;quot; lands on a player's piece, that player becomes &amp;quot;It&amp;quot;, exchanging his or her piece for the marker; the former &amp;quot;It&amp;quot; takes back his piece and starts in the Safety Zone.  If a player's piece lands onto &amp;quot;It&amp;quot;'s rear from behind, he or she scores 10 points.  Nobody can become &amp;quot;It&amp;quot; or score points in the Safety Zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player scores a total of 50 points and is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
