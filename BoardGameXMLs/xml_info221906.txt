							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Smugglers&#039; Cavern - Level 5</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The smugglers set up shop here recently. They were drawn to the cave and natural beach, which they modified into a semi-fortified hideout. They were unaware of the ancient cult that once built its temple and burial grounds in the same cave system, and thus had no qualms about looting some of the dark artifacts they found. Because they never found the other caves they have yet to be scared off by the undead cultists still lurking there. The Captain and spell caster may be tied to a reincarnation of the cult, or they could simply visit the same tattoo parlor. Either way, it's a tough crew and a spooky place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
