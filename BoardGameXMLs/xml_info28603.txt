			<description>A &amp;quot;Firefly&amp;quot;-themed card game similar to Mille Bornes.  Make money, but keep flyin'.&lt;br/&gt;From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Well, you&amp;rsquo;ve just pulled of a heist of valuable medications from St. Lucy&amp;rsquo;s Hospital in Ariel City on the planet Ariel. All you need to do is fly out to the border planets and sell them. However, the Hands of Blue are in pursuit! In order to escape them, you must fly through the Black and avoid all the hazards that will slow you down and get you pinched by them. If you fly far enough in the &amp;lsquo;Verse, you should be safe to sell off your stolen cargo. They won&amp;rsquo;t fly 86 million miles for a box of band-aids, will they? &lt;br/&gt;In this game you try to fly 86 million miles through space to escape the Hands of Blue. But you must be wary, because your competition is doing the same and will tip off your enemies to your location (by playing cards to stop or slow you down), of course, you can do the same! &lt;br/&gt;In the basic game, designed for 4 players, the object is to be the first crew to accumulate $5000 in platinum (that is the point system) over several rounds of play. In doing so, you must try to complete a trip of exactly 86 million miles in each round of play.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
