			<description>Daring Racers is a print &amp;amp; play, semi-statistical solitaire game on motor racing, with single yearbook dedicated to several different Formula 1 or NASCAR season.&lt;br/&gt;Each Yearbook has data for all the drivers (or drivers that started at least two races or complete one in NASCAR),&lt;br/&gt;Each driver is rated for qualifying ability and racing ability; there are also data for his/her propensity to retire (for mechanical reasons or for an accident).&lt;br/&gt;Each race is resolved through a series of dice rolls where each driver gains or loses positions against a &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; point. Through this system the starting grid is frayed very soon and the race develops in a constant fight, made of passes and change of positions.&lt;br/&gt;Till now the following Yearbooks has been released:&lt;br/&gt;NASCAR 1949 to 1959&lt;br/&gt;Formula 1 1950 to 1999&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
