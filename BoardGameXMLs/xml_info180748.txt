			<description>Architectus is a game in which players face the challenge of creating a city.&lt;br/&gt;Players have cards that represent different buildings: library, theater etc. and there is a map on which players can place these buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn each player plays a card and builds a construction. This will give different points depending on where the construction is located and the buildings that are next door.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a card of neighborhood that gives extra points if certain buildings are constructed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all cards are played, the player with most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
