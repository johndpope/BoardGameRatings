							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Toyman&#039;s Fair</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the Ennie Award-nominated Construct Companion, The Toyman's Fair is a complete adventure module for Rolemaster. It is designed for adventurers from levels 8-11, but guidance is given on how to scale the encounters for both lower and higher-level parties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Local farmers have reported strange beasts are abroad, attacking the unwary. A chance meeting reveals that these are no flesh-and-blood monsters but mechanical creations. Suspicion falls on the eccentric Parsuik Volmaire, the magical inventor known as the Toyman. The adventurers must enter his tower and discover what has befallen the Toyman, battling further clockwork nightmares and the machinations of an evil order known as the Hand of Fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Toyman's Fair includes complete Rolemaster statistics for new construct creatures and six members of the Hand of Fate, with color floor plans and interior illustrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
