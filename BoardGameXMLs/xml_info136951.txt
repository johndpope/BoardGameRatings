			<description>Pixel Quest its a cooperative card game for 1 to 4 players, based on classic 8-bit RPGs. In this adventure game you will play as a party of heroes, travelling around to complete different quests. You&amp;rsquo;ll get an objective card at the start of the game: once the quests in it are complete, you&amp;rsquo;ll fight the final Boss. If you defeat him you&amp;rsquo;ll have won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each quest, you need to build a deck so your group of heroes can explore it. During these adventures the heroes will fight dangerous monsters, avoid deadly traps and find priceless treasures. But there is more than adventure in a hero&amp;rsquo;s life &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;ll also get rest at inns, drink at taverns and buy objects that will help them in future quests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The greatest 8-bit RPG of all times, and you will not be playing it on a video game console, but on a table. Do you dare?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
