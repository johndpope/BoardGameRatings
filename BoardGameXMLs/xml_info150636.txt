			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's 1924 and a small English village has been beset by a spate of apparent demonic possessions. Luckily, the local preacher is on hand to drive away the evil spirits and indeed deliver the corrupted bodies to healing. The villagers are starting to get a little anxious now their loved-ones aren't being returned to them however. Is the preacher all he seems? Is the village as innocent and unsuspecting as it first appeared? And how does one explain the Angel that has been guiding the church here?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is ideal for 2-5 investigators and is easily relocatable from it's default setting with a little work.. It contains strong elements of the Cthulhu Mythos, but should be enjoyable even to those with limited familiarity with the cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recommended Systems: Any system designed to emulate a real-world setting should be able to run this scenario with few issues. Due to the Cthulhoid elements, Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu, Pelgrane's Trail of Cthulhu or the Savage Worlds Realms of Cthulhu rulesets would be ideal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
