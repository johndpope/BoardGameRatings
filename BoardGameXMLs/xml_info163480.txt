			<description>Dragon Raiders is a game where players take on the role of the Dragon, raiding the fantasy kingdom for food (to grow bigger and stronger) and treasures (to gain an advantage over the other Dragons).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play consists of a series of Raid phases, broken up into turns by an Accounting phase (where certain play elements get reset). Each Raid phase consists of three sub-phases; movement, reactive board elements, and combat, in that order. Players accomplish each sub-phase in an order determined by their power ranking. Players choose where to move based on what they think they can successfully raid, or may choose to go on adventures in the deepest forest. After the Dragons move, Knights will come out of their keeps to fight any Dragon nearby (i.e., adjacent to the keep).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat consists of rolling 1d6 and adding your Power attribute; you must beat the Defense score of the board element in order to win. A Dragon who does not win his combat must retreat, losing half of his carried treasure as he does so. Dragons must fight other Dragons in the same space first; both roll 1d6 and add their Power, highest total wins. The loser gives half of his treasure to the winner and retreats. Ties result in both dragons retreating without losing any treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end-game is triggered when a Dragon defeats the King, who sits in his castle at the center of the kingdom. The current Raid phase is finished out, and victory points are totaled. The highest total is considered the strongest Dragon and wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
