			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...and justice for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, Undergrounder, you finally made it. You've reached the place all roads lead to. The belly of the beast. The ninth layer of Hell. The top floor of Babel. The diseased liver of the nation. Washington D.C.: Democracy City. Yeah, you've finally found the HQ of the real bad guys. They're not like the villains we fought in the Slumberland VR program. They don't jam around with capes and masks and wigged-out codenames. They don't stick you in death traps and gloatingly spill their whole plot to you as you wriggle free of your bonds. They don't even bother with Punkbusters or EP450s. Their weapon is the stroke of the pen, the subclause of death here is not the metallic patang of a round being ratcheted into the chamber. It's the whispering sound a briefcase full of money makes when it gets slid across a mahogany desk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ways and Means comes packed with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Complete information on the Nation's Capitol.&lt;br/&gt;     Tons of dirt on the movers and shakers of Democracy City for your vet to dig up.&lt;br/&gt;     Scenarios to get your punks primed for action in the big city.&lt;br/&gt;     Pull-out pages on the people, places, and things of D.C. for you to slip into your Underground Notebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
