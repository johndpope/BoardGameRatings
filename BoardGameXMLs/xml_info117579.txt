			<description>Bike or Die! is a trial bike game released in 2004 for Palm OS devices, and in 2008 for iOS devices. Players try to ride a bike with simulated physics, to collect flags as quickly as possible. Bike or Die! allows players to submit their replays to Toyspring's server.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay involves using the Palm's keys to control the movement of the biker. The player must guide the biker through all of the checkpoint flags, if there are any. The level is completed when the biker reaches the finish flag; if there is no finish flag, then the biker only has to pass the checkpoints. In each level, there are usually obstacles and challenging terrain that will cause the biker to crash and fall of the bike. When this happens, the player must restart the level. A player crashes when they either run into mines, which can be randomly or strategically placed in the levels, or when the biker's body hits the ground or a wall. Later version introduced sticky and slippy surfaces, along with portals, which are quite difficult to work with, but produce interesting results. All of these features are supported by the level editor, Bike or Design. The bike is very springy and can wheelie, flip, or do jumps. However, if the bike has too much force when hitting an object, the bike will go through the ground, the biker will crash, and the level must be restarted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay progresses through a levelpack, which includes a number of levels. Only the first two levels of each pack are available to be played; to access more, one of the prior two levels have been beaten. Bike or Die! comes with 25 levels, and additional levels can be downloaded from the Bike or Die! web site. 163 of these levels are currently in the Time Trial competition. Most of these levels were made by players, and selected for the Time Trial by popular demand. Levels are occasionally added to the Time Trial in groups of 10-16 levels. Levelpacks usually consist of about 15 levels, but packs range from three to over 100 levels each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bike or die&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
