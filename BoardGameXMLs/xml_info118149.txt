							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BattleCON: Ernie the Geek Promo</name>
									
			<description>Ernie the Geek, mascot of BoardGameGeek, joins BattleCON as a promotional character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ernie begins the game by distributing his game counters across the board, then collects them back over the course of a duel to gradually increase his capabilities. Will you prioritize certain stats to take advantage of your enemy's weaknesses, or try to build up gradually for a solid, well-rounded fight? And how will your enemies respond to your attempts to collect more? With his signature attack &amp;quot;Tableflip&amp;quot; and his finisher &amp;quot;Raise the Stakes&amp;quot; (that forces you to play another game from your collection in order to resolve), Ernie is a force of geekdom to be reckoned with!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
