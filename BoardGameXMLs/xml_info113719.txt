							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ninja Family Picnic</name>
									
			<description>A simultaneous action board game for 2 to 4 Ninja. Quick to learn but hiding ancient ninja secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As 4 visitors walk and look around the park, you must enjoy your picnic meal, spend time with your ninja family, and take part in various fun activities -all without being seen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each ninja plays 3 cards face down each round, then simultaneously resolves them one at a time.  Among them; Dash Forward, Zig Left, Zag Right, Sneak, Family-time, Distract, Push, Hide, and your own Ninja's special ability.  When a Yin-Yang card is played, your action is determined by the face of your Salt &amp;amp; Pepper Marker (which then switches).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the 7th Visitor leaves the park, it is time to go, and the Ninja who has had the most fun (collected the most tokens) wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
