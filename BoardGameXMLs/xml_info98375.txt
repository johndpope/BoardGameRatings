			<description>As with all Family Pastimes games, players work cooperatively. In this roll and move game, the players' joint goal is to move the six members of a goat family over a bridge and along a path safely into a barn before being caught by a troll. The troll catches the goats to eat or to keep as pets, so when a goat might be captured by the troll, players try to lure the troll away with one of six different treats (such as donuts and cookies).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed to teach children logic, consultation and decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
