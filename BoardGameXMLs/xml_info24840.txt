			<description>This is nothing more than a book outlining 14 outdoor activities (including several games) that can be played with the included sidewalk chalk (in 6 colors, hence the suggested maximum number of players in this entry).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some games are no-brainers (Hopscotch, Tic-Tac-Toe) others are a bit unusual (drawing a race track and alternately flicking chalk to draw lines of advancement around the track).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Essentially, it's a structured set of sidewalk chalk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
