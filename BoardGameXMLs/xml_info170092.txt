			<description>Pounce is a fast paced dexterity game for 2-8 players that can be played as either individuals or in teams. Throughout the game small cups move around the table and players attempt to bounce a ball into the cup in front of them. If the player on your right completes this task before you, they can stack their cup on top of yours. The stacked player has to take a tower penalty shot &amp;ndash; potentially losing one of their lives and suffering a temporary handicap. The game ends when only one player or team has lives remaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
