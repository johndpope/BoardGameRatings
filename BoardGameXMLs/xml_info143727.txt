			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fehr's Ehtnology: Urisk profiles the urisk race for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Urisks, called &amp;lsquo;Mountain Billies&amp;rsquo; by rural humans, are a homely, but stalwart faerie race that lives in isolated mountain caves and valleys. They live by wandering, hunting, and doing odd jobs for humans, staying to a home range but moving frequently within that range. Though they are tough and have some considerable powers, they are not warlike, but can be dangerous when riled. They possess no cohesive society, but sit forlornly at the sidelines of others&amp;rsquo; wishing for inclusion, the epitome of loneliness. Some scholars, especially the elves, purport that urisks play some role in the overarching Scheme of Things, as a nature spirit of fire, or simply exist as a flighty representative of this element, and with no purpose at all&amp;hellip; What is known is that they are native to Porphyra, though they probably did not notice the Calling of the Lost Gods&amp;mdash;what would it have to do with them, up in the mountains?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This release includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     ecology of urisk&lt;br/&gt;     racial characteristics for urisk characters (including alternate racial characteristics)&lt;br/&gt;     a selection of racial feats&lt;br/&gt;     traits for the urisk race (if you use traits)&lt;br/&gt;     sample urisk 1st level character&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
