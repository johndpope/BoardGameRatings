			<description>Deduction game.&lt;br/&gt;Components: 54 wooden tiles featuring faces with a variety of eyes, noses and smiles, 18 control cards showing 18 face variations, red and white plastic counters.&lt;br/&gt;Game for 2 players, one the informant and one the detective. 54 tiles are placed face up in the lid of the box or on the table. The informant selects one card from the 18 control cards and copies the face onto a piece of paper secretly The card is returned to the pack and the paper hidden from the detective. One of the colours, red, yellow or white is also written on the paper.&lt;br/&gt;The detective then attempts to deduce the features of the face by presenting a tile. The informant places a red infomation counter  for each correct feature; eyes, nose, mouth, colour. This continues until the detective knows the selected identity. Twice per round the informant can refuse to give any information and indicates this by placing a white counter. At the end of the round players reverse roles. The winner is the player who, as detective, collected the fewest information counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
