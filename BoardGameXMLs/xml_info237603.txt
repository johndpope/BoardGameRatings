			<description>Chaos in Hell! The soul contracts concluded by the demons have somehow got mixed up and the souls have been credited to the wrong demons. Since one can not even rely on the bureaucracy in hell, it is up to the demons themselves to get their property back. That would not be a problem, if demons were not so devious...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seelenchaos (Chaos of Souls) is an unusual card game for 3 torn cross-thinkers, in which no player plays with his own cards, but with those of the right neighbor. The neighbor orders the card to be played by a player, but whether or not the card is really played, is left up to the demonic conscience alone. You get points for every trick you make, but the card itself goes back to its owner. And bring him the card value as points. You can not give the other demons the points, of course - it would be much better if the opponents' high cards burned each other.&lt;br/&gt;The right assessment of the other players, clever tactics and a little luck at the right moment are necessary to gain the most points in this chaotic-confusing but highly tactical card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
