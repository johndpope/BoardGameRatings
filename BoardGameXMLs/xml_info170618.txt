			<description>オカシノビ is a game modeling the epic struggle between the ninjas of the Mushroom and Bamboo Shoot factions.  It employs hidden team affiliations, asymmetric player powers and inter-player combat using a rock-paper-scissors resolution.  In addition to the Mushrooms and Bamboo Shoots, each game also incorporates a set of neutral factions: so the agendas of each player are never clear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players manage a hand of six cards: all different; each with a faction symbol (Mushroom, Bamboo Shoot or Neutral) in addition to the image of a rock, paper or scissors hand gesture. In a player's turn she may:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Pass a card from hand secretly to another player to inquire as to their faction loyalties.  For the most part, a player responds &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; if their affiliation matches the card, and &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; otherwise.  Some player affiliations require a false response to any query!&lt;br/&gt;    Attack another player.  Both players select a card from hand, then reveal together.  If tied, another card is played.  Cards played are unavailable for re-use until all six cards have been played: at that point all are reclaimed.&lt;br/&gt;    Reclaim one played card to her hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The various player powers affect the actions:  some are strong one-shot powers; others more modest powers that always apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until one faction has achieved their victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
