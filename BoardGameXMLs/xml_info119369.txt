			<description>A spin-off from the regular Subbuteo game of football. This was a Five-A-Side version, with an enclosed pitch so that the ball didn't always fly of the table. The mechanic of finger flicking the players remains the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subbuteo is a classic finger-flicking soccer-simulation action game. It is played on a large cloth playing field called a &amp;quot;pitch&amp;quot;, with teams of players that are represented by miniature men mounted on smooth round bases. The men are made to kick the ball by flicking their bases, which causes the men to slide around on the pitch, hitting the ball. The rules simulate nearly all details of a soccer game including ball possession and passing, throw-ins, goal kicks and corner kicks. There is even a large section in the rules devoted to fouling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two editions were produced. One with a folding pitch, the other with a solid pitch. Obviously, the solid pitch edition was in a box twice the size of the folding pitch edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Subbuteo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
