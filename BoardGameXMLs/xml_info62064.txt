Players will collect money from the bank and other players if they manage to score under par on each hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each hole, each player puts one's pawn on the tee (start space) and roll one or both dice. The pawn is advanced the number of spaces indicated. The player follows the instructions on the space on which the pawn rests; Ball in Motion means a free turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most money at the end of the game (nine or eighteen holes) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a glossary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
