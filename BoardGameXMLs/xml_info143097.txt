							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rock Bottom</name>
									
			<description>Rock Bottom is game geared towards adult players who try to eliminate the other players by making them hit rock bottom. This is accomplished by playing cards on either the other player or yourself to either give or take assets. The objective is to make all other players lose all their money, their spouse,their children, their job and their home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rock Bottom features cards that fit players with a somewhat twisted sense of humor, as the cards that are played inspire trash talking the friends that you are playing with. Simple rules keep the game moving fast, and the laughs always following.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
