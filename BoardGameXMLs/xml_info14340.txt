			<description>Link-Up is a tile placement game for 2-6 players ages 6 to adult that takes 60 to 90 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every Link-Up tile has up to four open chain links. Each of these links may be one of the four link colors: red, blue, green, or yellow. A player has a pool of up to five tiles that they keep hidden from other players behind a screen. On their turn, a player plays any number of tiles from their hand and scores points for each chain or loop completed by the tiles played. At the end of their turn a player draws up to two tiles to a maximum hand size of five.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points when the tiles run out is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.linkupgame.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.linkupgame.com&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
