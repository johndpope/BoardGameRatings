			<description>In preparation for the apocalypse that is the 2016 election, the assorted college students at Dawn of Time Studios made a simple political card game for 3 to 5 players that explores the most interesting and prevalent topics that pervade our legislative environment: corruption, bribes, and chasing your dreams of power and influence. Not only does every card you play have grave ramifications for the world at large, it also has a sardonic quote and description that was handcrafted by people who think they are funny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regent is a game about dark humor and betrayal, where your expertly executed play is rewarded by an unnerving realization that the world of politics is not that far removed from the depravity of this card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cornerstone of Regent is the legislative mechanic. The regent has been given two to four policies and several bribes of varying values. Choosing a policy has several motivations - you can just choose the policy that gives you the most benefit or the one that harms the other players or choose because of the wonderful lobbying of the other players (i.e., several million dollars). Although the game runs on a purely mathematical system, the social aspect is what makes this game truly tense, entertaining, and thought provoking. Each chosen policy benefits one player or another, and in the end, whoever has the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
