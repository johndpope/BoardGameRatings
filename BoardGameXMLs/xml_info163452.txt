			<description>An FBI Hostage Rescue Unit game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The point of this game is to rescue hostages and kill terrorists with automatic weapons. One side is the Terrorists, and the other side is the FBI&amp;rsquo;s Hostage Rescue unit. Each person can control up to 3 people in a fire team, and they use the same map to control them in the Action phase. The map can be anything from a blueprint to an actual model. The objective of the Terrorists is to get their demands met, or kill the FBI Hostage Rescue guys, forcing the FBI to back down. The point for the FBI is to free the hostages. The hostages follow the team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
