			<description>The players are miners, whose objective is to transport bags of silver from their mine to the harbor of Vera Cruz (end space).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a simple roll and move game. When the meeples land on a marked space, the players have to follow the instructions in the rules. While passing through the &amp;quot;Indian Gorge&amp;quot; the meeples are in danger from an Indian, who is moved, whenever an odd number is rolled. The player who is the first to reach the end space is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
