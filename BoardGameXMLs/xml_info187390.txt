							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rebellious Archetypes Volume IV</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be a Rebel with a Cause!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not every evil lurks in deep, dark dungeons far away from innocent townsfolk, waiting patiently for adventurers to kick down their doors and start fighting. Some monsters don't just prey on society from without, but have burrowed and wormed their way into the very heart of the civilized world, and twist and corrupt the very laws that are supposed to protect the innocent, using them to oppress and exploit them, instead. These evils are no less a threat than the ones that most adventurers face, but many PCs are ill-equipped to deal with them. This is a job for rebels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents five new rebellious archetypes for five different classes. Included are the freemage, an arcanist archetype for those who believe that magic should not serve the caster, but rather be allowed to act freely and anarchically, and who can gamble their magical power when casting spells, or turn their enemies' magic against them, the order of the broken tower, a cavalier order devoted to protecting the common folk against oppressive tyrants, who specializes in guerilla tactics and serves as an inspiration for rebellions, the green wilds rebel, a druid archetype for those who believe that nature should rise up and throw off the yoke of civilization, which can turn plants and animals against mankind, and is resistant to the lures of civilization, the revolutionary bloodline, for sorcerers born from revolution, which has a mix of powers allowing them to inspire others, and cause great damage with fires, and finally the martyrbond revolutionary, a spiritualist archetype for spiritualists whose phantoms were martyred in life, and who fight alongside their phantom to continue that rebellion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're about to embark on a politically-themed campaign (such as the official Paizo adventure path focusing on revolution), or you just want a selection of exciting new abilities for passionate and freedom-loving PCs, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer. Even GMs can get in on the fun, as several of the archetypes here are perfect for rebellious villains as well, and can make for exciting and memorable encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
