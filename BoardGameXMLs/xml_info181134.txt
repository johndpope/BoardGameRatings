							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Baron K&#039;oz</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am immortal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I have all the time I need to rule everything. The Kiton Empire is already mine. The rest of the Nanoverse will follow. And then, I shall move on to conquer all other realities. It is as inevitable as your own eventual death.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the Nanoverse, the subatomic quantum reality found within the smallest scale of our own world, the ultimate threat is the PL 10 Baron K'oz. Once a revered and brilliant scientist, Baron K'oz learned the secret of existing as pure mental energy, and used that secret to conquer his native Kiton Empire. He nearly conquered all of the Nanoverse, but was stopped by the shrinking heroes Myrmidon and Vespa, who then returned to the normal world. But Baron K'oz was stalled, not defeated, and now knows there are other worlds waiting for his iron grip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
