			<description>From the back of the box: &amp;quot;Play your cards right and keep possession of the ball.  build up the attack with your team cards and just hope that you aren't tackled.  The referee will award you a free kick if you're fouled, or even a penalty if you're quick enough.  Shoot!  You need goals to win, in this fast action football gane!  Collect your favourite players and clubs.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a simple card game where players lay cards from a face-down pack hoping they will form a sequence that would allow them to shoot.  If not, the opposing player could attempt to intercept.  This could lead to a successful tackle or a foul, which in turn could lead to a penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be played with one or two packs of Top Team cards.  Each pack represents a different team from the upper reaches of the 1979 English First Division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself is pure chance.  Prominent players of the era were represented as 'artist's impressions'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
