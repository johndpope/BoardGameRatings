			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You hail from the icy north, a land of snowy, jagged peaks. You are trained to kill; you are molded to survive. You are a legend among warriors. You are a barbarian.&lt;br/&gt;Barbarians Versus is an easy to learn, fast-paced, action-oriented roleplaying game. You play a barbarian from the cold north, far from your homeland in search of honor and treasure. Bring back riches and trophies, and you will be the pride of your clan. Bring back the most riches and trophies, and you will be a legend among barbarians.&lt;br/&gt;However, the normal raiding season has turned out to be unusual. Word has spread among the various barbarian parties throughout the countryside -- castles, cities, and villages are empty and deserted. In their place, reptilian aliens from beyond the sky have built sprawling slave camps and massive factories. These evil creatures are armed with unusual weapons -- iron sticks that shoot lightning, delicate stones that explode upon impact with humans, flying chariots that arc through the sky, and invisible walls that shock those why try to escape. To gain honor this year, the barbarians will have to take the battle to these alien invaders or go home empty-handed. Of course, what self-respecting barbarian would do that?&lt;br/&gt;If you like to make up stories about savage barbarians and the creatures they smash to tiny bits, Barbarians Versus is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
