			<description>It is a game for two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dog is faster than the sheep.&lt;br/&gt;The sheep are always still, grazing.&lt;br/&gt;When the dog gets near the sheep they start running along with him. As soon as the dog moves away they stop and start to graze again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Each player has one sheep dog and sixteen sheep, white or black.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-The dog is placed on the cross next to the player, the cross is also next to the sheepfold in which he has to introduce his sheep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The youngest player begins.&lt;br/&gt;Taking turns each player places the other player&amp;rsquo;s sheep on the board, one by one. They can&amp;rsquo;t touch sheep of the same colour nor the wire fence that surrounds the field. You can put sheep next to sheep from the other flock.&lt;br/&gt; -The sheep, the bigger the flock gets, are more difficult to be moved by the dog in the way that:&lt;br/&gt;The dog moves up to 5 squares in any direction.&lt;br/&gt;Sheep can only be moved by the dog horizontally or vertically, never diagonally, in the following way:&lt;br/&gt;    Dog (alone)        up to 5 squares&lt;br/&gt;    Dog + 1 sheep        up to 4 squares&lt;br/&gt;    Dog + 2 sheep        up to 3 squares&lt;br/&gt;    Dog + 3 sheep        up to 2 squares&lt;br/&gt;    Dog + 4 sheep or more    up to 1 square&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dog can join and leave the sheep as many times as he likes as long as he does not move more than the total number of 5 squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;up to&amp;quot; means that there is no need to move the total number of allowed movements if one does not want to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dog can only move sheep of his own sheepfold. The other sheep ignore him and will not move no matter how loud it may bark! They will just stay still, grazing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player that first gets all his sheep in his sheepfold is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
