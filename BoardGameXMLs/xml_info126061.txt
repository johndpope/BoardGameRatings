							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Home Invasion</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a nice middle class neighborhood with a nice mix of professional families and a nice, powerful homeowners association. Good people who get involved and know their neighbors. People who aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid to tell you that the shade of blue you are painting your house is not exactly allowed by the association covenant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But lately things have been unsettled around Poppleton Terrace &amp;ndash; property values are falling, crime is rising, long-time residents have been less than receptive to the suggestions of the standards committee, and now new people are moving in. People who are not like us. At all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Invasion shares a number of locations with other playsets, making it a lovely candidate for multi-session play. Tales from Suburbia, in the Fiasco book, is one. Sharp-eyed enthusiasts will note others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
