			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town sits upon a mountainous crag, accessible by a single bridge. Nulukkhur was once a prosperous and wealthy trading post between the dwarf clans of the Smoking Mountains and the humans and gnomes of the midlands. Human, Gnomish and Dwarven traders all set up offices here and the town market used to be a bustling and crowded place. Part of the town clings to the cliffside and part of the town is actually built inside of the mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside the mountain you will find the homes, forges and clan halls of the dwarven inhabitants as well as mercantile offices, city offices, the fortress of the town watch and many homes of the very wealthy which extend upwards outside of the mountain in vast towers of luxury and security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exterior of the mountain is covered in homes clinging to the cliffside as well as numerous walkways and rope bridges that connect the many levels of the outer city. The Market is a large wooden deck secured with ropes and spikes into the mountainside. The King and Blade Tavern as well as a few shops can be found in the outer city near the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is governed by an arcane sorcerer, a female gnome named Sanzur. Since Sanzur took over the running of the town many of the wealthy merchants have steered lcear of the volitile little gnome. Sanzur was once an adventurer and decided to retire in Nulukkhur. She bought the largest tower home in the city and convinced the old mayor to turn over the town to her. She has been known to use magic on those who have crossed her in the past though some of her enemies have simply vanished or had nasty falls from one of the town's rope bridges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Instant Towns pdfs provide GMs with interesting NPCs and locations to use with or against your player group. Instant Towns can be interesting stops along the road, temporary bases from which to loot nearby ruins or side quests in between major campaign events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pdf provides a brief description of each Town including tavern, meals and costs, patrons and some rumors, town goings on, any stores, brothels or other significant places of interest in town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
