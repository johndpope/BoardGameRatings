							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Q4</name>
									
			<description>The game is played on four trays, each tray having four by four holes where marbles can be placed. The trays are placed side by side on the board and each player starts the game with 12 marbles. On each players turn he can place one of his marbles on any tray as he chooses and thus trying to make four in a row (or a Q4 as it's called in the game rules). The Q4 can be on a single tray or spanning all the trays (that is, three dimensional).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a player has played all his marbles he can start to move them around (on the same tray or between trays). After placing a marble he can claim a Q4. If the Q4 is on a single tray it should be fairly obvious whether it's a Q4 or not. If the Q4 spans all the trays, they must be stacked (the leftmost being on the bottom, the rightmost on the top) and then it can be checked whether the claim for a Q4 is true or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first one to make a Q4 wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    3D Tic Tac Toe - which is played on 3x3x3 grid&lt;br/&gt;    Four Letter Words - though with words&lt;br/&gt;    Qubic - which is also played, with placement only, on 4x4x4 grid but with 32 markers for each player&lt;br/&gt;    Tetrano - which is the same game represented on a 4x4 board.&lt;br/&gt;    Qubic - which has a version for 3 players also&lt;br/&gt;    Score Four - 4x4 grid of pegs that are filled from the bottom up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
