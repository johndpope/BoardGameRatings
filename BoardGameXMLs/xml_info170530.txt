							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Curiosities from the Dancing Hut</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For centuries, a Slavic witch has haunted the forests and remote lands of Russia. Her name is Baba Yaga, and the peasants regard her as with an uneasy mix of hope and dread. Baba Yaga is a potent and dreadful creature governed by her own inscrutable impulses. One year, she might appear to blight the crops of an entire village; the next, she may return laden with priceless gifts for the same suffering townsfolk. Legends of her cruelty abound, but so do tales of her generosity, and every third person has a story of a kinsman who was given some strange treasure by the ancient crone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baba Yaga makes her home in the Dancing Hut, a crude shack of wattle and daub teetering atop a pair of giant chicken legs that travels across the frigid Russian tagia. This storied dwelling contains untold treasures. Each chamber opens onto another hallway and each hallway onto a score of new chambers. Every cupboard and cloakroom is littered with trinkets and artifacts, some created by Baba Yaga herself, others collected from the farthest reaches of the globe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
