							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vigilantian: Eternal Vigilance</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vigilantian: Eternal Vigilance is a sourcebook for Vigilantian RPG. This book offers four key features for  your campaign. Character LifePath, Sample NPC characters, Super-Normal Powers, and Vehicles. In the first chapter expands on the Character Creation system, adding to it a LifePath system (derived from Atomik Lifepath), new Character Templates, and new Skills. The second chapter &amp;quot;Supporting Cast&amp;quot; covers a few sample NPC characters that can be placed into any campaign. Chapter Three is one of the major chapters of interest in this book, covering Super-Normal powers - that is, super powers for a very street level super vigilante campaign. The forth and final chapter discusses the automotive side of vigilantism, utilizing Atomik MotorWarz as its primary source material. Chapter Four also gives some additional information and technology on vehicles in the early 21st Century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vigilantian: Eternal Vigilance should be an invaluable source for expanding not only Vigilantian, but any Fuzion game of a similar genre. Super-Normal Powers can be adapted for use in any campaign (with the GM's permission), and the NPCs are generic enough to be found almost anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
