							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Art of Defence</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To those versed in its intricacies, swordplay is more than mere swordplay. It is elevated to an art form: the art of defence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many forms within this art. One is two weapon fighting, and the rules cover that form well. Another is ranged weapon fighting, and again, that is covered in the rules. But other forms of the art of defence are not addressed in the rules. As such, they are presented in this module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Art of Defence presents 12 new feats similar in theme to the Two-Weapon Fighting feats, as well as a few new weapons with special properties. All feats presented are general feats, and may be selected by a fighter as a bonus feat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
