			<description>Spiegelen (Mirroring in English) is a Dutch game, published probably somewhere in the sixties of the 20th century by Revanche-Spelen. The game comes with six dice (three red, three green) and a rules leaflet (printed double sided).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to create combinations of dice on a table comprised of two columns and six rows. The red dice go in the left column, the green dice on the right. Points are awarded for creating certain combinations with the rolled dice (duplicates or streets).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a maximum of 6 rolls per turn. After every roll at least one die must be placed on the table. If certain combinations are rolled, the player may place more than one die on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won by the player with the highest total after at least one player has reached a total of 250 points or more and all player took equal turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
