			<description>It has copyright 1967 R.G. Bryant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's an Abstract Strategy game, played on a 16x16 grid, 20 pieces to a side, each on own colour. each corner has a 3x3 area that is not playable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces can move different amounts as per pre game arrangement. by single squares, by one or two squares, one or 3, one of 4, or one or 5, through open squares only. Moves are diagonally backwards or forward, sideways or circular (not really explained in the rules)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;three ways to capture (albeit one would be rare as you have to move into a capture position, they call it a 'blunder')&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;others are by landing on a square not of your colour (again not easy to see how that happens)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or by having a piece on opposite sides of an opponent's piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three options sound like designer was trying to add depth with options that will rarely come into play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The copy must be Canadian since it's in both English and French. I am in Canada too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Box is simple, checkerboard design, with nothing more than name and the copyright info.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;pieces are plastic, stamped '220' simple. but nice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
