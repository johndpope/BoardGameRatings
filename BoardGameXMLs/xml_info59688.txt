							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slumbering Tsar</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Years ago, the Army of Light drove the forces of the demon-lord Orcus from his evil city of Tsar. The wasteland where that battle took place is now known as the Desolation, and the only way to reach the ancient ruined demon-city is to cross this barren realm. Today, adventurers have come, ready to brave the perils of The Desolation, and seek out Orcus' lost city. Why have they come?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps in search of fame and glory, perhaps to right ancient wrongs or to learn the truth about the destruction of the Army of Light. Whatever their motives, they will face any danger, even the threat of horrible death and eternal damnation, for they are adventurers, and in the Desolation, adventure waits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
