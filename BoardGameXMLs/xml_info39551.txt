			<description>Players represent Dwarven nobles.  Each turn you will attempt to win honor by giving the most money in the Contest of Gifts.  The winner of the Contest also gets first pick of the opportunities available for that year; lands that can increase your wealth, magical items, buildings and quests.  You must manage your gold carefully and evaluate the relative value of the opportunities based on the stage of the game and what you and your opponents have already developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
