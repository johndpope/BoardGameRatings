			<description>Just a party game, the theme is drawn from the film &amp;ldquo;The Big Lebowski&amp;rdquo;, as well as &amp;ldquo;LebowskiFest&amp;rdquo;, the annual festival of all things Lebowski. All of the artwork is original. Printed on fabric, the board design reflects The Dude&amp;rsquo;s rug, the maguffin of the film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;Move to the center of the board and get The Dude&amp;rsquo;s rug, which is a poker chip placed in the center space. The player must then get home with the rug.&lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;Game Mechanics&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a roll-and-move game. The board is laid out in a circle, with 8 starting points on the perimeter. The player may roll a single die, or for more control (to land on a more desirable space) may bowl instead. 5 bowling pins and 2 marbles are included. 1 marble is rolled and each pin knocked down equals 1 space. Each space requires its own action, or inaction. E.g. answer a trivia question and roll again. &lt;br/&gt;The players may move in any direction, there is no predetermined path. Once a player gets possession of the rug, the other players must catch up and challenge for possession. This is determined by a roll-off. Each player bowls a frame, and the best score wins possession of the rug.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is some adult content. This game is not intended for little Larrys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
