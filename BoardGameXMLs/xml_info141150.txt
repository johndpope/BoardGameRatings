							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Man, Primitive: A Prehistoric Fantasy Adventure</name>
									
			<description>Man, Primitive's setting is millions of years ago in the Paleolithic period. Humans are just beginning to form settlements and small villages. Times are tough for them, hunting &amp;amp; gathering food in the cold weather.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Man, Primitive's game-play has several different movement factors. A large game board that represents the northern region of Palagon is where the players begin their journey. One space at a time they move. During encounters, they will take place on the Battle Board. The Battle Board is a smaller board laid out for tactical movement around creatures. Players will move according to their character card's Speed setting. The mechanic of the encounters revolve around rolling a custom &amp;quot;Fate Die&amp;quot; along with a d10 to determine the outcome. Damage will be rolled according to the weapon's damage die. The characters village will be upgraded throughout the game along with weapons being crafted from materials found along the way. 4 players will be the characters and 1 player will be the Great Spirit(GM). Solo adventures are being created for those in between larger games to acquire better items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Man, Primitive's goal is just what the real primitive's goal was to do; survive. There are 11 hunting quests each lasting an average of 1 hour. The players will need to make it through all of quests, build up their village and craft their weapons. The players will be upgrading everything for fear of the Ice Lord returning with it's minions. A final boss fight will ensue. Already planned expansions will finish the story and conjure some creatures the players have never seen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
