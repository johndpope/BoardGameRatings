							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Starships Assembly</name>
									
			<description>Societies in the 28th century roam the galaxies in continent-sized starships. Captains of these starship societies gather to negotiate peacefully in the Starships Assembly. While the peace holds you will recruit captains to your side and deploy a fleet of starships. But after a declaration of war there is no course left except to engage your opponent's fleet and triumph!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starships Assembly is a two-player strategy game played with 20 cards, each with a captain on one side and a ship on the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Assembly phase is a peaceful political arena. A card from your hand could be played as a recruited captain, where captains cast votes and have special abilities. Spend your votes to recruit more captains and also to play cards from your hand using the other side: a deployed ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually one player or the other will cause a declaration of war. Then every card that is not a ship gets shuffled together and your fleet of ships is all you take with you to the final Open Warfare phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War has been declared! There are no reinforcements! From here on out you must defeat the enemy fleet, ship by ship. Be the last player with a ship to win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
