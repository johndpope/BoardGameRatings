			<description>From cassette inlay&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Hideous Bill and The Gigants. A gripping three part tale of heroism and romance.&lt;br/&gt;Can you help Hideous Bill pit his wits against the Gi-Gants to rescue his true love Greta. This game is based upon an idea from Steve Lee with original music and 'a great deal of help' from Dave Lee.&lt;br/&gt;This is Bill's first starring role in a comupter game. He has appeared before in anonymousminor parts including a reckless frog-squashing lrry driver and the rear end of a giant pantomime camel for which he received an Ernie award nomination as Most Unrecognisable Character.&lt;br/&gt;The Nickname 'Hideous' is was given to him by his ather, 'Happy' Dan Granite out of simple but accurate malice. me met his charming wife Greta at an agricultural machinery exhibition and they now have two reassuringly despicable childring, Justin and Lulu who have appeared on TV as members of Vera Trappist's Timbling Teenies. Bill is also no slouch on the dance floor, combining 'random-leg' style with a total lack of musical awareness.&lt;br/&gt;Bill still works at he local baked bean facotry as a labatory attendant which of cause means a lot of overtime. In his spare time, Bill like to relax by listening to his collection of tape-recorded shipping forcasts or just tinkering with his unique 'friction' bike - the harder he pedals, the slower it goes. He is also a keen windsurfer.&lt;br/&gt;If his career takes off and the money rolls in, he plans to buy himself a pair of carbon-bivr cycle clips and Greta a long holiday in Australia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
