			<description>The Player Characters are victims of an alien abduction. Their abductors crash and the PCs find themselves in a strange rural area populated by twisted, bizarre creatures (we call them locals). Odd things start happening after the crash and a logging operation appears overnight. A bunch of doctors decide that an epidemic is breaking out and quarantine the area. The local diner starts serving sushi and a lot of people are wearing sunglasses, two sure signs of the Apocalypse. Victims of the dreaded disease are taken away for treatment... special treatment. &lt;br/&gt;Trucks, and hearses, roll into Erie, Pennsylvania taking unusual cargo from the crash site to the NERDCo facility. Strange things start happening in the area around the labs and none other than Rudolfo (infamous smut television talk-show host, fashion plate, and brawl-magnet) decides to do a series of shows from Erie because the town is apparently experiencing poltergeistic phenomena. At that point things start getting really weird...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
