			<description>&amp;quot;Universe is a graphical sci-fi, futuristic adventure game, originally released in 1994 and published by Core Design as their second (after Curse of Enchantia) and last effort in the genre. (...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes role of the young man named Boris Verne, who is taken to a distant future/parallel universe from the present time, when playing around with his uncle's &amp;quot;Virtual Dimension Inducer&amp;quot; invention. Boris finds himself in a universe reminiscent to that of Star Wars and the Galactic Empire as well as being at the centre of a prophecy that says that he will overthrow the evil Emperor-King Neiamises, who possesses god-like powers and is bent on conquest of the whole galaxy, and thus bring peace to the universe. Throughout the game Boris encounters allies, enemies and a whole host of aliens and strange beings on a variety of worlds, installations and starships.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Universe_(video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
