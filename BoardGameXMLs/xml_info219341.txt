			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dice in Bumpi are unique in that they do not roll on the table; they bounce! This is because the dice are actually five-sided objects in which four of the sides are attached to the fifth, and to &amp;quot;roll&amp;quot; the die, you push it down onto the table, flattening all the sides, then let it spring up to roll around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why are you doing this? Because all players are presented with a task card at the start of each round. Sometimes you want to find an animal, sometimes a color, and often both &amp;mdash; and you need to keep rolling until someone finds a solution and wins the card. Whoever collects five cards first wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
