			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who Dares Challange the Gods Themselves?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;An ocean of goblins, a host of the lords of the fey, and the dying body of a nightmarish thing whose very form was anathema to sane minds sat rotting atop the carcass of a serpent as large as the world itself. Elshrin absentmindedly cleaned the glowing blade of his sword as he wondered how much of the mountain range to the south had withstood the death throes of the world serpent after Mierlek had used one of his spells to throw a miniature sun at it. With a gesture, a word, and a wave of light, Krel healed the last of Tala&amp;rsquo;s wounds. That group of pit fiends had really done a number on her before Elshrin had managed to carve his way through the last of the ancient wyrms to help her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suddenly, the earth shook, the sky darkened and thundered, and all the hosts of the gods themselves descended to challenge these upstart adventurers. The party readied their weapons. Elshrin smiled as he patted the rusty dagger he&amp;rsquo;d been handed all those years ago. He&amp;rsquo;d certainly come a long way from exterminating rodents in the innkeeper&amp;rsquo;s cellar.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's Inside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yep, we&amp;rsquo;ve got plenty of monsters and gods for you to use in your games, but that&amp;rsquo;s not all you&amp;rsquo;ll find inside. The monsters presented within should serve as examples for you to use for reference if you should want to stat out your legendary encounters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Book Includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    14 new creatures (Including, but not limited to, stats for Athena, Loki, Set, Hephaestus, Zeus, and Thoth!)&lt;br/&gt;    +3 Variant Creatures&lt;br/&gt;    A tool box to create gods for Legendary Levels play! How cool is THAT!&lt;br/&gt;    6 Deity Archytypes (Which can be concidered creatures in their own right)&lt;br/&gt;    Traits &amp;amp; Weaknesses to flesh out your deities&lt;br/&gt;    2 Templates (God Touched &amp;amp; Deity)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Requires Legendary Levels to use&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
