							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jeu du Juif-Errant</name>
									
			<description>This mid-19th Century game is laid out like Game of Goose, with an inward spiral of 63 spaces, but it is based on the 1844 novel Le Juif-Errant (The Wandering Jew), by Eugene Sue. The starting (lower-left) corner of the board has an impage of Sue at work writing the novel. The other corners and each space on the track show a character or incident from the 1400-page book. The center of the board shows the Wandering Jew arriving in Paris, and also includes the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in Game of Goose, players make an initial ante, and may be forced to pay more into the pot as a result of landing on certain squares. The first player to reach the end of the track takes the pot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
