							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War Tactics or Can Britain Be Invaded?</name>
									
			<description>One of the oldest high level strategy games, War tactics takes place on a map containing England, Denmark, Belgium, Germany and a part of northern France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map is divided into a series of squares which include ports, forts towns, cities and the capitals.  Units include land units, dreadnoughts, torpedo boats, cruisers, air units and subs.  Each unit has a different movement pattern (for example ships - dreadnoughts, torpedo boats, cruisers all can move 1 square forward, right or left but not diagonal or backward) and the players try to capture enemy units and ultimately the enemy capital.  Landing on an enemy will capture him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving units and gain rewards for occupying key sites like naval bases and 1 square of the capital (out of a total of 4).  Scores are gained for occupying towns, cities and naval bases.  At the end of the game the player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
