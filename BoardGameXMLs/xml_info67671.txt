							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battlemaps: Dungeon Rooms Vol. I</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Rooms Vol. I is the first accessory of the new product line Master Accessories featuring the amazing battlemaps by &amp;Oslash;1 Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This accessory contains some of the most common dungeon rooms like the Dark Temple, the Alchemist&amp;rsquo;s lab, the Crypt, the Armory and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each map shows a dungeon room from a top-down perspective with stunning lighting effects and superb 3D-rendered objects. You can easily print out these maps and place your favorite miniatures on them. Highly detailed, these maps add flavor and facilitate tactical movements while running combat encounters. A one-inch square grid is drawn on each map but blended in perfectly with the environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each map is printable on a single sheet of paper, except for one map (the Dark Temple) that comes divided in two sheets. You can print out the map you need in full color, or choose its grayscale-optimized version if you do not want to consume too much ink.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even if you decide to print them in color, these battlemaps will be always more cost-effective than a printed version, as you can print out just what you need... even multiples of your favorite ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get Inspired&lt;br/&gt;These maps are so detailed that simply looking at them can give thousand of ideas for your own games. Why does a blade of yellow light filters through the alchemist&amp;rsquo;s lab door? Who are these grim looking statues in the Dark Temple of, or who left that blood-spattered axe on the altar? You know the answer, and your players will soon discover it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be Descriptive&lt;br/&gt;Even if you do not use the battlemaps for combat, their amazing detail will assist you in room descriptions. Looking at the map while describing the room to the players becomes easier than read plain text. You could look at the preview map of the Crypt and say:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The shadows of the rusty iron bars stretch across the dirty stone floor of the crypt. White human bones scattered on the ground are visible next to standing brass braziers. Four niches are along the walls; remains of more bodies are visible there. Cracked steps lead to a raised platform where a sarcophagus stands in peace. Four high candleholders produce an eerie light on the four corners of the coffin. On the lid there a deeply engraved sword...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build Your Own Dungeon&lt;br/&gt;You can assemble a dungeon using the battlemaps, connecting them with dark hallways and dangerous corridors and finally fill them with hideous critters of your choice. The players will enjoy the battle in your custom built dungeon. More of these supplements are planned, and in no time you will be able to build any dungeon you desire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
