			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a forest somewhere - exactly where it is doesn't matter. What does matter is the fact that a Beast is sealed in there. The Beast is mostly made of smoke, but can easily transform itself into all sorts of shapes. It is a representation of folly, of power gone mad, of the death that awaits the overconfident. No creature now alive remembers its origins, but they all know its name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two main bird clans, the Owls and the Crows, have banded together to stop this threat. Even though they are usually mortal enemies, this is something greater, something much more dangerous. The Beast cannot be defeated through mere brute strength. No, the seal must be recreated, and that in itself is a long process. And even after the seal is finished, a battle will still ensue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are either an Owl or a Crow, part of a group tasked with the job of completing one of the tasks to form the seal and hopefully subdue the Beast. Will you succeed, or will the world be consumed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
