			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for 4 &amp;ndash; 6 PCs&lt;br/&gt;Character Levels 5 &amp;ndash; 12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Heart of the Razor, includes four adventures:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jungle Fever by Owen KC Stephens: An island hopping adventure of greed, betrayal, and undead vengeance for three to five characters of 11th&amp;ndash;12th level. When a supernatural plague strikes down brothel workers in the cargo pit of Sharkjaw Docks, events entangle the PCs in the schemes of Butcher Jill, an infamous and wealthy pirate-turned-drug-lord. On mysterious Dreamfog Island, they must undo the horrors Butcher Jill wrought in pursuit of her ill-gotten wealth, before the evil she unleashed sweeps the whole of the Razor into the charnel pit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Angry Waters by Richard Pett Angry Waters is a 10th level Razor Coast treasure hunt for taboo riches, featuring mad admirals, beautiful captains, forbidden islands, dread beasts, and dark magics best left undisturbed. &amp;ldquo;Dead men tell no tales,&amp;rdquo; they say. Captain Mercy will tell you otherwise. She&amp;rsquo;ll tell you dead men know secrets. They know of incredible places, like a City of Gold in the caldera of an extinct volcano. A city. Of gold &amp;ndash; and she wants your help to get it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sinful Whispers by Tom Knauss An adventure of rescue, redemption, and the ancient terrors of a forgotten age for four to six 5th level PCs From ruins where once Great Pele trod in wrack and wrath, the temptations of an ageless evil speak after centuries of silence. Sinful Whisper is an adventure of supernatural and psychological horror set on a mysterious island grown verdant with time. Here the PCs must overcome both their deepest fears and most base desires to combat a depravity so deep it survived the retribution of a goddess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Black Spot by Gary McBride An adventure of extradimensional depravity for four to six 5th level PCs Explore the wreck of The Flying Fortune, a ship impaled on the exposed tip of an underwater mountain with a waterfall of gold coins spilling from her shattered hull. Unravel the mystery of her vanished crew &amp;ndash; the bloodstains, the shredded decking. Discover a dank and gaping hole in the stone peak that pierces the Fortune. Is it a natural opening? Or a tunnel crafted by arcane engines? It leads down, that much is clear. Down inside a hollow, underwater mountain &amp;ndash; all the way to the ocean floor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
