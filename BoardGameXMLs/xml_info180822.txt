			<description>Competition at robot building factory begins! But the pieces are all around, and you need to find the best parts before anyone else does. Will you be the best builder and figure out a way to win, and get the title of Robot Builder Master?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiny Robots is a memory- and puzzle game, where players take turns building their robots from pieces available. All pieces represents different robotic parts available for building. Pieces are arranged to gaming area with circuit side up. This way all players can see pieces available, and look for their next piece to take. On the hidden side are robotic parts. Parts include heads, legs, wheels, arms, canisters, cameras etc. But parts also have different colors and Technical points added to them. When building a robot, players try to arrange their circuit sides into as whole circuitry as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can do 4 things during their turn, in any order they want:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Pick a piece from the table and add it to their pile.&lt;br/&gt;     Turn 3 pieces around from the table&lt;br/&gt;     Remove one piece from their pile.&lt;br/&gt;     Declare your robot as ready.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can look at the robotic side from their own pieces at any times. After players are done with their turn, player order goes clockwise. After players have at least 3 pieces arranged the way they want, they can declare their robot completed. When a robot is completed, it is then given points. Points are calculated from amount of pieces used, unified colors of robotic parts, complexity points and deduction of points from any mistakes on circuitry side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game consists of 125 gaming pieces, and players can choose game length with 25, 50, 75, 100 or full amount of 125 pieces. Regular game lasts until either all the pieces are taken or players don't want any piece. Goal of the game is to get more points than other players when the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
