			<description>Each card in a deck displays a letter that is worth from one to three points. Nine cards are arrayed face-up in the playing area, and three more are dealt to each player. Players simultaneously try to find the word with the most points and announce the word's value. When no one can exceed a value, the player who announced it provisionally collects all the cards and keeps them if he survives a challenge to the word's validity or spelling. The nine community cards are replenished, and play continues until the deck is exhausted. The winner has the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
