			<description>Published by Pirston Promotions in 2010, the &amp;quot;Museum Jackpot&amp;quot; is a non-elimination type board game. The game comprises of artifacts in the form of 'dinosaur bone sets' or 'relics'. There is no limits of appraisal attached with these artifacts although hold minimum of one appraisal. The player can bid for these throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the dinosaur bones have one distinct feature that each type of dinosaur, there are three bone set in the form of head, tail and torso, which are gained by players separately and if a player able to acquire all three parts of the same dinosaur, than it comprises one artifact and its value doubled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of the game is to collect as many artifacts as possible along with searching for the jackpot while moving through the board. The player can gain extra appraisals and can trade, buy or auction the relics during the game. The appraisals have three level; red, blue and white. When the white appraisal exhausted, the game concludes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main strategy includes the removal of 'Fake' appraisal while comprising 'dinosaur bone artifact' as it the only time the 'fake' can be removed.
