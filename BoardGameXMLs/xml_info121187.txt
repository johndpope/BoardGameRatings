			<description>From the RPG Description here on RPGGeek:&lt;br/&gt;Spiritual Warfare the RPG is a Christian table-top roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A land filled with unfathomable mystery, fantastical words of power, religious and political clashes of epic proportions, and a spiritual conflict as old as time itself. A setting full of valiant men, stout dwarves, nimble elves, and kindly halflings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of Spiritual Warfare the RPG. Now you can join the fight against The Devil and his forces of darkness. Unsheathe your sword, mount your steed, put your trust in the Lord, and tear down the demonic forces that have ravaged the earth. The day of evil is here; will you be able to stand?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the Spiritual Warfare the RPG Handbook: Skill based character creation allowing for originality and diversity in the characters. A simple yet realistic game system that is both fast and flowing. Discipleship roleplaying that encourages Scripture memory and preaching the Gospel. Four Character Orders and many Callings to choose from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
