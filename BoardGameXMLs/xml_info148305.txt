							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Ninja Moves</name>
									
			<description>Jumbo combat card game. Perform the ninja moves shown on the card to defeat the villain hiding on the other side. All players move at once, and moves performed by more than one player at a time means the villain gets away!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the jumbo cards features a villain and a points value on one side of the card. On the other is one of four ninja moves: swing, kick, spin, or jump. Cards are divided into four equal decks with the villain face down; players should have plenty of room to move actively without hitting each other. Together, all players shout &amp;quot;1 - 2 - 3!&amp;quot; and perform the ninja move showing on top of any deck. If a shown ninja move is performed by only a single player, that player turns over the card and captures the villain on the other side, scoring those points. If more than one player performs the same move, even if the move is showing on more than one card, no points are scored and those cards are discarded. The game ends when one deck runs out of cards. Points are counted to determine the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box declares this a game for ages 5+. The jumbo cards feature artwork from the 2013 Nickelodeon Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
