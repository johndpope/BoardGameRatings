							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Anime Hack</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Anime Hack brings the frantic energy of Japanese animation to the tabletop in an easy to play multi-genre role playing game based on the fantastic Black Hack RPG. Based on the original 1970s fantasy role-playing game the rules are easy to follow and playable right out of the box. Character creation takes a few minutes and you'll be playing in no time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Anime Hack adds anime flavour, mecha and vehicle rules as well as advice for GMs and players alike who want to play in a world of over-sized eyes, giant robots, katanas, ninjas, weaponized mallets and collectable monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose between eight anime inspired classes: Magical Girl/Boy, Mecha Jockey, Monster Collector, Neko, Ninja, Robot, Trenchcoat Samurai, and Wunderkind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a complete game. The Black Hack is not required, but it is awesome and would add a lot to your experience (in life as well as gaming).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything needed to swing katanas and go &amp;quot;over 9000&amp;quot; is right here in 45 pages of adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
