							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BattleTech: Die Welt des 31. Jahrhunderts</name>
									
			<description>Die Welt des 31. Jahrhunderts is the complete future-history of the BattleTech world.  Authors Mai and Nick have taken every BattleTech product, including board games, novels, graphic novels, computer games, role-playing products, comic books, and the CCG to create an encyclopedia of every person, place, and event outlined.  This book is profusely illustrated with many color plates and the book is over 500 pages long.  Included are a complete timeline of the BattleTech Universe, complete listings of every BattleTech product in a variety of media, and a list of every BattleMech model in both English and German.  The book sports a fantastic cover by Joern Rauser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book was published in German, and although there have been talks of an English translation, no such translation has yet appeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
