							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Great Bombard</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The great bombard, an engine of war, that puts fear in the hearts of those besieged and on some occasions the hearts of those manning it as well. A few well placed shots from this siege engine are more then enough to knock down any but the sturdiest walls. And even for those it just takes a little longer. But every shot bears a chance for disaster for the gunnery crew as well. Even the slightest mistake or just plain bad luck could cause the cannon to blow up around their ears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bombard itself is assembled from many pieces. The most important of those is the inner barrel, cast from brass in one piece. It is surrounded by a layer of steel beams all around its circumference, which are held together by weathered brass clamps. This whole assembly in turn is suspended by sturdy ropes from a massive wooden frame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stacked next to the gun are a small number of the massive stone balls which are usually used as ammunition for the bombard. And a slightly behind the bombard keeps the powder for the next shot dry. A small muddy pond next to the barrel is used to cool the barrel after firing. The emplacement as a whole is secured by earthworks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
