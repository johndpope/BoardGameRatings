			<description>Mega Man X8, known as Rockman X8​ in Japan, is a video game developed by Capcom. It is the eighth game in the Mega Man X series. The game plot focuses on the abduction of a &amp;quot;next-generation&amp;quot; reploid from the construction site of a space elevator, and the subsequent pursuit of his captors. During the course of game play the motivations of these captors comes into focus, and it is up to the heroes, led by Mega Man X, to stop them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay in Mega Man X8 is similar to previous Mega Man X games. After an introductory stage, Mega Man X8 presents the player with a choice of 8 stages, with a Maverick robot serving as the stage boss. After defeating the 8 bosses, a series of fortress stages open up for the player to complete in linear progression until the final boss is defeated. This general format is the template of all X series games. X, Axl, and Zero have character-specific attributes to assist them in navigating the terrain and defeating enemies:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Axl has the ability to fire his gun in any direction, hover and glide horizontally for short distances, and stick in place on a wall as long as he is firing. He also has a 'Copy Shot' which allows him to assimilate the DNA of certain enemy reploids and take their forms and abilities for a short time. By defeating bosses, Axl gains new types of guns which have unlimited ammo.&lt;br/&gt;     X can find and equip individual body parts, obtained from capsules hidden by Dr. Light. He can equip any combination of previously obtained armors to a &amp;quot;Neutral Armor,&amp;quot; a new addition to this game. As X defeats bosses, he gets special weapons which have a limited supply of ammo, just as in previous games in the series. Unlike X7, X can only fire his shot in a straight line.&lt;br/&gt;     Zero uses many different short range weapons and is the only character that can double-jump. He learns new attack techniques by defeating bosses, some of which change depending on which weapon he has equipped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Mega Man X8 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
