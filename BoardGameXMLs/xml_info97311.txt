			<description>2-4 players take turns influencing a central character in an attempt to end each chapter of her life to their advantage.  The several mechanics that drive the game; playing color-based scenery cards in connection to her location, drawing tokens with positive or negative words on them, and taking 'characterized' actions -will all be used by the players to tell the story as it happens.  Whichever player's decisions had the strongest influence on the story, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
