			<description>Will the ship sink or not?&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps the ship dwarf can help&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S.O.S. Is a exciting game because you need skill and a little bit of luck.&lt;br/&gt;A game with real water! But no fear: a large receptacle ensures that everything stays within the limit.&lt;br/&gt;And if you spill some water, don't worry, there is a piece of cloth to wipe it away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Purpose of the game:&lt;br/&gt;It comes down to skill: Who drops water so convenient and carefully in the sailboat, that ship does not sink?&lt;br/&gt;The goal is not to sink the ship, so you have the least you knots in your rope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player whose turn it is, throw the dice and then pour the water from the bowl into the floating boat as the number of eyes that he has thrown . So up to three shoots or better yet droplets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is important that for each point you rolled on the dice, you have start again to pour the water from the bowl into the floating boat. More drops from a single pouring count as one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is the player skillful, and the boat sinks not during his turn, then the next player must show his agility. Also, he should throw the dice and then pour the water into the boat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sinks the boat, then the player whose turn it is, must lay a knot in his rope.&lt;br/&gt;Then he makes the sailboat empty and turn it back on the water. This player begins the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player have three knots in his rope.&lt;br/&gt;The player with the fewest knots in his rope, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
