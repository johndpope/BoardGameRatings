			<description>To start the game set up the board and choose the character you like best. Each player has a treasure chest, which they must fill with coins as they move around the board, But beware of the skull which will take the coins off you. This is a simple board game for children aged 3 to 6 years old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cognitive aspects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have based this proposed classification of toys on recent studies and investigations, as well as recent domestic and international classification systems. Our proposal aims to be coherent, unified and practical at all times.&lt;br/&gt;4. Spatial orientation: The ability to maintain oneself in a space with the help of spatial references in relation to the surrounding area.&lt;br/&gt;5. Reasoning:&lt;br/&gt;- Concrete: Ability to select forms, categories and objects, and then link them together.&lt;br/&gt;- Abstract: The ability of thought to systematically analyse the possible combinations of elements or ideas to discover specific relationships.&lt;br/&gt;6. Concentration: Ability to detach oneself and keep the focus on certain elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
