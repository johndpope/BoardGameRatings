							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Slavers of Thin-gala</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Duchy of LaGrange in the kingdom of Tanaska has a problem. Over the past few months, several of its coastal towns have been raided by pirate slavers. They have sacked the towns and taken most of the able-bodied men back aboard their ship in chains. There have been four raids to-date, each about 3 weeks apart, and over 100 people have been taken prisoner. The coastal towns have petitioned the Duke to do something to help but Reginald LaGrange, who is not exactly know for his compassion, has declined to intervene, claiming that without a naval force, there is nothing he can do. A petition for aid was also sent to the King, but the reply declared the problem to be an &amp;quot;internal matter&amp;quot; for the Duchy to deal with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With no help forthcoming from any source, the many towns along the LaGrange coast are now living in fear, keeping a close watch on the seas, and preparing to run at the slightest hint of trouble. None of the villages are large enough to afford a mercenary protection force, and are too widely dispersed to band together for common defense. Some of the residents of these towns have moved away, but most have refused to leave, either because they are too stubborn to give up their homes without a fight, or because they have nowhere else to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 5th - 7th level characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
