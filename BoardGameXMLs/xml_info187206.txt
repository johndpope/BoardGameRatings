							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spectrobes: Input Cards</name>
									
			<description>Spectrobes Input Cards are hard plastic and are part of a system present in all three Spectrobes games. It used to acquire rare Spectrobes, Custom Parts, Minerals, and weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Spectrobes, you unlock Card Input from a cube, while in Spectrobes: Beyond the Portals, you unlock it after repairing the escape pod. Player enter the code at the back of the card in the Constellation Card, then links the stars to form the pattern displayed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three distinct &amp;quot;sets&amp;quot; were released. Each &amp;quot;set&amp;quot; contained a unique assortment of cards and could only work with the game it was released for/to co-inside with: set 1 with Spectrobes, set 2 with Beyond the Portals, and set 3 with Origins. Each video game came with a random selection of cards from the &amp;quot;set&amp;quot; that worked with that game. If additional cards were wanted you had to buy them direct from Disney (as individual 'packs' in clear wrap). Disney never marketed the cards well or made them available from other retailers. When a new set&amp;quot; was released the previous one was discontinued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
