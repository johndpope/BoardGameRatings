			<description>To win a round of Animals (アニマルズ), you need to get rid of all your cards in hand; if you do, you score points for the cards that others still have in hand, and whoever scores fifty points first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck in Animals has cards in red, yellow, and blue, and in each color there are three 3, 5 and 6; two 2 and 4; six +2 and +4; and nine 1 (stop) cards. The deck also contains six multicolored cards from 1-6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the cards are dealt out, the first player in the game lays down one or more cards; if they play more than one card, then the cards must be all the same color and they must either match in number or be in sequential order. The next player can play something higher than what was played initially with higher numbers outranking lower ones, and red outranking yellow, which outranks blue. A multicolor card played first on its own is worse than blue; played after a single card, it's considered to be the same color as what it's following.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1s can be played on 6s without needing to play more cards to outrank the current hand, so a blue 1 beats a red 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player either plays or passes. Once everyone passes, the last player to have played leads something new, and play continues until someone empties their hand of cards, thereby scoring points equal to what other players still have in hand. These rounds are repeated until someone scores at least 50 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
