							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Turkey Day</name>
									
			<description>It's Thanksgiving day and the family has decided to celebrate at your house. Will this year's feast be a success, or will it be a disaster?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Turkey Day, you have 12 hours (turns) to attempt to resolve all of the mishaps that might occur while you prepare and cook your holiday meal. Each turn you will have 3 actions but with any luck Gramma or your favorite Aunt will show up and lend a hand. Let's just hope that Chester doesn't show up this year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turkey Day is a free, simple, solo, print and play game. &lt;br/&gt;Turkey Day was originally designed as a gift to the designer's extended family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
