			<description>In Bumpback your goal is to move all of your pawns from the start space around the board to the finish space before your opponent. The game can be played with anywhere from 2 to 8 pawns per player. If you wish to play a shorter game you may choose fewer pawns to start with. If you wish to play a longer game you can start with more pawns. Players take turns rolling and moving their pawns around the board. The game includes a Bumpback die that can be rolled when you land on a space that is occupied by another player. The Bumpback die sends pawns back to their start position. Each space has six dots on it and the number rolled on the Bumpback die applies to any pawn resting on that numbered dot. The game can get very exciting with 4 players and 32 pawns on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
