			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mobile Suit Gundam Side Story 0079: Rise From the Ashes, also known in Japan by the alternate title of Mobile Suit Gundam Side Story: At the Site of the Fallen Colony... (機動戦士ガンダム外伝 コロニーの堕ちた地で... Kidou Senshi Gandamu Gaiden: Koroni no Ochichita Chide...) is a video game that was released for the Dreamcast. It is based in the Universal Century timeline of the popular Mobile Suit Gundam franchise. It was developed and published by Bandai. It takes place in Australia, following an elite squad of RGM-79 GMs (known as the &amp;quot;White Dingo&amp;quot; squad) who are charged with various missions pertaining to the attacks by the Duchy of Zeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is notable amongst Mobile Suit Gundam games for allowing the player to pilot the large &amp;quot;mobile suits&amp;quot; in the game from a cockpit view, like its predecessor, Mobile Suit Gundam Side Story: The Blue Destiny, as opposed to the third-person viewpoint employed in games such as Federation vs Zeon DX. It also requires the player to employ team-tactics with their (usually 3-man) team - these teammates are computer-controlled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player could normally choose from two mobile suits, the standard RGM-79 GM, a decent all around mobile suit, or the heavier RGC-80 GM Cannon, a mobile suit with a cannon attached to its shoulder. If a certain mission was completed successfully, a third type of mobile suit the RX-77D Mass-Production Type, a heavy mobile suit with dual cannons on its shoulders, and a machine gun in each hand, could be unlocked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The very last mission of the game put the player in the cockpit of the RGM-79SP GM Sniper II , a heavily customized white and blue painted unit. It was the ultimate of the suits available for this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consisted of 9 stages, bringing you all around Australia in an attempt to stop Zeon from developing and releasing Astaroth, a biological weapon capable of accelerating the growth of plant life on the Earth, turning it into an uninhabitable forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After completing the game, the player could open up an &amp;quot;Extra Options&amp;quot; menu with customizable &amp;quot;cheats&amp;quot; like Lunar Titanium Alloy (larger health bar) or certain weapons, like the Prototype Beam Rifle used in the GAW Assault Carrier mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
