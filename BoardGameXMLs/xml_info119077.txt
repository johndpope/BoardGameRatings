			<description>Air combat in the 1980's. An extremely simple game (one tiny page of rules) in which the players command the air assets of sectors of a military front. Each has, typically, 15 to 30 planes of various types to allocate secretly to one of four missions (Scramble Ready, Ground Attack, Offensive Air Superiority, Defensive Air Superiority). The allocations are then revealed, and the players determine how many ground attacks succeeded and how many planes were shot down or damaged. Successful ground attacks score 5 victory points, downed planes 2 each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios are provided for Germany (U.S. or U.K./Germans vs. USSR), the Mediterranean and the Middle East (Israel vs. Syria).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
