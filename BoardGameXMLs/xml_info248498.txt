			<description>Cassete inlay (ZX Spectrum release)    &lt;br/&gt;THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;There are 7 races in a meeting and you must try to win as mych as possible from &amp;quot;honest Clive Spectrum&amp;quot; the bookmaker as you can. Up to five players can play at a time and they can bet on whatever horse they wish. For iinstance all five players betting on horse 1 is allowable.&lt;br/&gt;If a player changes his mind while gambling is still taking place, he can change his wager even though his original bet is registered with &amp;quot;honest Clive&amp;quot; . His new bet is entered in the usual way and the last wager is vounted as void. PLaving a bet is promted on screen by &amp;quot;honest Clive&amp;quot; what pressing key 9 ends the gambling and starts the race. In this way a player need not bet on a race, as pressing key nine begins the race even id no one has gambled.&lt;br/&gt;The final stretch of the race is in slow motion and after a horse has reached the winning post there is a photo for places. The horse coming in second recieves a quarter of his quoted odds.&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;pence&amp;quot; option and gambling options 3 &amp;amp; 4 are to allowed a member of the family to become &amp;quot;honest Clive's&amp;quot; partner and make an actual book on which the family can gamble for pennnies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We wish you a good days racing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
