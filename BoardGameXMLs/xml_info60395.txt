							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Quintessential Ranger II: Advanced Tactics</name>
									
			<description>Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ranger is the ultimate wilderness warrior, using his knowledge of woodcraft to flow like a shadow through the sylvan depths. He is the hunter, the avenger and the saviour of the frontier, wielding his sword and his bow to protect settlers and to destroy the evil that lurks in the darkest corners of the world. But the ranger is also a guide and an explorer, bringing the light of civilisation to unsettled wastelands and helping pilgrims find their promised land. Perhaps then, the best word to describe the ranger is a simple one; the ranger is a hero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the help of this sourcebook, any character choosing to play a ranger will find many alternatives and options for expanding his range of abilities. With Career Paths, rangers can customise their advancement with their chosen branch of training. The Legendary Ranger offers an expansion of their character features that may take them to epic levels and beyond. Multiclassing gives advice and variant rules on how to best integrate two classes, while Superior Tools opens up a wealth of items to enhance a ranger's performance. The Magical Ranger offers new magical items and spells tailored to the ranger class, while Tricks of the Trade explores new uses for skills. Ranger Abilities presents a wide selection of variant combat styles, alternate favoured enemy progressions and new feats. Finally, Survival Tactics explores how to best build and play a ranger character across all levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside You Will Find:&lt;br/&gt;Career Paths&lt;br/&gt;Multiclassing&lt;br/&gt;Prestige Classes&lt;br/&gt;New Combat Styles&lt;br/&gt;New Feats&lt;br/&gt;New Magic Items&lt;br/&gt;Tricks of the Trade&lt;br/&gt;New Weapons and Armour&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
