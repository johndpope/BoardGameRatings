			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just as the Force moves throughout the entire galaxy, binding and connecting all lifeforms, there is a new spark of rebellion that has begun to move across the galaxy, igniting everything it touches. From the planet Lothal, a small cell of rebels strikes back against the Galactic Empire &amp;mdash; and they're becoming more powerful by the day. The Galactic Empire's might may seem unstoppable, but these young rebels are making a difference, and soon you'll be able to fight alongside them in your games of Star Wars: The Card Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power of the Force is the fifth Force Pack in the &amp;quot;Opposition&amp;quot; cycle, and within this expansion, you'll find plenty of new &amp;quot;Specter&amp;quot; cards reaching across affiliations, even as other cards play into the feuds that exist between factions. With a completely new fate card focusing on Specter units, and iconic characters and vehicles like Ezra Bridger, Hera Syndulla, the Ghost, and &amp;quot;Howlrunner&amp;quot; joining the game, there's never been a better time to declare your allegiance and join the fight for the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
