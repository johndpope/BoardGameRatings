			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Put on those shades, run a self-diagnostic on your implanted chrome and prepare to hit the mean streets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Daring Tales of the Sprawl Compendium contains five cyberpunk adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Family Affair: A new patron contacts the heroes and pays them a retainer to perform a few odd jobs on a tight schedule: Tampering with food deliveries, &amp;quot;rescuing&amp;quot; a middle-aged couple from an ambulance,keeping them safe and delivering them to the airport are hardly standard missions, but the patron is paying well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extraction 101: An almost textbook corporate extraction is required. What could possibly go wrong? Quite a lot actually, and the heroes are going to be busy trying to ensure it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Their mission takes them from the sterile corridors of a corporate tower, to a crosstown race against time, and finally to the ruins of the deregulated zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tail Chasing: From a missing broker&amp;rsquo;s junkyard, to a mercenary haunt, to the ruins of the deregulated zone and a commune that has opted out of the sprawl, the heroes must follow a twisted trail to find the prototype they seek. And when they find it - is it what they expected?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Band on the Run: Someone wants to put an old rock band back together, easy right? Wrong! What should be a simple investigative case has the characters scouring the Conurbation, the deregulated zone, the Amazon rainforest and the Gobi Desert. This tale pits the heroes against kidnappers, eco-terrorists and a biker gang, not to mention pitching them into the midst of a corporate war!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escape Clause: What does a hostile extraction that goes awry have to do with a clandestine meeting at the Eiffel Tower or a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game? They do all have something to do with the mysterious &amp;quot;Achilles Protocols&amp;quot; but can the heroes survive long enough to find out what this all means?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daring Tales of the Sprawl are gritty cyberpunk adventures by Triple Ace Games for the award-winning Savage Worlds Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
