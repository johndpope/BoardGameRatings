							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gospel Explosion: the Acts of the Apostles</name>
									
			<description>From the text of the author's patent:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game is played on a game board of the Ancient Mediterranean World. Each player is given several playing pieces representing Apostles, early leaders in the Christian church. He moves these around the board winning converts and establishing churches as quickly as possible. Unlike most games, players do not compete against each other. They cooperate as the early Apostles did to spread Christianity throughout the world. Competition is provided by the game itself, through two sets of cards, many of which inflict persecution or misfortune upon the various churches and Apostles. An intelligent group of players, cooperating with each other, can overcome this opposition and successfully spread Christianity throughout the Roman Empire, thus winning the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gospel Explosion: the Acts of the Apostles has been awarded U.S. Patent Number 4441718.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
