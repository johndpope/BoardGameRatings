			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some worlds, Magic may not be seen as a force in and of itself. In some philosophies, magic can not be classed by types of effect, like Evocation, Illusion or Abjuration. Instead, it might be seen as a result of fundamental aspects of arcane metaphysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One such theory holds that all magic is a result of the principles of Colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red is the colour of Fire, Power and Light. It manifests heat, energy, motion, brightness and strength. Its influence is simple, beyond morality or even thought: it is the colour that drives forward, empowers and illuminates, and is evoked in all that moves in the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those that devote themselves to understanding the Red become scions of the power that fills the universe, able to evoke vast effects of energy, fire and motion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most devoted of these might become Crimson Battlemages. These are spellcasters able to draw power directly from the Red. They are much sought for their arcane might and combat prowess, and usually espouse the philosophy that the best form of defence is attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this product:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    3 new Clerical or Mystical domains &lt;br/&gt;    a linked reclassification of one twelfth of the spells of the players handbook, with some new spell effects to fit the spells into Chromatic Magic Theory &lt;br/&gt;    a whole new character class, the Crimson Battlemage. This specialist spellcaster is devoted to the Red, with abilities somewhere between cleric, sorcerer and wizard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
