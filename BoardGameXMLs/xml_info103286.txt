							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Even Odder</name>
									
			<description>This game is game #28 in Games on Half a Checkerboard Series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even Odder features several layers of contradictory victory conditions that force players to use discernment as for which would be most likely to be feasible to do, with the final one where the winner is determined by whether their tallest stack is even or odd.  The play mechanics are similar to those found in Sight Reduction, game #27 in the Games on Half a Checkerboard Series, including a randomized board layout to start, and line of sight being used to determine whether or not a piece can join with another piece in a stack.  Unlike Sight Reduction, pieces join together with other friendly pieces to grow a stack, as opposed to being removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
