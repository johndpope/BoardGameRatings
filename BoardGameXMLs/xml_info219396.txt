			<description>The main characters in Dragoonies have discovered a treasure chest and naturally each of them wants to take as much of the gold as possible for themselves &amp;mdash; but to do that, they need to solve tasks more quickly than anyone else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of play, a circle of sixteen dragon cards is formed in the center of the table; each card is different from each other, whether due to color, horns, or small objects with which they're equipped. On a turn, the active player reveals 2-6 search cards &amp;mdash; with more cards making for a tougher challenge &amp;mdash; then all the players race to determine the characteristics that are most common on the search cards, e.g., the color blue, a key, or three horns. Multiple solutions might exist, and when you find one, you want to cover an unoccupied dragon card that corresponds to the answer. If you do so correctly, you earn a Drachentaler, and whoever collects the most money in the end wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
