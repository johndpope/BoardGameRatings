							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">From Rage to Reason</name>
									
			<description>A psychological teaching game that teaches how to deal with Rage and properly Reason.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From one of the rules sheets:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Randy is in his late teenage years. He goes to school and also has a job. In the game, we will follow Randy through challenging situations that make Randy very angry. Randy's anger is not unusual, because these situations would make most people angry. It is the job of the players to give him advice on how to deal with these problems and achieve his goals. Players earn lots of play money for giving good advice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to earn the most money. Play until the last Spark card is used or the instructor says that time is up, whichever comes first. Players choose a banker to give out the money. The banker receives no extra pay period&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nature of the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is different from most board games. Players do not go around the board with their pawns. In fact, there are no pawns or dice. It is played more like a card game than a board game. Players play certain of their cards on each round, and the player who has played the best cards wins the &amp;quot;pot&amp;quot; (all the money on that round). The board serves as a playing surface and a presentation of the skills used in the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-6 Players (More with team play)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
