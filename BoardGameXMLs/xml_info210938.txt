							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hero&#039;s Song</name>
									
			<description>Hero's Song is a hardcore action RPG and uses the familiar click-to-move and attack controls of classic action RPGs like Diablo III or Path of Exile. Combat takes a more measured pace, giving you time to react to the intelligent tactics of your enemies and to thoughtfully deploy your wide variety of skills and abilities. True to its hardcore nature, combat in Hero's Song is dangerous and has very real consequences including the chance of permanent death. Friendly fire is always defaulted to &amp;quot;on&amp;quot;, so positioning and precision are very important considerations. Death will come quickly if you think this is a simple clickfest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The crowdfunding campaign for Hero's Song was canceled just one week after launch. Pixelmage will continue to develop the title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
