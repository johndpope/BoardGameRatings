			<description>Each player gets 3 animals and starts from any 3 white spaces in the blue area. The Goal is to encircle the opponents in the yellow area so they can't move anymore. If the opponent stands on a blue space, he is put back into the blue area. If he is standing on a red space, he is put in the red area and is eliminated from the game. The last player who has at least 2 animals on the board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in the 1930s or 1940s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
