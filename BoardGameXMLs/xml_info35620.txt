			<description>Finesse uses a standard deck of cards and a game board that features a tableau for each of the four card suits.  Each tableau has specific spaces for ranks 2 through king, as well as eight suited spaces below.  Each player has 6 pawns in their color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;Maneuver 3 of your 6 pieces into opposing player's back row, while defending your own, using piece movement and playing cards.  First player to score 3 times wins.  An intriguing game of skill and alertness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
