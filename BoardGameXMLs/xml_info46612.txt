							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Violence: The Roleplaying Game of Egregious and Repulsive Bloodshed</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Violence: The Roleplaying Game of Egregious and Repulsive Bloodshed is a short, 32-page roleplaying game written by Greg Costikyan under the pseudonym &amp;quot;Designer X&amp;quot; and published by Hogshead Publishing as part of its New Style line of games. Violence is a parody of conventional dungeon-bashing games, being set in a contemporary metropolis where player characters run from room to room killing the occupants and stealing their stuff. It is relentlessly user-hostile, taking time out to insult the reader wherever possible (it opens with the words &amp;quot;Welcome to Violence, you degraded turd&amp;quot;), and uses a mechanic whereby experience points can be bought for hard cash from the designer or publisher. Despite innovative games design and exhaustive lists of equipment and weapons (including both belt and orbital sanders), monster types, and possible scenarios, it is largely and deliberately unplayable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cover art was by Clint Langley. A Spanish language edition exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In August 2005, Costikyan released Violence under a Creative Commons license (Costikyan 2005) and made it available for download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Violence was part of a series experimental/alternative role-playing games published by Hogshead Publishing. Other games in the series included the award-nominated The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron M&amp;uuml;nchausen, Pantheon, and Puppetland/Powerkill.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Violence:_The_Roleplaying_Game_of_Egregious_and_Repulsive_Bloodshed,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
