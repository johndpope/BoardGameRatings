			<description>Autokinisi is a Greek educational game targeted at younger ages, although grown-ups can also enjoy it, and it is ideal for families. It was published in the 80s in Greece by Imago and is no longer in print.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is played by 3-5 players with one of them not taking active part but playing the role of a general supervisor. Basically, he takes all the non-player roles in the game, like the traffic controller, the insurance agent, the examiner for the driving license etc)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to drive your car in such a way so that you won't run out of money and at the same time create problems to the others to drive them to bankruptcy. By moving various pointers on the board you try to avoid STOP signs, obstacles etc so that you 'll save money, while forcing the other players to make violations and pay fines. How the pointers will be moved and the random events that take place are determined by random card draws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains:&lt;br/&gt;A driving map&lt;br/&gt;A series of bank notes&lt;br/&gt;Four automobiles&lt;br/&gt;A series of cards&lt;br/&gt;A table with violations, fines and questions that need to be answered in order to obtain a license.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
