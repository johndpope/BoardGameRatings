							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Formula One 99</name>
									
			<description>Formula One 99 is a 1999 video game developed by Studio 33 and published by Psygnosis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The drivers on the front cover, from left to right are: Jean Alesi, Michael Schumacher and Mika H&amp;auml;kkinen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the failure of Formula 1 98, Psygnosis brought in a new development team. Studio 33 had previously developed Newmann Haas racing using the original F1 Game engine from Bizarre Creations. Formula One 99 showed that Studio 33 was already experienced in creating a sim-based racing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other innovations included the pit lane speed limiter and a clutch. This game was a considerable and welcome improvement upon Formula 1 98. It may have lacked an &amp;quot;arcade&amp;quot; mode or that extra polish, but Studio 33 clearly concentrated on the most important aspects of the simulation mode, leaving the addition of an arcade mode for Formula One 2000. The AI was suspect, and often cheated the player when pulling out a substantial gap, the AI would then do impossible lap times to catch up and pass. This was also inherent in the Newmann Haas Game which Studio 33 also developed. Another AI tactic was to simply pass through solid walls when trying to overtake the player. This was especially noticeable in Monaco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the making of this game, Psygnosis was taken over by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe and became SCE Studio Liverpool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_99,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_99,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
