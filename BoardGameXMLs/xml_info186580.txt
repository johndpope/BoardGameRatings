			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;There are places far beyond the familiar bounds of Earth. Some lie twinkling in the distant starfields, waiting to be discovered by intrepid explorers or conquered by legions of space marines. Others are just around the corner in time, a near future where hovertanks race across blasted battlefields, cyberware replaces organic limbs, and robots serve humanity&amp;mdash;or attempt to annihilate it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cast of Cards: Science Fiction Companion Vol. 4 features 17 xenos from the Science Fiction Companion for Savage Worlds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cast of Cards decks offer gamers ready-to-use Savage Worlds NPCs, monsters, and villains, complete with stats and background--you can just shuffle the deck, choose and play. Available for order on dry-erase marker-ready cards, or printable from the PDF you can download today, Cast of Cards decks save you time and effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
