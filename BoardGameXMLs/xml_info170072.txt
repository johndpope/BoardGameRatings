			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trials of the Magi is a tabletop role-playing game which centers around the idea that Harry Potter style magic exists and is kept hidden from the modern world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the game the Tutor [Game master] is an skilled magus who is tasked with putting a group of potential spell casters through a series of trials to determine if they are worthy of becoming magi. These trials take the form of a tabletop RPG in which players control a projected version of themselves called a Persona. This persona may look and act like the player but its strengths, weaknesses and skills all come from the player own psyche and knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game aims to blur the lines between fiction and reality as it takes on the form of an alternate reality RPG allowing Game Masters to integrate the game with the players daily life. It also strives to self-directed investigation by encouraging players to strengthen their Persona&amp;rsquo;s through their own research and knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the simple nature of the mechanics and the ease of roleplaying yourself, Trials of the Magi is a refreshing and engaging experience for players both young and old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
