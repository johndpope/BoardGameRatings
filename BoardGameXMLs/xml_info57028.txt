			<description>Endless Quest #23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;For ten years, you have been trained in the fighting skills of a samurai warrior.  Now, with rival factions battling for control of the empire, you face your first and most important quest - at the request of the emperor himself, with the fate of the empire hanging in balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are about to enter the exciting world experienced by the players of the popular DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS Game. It is a fantasy world filled with enchanted castles and fearsome moneters. Are YOU brave enough to meet its challenges?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In other ENDLESS QUEST Books, you can combat secret agents skilled in espionage, journey to the corners of the galasy, or attempt to survive in a future world ravaged by wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each ENDLESS QUEST Book is based on an exciting role-playing game, but you don't need to know the game to enjoy the book. Just make your choices, and accept the consequences!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember! Only your choices lead to success in ENDLESS QUEST Books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
