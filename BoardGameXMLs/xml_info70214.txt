			<description>Also known simply as &amp;quot;Fate&amp;quot;; Pendulum of FATE is an acyclic two-player perfect information luckless abstract strategy game played on a grid of any size that starts out empty.  It can also be played on a hex grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fate's most significant feature is the fact that players gain increasing tokens to place and use as the game progresses.  &amp;quot;Reinforcements&amp;quot; are calculated as a function of both the number of spaces the player already occupies at the start of his or her turn and the turn number of the game.  This increasing reinforcement calculation causes the dominance of the game to swing back and forth like a wild, accelerating pendulum, hence the name of the game.  The goal becomes timing the swings of the game such that a player is able to completely win the game before the momentum shifts right back.  The game is driven to a conclusion with one player filling the entire board and removing the final pieces of his or her opponent so only tokens of one color remain on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Standard Pendulum of FATE is a two-player game, but it can also be played by more with additional supplies of theoretically limitless tokens in different colors for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
