			<description>There's commotion in the village! The legendary Galipote, who, years ago, terrorized walkers in the west of France, has been seen at night, hidden behind the old oak tree : giant eyes, large jaws and big claws, of either green, yellow or red color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each round, each player start with a hand of 7 Galipote cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During his turn, a player can places one of his card as Testimonial, on one of the 6 available sides, matching half-symbols and colors. If there is a Legend card available, he can places up to 2 cards according to the Legend. If he places a card with fur on the side, other players vote for the new Legend card. If he complete the Figure of Galipotes in one side (a symbol), he can score the cards for him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get rid of all his cards, there is one turn until the end the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He scores as positive points all the remaining cards in players hand. Other players scores as negatives points all their cards in hand. All players scores as positive points the number of different colors of the Figure of Galipote, for each symbol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
