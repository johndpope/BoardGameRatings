			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NEVER BEFORE had the world faced a threat as potentially devastating as the A-bomb&amp;mdash;and the even more lethal H-bomb that followed. Educational films showed how to &amp;ldquo;survive&amp;rdquo; a nuclear blast by crawling under a desk, as if a few inches of wood made any difference. In movie theaters, classic monsters of the &amp;lsquo;30s and &amp;rsquo;40s were replaced by atom-spawned horrors. Unseen enemies were everywhere: from devilish rock-and-roll music to morally-corrupt books such as Lolita and Catcher in the Rye. Comic-books corrupted the minds of our youths, and godless Communists constituted a red menace to be stopped using any means necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atomic-Age Cthulhu brings Lovecraftian horror roleplaying into the post-war golden age. Here you find background and history that led to the development of the 1950s world, along with new skills and professions for your investigators. A number of Sinister Seeds are included to help you grow your own &amp;lsquo;50s horrors, but seven complete adventures are ready for you to spring on your unsuspecting players.&lt;br/&gt;The scenarios included in the book are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Village was Made for Us by Christopher Smith Adair &amp;ndash; In a closed community devoted to exploring the new found wonders of the atomic age, alien horrors conduct their own experiments and our well-being does not factor into their calculations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;T.V. Casualty by Matt Sanborn &amp;ndash; Television: newfangled technological wonder, or dreaded idiot box looking to enslave us all? Could the answer to both questions be yes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Return of Old Reliable by Oscar Rios &amp;ndash; The space race, still in its infancy, gives birth to a world-threatening horror no one could have seen coming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forgotten Wars by Brian M. Sammons &amp;ndash; The Korean &amp;ldquo;conflict&amp;rdquo;, never formally classified as a war, and yet technically still underway today, pales in comparison to the aeons long battle between two ancient enemies, and a US Army tank crew gets caught in the middle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Octane by Tom Lynch &amp;ndash; Slick hot rods, dirty and dangerous bikers, a commie plot, and a once slumbering menace starting to stir.  Will the investigators be able to keep the lid on this pressure cooker or are things going to blow as the fear continues to mount?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;L.A. Diabolical by Brian Courtemanche &amp;ndash; It&amp;rsquo;s Tinsel Town and the rich and famous want to dabble with the chic side of darkness for kicks, but when something from the darkness starts playing with them, the fun quickly ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Destroying Paradise, Hawaiian Style by Michael Dziesinski &amp;ndash; Blue skies, loud shirts, surfing and a king of rock n&amp;rsquo; roll making a movie, what could possible go wrong? Well when the horrors of the Cthulhu Mythos combine with the horror of nuclear weapons, what do you think?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
