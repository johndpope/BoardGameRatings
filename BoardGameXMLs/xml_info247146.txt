			<description>North Tarrytown hides a ghastly secret: it&amp;rsquo;s population is being overrun by restless ghosts.  It&amp;rsquo;s one versus all as the Ghost Hunter player battles all other players controlling the green ghouls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flick your wooden playing pieces from haunt to haunt in an attempt to either catch the ghastly ghouls or haunt the entire town.  Either side can prevail and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Ghost hunter, you have 3 playing pieces.  The Dog, The Van and The Hero.  Each of these pieces has one action per turn.&lt;br/&gt;The Dog moves to protect the headquarters like a hockey goalie.&lt;br/&gt;The Van is a mobile base that the hero always goes back to.&lt;br/&gt;The Hero is the piece used to trap the ghosts by hitting them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Ghosts, the other players have 6 ghouls.  Their goal is to successfully haunt the 10 town locations before the hunter can catch them all.  The ghouls can haunt the civilians for extra turns in the game, but they need to be careful: A civilian can only be turned once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
