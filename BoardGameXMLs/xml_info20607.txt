			<description>&amp;quot;No time to waste&amp;quot; is a cooperative trivia-game. The central piece of the game is a clock with an arrow that starts at 12 o'clock, and than starts moving clock-wise, taking exactly an hour for one turn. Surrounding the clock are tiles that are face down at the start of the game, but that are turned up during the game (showing colorful pictures of nature) if the players succeed in answering trivia questions about environmental topics. The clock-arrow indicates how well the players are doing because if the tile-turning is ahead of the arrow the players are doing well, but if they are behind they are in trouble!&lt;br/&gt;Other trouble for the players comes from wrong answers, because after a wrong answer a red card has to be turned over, which may mean that the Greenpeace ship is blocked. In case of a blockade progress on the dial is stopped (but the clock moves on!). Luckily good answers not only turn over tiles, but also give players green card that they can use to remove blockades.&lt;br/&gt;The game is cooperative because everyone wins if the last tile is turned over, and everyone loses when the clock runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
