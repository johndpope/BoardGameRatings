							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Alien Abduction Home Game</name>
									
			<description>Suitable for two or more players, this game is played on a tabletop without a physical game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is the pilot of a flying saucer UFO. His mission is to demonstrate his superior prowess by garnering more mission points than the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mission tiles represent the various missions that can be completed, including abducting, brainwashing or impregnating humans, making crop circles, mutilating cattle and being sighted in famous locations after dark, in bad light, by unreliable witnesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vril chits represent special abilities and equipment that can help accomplish missions or hinder the other players. (And yes, Virginia, there are anal probes.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can choose to play as any of five of the more well-known types of aliens including Greys, Reptilians, Nordics, Nephilim and Elderbarians, with each type receiving a bonus for accomplishing certain types of missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alien Abduction is a hilarious game, that&amp;rsquo;s also educational and fun to play. The victims to be abducted have famous names and any occult or UFO enthusiast will recognize the locations mentioned on the mission tiles and the concepts presented by the Vril chits. It&amp;rsquo;s almost like a UFO trivia game, as well as a fast moving action game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays quickly and is full of dark humor. I convinced my brother-in-law to play. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t generally care for games and is not a UFO enthusiast, yet before long he was laughing and really enjoying himself. He actually won!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components include four sheets of colored cardstock mission tiles, one of cardstock Vril chits, a cardstock chit explanation card and a two-page rules pamphlet. Some assembly required. Dice, poster board, and some glue are needed to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an added bonus the game includes the pamphlet, Self-Defense Against Alien Abduction that explains how one might successfully defend against abduction by aliens through the use of various techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
