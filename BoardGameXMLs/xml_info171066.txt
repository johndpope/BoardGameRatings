			<description>Infiltrate the enemy as a psychic spy, leaping from body to body by touch! But when your own body is stolen, you'll race against time to find it before your mind disintegrates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ORPHEUS Ruse is the thrilling interactive spy novel by Paul Gresty, where your choices control the story. The game is entirely text-based&amp;ndash;without graphics or sound effects&amp;ndash;but driven by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What secrets have your mentors been keeping from you? Can you trust your friends when you don't know whose face they're wearing?
