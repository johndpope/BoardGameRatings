			<description>Kibamusha is an ancestral chess-like boardgame, from the feudal japan. There are only 2 pages of rules : it is not a complicated game. So a 9-year-old child can play Kibamusha, and even wins against an adult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kibamusha uses a gameboard of 9 rows by 10 files. Each player has 20 pieces (Ashigaru, Bowman, banner, Horse archer, etc..).&lt;br/&gt;There is no dice in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some questions :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I) HOW TO WIN ? &lt;br/&gt;In order to win, you must be the first player to place your own Bana (banner)on the opponent's first row (row 1 or  9, depending on the opponent's side).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;II) It is my turn : what do I make ?&lt;br/&gt;In your turn, you have 3 options.&lt;br/&gt;a) Moving only 1 piece (useful if you want a fast advance for your Bana).&lt;br/&gt;b) Moving 2 pieces.&lt;br/&gt;c) Moving 3 pieces (including at least 2 Ashigarus).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;III)CAN I TAKE (CAPTURE) OPPONENT'S PIECES ?&lt;br/&gt;Yes ! Except the opponent's Bana.&lt;br/&gt;The Bana is the most important piece : the Bana cannot be captured, and the Bana cannot capture pieces.&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to threaten spaces where the bana could advance : in this way, you can prevent the opponent's bana from moving towards your own line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
