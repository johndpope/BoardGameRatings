			<description>In essence, Competition is a four-handed game of Checkers. However, there are several unusual twists to the game that keep it from fitting neatly into one category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    First, each player starts with a limited supply of play money. There are costs associated with various moves, so it is possible to lose by running out of money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Second, each player only starts with five of their eight pieces on the board, and must pay to bring the other three onto the board when space in the back row becomes available for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Third, the games spaces have costs or rewards associated with them. Most of the spaces will cost money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Fourth, there is a safe &amp;quot;corridor&amp;quot; between the four board quarters. A player may not be captured when in that safe area, but may capture a piece when coming onto another board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when only one player has any money left, when only one player has any pieces left, or when one player has successfully confined their last opponent within their own home board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
