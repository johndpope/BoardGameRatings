			<description>The deck consists of cards numbered one through forty plus two wild cards. Each player is dealt five cards. One card is placed face up in a tray marked &amp;ldquo;high&amp;rdquo;; one card is placed face up in a tray marked &amp;ldquo;low.&amp;rdquo; The other cards form the draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player's turn begins with a draw a card from the draw pile. A player then places a card in either tray. If that card happens to be a number that falls between the cards in the trays that discards an extra card. The round ends when a player runs out of cards. That player scores one point for every card that remains the opponents&amp;rsquo; hands. The game ends when a player reaches the target score outlined in the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
