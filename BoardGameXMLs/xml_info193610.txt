			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Follow the path of rational thought and self-control as a stoical monk!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Want to add interesting characters to your campaigns but don&amp;rsquo;t have time to create them? Need new characters at the last minute for you or your players to use during a game session? Wish you had a premade character at the ready to help introduce a new player to RPGs? Characters-By-Level has you covered!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Characters-By-Level?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters-By-Level (CBL) is a time-saving RPG accessory that offers GMs and players ready-to-play pregenerated characters to be used in games of any level. Each release provides you with stat blocks for one or more characters at multiple levels for a particular RPG system along with profiles detailing their character builds, backgrounds, physical descriptions, and personality traits plus ways to help you fit them into your games. You will also receive high-quality digital character artwork suitable for character sheets, virtual tabletop tokens, visual aids, and desktop wallpapers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CBL characters are designed to be inserted into your games with a minimum of fuss and additional customization. GMs can deploy them as ready-made NPCs to use as either allies or rivals. Players can use them any time they need a character to play on short notice. Playing a CBL character requires little to no preparation, letting you spend more time playing your game and having fun instead of preparing for it. Less work, more play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, CBL characters come with complete NPC and PC stat blocks for levels 1-20. NPC stat blocks are based on the 15-point-buy method or the default NPC heroic ability scores. PC stat blocks use 20-point builds with two starting traits. All race, class, skill, feat, equipment, spell, and trait choices are selected from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook and Pathfinder Roleplaying Game&amp;rsquo;s Advanced, Bestiary, and Ultimate sourcebook series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this release for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    One detailed pregenerated monk using the hungry ghost and qinggong archetypes for levels 1-20&lt;br/&gt;    High-quality digital character artwork, including full-screen and portrait wallpapers*&lt;br/&gt;    Hero Lab portfolios &amp;mdash; one file for every stat block&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let Duragul, a ki-stealing monk devoted to the monastic order of the Disciples of the Hungry Hand, be part of your campaign today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
