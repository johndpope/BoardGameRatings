			<description>A Family Card Game for Creative Minds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compete or use teamwork to construct incredible machines and contraptions out of loads of scrap! Five game modes offer unique challenges &amp;ndash; Easy, Standard, Crazy, Co-Op, and Sandbox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scrapyard Warriors is centered around the Scrap Cards. These are what you use to build your amazing machines and contraptions. Each Scrap Card has color and corresponding point value, located in the lower-right corner of the card: Red = 1 Point, Light Blue = 2 Points, Yellow = 3 Points, Green = 4 Points, Blue = 5 Points, Purple = 6 Points, and Orange = 1-6 Bonus Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonus Cards cannot be used to construct your machines. They simply add extra points, ranging from 1 to 6. They have a green plus sign in the lower-right corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
