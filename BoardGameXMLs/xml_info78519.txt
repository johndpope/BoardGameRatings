			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Based on the Japanese movie of the same name you play as a security guard trying to protect clients homes from from being robbed. As a member of Perfect Security Service you have at your disposal a limited budget with which you need to buy traps. Once bought you set them around a house in the hope of stopping the thieves that then come and attack. If you succesfully foil their attempts you gain more money and move onto the next level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
