			<description>Princess Sissi has made a big mess in her dressing room. Now she is called to the great ball and the players have to help her find her accessories quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing field in Schnell, Prinzessin Sissi! consists of an open 6x6 grid of tiles, with the tiles depicting six different accessories and one flowerpot. The princess is placed on any tile to start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, any player rolls four dice: One of them shows which accessory the princess is looking for, the other three show numbers from 1 to 3 or an arrow. All players now look for a path from the princess to one of the matching accessory tiles, using the following rules: Each of the movement dice must be used to move the princess in a straight orthogonal line; an arrow lets you move the princess to the edge of the grid. At the end of the three moves, you must reach the accessory tile. The first player to find a solution calls out and demonstrates it, receiving one diamond if correct. If the path leads past one or more tiles with a treasure icon, there is a bonus diamond. If the path doesn't work out or leads past the flower pot, the player loses a diamond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect five diamonds wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
