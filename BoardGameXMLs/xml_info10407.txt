			<description>(from the Critical Hit Website:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shipbase III is the game of naval warfare from 1890-1945. More than just a set of rules, Shipbase III is a computer program that handles all the record-keeping and serves as an interface between you, the gamer, and thousands of lines of code representing years of technical research, allowing the players to concentrate on tactics...and fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;200 Game Pieces ... Shipbase III includes everything you need to play in one package. You receive 200 color, mounted cardboard game pieces representing ships and aircraft, as well as game markers, torpedoes and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shipbase III is designed to run on any PC. It runs under Windows 3.x to 9x/ME/2000/XP. and can be run using PC emulation software on the Macintosh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shipbase III is a complete game. You receive all the game pieces you need to play. Use of naval miniatures is purely optional.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(from BGG user breakmanynecks:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This looks like a very appealing game system. A computer assisted Naval Combat System for table top gaming, using miniatures or cardboard counters.You enter in the unit attacking, the ship that's being attacked, and the software gives you the results. I wonder if factors like; move allowance compared to ship's damage, or aircraft are included. I've been shopping for a Tactical naval rules system, this might be it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
