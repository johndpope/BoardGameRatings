							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death at Grimwood Hall</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People will do strange things for love, but Margaret Grimwood of Grimwood Hall is going to take that to a whole new level. In the sleepy town of Meanderwood something stirs in the darkness. Under the moonlight a glint of steel flashes. Two shadowy figures emerge from the graveyard carrying something on their shoulders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure will take the players deep into a macabre mystery of love, power and magic inspired by Mary Shelley&amp;rsquo;s Frankenstein. Take care, for everything is not what it seems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death at Grimwood Hall is an adventure for 4-6 PCs (player characters) of levels 3-4, although the adventure can be scaled for other levels. This adventure was designed for use with 7th edition rules of Tunnels and Trolls, but it can easily be converted for use with 5th edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
