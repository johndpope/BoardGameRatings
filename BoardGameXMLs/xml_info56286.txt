			<description>My First: What's My Job? is a children's educational game designed to help children associate objects with the jobs the people who use them and to help stimulate conversation. Game cards feature pictures of children acting out jobs such as Teacher, Fireman, and Singer as well as the objects they use. Players must match these cards together. For example, the fireman would match with the fire extinguisher, the singer would match with the microphone, and the teacher would match with the chalkboard. The player with the most matches is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
