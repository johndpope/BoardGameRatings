							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">KLIC Bowling</name>
									
			<description>KLIC Bowling is played on a plastic board reminiscent of a bowling alley, with a bowling lane for throwing two-six sided dice, and ten holes arranged like bowling pins, labeled with numbers one through ten and with plastic pegs that fit inside.  A score pad is also provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn a player rolls the dice and removes pegs based on the outcome, then tries to remove as many more pegs as possible by jumping as in Checkers or Solitaire puzzles.  When no more moves are possible, the score is tallied exactly as in real bowling games.  A second roll of the dice is then allowed, to attempt to remove any pegs remaining.  The next player then resets the pegs and takes his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rolling a double on the first dice throw is a strike, rolling a double on the second throw is a spare.  Players track their scores in a regular bowling score format, with the winner being the player scoring the highest number of points in ten frames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
