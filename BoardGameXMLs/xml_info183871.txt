							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Icarus Project</name>
									
			<description>The Icarus Project is a fast paced, narrative driven, sci fi skirmish wargame set over 700 years in the future. Players take control of small groups of elite soldiers, called strike forces, as they try to accomplish a variety of missions including assassinations, prisoner captures, and bomb disposals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a focus on narrative, cinematic gameplay, the Icarus Project is a game filled with water-cooler moments that will have you and your friends re-telling the stories for years to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take control of the Galactic Alliance of Humanity, a utilitarian behemoth with the largest military in the galaxy, or command the Nexus, a brutal alien race that wants nothing more than to wipe humanity from the galactic stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a variety of other factions and races, the Icarus Project has something for everyone. The Praesidians are a wise and noble race, and posses some of the most advanced technology in existence. The Ji'tar are iron-willed and don't take kindly to outsiders. And the Mercenary faction allows you to take control of the galaxy's criminals, outlaws, and guns for hire that can be added to any other strike force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
