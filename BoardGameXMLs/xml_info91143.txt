			<description>Toy Pop (トイポップ) is a multi-directional shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1986. The game was included in Namco Museum Vol.1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toy Pop is a top-down multi-directional shooter that can be played both single-player or with two players simultaneously. The player ventures through 44 levels (Toy Pop uses the toy-themed term &amp;quot;Box&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;Level&amp;quot; to fit with the game's setting) collecting five gold hearts contained in jars in each level in order to advance. Along the way, the player must open gift-wrapped containers concealing weapons and score-increasing bonus items; these various weapons are used to defeat several different varieties of enemies, each of which are typically vulnerable to only one type of weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The back story is that two dolls, Pino and Acha, have gone into the castle of the witch Majyo, who has kidnapped their friends. The game's opening cutscene reads &amp;quot;PINO AND ACHA ARE GOING TO MAJYO'S CASTLE TO SAVE FRIEND&amp;quot; before gameplay begins. The story culminates with a battle against Majyo in the 44th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Toy Pop,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
