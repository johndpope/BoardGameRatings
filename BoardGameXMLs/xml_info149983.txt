							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Song of the Starwalkers</name>
									
			<description>subtitle:&lt;br/&gt;an introductory adventure for Call of Cthulhu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Song of the Starwalkers is an adventure designed for a small group of present-day investigators. Set in the fictional town of Armitage, Massachusetts, it is intended as a first introduction to the Cthulhu Mythos. The story is primarily concerned with the machinations of a pair of small-time sorcerers in a rural New England town, and the horrors which they have visited upon the community. Despite obvious similarities, this scenario was not originally inspired by A Victim of the Art, by Dennis Detwiller. (This author did not purchase Countdown until after most of the scenario had already been written.) That being said, Countdown is a phenomenal book, and Song of the Starwalkers was originally intended to kick off a Delta Green campaign centered around the Hastur Mythos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
