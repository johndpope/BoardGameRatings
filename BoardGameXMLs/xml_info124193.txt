			<description>Each player has a card that features seven one-word clues. Each clue calls for a one-word answer that will complete a compound word or two-word phrase. For example, the clue may be &amp;quot;Black&amp;quot; and the answer &amp;quot;Jack&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reader reads the first clue from his card, and the other players shout out as many possible answers as they can think of in ten seconds. The first player to guess the correct answer moves his playing piece three spaces on the board. If no one guesses the correct answer, the reader makes up a sentence to help out the guessers, such as, &amp;quot;Ben likes to visit Vegas to play Black ________.&amp;quot; A correct guess now earns both the reader and the guesser two spaces on the board. The next player becomes the reader, and play continues until one player reaches the Finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
