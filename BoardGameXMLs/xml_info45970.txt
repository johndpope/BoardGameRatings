							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Against the Barrow King</name>
									
			<description>From the front cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Against the Barrow King is a d20 System adventure booster designed for 4-6 characters levels 3-5. It can be played as a stand-alone adventure or dropped into any ongoing campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The first raid on our village happened a little over three months ago. We awoke in the morning to discover that the Cooper family's house at the edge of town had been sacked and the entire family was missing,&amp;quot; croaks Obed, the village elder. &amp;quot;We mounted a search party, but found no trace of them.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old man lifts his gaze to the west woods. &amp;quot;After the third such attack, we sent a messenger to seek aid from one of the larger towns nearby. He never returned.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He turns back to face your party and continues, &amp;quot;We had no idea who or what was attacking our village... until last week. Creatures in black robes drifted out of the woods to the west and began setting houses on fire. Then, they seized four of our bravest men and carried them, screaming, into the mists.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obed throws his mug of ale into the fire, suddenly angry, &amp;quot;The only creature capable of this evil is the Barrow King, who lives in the burial mounds to the west. But I swear, we have done nothing to focus his anger upon us, nothing!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wearily, the elder stands, leaning heavily on his walking stick. Slowly, he lifts it, pointing at each of you in turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;If it is the Barrow King, God help us!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
