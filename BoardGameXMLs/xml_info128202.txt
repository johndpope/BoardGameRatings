			<description>A communicative card game in which quotations from the bible have to be put in relation to other texts. The idea behind the game is to show that the bible is still relevant today, to personal life as well as to society and politics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of two different sets of cards. One contains quotations from the bible, the other descriptions and aspects of modern life in the form of short texts, messages, promotional slogans etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players have to connect the quotations from the bible on the cards in their hands with the cards from the second set. This doesn't necessarily have to be a literal connection, it involves interpretation and translation into different contexts. &lt;br/&gt;Each player has a hand of five cards with a quotation from the bible, of which he/she has to choose one to go with the current card from the second set of cards. Each player then has one minute to explain why they have chosen a particular quotation, with the aim of &amp;quot;selling&amp;quot; their choice to the other players. The players then vote on the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; (i.e. most fitting) quotation. Each round, a different player is the &amp;quot;buyer&amp;quot;. He/she uses a set of blue chips numbered 1-5 to secretly vote which quotation they consider best, second best etc. The other players use white chips (also numbered 1-5) to guess the buyer's preferences. Players get points for choosing good (i.e. rated highly by the buyer) quotations as well as for guessing the buyer's preferences. &lt;br/&gt;The game ends either after a certain number of rounds, or after a player has reached a certain number of points. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
