			<description>The Blueprints product line offers you old-fashioned blue printed maps for using in your adventures and campaigns. For each map you get a blueprint version and a standard black and white version. The maps are all vector-based so you will get maximum print resolution. Despite their old fashioned appearance each map offers you a degree of customization by using the pdf technology at its best. A small control bar (which will not be printed) on each map allows you to turn on and off the grid, eliminate the room numbers, get the walls filled and don&amp;rsquo;t show doors and furniture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each product features a classic fantasy adventure location: a dungeon, a keep, a temple complex, a thieves&amp;rsquo; guild and so on. You can use these map as reference to build your own adventures or simply take them at hand in case your players go in an unexpected direction during the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to your favorite base of operations: the Citadel. This small citadel is a perfect headquarter for your party; also, within its walls, it may offer many opportunities to adventures who take home here. The citadel flanks a river (or sea) and features a small port. Two gates lead the travelers into the walls of the citadel. Inside the citadel, you can found everything a small community needs: stables, forges, inns, a large temple area, a lord&amp;rsquo;s house, gardens, wells and more. The citadel could be the keep of a larger city surrounding it or simply a small town, perhaps an extension of the lord&amp;rsquo;s keep. The citadel features two levels (ground level and first level) and a roof level is also provided. Below the ground level, you can found a cavern complex that links with the manor&amp;rsquo;s dungeons and a small sewer system. Please note the citadel is very large so the grid square should measure 20 feet.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
