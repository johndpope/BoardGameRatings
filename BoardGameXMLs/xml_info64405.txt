			<description>'Blik op de eeuw spel' is a Dutch game, published by PTT Post (Dutch postal service) at the end of the 20th centrury for promotional use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a lot in common with Trivial Pursuit. Players have to get all of their three pawns to the middle of the gameboard. Winner is the first player to do so. Pawns are moved by roling a d6, a pawn can only be moved towards the middle of the board by answering a question correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 10 categories of questions, each category covers one decade of the 20th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There also exists an edition that comes in a tin box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
