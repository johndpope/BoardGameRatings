			<description>Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou (爆笑!!人生劇場, &amp;quot;A Hearty Laugh! Theater Life&amp;quot;) is a Nintendo Family Computer life simulator game that simulates life from the toddler years to senior citizenship. The player must go to elementary school, junior high school, and high school. However, the player can elect to either go to university or start a career immediately. University requires players to pass a &amp;quot;test&amp;quot; in order to graduate and gain access to the better jobs in the game. Unlike the Super Jinsei Game series for the Super Famicom, the computer assigns the proper career for the player based on his avatar's intellectual, social, and physical skills.&lt;br/&gt;This game was released exclusively in Japan on March 17, 1989 and requires Japanese literacy to play successfully. While it lacked in the sophistication factor when compared to other games that are based on the Jinsei Game board game, the success of the game eventually lead to Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou 2 and Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou 3. Various elements that would be added to sequels with the series included the event squares and opportunity for radical hair cuts. Social interaction with other players (computer or human) is possible. However, the player's &amp;quot;parents&amp;quot; can take money away from players entering the next level in the game if they feel that they have too much money. This event is seen exclusively in this video game and it is not seen in its sequels or any of the games in the Super Jinsei Game series. Another feature not passed on to later games is the job interview. In order to get a job in this game, the player must do an interactive miniature game and &amp;quot;audition&amp;quot; for the new career. Failing the miniature game means not acquiring a job and succeeding means acquiring a paycheck and having job-related events appear on rolls of the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bakushou!!
