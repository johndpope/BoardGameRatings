			<description>[From the back of the box]:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rush across America&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Performance...Adrenaline...Speed!. these are the ingredients in the next generation of Rush Mania! Feel the Rush once again as you blast through some of the hottest spots in America!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- You want death-defying jumps and treacherous shortcuts? You'll find 'em along with much more, in 8 new venues&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Time to polish your speed demon driving skills! You'll be smokin' the radar guns in places like Las Vegas, New York City, Hawaii, Los Angeles and Seattle. And of course, there's that garden spot known as Alcatraz Island. Yeah, we're talkin' about The Rock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Choose your racing machine from 15 new vehicles. Then cruise on in to the body shop and trick out your ride: change the brakes, switch out the wheels or get a completely sweet paint job!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- New Durability setting allows you to pump up the strength of your vehicle! The heavier the setting, the more hits you'll withstand! And while you're testing your car muscle, collect keys hidden on all the tracks and gain access to leaner, meaner and faster racing machines - cool things come to those who race!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Decisions, decisions - Rush 2 has 11 selectable tracks along with a 28 track circuit mode. Ignore the speed limit as you race through all of them or reverse the tracks to make even more! And while you're seein' the sights at the speed of light, crank up the radio - each city comes with its own killer soundtrack!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
