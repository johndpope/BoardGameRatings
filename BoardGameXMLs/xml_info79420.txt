			<description>Raise and breed magical pets! Collect gold! Save your kingdom!&lt;br/&gt;Adventure and SIM lovers, we've made a game that we think you will love! Explore villages in a beautiful kingdom, solve quests, find goodies, buy magical pets, breed magical pets, and create new species of pets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your step father has died and left the kingdom to your evil step brother, Lord Boras. However, if you earn 100,000 gold coins in 100 days, you can kick out Lord Boras and take the castle for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get your kingdom back, you buy a run-down cottage called Grimm's Farm, where you can raise and breed new species of magical pets. As your herd of magical pets swells, you can buy new, more luxurious places to raise your pets and unlock new parts of the kingdom to explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
