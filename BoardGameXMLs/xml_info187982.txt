			<description>Teblo is an abstract strategy game. It is played on a square board (12x12). Each player has a pawn and 25 square pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows 4 colored starting squares. Players start their pawn on their own starting square, diagonally opposite to each other. Their goal is to reach to starting square of the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn a player can either move his pawn horizontally or vertically or place one of his square pieces on the board.&lt;br/&gt;These pieces can only be placed on the white squares. Pawn can enter the colored squares too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The square pieces block the opponents route to the goal square, but not your own (you can place your pawn on top of it and pass your own piece in the next turn).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player may never block the goal square completely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You win as soon as you reach the goal square with your pawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
