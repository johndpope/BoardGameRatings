							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Murder at Moonveil Manor</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You walk across the cobblestone streets in the bustling city of Everhast, following the hastily scrawled map in your hands. Wandering past shouting vendors within the vibrant marketplace, you exit the wonderous trading city through one of its many archways; the street giving way to dirt roads overlooking rolling hills and lush forest. You didn't expect an invite from such a high ranking noble, let alone for such a dinner to be held on such short notice. After all, it's not like your adventuring exploits had gained that much fame, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a short, 6 - 8 hour action packed murder mystery adventure for a party of 4 - 6 5th level characters. After being invited to an evening dinner by the eccentric Lord Berkestaff, can the players figure out the mystery before the killer figures them out first?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
