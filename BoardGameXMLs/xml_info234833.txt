							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Behind the Mask: Neutron Girl</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Behind the Mask series goes beyond the media hype and comic book exaggerations to uncover the real people who wear the costumes, fight the super villains, and live with the moniker, &amp;quot;hero.&amp;quot; Where did they come from? What do they want out of life? Who are their most hated adversaries? Each issue of Behind the Mask asks one hero of M.E.T.A. Force to answer these questions uncensored and unscripted, no subjects are off limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features Include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Full M&amp;amp;M 3E stats -PL10&lt;br/&gt;    Areas of Specialty, Methods, and Objectives&lt;br/&gt;    Allies and Enemies&lt;br/&gt;    Personality&lt;br/&gt;    Origin&lt;br/&gt;    Combat Tactics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And we make a few suggestions on how to incorporate each hero into your own RPGs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this issue we get a rare opportunity to talk with one of the most reclusive and obscure legends of the Golden Age, Neutron Girl. An alien super soldier originally sent to Earth to fight the Nazis, she survived a blast of cosmic radiation and gained enormous power. After the war, she stayed on Earth  and became both a hero and an international threat, due to her unstable psychology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
