			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;A broom, rotating slippers, meatloaf explosives and aggressive grannies!&lt;br/&gt;All this is Angry Granny!!!&lt;br/&gt;A game up to six players where you have to drive your grandmother in a fight full of explosives and grandchildren of Alzheimer attacks with purpose of winning the coveted old-age pension!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Angry Granny is an easy game to learn but more and more challenging as they play! You have to choose very carefully the grandmother to attack because it might hide some surprises ...&lt;br/&gt;in short, this is a game in order to put an end to even the most solid friendships!.&lt;br/&gt;Grandmothers of Angry Granny will change forever!!&lt;br/&gt;There are no more grandmothers of a time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IN THE BOX: &lt;br/&gt;18 Grandma cards&lt;br/&gt;100 action cards&lt;br/&gt;6 staples scorecard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to defeat other players reducing their grandmas' score to zero! The last player who survives with his grandma is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn consists in three phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supplying phase: The turn player take a card from the fighting deck. He  reveals it to everyone and then he holds it among his cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Main phase: The turn player can play cards of his hand respecting a sequenze of colors in the use of the cards (first yellow, then red and finally purple cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End Phase: Every player can place a covered defence card and then he respects the number of three cards in his hand drawing new cards from the fighting deck or discarding redundant cards .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
