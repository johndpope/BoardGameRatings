			<description>A cricket game &amp;quot;First-Class cricket in your home&amp;quot;. The publisher goes on to say that it is hard to imagine a more thrilling game on your table.&lt;br/&gt;The board is &amp;quot;gaily coloured&amp;quot; and represents the Kensington Oval, a revered cricket ground in South London.&lt;br/&gt;The fielding team player can place his fielders on different locations on the board, hopefully to stop runs. The bowling and batting seems to be decided by card play (but it could be as simple as draw a card, read the result, i.e. no skill). Unfortunately, I only have a magazine advert to go by as this game is unknown in the British collecting circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
