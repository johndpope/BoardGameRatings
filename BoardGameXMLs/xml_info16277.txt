							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Satan!</name>
									
			<description>The game comes with a flaming dice pin, which the players wear. When two players meet (recognizing the pin), the game begins when one of them declares &amp;quot;Satan!&amp;quot; Then both players roll three six-sided dice on the nearest convenient surface. Any die that doesn't come up 6 is rerolled. The first player to have all three dice showing sixes (6-6-6) and declare &amp;quot;Satan!&amp;quot; is the winner. If other players hear the initial call, they can declare &amp;quot;Satan!&amp;quot; and join the game. &lt;br/&gt;The game was sold as a joke at GenCon 2003, but turned into a minor hit. Prospective buyers weren't told the rules unless they bought the game, but at $5, it drew in many curious gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
