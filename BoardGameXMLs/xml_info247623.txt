							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Books on UFOs and Extraterrestrials to Find on a Bookshelf</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a list of 100 books on UFOs, extraterrestrials, close encounters and abductions that players might find on a bookshelf. The books are mostly suitable for a modern setting, as the vast majority were first published in the late 20th century, although some are older.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The books cover aspects of UFOs, including encounters with their crews, voyages to other planets and man-mad flying saucers, most from believers but a handful coming from a more sceptical viewpoint. All the books listed are genuine books, some of them by well known names in the field. Whether or not the books have any in-game value other than decorative is up to the GameMaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entries have the book's name, author, if known, and in every case other details, in particular the area that the book covers. They can be used to pad out a bookshelf with other genuine material, although it is unlikely that any one person would have books on the whole range of subject material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some examples are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;33. ManMade UFOs, 19441994: Fifty Years of Suppression by Renato Vesco and David Hatcher Childress (Manmade saucers starting with World War II Nazi designs, some powered by Vril)&lt;br/&gt;34. Men In Black: Investigating the Truth Behind the Phenomenon by Jenny Randles (Investigates cases of encounters with the men in black)&lt;br/&gt;35. Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Philip J. Imbrogno and Bob Pratt (The UFO sightings in the Hudson Valley in the U.S. starting in 1982)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
