			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can't run your usual game, running a Con game or looking for something short to introduce new players? Just Insert Imagination has you covered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You slowly open your eyes (or eye in some cases) and look around. A stuffed bear stares at you morosely. You are sitting on a shelf in a room with way too many posters of ponies and happy cats.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When your master was imprisoned, the magic animating you was cut off.  But now, many years later life is flowing back into your burlap arms and the voice of your master repeats in your mind: &amp;quot;Find the ingredients, finish the ritual and free me from this prison. You have until midnight.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night of the Living Dolls is a Halloween adventure for the whole family. A group of doll-like minions wake up in the room of a four-year-old girl. They must search the house for the ritual ingredients while hiding from humans, avoiding the family dog and keeping a look out for the minions of the man who imprisoned their boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the document (that is designed to fit inside a GM screen) you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    setting rules&lt;br/&gt;    twists and complications to use&lt;br/&gt;    npc's&lt;br/&gt;    5 pre-generated characters&lt;br/&gt;    a blank character sheet to create your own doll&lt;br/&gt;    table tents&lt;br/&gt;    house map and stickers &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
