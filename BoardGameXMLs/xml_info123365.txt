			<description>1930's party game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 5 large, cardboard horses. Each horse is attached to a length of string. Up to 5 players can play but more can be included if they just bet on the result. Each player with a horse stands about ten feet away from the agreed finish line. Their line of string is attached to something substantial, like a dining room table. At the cry &amp;quot;They're Off!&amp;quot;, players jiggle their string and their horse should start to move to towards the finish line. It will get pretty frenetic but that adds to the fun. First owner to get their horse to the finishing line wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
