			<description>Key to the Front Door is an educational game aimed primarily at school children to help teach money management. Players take turns rolling dice and moving around a board in Monopoly fashion. The board spaces allow players to purchase &amp;quot;needs&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;wants&amp;quot;, to add funds to savings, to splurge on a vacation, to buy or sell at garage sales, or to spend or earn money in a variety of other ways. The winner is either the first player to furnish his apartment with all his &amp;quot;needs&amp;quot; or the last player to go broke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
