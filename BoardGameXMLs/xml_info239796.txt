							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Butcher&#039;s Game</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You were raised in the small town of Kerasak, and had spent every day pretending to be adventures with your close friends. You all swore and oath to one day become adventures and one day travel the world, slaying dragons and rescuing dames and damsels in distress. Of course, as you grew older you gave up those fantasies and settled in for real world accomplishments. Now, you haven&amp;rsquo;t spoken to most of those friends in years, and even when you have, it has only been short catch-up conversations and nothing more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But none of that explains why you currently find yourself strapped to a table in a dark room, with all these old friends of yours around you. When a man you don&amp;rsquo;t recognize starts sawing through one of your old friend&amp;rsquo;s legs, you know it's going to be a long night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Butcher's Game is a who-done-it, one shot adventure that pits players against each other as they travel through a horror setting trying to escape from a dungeon they mysterious find themselves in. Each player is given a role and a secret which ranges from hiding a simple thievery to murdering another player for future prophet or power. Is is designed with Dungeon and Dragon's 5th Edition in mind, however the rules are malleable enough to easily fit into any RPG adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure heavily focuses on roleplay and is recommended for player level 1-4, and takes roughly 1-4 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
