			<description>One Piece: Unlimited Cruise (ワンピース:アンリミテッドクルーズ Wan Pīsu: Anrimiteddo Kurūzu?) is a video game for the Nintendo's Wii console based on the popular manga and anime One Piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five different islands in Episode 1; A winter island, a desert island with a seashell, an island with a giant tree and waterfalls under it, and a island that is essentially a giant cave. The final island is where the player fights the final boss, Doom Guardian. The Thousand Sunny can be explored, showing many of the rooms inside of it. In the Tankōbon version of One Piece manga, Oda drew a detailed interior design for Thousand Sunny including each piece of furniture and passage ways. From the current preview it seems Unlimited Cruise kept Oda's design down to exact detail down to the patterns on the walls and furniture. In Episode 2, there are five locations(not including Thousand Sunny) : a desert location that resembles Alabasta, and a dark, murky, ruinous place that looks like Thriller Bark. The Thousand Sunny is a stage in which the players can interact various rooms with, however, it is not an island. There is also an Island that looks similar to the &amp;quot;Seaside Zone&amp;quot; of Unlimited Adventure, but lightly edited, and could possibly be based on the island in the Ocean's Dream arc where the Straw Hats had their memories stolen. The fourth location is a floating island. This island could also be based on Skypeia as the island is supported by a large beanstalk which bears a striking resemblance to Giant Jack. The final island where the final boss Doom Guardian is held also looks nearly identical to how it looked in Episode 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;One Piece: Unlimited Cruise&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
