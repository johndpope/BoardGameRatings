							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Island Emergency</name>
									
			<description>The Islands have been devastated by a huge natural disaster. It has ripped buildings apart, thrown debris far and wide, and endangered the lives of the Island&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants. As the danger subsides survivors are gradually emerging from the rubble and signalling for help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can choose. Will you be a team of willing rescuers on a helicopter, a UFO looking for specimens or a hungry dragon looking for easy meals? Either way players score points by collecting the survivors as quickly as they can but are restricted in their flight patterns by the local air currents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of a grid of 9 tiles, representing the islands, each with only 2 arrows on to indicate legal moves off of the tile. As the survivors are randomly generated each turn players must try to negotiate their way to them using 2 moves, no more, no less. If they fail to pick anyone up in a turn then they can claim a chaos card that can allow them in a future turn to twist, swap, or twist and swap islands around to make their path easier and/or to foil the plans of the other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't be fooled by the apparent simplicity of only having to negotiate 9 tiles - this is a game often demanding some pretty involved thinking out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advanced solo option keeps the pressure on by introducing dangers to your survivors such as storms, fire, and disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
