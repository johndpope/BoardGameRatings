Combat is resolved by the attacker secretly choosing a Fate Bear and the defender secretly choosing one or more (depending on the situation) Fate Bears. If the attacker's Fate Bear does not match any of the defender's Fate Bear colors, the attack is successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comes with 4 scenarios (variants).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
