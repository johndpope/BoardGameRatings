							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Terminal Velocity</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Terminal Velocity is a video game developed by Terminal Reality and published by 3D Realms on May 1, 1995. It is an arcade-style combat-dedicated flight action shooter, with easier game controls and less general realism than general flight simulators. It is known for its relatively fast, high-energy action sequences, especially when compared to other more realistic flight simulators around at the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terminal Reality also developed another extremely similar game, Fury3, published that same year by Microsoft. It used the same game engine and basic game mechanics, but was designed to run natively on the new Windows 95 operating system. It was considered a weaker game than Terminal Velocity, but Fury3 spawned an add-on pack, F!Zone, as well as a sequel, Hellbender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can fly at arbitrarily low speeds without falling. The player's craft also has no inertia, meaning its course can be changed instantly. Additionally, it possess powerful afterburners  that allow it to move at blinding speeds, evading massive attacks, though it is unable to shoot during that time.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Terminal Velocity (computer game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
