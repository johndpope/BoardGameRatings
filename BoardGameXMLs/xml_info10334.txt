							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Cold Day In Hell</name>
									
			<description>It's the day nobody thought would come, especially the Devil. Temperatures in Hell have taken a real nose-dive. For the first time ever government offices in Hell have turned off the air conditioning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's downright COLD!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While everybody is loving this break from the eternal heat, there is one problem: the Devil can't find his winter coat. He swears he put it in his closet after his last ski vacation in the Alps. But, it's been an eternity since then, and how often does he really need his winter coat in hell anyway?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your task is to find the Devil's winter coat before he gets his panties in a bunch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(This is an e-game; you can purchase it for download, and print it out.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
