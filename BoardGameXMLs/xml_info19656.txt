			<description>Roll dice as few times as possible to match symbols shown on the game board. Symbols must be matched in rows of six. Rows must be across or up and down. Each row of symbols must be matched in not more than 3 rolls of the dice per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player who has filled a row of symbols picks up the six dice and places a strip of cardboard over that row of symbols and continues to play, attempting to match dice with symbols in any of the remaining rows.  The same player continues to play as long as he can complete an uncovered row of symbols.  As rows are filled (or covered) the game becomes more challenging.  Filling a row in the three rolls becomes more difficult.  If a player does succeed in covering all the rows without ever giving up the dice, he has achieved the IMPOSSIBLE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
