							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Broken English</name>
									
			<description>Broken English is a word/card game; you start with 8 cards and try to form words.  Picking up a card from the draw stack and discarding one.  Once you can play all your cards as a set of words, you declare you are going out.  Others then play their words and then attempt to play off the declarer's cards to form words.  The cards are worth points and the more points you get, the higher the score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very groovy 70's color scheme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
