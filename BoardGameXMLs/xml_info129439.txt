			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         This game is scheduled to be released at Spiel 2013 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that all details for this game are preliminary. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an apartment building, the tenants are having a laundry day.  Their task is simple: to hang clothes on the balconies.  But, the air and shaky hands might cause some of the clothespins, pinza de ropa in Spanish, to fall, or mysteriously end up on a higher floor of the building!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players alternate turns during which they try to have as many clothespins as possible on their floor.  Each player's floor is designated by a secret objective card (marked with a star).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During their turn players choose a floor on the board, roll the dice, and then may play cards to affect the outcome of the dice.  Each number on the dice different from the player's floor means that a clothespin must go to another floor.  A special objective card indicates which floor is best for that player's clothespins.  The winner of the game is the one that gathers the most points, based on the special objective card and a player's played cards during the duration of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The print &amp;amp; play version which will be available through this site and the publisher's page is the family version of the game.  A future version of Pinza de Ropa will include a new advanced version, with more cards, strategies, and surprises that will make the game even better!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only thing not provided in the print'n play version of the game are the 5 dice.  You will need 5 6-sided dice to play.  Also, if you wish, you may use real clothespins.  We have provided a .pdf with a printable clothespin, but if you want to pimp out the game...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
