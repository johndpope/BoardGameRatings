			<description>Players identified by a color, place two marker chips on the board. Similar to Craps, there are several types of options with various odds. In addition to single roll options, one section has two levels. Upon successfully winning Level 1, Level 2 (the second marker chip, if placed in Level 2) is activated and increases the potential for an exponentially high payoff on the next dice roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although calibrated for casino-style wagering, the premiere edition is configured for the accumulation of points. All options on the board state the point values. Everyone plays concurrently and independently, utilizing the same dice rolls. Each player lists the points acquired and after (30) minutes of play, the scores are totaled. The player with the highest score wins the game.  In the event of a tie, play continues one dice roll at a time until the tie is broken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Level 1 is the spark that can ignite Level 2 to Fuel an exponential payoff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
