			<description>Educational game developed for &amp;quot;Libera&amp;quot; an anti-mafia association that wanted a game to educate people on which bar in Perugia city, Italy, were free from slot machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game a player is a gambler who is wasting all the money of his family gambling on slot machines of the city's pubs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other players cooperate all together moving family pawns in order to find him and sae his soul and the money of the family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty-five  3D Slot machines are placed in a 5x5 grid representing the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gambler takes turns hiding the gameboard with a screen, and moving  his pawn of one space. The pawn is always hidden inside a 3D slot machine. Each time he moves the pawn, he leaves one hidden gold coin below the visited slot machine.&lt;br/&gt;On the family's turn, players cooperate choosing which family pawns to activate. &lt;br/&gt;Family pawns stay among the 3D slot machines, on the intersections of the grid.&lt;br/&gt; When activated, a family pawn may move one space OR search in a bar in the surroundings. &lt;br/&gt;If searching, players can look below the chosen slot machine:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    if they find the Gambler pawn, they win&lt;br/&gt;    if they find a Gold coin, they remove the 3D slot machine from the gameboard (several gold coins may indicate the current position of the gambler)&lt;br/&gt;    if they find nothing, they must put back the slot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gambler wins if he runs out of gold coins without being found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
