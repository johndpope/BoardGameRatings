			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s Filbar Friday offers continues in the Dual Series with FD8 &amp;ndash; Mask of Vexicon! After checking local pawn shops and the library you have discovered information on an old Adurite noblewoman who possessed a magical mask. The woman had suffered a facial injury and commissioned a magical face shield to hide her wound. Having never heard of the item you believe it is probably in the ruins near Ugus Horrus where she lived. With no other leads at the moment you gear up and decide to embark on the search for this item!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Dual Campaign for a 2-4 mid-level adventurers and DM.  Primarily designed for two players, the FD series has included the opportunity for NPC assistance or with just four players. This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
