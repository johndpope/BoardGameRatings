							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Martini Street Peril</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty years after a brutal race riot rocked the small town of Liberty and forced its minority population to flee for their lives, a survivor of the violence approaches the PCs with a request to retrieve some valuables he left behind in his flight. But to complete their mission, the group must contend with a viciously racist motorcycle gang and then determine the whereabouts of the valuables. And what is the deadly secret of both the patron and the long-lost bundle?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Martini Street Peril is a short, no-frills adventure for Thrill of the Thirties! 2D6 Adventure in the Pulp Era and other tabletop RPGs using a 2D6 mechanic based on the Traveller SRD (which is itself based on The Original Science Fiction Roleplaying Game) starring characters of varied career backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
