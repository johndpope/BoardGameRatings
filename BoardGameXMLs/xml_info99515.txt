							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Noort River Fur Traders</name>
									
			<description>The winter ice will soon be swept out of the Noort River, and the new trading season for furs will will begin. All winter, Indians have been trapping beaver and other fir-bearing animals. They are now on their way to Dutch Fort Orange, 150 miles north of New Amsterdam, with bundles of pelts for sale. You have stocked your sturdy ship with a selection of desirable trade goods, welcome to both settlers and Indians alike. Your task is to sail to Fort Orange, selling your trade goods at a profit along the way, arriving at Fort Orange ready to buy furs. Time is precious as you look for the best price to buy, then sailing back to New Amsterdam (or New England) to sell your cargo of furs at a profit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
