			<description>Number of players: 2&amp;ndash;4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game: The player that shoots the soccer ball the best will win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment: You will need the box, four trilithons and a set of ten of the same color disks per player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all of the players are ready to begin, each player touches their goal with one of their thumbs and hold their ball straight up with their pointer finger. All players yell &amp;quot;one, two, three, shoot&amp;quot; to begin. A player can then &amp;quot;shoot&amp;quot; the ball by gently flicking it with their other pointer finger. There are no turns to this game, so the players can shoot as fast or as slow as they wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all of the players are out of disks. Scoring is completed and the one who scored the most points wins. If there is a tie, out of the tied players, the player who has the least amount of balls through their home goal is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;What a great day for Stonehenge Soccer, Chet.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You betcha, Bret. Both teams have just finished making their appropriate sacrifices and they are ready to take the pitch.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
