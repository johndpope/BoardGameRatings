							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blackwheel Company: A Plague Upon Your Houses</name>
									
			<description>A One-Round Faction Adventure Packet for 9th-Level Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blackwheel Company&amp;rsquo;s internal conflict has become an open struggle for dominance within the ranks at this point. General Mach Ogdin has publicly declared his wish for the Company to end it&amp;rsquo;s exclusive contract with the Dragonmarked Houses. Following up on his proclamation he has called for an Executive Council session to push forward a vote of no confidence against Field Marshal Mackinnon Maceck. The Executive Council is made of up the Company&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;shareholders&amp;rdquo; consisting of all high-ranking officers of the company. The higher the rank earned, the more shares held and the more votes can be cast. While the Council prepares to meet, Maceck and Ogdin are doggedly attempting to sway the officers and hires to support their cause. Interestingly, and perhaps ironically, the internal rift has not impeded the Company&amp;rsquo;s paramilitary operations. In fact, following up on the successful defense of Stormreach against the Ebon pirates, the Company has received broader public support and has experienced a number of successes in other missions. These successes have brought both increased confidence and swollen coffers to the Company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
