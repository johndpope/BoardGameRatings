			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring the Infected Zombie Hordes to Your Savage Worlds Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is your Savage Worlds game missing the infected zombie hordes you've always dreamed of?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This release of Monster Brief provides game stats on the Infected Zombie, a creature returned from the dead to eat brains and spread its infection to the living.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes the infected zombie template so you can transform any creature into an infected member of the undead, along with example infected zombie civilian, rat swarm, and wolf/ dog stat blocks. There is also a special infected lasher zombie template (zombies that whip and entangle their prey using their own intestines), infected blob zombie template (zombies that spew bile and rotting flesh to attract other zombies), and infected stalker zombie template (zombies that leap large distances to pounce upon their prey), each with a zombie civilian example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also the intelligent infected zombie template for portraying characters who are overcome by the zombie infection but retain their intelligence, along with an infected intelligent super-hero zombie example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rounding out this product are eight plot ideas for using infected zombies in your game, and suggestions on how the zombie infection may function in your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
