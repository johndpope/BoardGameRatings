			<description>&amp;quot;Rules for Wild West and Civil War. These is a very simple wargame for play on beach or in backyard, with plastic toy soldiers. The focus is on a fast-action game, easy to learn and easy to play. Our game is for small battles, only - with armies of 100 men or less on each side.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players must supply the appropriate Cowboy and Indian or Civil War toy soldiers. The rules divide the figures into four types: Infantry (foot soldiers), Cavalry (mounted soldiers), Artillery (gun crewmen and cannon), and Indians (who fight as infantry or cavalry).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each type of figure is rated or movement, as are wagons and caissons. Each of the weapons commonly carried by these types of figures is rated for range, damage, and rate of fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other concepts covered in the rules include terrain effects, hand-to-hand combat, walls/bunkers, forts, prisoners and escapes. Scenario suggestions are given for open field battles, defense of forts, and relief of besieged forts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the Sandy Hook Battle Games, available for free online at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.thortrains.net/armymen/westgame.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.thortrains.net/armymen/westgame.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
