							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strange Bedfellows (Hot Chicks)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Book One of the Yojimbo Trilogy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Times have been hard for the Swedish Bikini Assassin Team.  No front man, no money, and the whole world coming after them for lethal payback.  Just their luck they should happen to run to Bakersfield...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See what happens when the world's most dangerous swimsuit models hook up with the Lich Lord of Bakersfield.  It's not a match made in Heaven, really, but lethal payback may just have to wait a little while.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add a horrific tentacle monster to the mix, and almost anything can happen.  Even assassins and undead Archmages may need a helping hand from Player Characters when things get this bad.  Can you save Bakersfield before it falls... and leaves the world vulnerable to a toxic tentacle zombie apocalypse?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a supplement for Hot Chicks: The Roleplaying Game, you will need the core rulebook in order to play.  Herein, we update characters from The Swedish Bikini Assassin Team and The Lich Lord of Bakersfield!, you may want to look at those books for reference.  There will also be references to material from Librum Enchantus, Mechaphisto: The Demon Lord of Technology, and Villain-Net.  While Strange Bedfellows is not an adult supplement, you may find a copy of our book of Dark Erotica, Inner Darkness, useful (it is not, however, necessary).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
