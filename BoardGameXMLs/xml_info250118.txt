							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Wasteland Traders, Set 1</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scattered across the ruined wastes of a post modern civilization are numerous trading posts, flea markets, and swap meets. At such places its not uncommon to find various scavengers and peddlers selling their loot from rickety old tables, junk littered blankets, makeshift tents, rusty truck beds, or the back trunks of cars. But who are these folk, what are they like? Most important, what do they have for sale? This 100 list features the name of the trader, a brief descriptive (down to earth, cautious, shady, etc.) and a list of the most common goods they have on hand. Some vendors have needed practical items, like food, clothing, and tools, while others cater to the addicts of assorted vices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
