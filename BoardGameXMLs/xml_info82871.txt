							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NFL Paperbowl</name>
									
			<description>It's the the Official Paper Football of the NFL! Official, baby! It doesn't get more official than that! That doesn't just mean we have all the teams and all the logos, it means we're the best damn Paper Football on iTunes! When NFL Films makes their long-awaited documentary on Paper Football, you're going to be seeing grainy footage of THIS APP. Don't you want to be able to say you were there? Who knows, it may be YOUR FINGERS kicking a paper football across the Frozen Tundra. Or the Electronic Tundra. Or maybe you could take your iPhone to the stadium and flick a football across the Electronic Field, while you're standing in the Real Action. You get the idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
