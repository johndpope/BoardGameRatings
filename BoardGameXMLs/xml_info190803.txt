Just play a Black Apple card from your hand that best matches the White Apple card.  If the judge picks your card, you win the round!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Packed with exclusive Appleversary scoring tokens and bushels of cards never before seen in a Party Box, the Apples to Apples 15th Appleversary Edition proves that some things just get better with age!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
