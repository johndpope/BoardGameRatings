			<description>The player controls a Phoenix that is slowly dying. With its flaming wings unable to sustain themselves she flies low over a river on the Chinese new year to collect fire from the lanterns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to travel as far as possible: red lanterns will invigorate you while the blue 'water' lanterns will douse your wings and slow you down. You must actively collect the red lanterns or you will gradually burn out. In addition to the lanterns are several obstacles and special items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ice crystals will freeze you in place while walls will slow you down dramatically. The three special coins can be activated once collected:&lt;br/&gt;Z - 'Tiger Blood' The next two rows of red lanterns will be extremely potent&lt;br/&gt;X - 'Tortoise Speed' A temporary boost of slow motion allows a few seconds of fine-control&lt;br/&gt;C - 'Dragon Rage' For a few seconds you are invulnerable to all slowing effects and your speed will not decay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember that all Phoenix must die before they can be reborn, but please enjoy the beauty of this final flight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the player flies through the city the Phoenix can quite possibly come across bridges which block out the player&amp;rsquo;s view for half a second. Fireworks will pop up every time you can beat the previous furthest distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
