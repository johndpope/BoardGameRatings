			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city of Spire is rotting from within and without. Each year the structures built onto the outside of the city&amp;rsquo;s structure collapse and fall away. The cursed tear in reality, the Heart, festers deep within the centre. Disorder and chaos are a natural part of daily life for those on the edges of civilisation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And yet: the brutal undercity of Red Row is more chaotic than ever. Where before gangs would pass each other with holstered weapons and wary glances,  each keeping to their respective territories, now they engage in open warfare, and spireblack gunsmoke floats through the dark city. Families come apart, leaving children without mothers, begging on the streets for sustenance. The Crimson Vigil, a group of violent anti-aelfir reactionaries, are openly recruiting soldiers for their forbidden cult. And a new play, The Weeping Maiden, is touring the district &amp;ndash; and that&amp;rsquo;s all anyone seems to talk about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things are coming apart, and ordinary people are getting caught in the middle. Someone is behind this. The player characters, all of them noted professionals in Red Row (and relative novices in the Ministry) gather their resistance cell together and start investigating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood and Dust is a campaign frame for the Spire RPG intended to last around five sessions of play. Inside, you&amp;rsquo;ll find five pre-generated player characters (although players can make their own if they wish), a list of factions and events surrounding the goings-on in and beneath Red Row, and stats for relevant adversaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
