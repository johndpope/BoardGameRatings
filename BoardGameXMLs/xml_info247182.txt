							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flashpoint: South China Sea</name>
									
			<description>Flashpoint: South China Sea is a two-player strategy game that simulates the complex geopolitical contest currently taking place between the United States and China in a disputed region of the South China Sea. The game is driven by a card deck that captures developments ripped straight from today&amp;rsquo;s headlines, bolstered by cards with a context-setting reading of recent history, and a set of speculative cards capturing a diverse range of potential future events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chinese player works to influence other countries in the region, establish territorial claims and regional hegemony, and improve its world standing. The U.S. player works to maintain influence with allied countries in the region, secure freedom of navigation, and keep China in check. Success for both players hinges on the support and allegiance of non-player countries in the region. The game stops short of dealing with a potential full-scale military conflict. Rather, it requires the nuanced exercise of political, economic, and military resources, in a form of prima facie diplomacy &amp;ndash; on the waters, in the air, and ultimately in the minds of the people &amp;ndash; to achieve victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
