			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Random Encounter is an RPG interview zine. Each issue explores one RPG creator, the games they play, the things they make and how they try to do both well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Issue 3 of A Random Encounter looks at Patrick Stuart, writer of Deep Carbon Observatory, co-writer of the ENnie Award winning Maze of the Blue Medusa, and creator of the False Machine blog. We explore Patrick's imagination, his thoughts on games, his approach to game design and a lot more. As well as a super-sized interview, Issue 3 features outstanding art by Scrap Princess and Jeremy Duncan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
