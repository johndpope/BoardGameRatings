							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monopoly: Michael Graves Wooden Keepsake</name>
									
			<description>This is a redesign of the classic game Monopoly by design artist Michael Graves, and distributed exclusively in Target stores.  The game is smaller than a typical Monopoly board, and as such, so are the title deeds, chance and community chest cards, and bank notes,  The houses and hotels are also redesigned in the Michael Graves style, and come in velvet pouches for storage when not in use.  The tokens are based on the designs that Mr. Graves has submitted to Target for different household items (Cup &amp;amp; Saucer, Telephone, Wall Clock, Blender, Tea Kettle, and Toaster).  And this all is enclosed in a very attractive wood box.  The board folds open on the top like the top of a cigar or jewelery box, with side supports that swing out from the back, and there is a drawer on the side to store the tokens, buildings, cards, deeds, and money.  This drawer functions as Money rack when playing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
