			<description>Party Game. Guests are given a card. During the evening, you will be given clues by other guests as to the telephone number you are trying to find. The first guest to guess their telephone number correctly, wins&lt;br/&gt;(By the way, in the 50's you didn't just have a number, you have a place-name that comes before the number e.g. Maida Vale 1234 would be a possible number).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
