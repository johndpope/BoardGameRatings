			<description>This is a Japanese science fiction wargame set in the universe of the Legend of the Galactic Heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seven scenarios are contained in the game, and the fictional space battle that each was drawn in the story is reproduced. These are being called a fleet battle, but when either is said, it is close to the land battle of Napoleonic age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player control one or more star fleets. &lt;br/&gt;Each fleet is commanded by one admiral, and organized by 10 to 20 ships units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a fleet are activated in the unintentional order by chit-pull system, and it resolves a movement and a combat. &lt;br/&gt;An average admiral has only one or two chits. But the heroes of the story has four or more chits, and it is activated  many times during one turn. &lt;br/&gt;A battle is resolved with adjacent hex on the Odds CRT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome is decided by the number which made a fleet collapse. A fleet collapses when a fixed unit is eliminate or admiral's mental agitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
