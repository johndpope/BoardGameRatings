			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Erik the Swift, Baleog the Fierce and Olaf the Stout are out living it up Viking style, sailing about, when they are abruptly sucked into an alien spaceship and taken far from home!  They manage to escape the ship, but unfortunately they escape into a portal in time and become even more displaced.  Now you must help them find their way home by using each Viking's unique abilities to reach portals that will, hopefully, eventually lead back to their own time without getting any of them killed in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a unique combination of puzzles, platforming and action, you must control the three Vikings (or have a friend or two control the others) and use their skills to reach the end of each level.  Throughout their travels back home they will travel to a variety of locations, including a spaceship, prehistoric times, pyramids, and many others, each with original styles, music, puzzles and enemies.  The cartoony graphics, silly deaths and comedic interludes between scenes added some much needed relief to some very challenging puzzles and platforming, and a password system with one password per level let you return to any point in the game when you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
