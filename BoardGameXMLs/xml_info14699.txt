			<description>Path Of Pharaohs is a Free Print and Play card game provided by Crosstown Games (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.geocities.com/crosstowngames&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.geocities.com/crosstowngames&lt;/a&gt;) comprising of a card game which plays like a board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are one of many young pharaohs attempting to be the first to build a pyramid upon the ancient ruins of Alexandria, but first you must build upon 12 sites in the lower Nile River valley battling other pharaohs for exclusive use of construction locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays out as you place number cards in the shape of a pyramid in front of you.  Specific block locations allow for your pharaoh to be moved spaces along the path.  No pharaoh may be building in the same location which causes loss of ground and time...  Time?  Watch out for the mummies that become disturbed as the game unfolds.  They are jealous of their ancient site and allow no building upon them.  Sandstorms, thieves, and opponent sabotage await your every move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
