							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Abedju Cipher</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Abedju Cipher is about trust and all its myriad depths: earning trust, bestowing trust, wondering whether one&amp;rsquo;s trust in another is justified, the breaking of trust with (or in) another and all the consequences that follow from that break in faith. Implicit trust in someone is a precious and fragile thing. This story is about when to trust and whom, and what it means to be trustworthy. Within this story, the characters are introduced to an ancient mystical relic and exposed to a number of individuals and factions bent on acquiring it at any cost. The characters encounter uncertain allies, certain enemies, and could find in the end that the only people they truly can trust are each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a complete scenario that can be woven seamlessly into your Mage: The Awakening chronicle or run as a stand-alone adventure spanning one or two gaming sessions. Contained within these pages are all the tips and advice you&amp;rsquo;ll need to run an exciting and enjoyable story. If you want to change the story line or improvise along the way, there are plenty of places within this adventure to tweak the story to your tastes. This document provides the general layout- including characters, locations, situations and various clues- for you and your players to explore. Only you, the Storyteller, should read this document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure works with the rules system in the World of Darkness Rulebook and Mage: The Awakening. A useful supplement for this story is Seers of the Throne, but it&amp;rsquo;s not required. All the critical details you need are contained within this document. This story works best as the first adventure for a newly formed cabal, but it can be scaled up to serve as a worthy challenge to a more experienced group of Awakened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
