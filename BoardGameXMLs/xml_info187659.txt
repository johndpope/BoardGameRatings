During each round, players take turns drawing and playing their top card. Cards are placed FACE UP on the table.&lt;br/&gt;When a player draws a PRIMARY or SECONDARY OBJECTIVE, the player continues to turn over cards until an ORDNANCE card (a numbered card) is drawn. The player with the highest card wins and captures all cards in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
