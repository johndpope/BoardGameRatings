			<description>Mass Effect Galaxy is a game for iOS, released on June 22, 2009. The story focuses on backstory of one of the companion characters from Mass Effect 2. BioWare  has stated that the game will contain two hours of gameplay and will have &amp;quot;top down shooter action&amp;quot;. BioWare has also stated that the game, like the novels, will not be &amp;quot;required reading&amp;quot; for Mass Effect 2, meaning that players will still be able to enjoy Mass Effect 2 having only played Mass Effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob is controlled by tilting the iPod Touch or iPhone and firing is done automatically. The game is played from a top-down perspective and the levels become more maze-like as the player progresses. Enemies can be locked-on to and additional moves can be performed by pressing buttons on the heads-up-display. It is possible to use Jacob's Biotic stasis ability to freeze enemies in place, or use an omni-tool to Sabotage enemy shields. Finally, Jacob can fire a missile that can take out multiple enemies within its blast radius. Conversations are depicted in comic book style panels and there are some opportunities for multiple-choice dialogue. Cutscenes are shown via animated comic book panels. If the player logs in to their EA Online account using the Extras menu then completes the game, an unspecified reward is unlocked in Mass Effect 2 (provided that said game is linked to the same account). According to project director Casey Hudson, the reward is obtained via speaking with Jacob Taylor in Mass Effect 2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mass Effect Galaxy,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
