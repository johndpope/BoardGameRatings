			<description>Using direction dice you will be trying to shoot five balls into numbered holes on the playfield. They will light corresponding numbers on the backglass. Try to get 3, 4, or 5 numbers in a row on the backglass cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numbers must be ADJOINING each other connected by a line. Only highest score per card registers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coin 1: 5 balls on card 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as many (or as few) coins as you wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coins 2 - 6: lites Cards 2 thru 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coins 7 and 8: lites Diagonals on Cards 1, 2, 3 and Cards 4, 5, 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coins 9 and 10: lites a Magic Number for Cards 1, 2, 3 and Cards &lt;br/&gt;4, 5, 6. Hitting the Magic Number will DOUBLE the odds on those cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coin 11: lites DOUBLE-DOUBLE payoff on one card. Hitting the Magic Number will DOUBLE-DOUBLE the odds on that card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coin 12: lites ALL PLAYFIELD SCORES. Now, if you make 3, 4, or 5 adjoining holes on any one row ON THE PLAYFIELD, you score as indicated on the 3rd card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coin 13: lites PLAYFIELD SCORES. Now 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 score as 5 in-line, and 23, 24, 25 score as 4 in-line. You score as indicated on the 6th card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coins 14 and above: increases the odds on each card in turn, or lites a feature like '4 corners score as 5 in-line' or a SUPER LINE. (SUPER LINE scores 2 in-line as 3, 3 in-line as 4, 4 in-line as 5). Or, a coin might lite a playfield button to lite the CORNERS or SUPER LINE feature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After playing the 13th coin, you may (if you wish) play another coin and lite the Golden Star Game. Each coin increases the Golden Star Game odds. A maximum of 20 coins may be played. When lit, after shooting your first ball, five gold numbers will lite in a star pattern on one of the cards. Any 2, 3 or 4 in the Golden Star will score as indicated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After shooting the fifth ball, you may try to improve your game with 1 to 3 EXTRA BALLS. The maximum payoff on the next ball is shown, as well as the cost of an EXTRA BALL. (The higher the potential win, the greater the cost).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
