			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mythic setting, designed for the Savage Worlds rules system, takes inspiration from real world history, ancient mythology, and modern movies and tv shows to create a unique view of Earth&amp;rsquo;s ancient history, it&amp;rsquo;s cultures, and it&amp;rsquo;s mythologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike most other settings that deal with the ancient world, Mythic doesn&amp;rsquo;t just focus on one culture and it&amp;rsquo;s mythology. Instead, several cultures and mythologies have all been brought together to exist side by side in the same setting. The core setting book includes three cultures and mythologies which form the Known World. Pridith is based on Celtic culture and mythology, Illosia is based on Greek, and Niserri is based on Egyptian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core setting book is broken into five sections. The first section provides additional information for character creation, including Edges, Hindrances, gear, Powers, and setting rules. The next three sections deal with each of the three cultures that make up the Known World, including background information and information on the gods and goddesses that form the pantheons of each culture. The final section is a bestiary with stats and descriptions of over 90 creatures, animals, and npcs pulled from all three core cultures and mythologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the revised version of the Mythic setting book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to some cleaning up of the text and adding in a couple new pieces of art, some of the changes made to the new version of Mythic include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two new locations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Syrna; an Illosian city that has prospered thanks to it&amp;rsquo;s mighty army&lt;br/&gt;    Loch Bannagh; a lake on the island of Pridith that is home to a large number of evil Sidhe, and one of the biggest and meanest lock monsters ever to have existed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three new monsters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Daughters of Arachne; horrible spider/human hybrids descended from a princess who was cursed by the goddess Athena.&lt;br/&gt;    Dullahan; evil Sidhe horsemen who carry their own severed heads and a whip made of human spines.&lt;br/&gt;    Winged Serpents; giant vipers with feathery wings that are so violent they&amp;rsquo;ll even turn on each other and fight to the death&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duties of the Priesthood&lt;br/&gt;Before, each deity had a list of duties that gave examples of certain jobs and modes of behaviour possessed by worshippers. That never really seemed to fit right, so Duties has been replaced with Duties of the Priesthood. Simple worshippers typically don&amp;rsquo;t have to adhere to the same rules, codes of behaviour, and expected jobs, that true priests and priestesses do. In the revised boo, priests and priestesses must follow the Duties of the Priesthood associated with their particular deity. Others who simply worship the deity are expected to do their best at following the Duties of the Priesthood, but aren&amp;rsquo;t required to in order to keep their position as priest or priestess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
