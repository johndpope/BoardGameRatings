							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Serenity Crew</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The War between the Alliance and the Independents is a sore subject for a lot of folks, some more than others. Take Captain Malcolm Reynolds for example. Now here's a guy who fought in the Battle of Serenity Valley and laid down arms in front of his enemy. That kind of experience changes a man&amp;mdash;and it'll change you, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Serenity Crew allows you to spend your days playing Mal, Zoe, Wash, Kaylee, Inara, Jayne, Simon, Book, or River. If you're the type that wants to try something new, take a gander at the twelve archetypes we're offering you, too. If the math's right, that's twenty-one different options for you to play a character in the 'Verse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Serenity Crew is part of the Echoes of War role-playing adventure series, which is centered on a common theme: the Unification War. All characters and archetypes in this release employ the Cortex Plus system. The Serenity Crew is compatible with the Echoes of War adventures and all other releases in the Firefly Role-Playing Game line, which are all sold separately. The Firefly Role-Playing Game is based on the hit television series by Fox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This release was first featured in Gaming in the 'Verse: Gen Con 2013 Exclusive. This title is the stand-alone version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
