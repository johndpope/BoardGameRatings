			<description>A card game designed to teach children about the environment. It consists of 81 Life cards in 9 suits (Health, Peace, Heritage, Wildlife, Plantlife, Produce, Air, Water &amp;amp; Earth); 13 Pollutant cards; 13 Clean-up cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to collect sets of identical Life cards (in a similar fashion to Rummy), which will earn points for the player at the end of the game. However these sets can be 'polluted' by other players using  Pollution cards.  If you are lucky you'll be able to clear up the polluted set using a Clean-up card, which also doubles the score of that set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player plays their last card, and the winner is the one with the highest score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
