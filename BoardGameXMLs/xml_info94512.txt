			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rockman EXE 4.5: Real Operation is a semi-sequel to Mega Man Battle Network 4. The game transforms a player&amp;rsquo;s Game Boy Advance into a PET to control a Net Navi. When the game is first started, a player enters some personal information and chooses which Net Navi to team up with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Net Navi has unique abilities and battling styles. Unlike other Battle Network games, players do not directly control their Navis. Instead, they give general commands such as which enemy to attack, and the Navi will react based on their personality and capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A peripheral called the Battle Chip Gate was developed specifically for the title. The add-on allows players to upload Battle Chips to their Navis during battles by inserting real toy chips. Players can take on other EXE 4.5 players or people with Mega Man Battle Network 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
