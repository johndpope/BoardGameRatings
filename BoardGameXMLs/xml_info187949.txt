							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Martial Artist</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between the brute force of the fighter and the spiritual devotions of the monk stands the martial artist. The martial artist is an individual committed to the development of exotic and highly effective combat techniques associated with a specific group of weapons. A martial artist could be a master wrestler, a bare knuckles boxer, a fencer, an adept knife-pit fighter, or spear-master. Unlike the fighter, he does not rely on heavy armor and powerful weapons to accomplish his ends, but rather his own technique. Unlike the monk, he pursues not spiritual power and enlightenment is most likely not a goal of his martial devotions; instead, he seeks mastery of his weapons and himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presents The Martial Artist Class (well defined) for use in The Sleeping Imperium campaign setting.  However, the product is generic enough to be utilized in any D20 setting.  Special maneuvers are allowed, in essence a combination of spell and feat type abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
