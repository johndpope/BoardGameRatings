			<description>The final micro-expansion to the award-winning real-time strategy game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plagued by the continuous war, the factions have become weak and begin to seek refuge in the amiable sub-factions of their enemies in an attempt to find some solace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vasari fear the worst, as they know all too well that the end is near for their race if something radical isn't done within these fleeting moments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Members of the TEC notice a change in their constituents as many have shown menacing qualities of greed and self fulfillment. A search begins for an answer outside of their own kind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the while, many of the Advent are growing sympathetic to both the populations of the Vasari and TEC. They are becoming disillusioned by the path they chose, but now suspect it was either manipulated or drastically misguided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
