			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A corporate CEO hires the heroes to stop terrorist activity against his facility and to rescue his kidnapped son from them. Investigating, the PCs discover that the situation isn&amp;rsquo;t as presented. As they dig deeper into the true relationship between the &amp;ldquo;terrorist&amp;rdquo; leader, the industrialist&amp;rsquo;s son, and the animosity between activists and company, they become aware of a new and unique threat, as the damage the factory is accused of causing to the environment (the activists&amp;rsquo; casus belli) begins to take its toll in a strange and dangerous way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sword of Zeme is a one-page, no-frills adventure for tabletop RPG science fiction games using a 2D6 mechanic (including The Original 2D6 Science Fiction Game) starring characters of varied career backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
