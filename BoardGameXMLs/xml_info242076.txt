			<description>The Apocalypse. G&amp;ouml;tterd&amp;auml;mmerung. Ragnar&amp;ouml;k. It goes by many names, but in the end there are only ashes. The heavens have fallen and in their wake a void beckons to be filled. Mythic Arcana is an epic card and dice game about the creation of a new pantheon from the remains of shattered ones. Choose your gods wisely and use them to battle the opposition. Only one pantheon can reign supreme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Mythic Arcana 2-4 players will take turns summoning gods through the roll of dice. Recruit gods to do your bidding: alter dice results, destroy enemy gods, and unite the ultimate pantheon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, all players roll their dice. Starting with the lowest values, a player will choose to summon a god from the available gods on offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to obtain a god in each domain: Heavens, Life, Wisdom, War, and Death, will be victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
