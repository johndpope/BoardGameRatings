			<description>Triumphant Return: The Soviet Liberation of Kiev, November 1943, is an operational level simulation of the battle for Kiev that took place during November and December 1943.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful offensive of early autumn 1943 found the Soviets with several bridgeheads over the Dnepr River. The largest of these, located north of Kiev, erupted on 3 November as infantry and tank units of the 1st Ukrainian Front burst through the German line. Soon Soviet tank columns were racing to the distant towns of Fastov and Zhitomir, mauling several German panzers divisions hastily brought up to stem the Red tide. On 12 November, however, the Germans managed to assemble a powerful striking force centered around the 1st and 1st SS Panzer Divisions, threw them at the overextended formations of the Red Army, and rolled them back. Over the next four weeks the action see-sawed back and forth as reserves were committed and attack followed counterattack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One side represents the German forces of the 4th Panzer Army while the other side controls the Red Army forces of 1st Ukrainian Front. It uses the highly popular game system used in Ring of Fire and East Wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 4 to 8 days&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 4.3 miles / 7.0 kilometers&lt;br/&gt;Units: Battalion to Corps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;One 17 x 22&amp;quot; full color mapsheet&lt;br/&gt;One dual-side printed countersheet (240 1/2&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 24-page Triumphant Return rulebook&lt;br/&gt;Four dual-side printed Player Aid Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: High&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Low&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 1-5 Hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
