			<description>Highwaymen is a 2-4 player tabletop game in which the Players take on the roles of a group of Highwaymen attempting to rob a coach travelling through a dangerous forest trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must work together to steal the gold from the coach but must be wary that at any moments their comrades could turn against them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in 2 phases, firstly, the players take it in turn to take their actions, afterwards the Coach and Escorts will take their turn. A Player's turn can be taken in one of two ways, Players can either fire their pistols, or attempt to steal gold from another Player. If the player chooses to shoot, they shoot their pistols twice at the Escorts or the Coach, move up to 3D6 spaces, then shoot twice more. If the Player tries to steal, they roll 3D6 movement, and can attempt to steal from the first Player they come into contact with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If an Escort takes damage it is removed from the board and if the Coach takes damage then it will drop coins. The Players can move over the Coins to add them to their collection, the winner of the game is the Player with the most coins at the end of the Game. The game ends when either the Coach leaves the woods (after 8 turns) or the Players destroy the Coach (when it has taken 20 hits).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
