			<description>Up A Gum Tree - A game for monkeys!&lt;br/&gt;Throw the dice and move your monkey up the tree. Make use of the creepers, but watch out for the snakes! First to get their monkeys to the top wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is essentially a 3D 'Snakes and Ladders' with a number of subtle changes; each player has two monkeys, both of which must reach the top of the tree to win, each player's section of the tree has two creepers (which are the 'ladders'), but most importantly the pair of snakes on your section of the tree can be moved! Each player races his own pair of monkeys up the tree whilst attempting to avoid the two patrolling snakes, should a monkey and a snake end up on the same space, the monkey falls and has to start the climb over again. On your turn you can roll the dice and either move one of your own monkeys, or any snake (either to clear a route for your own monkeys or attempt to knock an opponents monkey back to the start).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
