			<description>&amp;quot;Jazz Jackrabbit is a platform game created by Cliff Bleszinski and Arjan Brussee, and produced by Epic MegaGames. It was released in 1994 for PCs operating DOS, with subsequent Macintosh and Microsoft Windows releases in 1995&amp;mdash;96.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;he game is set in a fantasy world based on Aesop's &amp;quot;The Tortoise and the Hare&amp;quot;, in which the enmity between tortoises and hares continues even after three thousand years. An evil mastermind tortoise named Devan Shell begins conquering planets, suppressing any native confrontation. One of such planets, Carrotus, is home to a peaceful hare kingdom that, once confronted by Shell, is able to provide enough resistance to fend him off. Enraged by his loss, Shell decides to kidnap Carrotus princess Eva Earlong and hide her on a distant airbase of unknown location to weaken the hares. In retrospect, the king chooses to send Carrotus' hero Jazz Jackrabbit to various planets conquered by Devan that might contain clues to the location of Eva's imprisonment. As Jazz travel through different worlds, he gains new weapons and meets new enemies in his pursuit to rescue the princess and save Carrotus from Devan Shell and his army of Turtle Terrorists.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Jazz_Jackrabbit_(game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
