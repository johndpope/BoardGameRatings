							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legacies (Version 2014)</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legacies is a fantasy role-playing game, focused upon replicating high fantasy and unusual, sometimes strange cultures and creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legacies is a completely overhauled version of the game formerly titled Grey Lotus.  The primary design goal was to simplify and streamline the core mechanic to eliminate complexity that was deemed unnecessary through extensive playtesting.  Major changes include swapping d10 for d6, limiting the dice pool, and providing for a smoother probability chart of Skill resolution rolls.  Also, Attributes and Skills have been simplified.  The setting is changed from monotheistic to polytheistic, has a better climate system, and is politically simplified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note:  Several sections of the 2014 rules are incomplete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
