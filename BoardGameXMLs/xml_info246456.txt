			<description>Micro-Football is a sports themed game that is fast-paced, easy to learn, and can be played anywhere requiring very little table space. Challenge yourself or someone else to see who can score the most points, or see who can score first. Sports fans, families and casual gamers alike will enjoy the back-and-forth card play while trying to anticipate your opponent's next move! Features three game modes: Full Game, Solo, and Overtime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Micro-Football, players take turns each quarter on offense and defense. The offense has the goal of reaching the Goal Line of the defense for a Touchdown, or get close enough for a Field Goal, while the defense has the goal of stopping them. Each player has seven cards to choose from (only four will be played), and as they are played simultaneously with your opponent, the results of the combined yardage moves the marker along the football field. If one player can consecutively guess their opponents' next card 3-times, they will trigger a Big Play like an automatic touchdown or a turnover. The player with the most points after four quarters wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components&lt;br/&gt;  - 18 cards (7 offense, 7 defense, 4 football field)&lt;br/&gt;  - 4 cubes (2 blue, 2 red) &lt;br/&gt;  - 1 coin&lt;br/&gt;  - 1 gem (football marker)&lt;br/&gt;  - rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
