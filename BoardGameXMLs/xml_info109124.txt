			<description>UltraStar is a clone of SingStar, a music video game. UltraStar lets one or several players score points by singing along to a song or music video and match the pitch of the original song well. UltraStar displays lyrics as well as the correct notes similar to a piano roll. On top of the correct notes UltraStar displays the pitch recorded from the players. UltraStar allows several people to play simultaneously by connecting several microphones possibly to several sound cards. To add a song to UltraStar, a file with notes and lyrics is required, together with an audio file. Optionally a cover image, a backdrop image and a video may be added to each song.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developed by Patryk &amp;quot;Corvus5&amp;quot; Cebula&lt;br/&gt;Current build 0.8.4&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;UltraStar&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
