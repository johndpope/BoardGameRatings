							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kings Court</name>
									
			<description>Kings Court is a Western Chess variant played on a large 8X12 board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game incorporates the standard array of King, Queen, 2 knights, 2 bishops and 2 rook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kings Court then adds two Chancellor and two jester pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game company's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE CHANCELLOR-Has two possible moves (1) it can move one or two square in any direction. (2) it can move one square on the rank or file and then while still moving away from the square from which it started, moves one square on the diagonals. This is not a line move but a move from point to point and can not be obstructed by any other piece. See figure 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE JESTER- Moves one or two squares on the diagonals. Unlike the Bishop the Jester can change directions while in motion, if desired. It may not return to the square from which it stared in the same move. See figure 2. For the first move from its initial square the jester may jump two square diagonally. All pieces with the exception of the Pawn, capture in the way it can legally move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The King is also afforded an additional special move;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KING'S FLIGHT- is a move made by the King when in check by the Chancellor. The move is executed by moving the King two squares in any direction instead of its usual one square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
