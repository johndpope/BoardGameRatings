							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">RB8 Retro Baseball 8-bit</name>
									
			<description>RB8 is a baseball simulation experience brought to you in the retro look of a classic 8-bit video game. Put together your team based on a point value player system with custom cards. Will you build your team with big sluggers, dominant pitching, amazing defenders, speed, or a well balanced machine? The choice is yours as you get to manage and make the strategic choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of RB8 is to build your team within an agreed point system (for example 900 points.) You must have one player for every position, a starting Pitcher, and any position player can play as a Designated Hitter (DH). Pitchers will not bat in the RB8 League. Once your team is set you will then determine the batting order 1-9 and set your player cards on the corresponding space on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn both Pitcher and Batter will compare their ratings and roll off to see who might get control of the at bat. This is called the &amp;ldquo;On Deck Phase&amp;rdquo;. Who ever rolls higher factoring in all special abilities will try to maintain control by rolling their custom Pitcher or Batter die. If they maintain control they will then roll dice and compare the result with their respective key to find out the results of the at bat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will also have &amp;quot;Rally Cards&amp;quot; they can play at anytime that can greatly effect the outcome of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will play 9 innings unless tied after bottom of the 9th  then you will play an extra inning thereafter until one team has scored higher after a full inning completes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RB8 features many realistic baseball game decisions. As you manage your team you have to make those calls. Should you run and steal a base, tag up on a deep flyout, should you sacrifice an out to bunt the runner over. These and many more are the hard decisions you will have to make to lead your team to victory.&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
