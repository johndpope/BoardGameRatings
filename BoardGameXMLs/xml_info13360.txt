							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">5 Pad &amp; Pencil Games People Love to Play</name>
									
			<description>This is a collection of 5 games played on custom pads of paper, much like Gamut of Games' 6-Pack of Paper &amp; Pencil Games.  The games in this set are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wordplay - 2 players take turns writing words in small crossword grids. 4 grids make a game.  Each letter can only be used once by anyone in each grid, and each player has a reserve of common letters which can be used over all 4 grids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vegas 13 - Much like Yahtzee with 3 dice.  1-4 players try to roll scoring combinations, with the twist that each combination only scores 3 times and generally increases in value as it is scored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ChineseChek - Nothing to do with Chinese Checkers, this is Dots and Boxes on a triangular grid (in the form of a 6-pointed star) for 2-4 players.  There are special spaces which are worth more points than the rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NineTacToe - 2 players play Tic-Tac-Toe on 9 grids simultaneously.  The spaces are numbered 1-27, each number being used 3 times, and on a turn a player chooses a number and plays in the corresponding 3 spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dam-It! - Basically Go-Moku (get 5 in a row) for 2-3 players, except that a player can also win by making 4 in a row 5 times, or 3 in a row 8 times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
