			<description>The board has a square grid on the four sides, numbers 2 to 12. In the middle, 10 wooden trees are randomly placed and, at random, one pawn per player. Then each player rolls two dice, sums them up and places on one of the four boxed number one of the 10 wooden game animals. At this point you have to move the animal with the result of either of the two dice. With the other die you can do one of the following: cancel it and do nothing; move his pawn orthogonally, in the desired direction; move another animal already on the board, in the direction of the head. At the end of these movements, if the pawn of the turn player is orthogonally within 4 boxes from an animal (or even more than one) without the line of sight being obstructed, he can &amp;quot;snap a photo&amp;quot; by picking the corresponding card from the deck . The first one who manages to collect ten photos of the ten different animals won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
