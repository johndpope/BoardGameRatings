			<description>Big League Baseball bills itself as &amp;quot;The World Series of Baseball Games.&amp;quot; It uses a curious dice-rolling mechanism that allows players to try to place their fly balls, ground balls, and bunts on a spot of the field least covered by opposing fielders. Strategy comes into play on offense in strategically allocating dice for a fly ball; on defense with positioning fielders to optimally cover the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No production date is given, but one of the Sid Sackson collection copies of this game was marked as being acquired in 1983.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
