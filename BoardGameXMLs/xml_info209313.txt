							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Saturday Morning Species Volume 1: Mushroom Dwarves</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isn't this the cleanest and most well-tended forest you've ever seen? It's almost like someone comes in and picks up and arranges things nicely and keeps the place looking good. Even the animals look cleaner and healthier than most. This forest is strange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike a lot of wooded areas, this forest has caretakers. Little people that make things nicer. Little people about three apples high, wearing funny hats, and sing and dance when all the chores are done. They also live in large mushrooms that have been repurposed into houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The are the mushroom dwarves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing inspiration from Saturday morning cartoons, Saturday Morning Species reimagines fantasy races for the Fifth Edition of the world's most popular role-playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
