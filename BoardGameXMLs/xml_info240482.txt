			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; VAPORWARE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is stuck in the development limbo known as Vaporware. Few to no details have been released about its gameplay, plot, or release date since its announcement many years ago. It may or may not be in active development, but neither has it been cancelled officially.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development team, self-described as &amp;quot;featuring AAA talent&amp;quot;, includes staff such as former Final Fantasy series composer Nobuo Uematsu. Violinist Hiroaki Yura serves as the game's director and producer. The project was hoping to gather $100,000 through Kickstarter by September 2013, eventually succeeding in raising over ten times this amount. The game still hasn't seen the light of day. It was supposed to be out in 2015, but very late in that year it was pushed back to late in 2018&amp;mdash;a huge delay by any measure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiny Metal, under the direction of Area 35, went to Kickstarter in 2016 but that campaign failed to catch fire, and was ultimately cancelled&amp;mdash;but the developers said in an update that even without the Kickstarter, &amp;quot;we already have secured the budget required to deliver the basic vision of the game.&amp;quot; That funding, according to claims made by Tariq Lacy, a developer who worked as a marketing and PR manager on the game, actually came from the Project Phoenix Kickstarter. In a message on Twitter and Facebook that has since been deleted but can still be seen on Kotaku, Lacy said he learned shortly after being hired that Tiny Metal was funded &amp;quot;by running a scam through Kickstarter.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Phoenix_%28video_game%29 Project Phoenix (video game)]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
