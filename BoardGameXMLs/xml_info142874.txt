			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As technology has become closely intertwined in our lives, we have begun to lose a sense of connection to others and maybe even to ourselves. As a result, we have had to work harder to hold on to our voices amidst the chaos. The Voice in the Garden is a narrative-based game for the iPad using the player&amp;rsquo;s voice as the main input. Players use their voice to help unfold and explore the spatial narrative of the game. The Voice in the Garden aims to provide an experience for players to recognize and regain the power of their voice in an effort to reduce their sense of isolation.&lt;br/&gt;Voice, in its nature, is potentially curative. This concept refers to a therapeutic method called Melodic Intonation Therapy, which is a process developed to help people with communication difficulties. This type of therapy introduces musical components, such as rhythm and melody, to help with the production of speech. In The Voice in the Garden, players are encouraged to participate with their voice used as individual musical components.&lt;br/&gt;The idea of using voice input in The Voice in the Garden aspires to do more than try to replicate the purpose of voice in the real world. The game experiments with looking for a distinctive purpose of voice in digital media. When players use their voice as a vehicle to empower a narrative, it becomes a process of self-construction through which players are able to bridge a deeper connection within themselves as well as with their greater surroundings.&lt;br/&gt;The game encourages players to reflect on themselves. The garden is a metaphor for a person&amp;rsquo;s inner world. The dynamic narrative is about a person exploring a garden and trying to find the way to open the door. Using the first-person perspective, the players take an active role as they use their influence to nourish the garden and heal their inner world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
