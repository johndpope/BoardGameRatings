							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Harwenna&#039;s Tower</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Elven Witch Harwenna had this tower built in the 12th Age, when the ice sheets still covered the north and the sea levels were lower. And now, despite millenia having passed, the tower still stands, a testament to Elven construction. The name lives on in the small communities of Elves that live in the region still, and whilst the tower is now empty, overgrown and crumbling, some say it still retains some of the magic of the original owner.&lt;br/&gt; A set of printable battlemaps compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A set of multi-level battlemaps, depicting a ruined Elven tower in a forest setting. The 20x20 ground floor shows the crumbling ruins in the woods, and each of the 5 subsequent levels has a cracked floor of ornately decorated Elven marble, overgrown with plants and vines. Aside from the ground and 5th floors, the rest can be arranged in any order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are 300dpi full size jpgs, for poster printing or VTT. (n.b. gridless version only available as jpeg)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are Roll20 VTT ready files, sized at 72dpi and 140x140px per square (all less than 10mb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
