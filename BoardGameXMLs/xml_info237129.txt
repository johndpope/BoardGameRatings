			<description>A board game based on the 1987 Science Fiction movie. One player is the Runners. The other is the Stalkers.&lt;br/&gt; The board is an 8x8 grid known as the Game Zone.  There are 4 main locations located in the corners: Runner Entry, Stalker Entry, Satellite Uplink and Rebel Hideout. The centre 4 squares are known as the Intersection. In order to go from any corner location to any other corner location, you must first enter an intersection space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 Runners: Ben Richards, William Laughlin, Harold Weiss and Amber Mendez. There are 5 Stalkers: Subzero, Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball and Captain Freedom. Characters have 2, 3, 4 or 5 hits. When a character takes damage a damage counter is placed on it. If a character has more damage counters than hits, it is killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Runners and Stalkers start the game at differing stages:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      At the start of the game the Richards, Laughlin, and Weiss counters are placed on the Runner entry square. Subzero starts on the Stalker entry point. Mendez enters the game on turn 4. &lt;br/&gt;     If Subzero is killed, both Dynamo and Buzzsaw immediately enter the game zone otherwise Dynamo and Buzzsaw enter on turn 6.&lt;br/&gt;     If both Dynamo and Buzzsaw are killed, Fireball immediately enters, otherwise Fireball enters on turn 10. &lt;br/&gt;     If Fireball is killed, Captain Freedom immediately enters play, otherwise Captain Freedom enters on turn 14. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a unique deck of cards comprising, Move, Attack, Defence and Special cards.  Players take turns to draw three cards, place them in their hand and then play cards to move their own units and attack opposing units. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Move cards are used (discarded) to manoeuvre a player&amp;rsquo;s units around the board.  A unit may make a max of 2 moves in a turn and must move the entire distance described by the move card or not at all.  &lt;br/&gt;     Attack cards are used to make attacks against opposing units in the same space. A unit may make up to 2 attacks in a turn. &lt;br/&gt;     Defence cards are played to negate an attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all Stalkers are killed or all Runners are either killed or escaped. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Stalkers win if all of the Runners are killed. &lt;br/&gt;     The Runners get a minor victory if 1 or more of them make it to the Rebel Hideout. &lt;br/&gt;     The runners get a major victory if 1 or more of them makes it first to the Satellite Uplink and then the Hideout. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
