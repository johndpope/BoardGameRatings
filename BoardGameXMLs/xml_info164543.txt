							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Konog</name>
									
			<description>An elegant game based off the traditional gambling game of the fierce and reclusive konog species, a secretive and xenophobic race from a remote corner of the galaxy. This game, enjoyed for years by the expeditionaries and pioneers in the Industrial Sectors, has only recently been introduced to the Core Systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to make a number of &amp;quot;Konogs&amp;quot;; which is either three cards of the same number of any suit, or a run (1, 2, 3) of three cards of the same suit. After playing a Konog, the fourth card left in your hand is placed in front of you, this is the value of that Konog. At the end of the game (after one player has performed a sixth Konog and all other players have taken one last turn) these values are added together (plus any triumvirates) to find the player's total ending score. The player with the highest score is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: you will need a large plate (or a rotating tray, like a Lazy Susan) to play Konog. As a player discards, many cards will make the discard piles (one for each player) rotate in different directions. Also included in the game are wooden &amp;quot;sentries&amp;quot;, you can place these on a discard pile to protect a card from being taken or covered up by another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Konog has many features that set it apart from other games. Inside each game box you can expect to find: simple, yet elegant artwork featured on circular cards, a completely alien numerical system based on three (don't worry, standard numbers are featured at the bottom of each card for those that are unfamiliar with the Konog numeral system), colorful wooden pieces (a sentry and matching post for each player), and a drawstring bag to hold everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
