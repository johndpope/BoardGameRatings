							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Spookies!</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spookies are a capering, mad horde of ghouls that build hidden and often surreal settlements in mockery of living humanity. Widely diverse in both appearance and outlook, Spookies are united by their disturbing, often nightmarish appearance, their morbid humors and their shared obsession with living culture. Spookies can coexist with mortals (provided those mortals have a strong stomach and an easy acceptance of the bizarre) in a way that few undead can, and Spookie settlements are often found in the shadow of a human metropolis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spookies are a race of undead bipeds, but those two basic terms are where the race&amp;rsquo;s similarities end. Spookies come in all shapes and sizes, each warped by the dark joke of fate in their own way. Spookies might be pale corpse-babies with enormous, hydrocephalic skulls, rail-thin capering skeletons or even swollen mounds of dead flesh stitched together imperfectly over metal bones. Some Spookie might be mistaken for a brain-dead and brain-eating zombie, if you didn&amp;rsquo;t notice the gleam of intelligence in their milked-over eyes and their keen conversational abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Otherverse Games offers several Undead races to players of its unique campaign setting. Spookies are a race of quirky Undead suitable for any Pathfinder Roleplaying Game campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
