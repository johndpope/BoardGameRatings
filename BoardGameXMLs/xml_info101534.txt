			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Third Contact of the role-playing game Eoris Essence. In order to enter this universe, you should be willing to incarnate an inhabitant of this world. By doing so, you will assume his personality, determine his reactions, and declare his actions in accordance with a series of events that are described by a single individual called the Narrator. Everything that happens in the universe of Eoris lies in your imagination. To aid you in this task, we created a set of game rules called the Essence System. The Third Contact is an Adventure called the 'Connection Between the Two', and it will provide a small insight into the universe of Eoris hopefully giving you a better notion of Eoris and what this new world can do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
