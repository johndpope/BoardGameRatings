							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fu: The Game of @#%* Up Politics</name>
									
			<description>A satirical political game of cunning and intrigue.  Players take turns playing cards and casting votes attempting to be the first to reach the stated goal conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players draw a card, and then play a card.  Certain cards require a vote.  Each player starts with one vote, but may acquire more through some cards.  If a vote passes, the card is played.  If it fails, the card is discarded.  Either way, the player's turn is considered to be over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The victory conditions fluctuate, ala Fluxx, with goal cards being played by the players on their turn.  The first player to match the current goal condition wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mostly a joke game, this game satirizes politics with cards such as &amp;quot;Everybody Wins - Current game ends with everyone winning&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Communism - All players play with their hands face up on the table. Anyone may play cards from anyone elses hand.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
