			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MonkeyDome is a schizophrenic game of shifting tones and harsh lessons in the cruel world of the future. Civilization has met its end&amp;mdash;in fire, with a sigh, by robot uprising, by plague engineered by man or god or presence from the stars, what have you. The remains of humankind is left fighting over the scraps with whatever tools are at hand&amp;mdash;even if that tool is a wiffleball bat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Together you and your friends will be making Survivors who are pitted against the cr&amp;egrave;me-de-la-cr&amp;egrave;me of post-apocalyptic horrors, cannibals, and marauding hordes for their space in this ravaged world. Survivors who&amp;rsquo;ve learned harsh lessons and seen the worst life has to offer. Survivors who do whatever it takes to stay alive. Survivors occasionally played by Brendan Fraser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the world of MonkeyDome life is ruled by Grim Violence or Zany Action, and either may strike at any moment. Sometimes you just got to swing that shovel to see if you can end a man with a sickening crunch, or knock him out with Dong!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
