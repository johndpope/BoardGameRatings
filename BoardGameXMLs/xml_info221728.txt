			<description>Back of the box&lt;br/&gt;Now one of the most exciting T.V. show challenges is up and running on your computer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Krypton Factor is different - it calls for all the contestants' wit and skill in tests on mental agility, memory recall, logical thinking, generalknowledge and intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each stage in the &amp;quot;ultmate test&amp;quot; has been faithfully reproduced ini this entertaining multi-player game. Play by yourself or your family and friends to compete for the highest accolade - do you hold the key to &amp;quot;The Krypton Factor&amp;quot;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Krypton Factor is a British game show produced by Granada for broadcast on ITV. The show originally ran from 7 September 1977 to 20 November 1995, and was hosted by Gordon Burns and usually broadcast on the ITV network on Mondays at 7pm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contestants from across the United Kingdom and Ireland competed in a series of rounds that tested their physical stamina and mental attributes. The title of the show is a reference to Superman's home planet Krypton, the title perceiving that the contestants had strong superhuman &amp;quot;powers&amp;quot; for taking part in the challenges they were set. The contestants, from 1986 onwards, all had their own corresponding colour, either red, green, yellow or blue. They wore their own clothes, apart from the Physical Ability round where the contestants wore track suits which were, in early series, red, burgundy, orange, green, black, light blue and dark blue. From 1986 onwards, the tracksuits were red, green, yellow and blue, and varied in design over the series that followed. The track suits changed to black with a coloured stripe from 1990 to 1993. For their own clothes, the contestants either wore a shirt/blouse, tie or a neckscarf of their corresponding colour. The points contestants earned through the game were not referred to as their score, but as their &amp;quot;Krypton Factor&amp;quot;, e.g. &amp;quot;The winner, with a Krypton Factor of 46, is the legal secretary from Kent, Mike Berry&amp;quot;. The 1987 series won the prestigious Premio Ondas - Spanish Television Award for Entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Krypton_Factor The Krypton Factor]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A computer game version of The Krypton Factor was published by TV Games and released in 1987 for the home computers of the era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Krypton_Factor%23Merchandise_and_commercial_representations The Krypton Factor]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
