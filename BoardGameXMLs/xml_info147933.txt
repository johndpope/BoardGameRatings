			<description>Bastion can be played by 2, 3 or 4 players. If there are 2 players, each one will have two fighters' camps, in the corners of the board, diagonally. If there are 3 or 4 players, each one will have one camp. When there are 4 players, they can play individually or in pairs, on the diagonal of the board. The two members of each team can communicate, choosing the strategy that suits them best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;​What does the game board represent?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the center of the board lies the Bastion, a fortress with four towers, of different colors. Around the Bastion, one square away, is a moat, filled with water, crossed by four bridges. In the corners of the board are situated the fighters' camps, the fighters being represented by four tokens, having different range attacks, as their respective numbers show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;​What is the purpose of the game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the game is the player who brings all his fighters, in the order 2, 3, 4 and 5, in the tower of his color. In the case of the team game, it is enough for one of the players to win, so that the team can be victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
