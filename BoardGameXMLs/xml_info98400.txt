			<description>Piclings is a platform game in which players are able to take photos and play them as levels. The main character in Piclings is indeed an odd looking one. Resembling a cross between a fruit and a toad, Picazzo is surprisingly nimble when it comes to navigating levels. But however agile, this little critter is still vulnerable to the pointy spines of the bad guys also inhabiting the world of photos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Single player platform game for all ages that allows players to turn their photos into unique levels filled with enemies and rewards.&lt;br/&gt;     Create and share your original levels with other players using the easy, built-in iPhone mail client.&lt;br/&gt;     Unlock achievements and secure your place on a global high scores list with Apple Game Center integration&lt;br/&gt;     Fight Huffies and Puffies and grab special items in an infinite number of possible levels that reach as far as the players' imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
