							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ULTIMATE Sports Trivia: Super Pro Edition</name>
									
			<description>Just like in Trivial Pursuit, you roll the die, answer questions and hopefully be the first to collect six scoring chips from the various categories.  They are Baseball, Hockey, General Sports, Football, Basketball and Olympic Sports.  The game is made more accessible by providing multiple choice answers to many of their questions, so even if a player doesn't know, they have a shot at it.   Who will be the ULTIMATE Sports Trivia champion in your gaming group?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
