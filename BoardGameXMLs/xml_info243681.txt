							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Verminator</name>
									
			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play Jake the Verminator, beginning with a bank loan and a big mallet.  You adventure throughout a magical tree with about 250 areas (platformer rooms) in search of the raw materials from which to make more money - or, even better, manufactured equipment.  Shops sells various useful items, but they're expensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your main function is using a weapon to eliminate vermin pests - they hurt your character but eliminating them doesn't earn much reward.  Other ghost-like &amp;quot;mugger&amp;quot; bad guys make life even more miserable because they can deplete health and also steal money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you get really desperate, you can go gambling or even take out another loan.  Periodically, you end a &amp;quot;week&amp;quot; of play and gain some resources and health over the &amp;quot;weekend&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
