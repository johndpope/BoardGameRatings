							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rainbow Fish Look Out For the Shark!</name>
									
			<description>The Rainbow Fish Look Out For the Shark game is ideal for 3-5 players. The object of the game is to get rid of all of you card-and avoid ending up with the shark card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dealer shuffles the cards and deals them all, face down to all the players. Players shoudl be careful not to show the faces of their cards to the other players. Any player who holds a pair of card with the same symbols (green leaf, red starfish, yellow snail, etc) in the top left corners should immediately lay them face up on the table. Player to the left of the dealer goes first. He or she picks a card from the player to their left. If the card matches, the player lays them down face up on the table. If the card does not match, or gets the dreaded shark card, their turn ends and it is the next players turn. Play continues until all pairs have been matched up and one player is left holding the shark card. The player with the shark is the looser. This game features the art of Marcus Pfister's award winning book series The Rainbow Fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
