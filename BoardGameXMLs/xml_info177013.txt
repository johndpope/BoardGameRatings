			<description>Pride and Glory: The Peloponnesian War is a strategy game set during a war in Ancient Greece. Players take control of the cities of Athens and Sparta and train soldiers, construct buildings, capture cities, and engage in epic battles for the future of Greece. Players control their empire from a full campaign perspective on the game board, but once a battle begins, players can command their soldiers in tactical, unit-by-unit combat on separate battlefield maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game turns are divided into the four seasons of the year. Each season has four phases in which players: 1) Build up their empire by recruiting units, constructing buildings and conducting diplomacy. 2) Move their units around the Campaign Map and besiege cities. 3) Engage in battle and command their soldiers in tactical, simulation combat. 4) Protect themselves against revolts of the people and the stormy seas of the Aegean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every triumph brings your city more glory, and closer to victory, until all Greece kneels before you. Throughout the game players earn things called Glory Points for doing things like capturing cities, winning battles &amp;ndash; even just by proving that your enemy is too cowardly to come out and fight. Whichever player is the first to get to 75 Glory Points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
