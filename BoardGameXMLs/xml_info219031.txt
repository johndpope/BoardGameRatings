			<description>From cassette inlay&lt;br/&gt;Nightfall.  The deadly enchantment begins.&lt;br/&gt;Will you live to see the dawn?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight a desperate battle to save your soul from the&lt;br/&gt;vampyre's bloodlust.  Your enemy's power is subtle&lt;br/&gt;and mysterious, his strength never-ending.  There is&lt;br/&gt;only one way to bring Nosferatu's reign to an end.&lt;br/&gt;There are three parts to your struggle to overcome the&lt;br/&gt;Vampyre:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DRACULA'S CASTLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are Jonathan Harker, an innocent employee of&lt;br/&gt;the estate agent Renfield.  Count Dracula wishes to&lt;br/&gt;buy a house in your home town, Wismar.  You have&lt;br/&gt;been sent to his castle to complete the sale, only to&lt;br/&gt;discover the Count's true identity - he is a Vampyre!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you must act fast to protect yourself and the&lt;br/&gt;inhabitants of Wismar from his power.  If Nosferatu&lt;br/&gt;moves into the house he could soon take control of&lt;br/&gt;the whole town and turn the innocent inhabitants&lt;br/&gt;into vampyres!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You left the deeds to the house on the dining room&lt;br/&gt;table, but they have disappeared.  You must find them&lt;br/&gt;and escape as soon as you can.  Nosferatu is most&lt;br/&gt;dangerous at night when the castle doors are locked.&lt;br/&gt;You cannot escape until the light of day, when the&lt;br/&gt;Vampyre lies low.  Meanwhile you may have to&lt;br/&gt;contend with vampyre beasts, plagued rats, and&lt;br/&gt;hallucinations created by Nosferatu for your&lt;br/&gt;confusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can find weapons and objects to aid your survival,&lt;br/&gt;but fighting the evil beasts will sap your energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
