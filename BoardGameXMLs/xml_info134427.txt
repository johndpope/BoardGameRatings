			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Ace 21 is a SciFi game of tactical space combat. The players design their own space craft from 12 different module types. The program gives a graphic display of each craft and a complete status report. After the craft designs are checked for errors, the craft then engage in a battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Human or computer opponent.&lt;br/&gt;2) Fight in two or three dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;3) Action sounds and graphics.&lt;br/&gt;4) Three scenarios to choose from: Smuggler, Refuel Option, and Phoenix Decathlon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ship Design&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are only three rules that apply to space ship design:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a. You must have at least one each of the five essential modules: bridge, engine, fuel, generator, and life support.&lt;br/&gt;b. Legal engine mounts require that the module directly under the engine module be a zero space. Therefore it is convenient for you to place your engines on module positions 19, 20, &amp;amp; 21.&lt;br/&gt;c. If you don't like your design or have made an error, you must RUN the program again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Command Entries&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four command entries each 10 second turn: Status Report, Heading Maneuver, Speed Change, and Weapons. Since the game is stop action the right side player should secretly write down command entries intended before the left side player starts entering commands. This will prevent cheating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defeat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To defeat your opponent's space craft you must remove the combined % capability of any of the essential module types or have your opponent run out of fuel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
