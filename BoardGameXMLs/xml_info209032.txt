			<description>Cycling board game produced in the DDR in 1956 about the Prag-Berlin-Warschau cycling race which was known as the Peace race, also known as Der Friedensfahrt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The race begins in Bratislava and ends in Warsaw (as did the 1953 edition of the race). The race is divided in 12 stages. The game is played with 3 dice. The first rider to reach the even stages receives 5 points, and the second receives three points. For odd stages there are only 3 poinys awarded to the first rider to pass the city and one popint for the second.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blue points are mountain passes; the first rider to pass through that point receives three point (none for the second).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red lines are sprints; players who fall on these play again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red points with letters are race incidents (fall, punctures, injures). Players who fall on these get negative points or have to wait for some turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rider with more points when all have reached Warsaw is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
