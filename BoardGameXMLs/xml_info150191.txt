							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Table Pack 16: Flight 2000 and Goin&#039; Nuts</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pack adds recreations of two pinball tables to Pinball Arcade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flight 2000 was released in 1980 by Stern Pinball. It is themed around the launch of a futuristic Space Ship and was the first Stern table to feature speech. The main aim of the table is to activate the 3-ball multi-ball. In order to do this, the player must lock two balls in the top left, light all the letters in B-L-A-S-T-O-F-F by hitting various targets on the table, and finally hit five drop targets marked 5-4-3-2-1 in the correct sequence!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goin' Nuts was a prototype created in 1983 by Gottlieb, but never released. Only 10 physical tables were made. It is a highly unusual design featuring Squirrels collecting nuts for winter. There are no out-lanes, and the design is based on a timer as well as the number of balls draining. Each turn three balls (the squirrels) are launched for a 3-ball multiball. The aim when two or more 'squirrels' are in play is to collect nuts (drop targets) which both score points and increase the timer. When only one ball remains in play, the timer starts counting down and the player must reactivate the multiball before the timer runs out. If the timer reaches zero, the flippers lock and the final ball will drain, losing a life (of course if the last ball drains while there is time on the timer, the life is also lost). Extra lives can be gained by collecting all five sets of three drop targets three times each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
