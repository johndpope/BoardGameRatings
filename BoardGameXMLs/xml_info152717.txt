							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Historical Turning Points: Misery</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wolf's Dragoons, one of the Inner Sphere&amp;rsquo;s most enigmatic mercenary units in the early thirty-first century. The Draconis Combine Mustered Soldiery, one of the most honorable and ruthless military forces among the Great Houses. On the tiny planet of Misery, the culmination of political plotting, jealousy, and fanaticism played itself out to a bloody, exhaustive end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The extension of the stubborn wills of Jaime Wolf and Takashi Kurita, Misery became a bloody milestone in the history of the Dragoons and a shocking embarrassment to the Dragon&amp;rsquo;s throne. Forever after, Misery became synonymous to both forces as a symbol of pain, dishonor, and unshakable devotion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historical Turning Points: Misery returns to an earlier time in BattleTech history, when the mysterious Dragoons were manipulated into a life-or-death battle by the jealousy of a Kuritan warlord, and nearly paid the ultimate price just to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, inserting it into their own campaigns and even create their own scenarios. This PDF exclusive includes a detailed map of the world of Misery, a run-down of the forces involved in the conflict, and several tracks that players can use to run simple lance-on-lance battles, or stage the complete, desperate battle for survival. Only the players&amp;rsquo; imaginations are the limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
