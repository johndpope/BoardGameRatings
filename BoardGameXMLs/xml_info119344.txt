			<description>This is a 3-player game, using 3 colours (Black, White &amp;amp; Red), but with no colour representing any one player. It is played using a standard Shibumi set.&lt;br/&gt;In essence, it is a simple connect-3 game. The winner is the player that connects 3 of any colour in a visible straight line (&amp;ldquo;visible&amp;rdquo; meaning that, for instance, a 3-in-a-row going through the middle of the pyramid, with stones all round, blocking one or more stones from sight, is not a win).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board starts empty. Each player places 2 stones each turn, in this order:&lt;br/&gt;P.1: B, W&lt;br/&gt;P.2: R, B&lt;br/&gt;P.3: W, R&lt;br/&gt;Passing is not allowed, and the stones must be played in this specific order. There is no removal of stones in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is the full extent of the rules. A draw can indeed occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was created in response to the Shibumi Challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the Shibumi Rule Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soft cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-andres/shibumi-rule-book/paperback/product-18940123.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-a...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Downloadable PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
