			<description>The Panasonic Q multimedia console  is a hybrid version of the Nintendo GameCube with the ability to play DVDs, audio CDs, MP3 and CDs  as well as several other features. The system was officially released only in Japan. Since the GameCube lacked DVD playback functionality, a feature its competitors had, the system was licensed by Nintendo and was released in December 2001. The Q was first listed at $439 USD, but a modified version that allowed users to play DVDs from all regions was listed at $499 USD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nintendo's uncharacteristic decision to license the gaming technology to Panasonic is a result of the deal brokered between Matsushita (owners of the Panasonic brand) and Nintendo. When Nintendo signed Matsushita as the producer of the optical disc drives that power the GameCube, an agreement struck allowing Matsushita to produce a DVD system with the capability to play GameCube games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other features of the Q include a backlit LCD, a front-loading slot disc tray, an optical sound output supporting Dolby Digital 5.1, a separate subwoofer jack, and a stainless steel chassis. The Q is capable of installing all of the GameCube hardware upgrades; however, because of the legs on the bottom, it requires a special Panasonic Q Game Boy Player unit designed specifically for it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panasonic ceased production of the Q in December 2003 due to low sales. As it is quite possible to obtain a standard GameCube and a standalone DVD player for less than the price of the unit, the Panasonic Q is not a very common purchase except for some serious collectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Panasonic Q&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
