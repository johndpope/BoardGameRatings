			<description>COO-COO is a party game published in 1921. Players punch out a hole in the pegboard using a metal &amp;quot;key.&amp;quot; A little wad of paper is pushed out, which when unrolled reveals a slip containing some stunt the player must perform. Each pegboard contains 100 stunts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every COO-COO game contains 100 different stunts. COO-COO is issued in series; every series is entirely different from every other series. The numbers are shown on the end of the boxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DIRECTIONS FOR PLAYING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;are shown on the front of the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A good variation is to have the player do the stunt called for on his slip, while the others attempt to guess what he is doing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes the hostess will select one of her men guests to start the game. When he has done his stunt, he gives the board to any lady he chooses for the next stunt. After playing she hands the board to a man, etc., till all have played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COO-COO will be even more successful if the hostess announces before the play starts that a prize will be awarded to the lady and another to the man doing his stunt the best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The judges may declare a tie and require two more stunts played by e&amp;raquo;ch of those tied, thus prolonging the fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
