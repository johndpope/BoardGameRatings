			<description>Counting quickly and snatching the correct number of cards from the middle of the table - that's almost all there is to it, but this is easier said than done. Since while checking the motifs and colours, there could suddenly be more or less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 14 number cards that are laid out on the table. Each number card has three numbers on it. For each round, four motif or search cards are turned up. Players look at the search cards, which may show colours or symbols, then count the number of matching colours and symbols on the motif cards. When they think they've got the number right, they take one number card from the middle of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The numbers are checked, and everyone who has a correct number cards scores a point. The number cards go back into the middle of the table and the next round begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the cards turned up are only search cards, then the result is zero - and there are number cards with zero on them, so those are the ones people try to grab. If only motif cards are turned up, another set of cards is turned up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a variation for 2 to 4 children aged 6 and up, with fewer number cards, placed the other way up so that there is only one number showing. In this version, the search cards and motif cards are separated and only one search card is turned up each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
