							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wizard&#039;s Crown</name>
									
			<description>Back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guide this valiant band on its perilous mission in WIZARD'S CROWN, a multiple-character role-playing game. It stands out above the crowd by combining the detailed tactical battles of war gaming with the magic and mystery of a fantasy quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight pre-made characters await your orders, or you can create your own. Make them sorcerers, priests, fighters, rangers, or thieves. Endow your heroes with strength, dexterity, intelligence and other personal attributes. Arm them with a variety of weapons and skills such as magic, stealth, and healing. Then command them in encounters with the fearsome denizens of Arghan, including monsters, wraiths, and the undead. Guide the companions through a maze of streets, buildings and dungeons, searching for clues to the ancient hiding place for the coveted Crown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When fighting starts, you can let the computer resolve it quickly or you can personally direct it with a multitude of combat options. Challenge yourself at any of five levels of play. Capture, find, or trade a nearly limitless number of magic items to increase your chances of fulfilling the quest and claiming the promised prize - a reward of great enchantment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
