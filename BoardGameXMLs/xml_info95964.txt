			<description>(from the box)&lt;br/&gt;Maxim 'Up! could be the new favourite game in house, due to the colourfull blocks, the easy scoring and the exciting and impredictable gameplay!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make chains with the blocks to form words. Change words by stacking blocks. You steal a word when you place the top-most block. But the stacks grow, so the winning hand changes continuously. You know the most words when the last blocks are played? then you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your turn, either, take a few letters from your personal supply, and form a word with it. Then add it to the growing game board. Like this, some sort of cross-word-board will grow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also play your letters on top of other players' words, to form new words. This way, you can steal their words, and steal their points. &lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, you see for each word on the board who has played the highest letter of that word, and score a point for each word you own. The person with the highest number of words wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
