							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trade Goods</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pixel Loot - Trade Goods contains 20 unique items that represent valuable commodities in a medieval style world. These can be great story-building rewards for players bored with chests full of gold. Can the players find a buyer for a herd of goats? The coffee beans and tea leaves they found in a shipwreck will bring them a lot of gold, but how do they transport it? These are also great rewards for low-level players who aren't ready for powerful magic items, but youncan easily tailor the quantities to match the appropriate challenge level. Each card includes the value per pound (and the weight of each animal, in the case of livestock). Just transporting and selling this stuff is an adventure in and of itself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
