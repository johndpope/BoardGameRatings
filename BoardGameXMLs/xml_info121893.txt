			<description>David Parlett's Puzzle of Oz was initially designed as a solitaire puzzle played as follows: Five stones in each of five colors are placed in a bag. Draw four stones and place them in the four outer squares of the playing area, which resembles a fat plus sign. Then draw the remaining stones one at a time, placing each stone next to a stone already in position. If no two orthogonally adjacent stones are of the same color, you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this release, Parlett has included rules so that two players can compete against one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
