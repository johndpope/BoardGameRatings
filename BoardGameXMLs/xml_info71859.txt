			<description>&amp;quot;God Hand (ゴッドハンド, Goddohando)  is the video game directed by Shinji Mikami. It was developed by Clover Studio and published by Capcom for the PlayStation 2 video game console. God Hand was released in 2006 in Japan and North America and in 2007 in PAL territories. Capcom announced just days after the game's North American ship date that it would dissolve Clover Studio, making God Hand the developer's final game released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;God Hand puts players in the role of Gene, a martial artist who is bestowed with one of the legendary &amp;quot;God Hands&amp;quot;, a pair of divine arms that were once used to save the world from a demon called Angra. Gene and his companion Olivia are eventually caught up in an attempt by a group of demons known as the Four Devas to resurrect Angra for purposes of world domination. The game mixes western and Japanese-themed comedy, containing over-the-top characters and storyline events. The gameplay combines traditional elements of the beat 'em up genre with new features. These include being able to map and string together a large repertoire of fighting techniques to the gamepad's face buttons in order to create unique combo attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;God Hand was directed by celebrated Resident Evil designer Shinji Mikami, whose desire was to create an action game aimed at &amp;quot;hardcore gamers&amp;quot; intermixed with a large amount of comic relief. The game received an overall lightly positive response from critics. God Hand sold only modestly upon its release in Japan.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;God_Hand,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
