			<description>Catch the Match Duo features two levels of game play in one package. First is the pattern recognition game previously featured in the 1995 release Catch the Match. That game includes 15 cards that each feature a variety of colored objects. Two cards are laid out, and players race to find the only object that's exactly the same on both cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second is Catch the Match Duo, which is played with the backside of those 15 cards. Now each pair of cards has exactly two objects that are identical on both cards. A player's job is to identify those two objects before any opponent can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four themed versions of Catch the Match Duo will be released simultaneously, with the game play being the same for each version of the game and only the pictures being different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
