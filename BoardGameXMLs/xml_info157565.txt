							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flaws II</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playerâ€™s Options: Flaws introduced flaws to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, helping players create richer, more colorful characters. Later Player&amp;rsquo;s Options: [Race] releases added more flaws to the selection, specifically focused on those races. As was said in the introduction for the first flaws release, not every hero is a paragon of virtue, of whole physical and moral cloth. Presented here are yet more flaws for players to choose from, allowing more variety in character creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This release also includes new class flaws &amp;ndash; flaws designed only to be taken by members of that character class. There is one for each of the core classes, and while these flaws are intended specifically for those character classes, a GM could decide to open them up to members of any character class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This release adds an additional 30 flaws created by the founder of 4 Winds Fantasy Gaming (Robert W. Thomson).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
