			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-Write History.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter a time when pilots really flew planes...airspeed was manageable, controls were simple, nothing was computerized. Dogfight success was determined by toughness and talent, not technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Air Warrior lets you experience the thrill of combat in 11 of the most feared warplanes of the WWII and Korean eras. This is the training school for online air combat duty against GEnie Air Warrior veterans. The theatre of operations could have over 50 planes airborne at any time; not a welcome mat for a novice pilot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Air Warrior is the first and only Super VGA (640 x480 x256 color) flight sim. Take to the skies in 3 modes: Beginner, Intermediate or Expert. Film your toughest missions and re-fly them differently to sharpen flight skills. Test yourself against a buddy in modem to modem airspace. But, log as many practice hours as you can; it's a wild blue yonder on-line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World War II&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nation was committed to the war effort. U.S. factories worked relentlessly from '40 to '45 to turn out more than 250,000 planes for battle in the Pacific and Europe. Many were outdated when the war began, but held their own against superior craft until faster, more maneuverable planes arrived. Training consisted of little more than a manual, mission papers and a parachute. We were not ready for war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Korea&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Korean War lasted from June, 1950 to July, 1953. This international military action involved the U.N., the U.S., and 19 other nations battling over Communism. Air power played a key role in the war; the very first jet-to-jet encounter occurred November 9, 1950 when an American F-80 destroyed a Communist jet fighter. MiG Alley alone resulted in the downing of an estimated 800 MiG fighters and some 58 F-86 Sabre jets. Air warfare had been completely redefined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
