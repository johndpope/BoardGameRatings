			<description>A miniatures game which uses 1/300 scale aircraft to portray air combat from 1930 to 1945. 48 page rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Take to the air in the dark days of the Battle of Britain or try to defend the Fatherland against the USAF. This game is for 1/300 scale aircraft and uses a simple movement system which takes account of the turning and climbing abilities of the aircraft. The advantages and disadvantages of different formations and aircraft types become apparent very quickly.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This set of rules operates in three dimensions while only physically using two, height being indicated beside an aircraft. Weapon effectiveness is taken into account, and the skill of your aircrew is paramount. This is varied by nation and period to get the right feel for the game. The system also caters for game balance to ensure that no game is a walkover. There are simple rules for ammunition expenditure, Flak, Bombing, Night Actions, etc. Players can handle about 4 planes each.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The rules are quite short, but are supplemented by introductory data with over 200 selected aircraft from the main theaters of World War Two. The theaters concerned are those NOT marked with an asterisk in the list below. These illustrate the differences caused by new designs and trying to stuff more into an old design. The Second Edition incorporates a number of rules revisions and some new rules to make life even more exciting for the unwary. A whole section of Optional Rules introduces new complexities into the game, as well as also offering some emerging technologies.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher ratings: Complexity - 4/10; Level of detail - 7/10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a separately sold data annex, adding more aircraft: &amp;quot;Angels 15&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's Home Page for the Game: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.aandagames.co.uk/scramble.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.aandagames.co.uk/scramble.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
