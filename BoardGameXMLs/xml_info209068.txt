							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Net Libram of Random Naughty Effects</name>
									
			<description>Being a compendium of wild surges sophisticated and risqu&amp;eacute;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I first saw Tome of Magic years ago, I was instantly drawn to the Wild Mage specialist.  The promise of power tempered with the very real danger of destruction was too seductive a prize to resist, and I was hooked.  That was way back in the early nineties, when The Internet was still just a gleam in Al Gore's eye.  Once I found Usenet, and later when I gained web access, I searched far and wide for anything I could find about Wild Mages, their spells, and their beloved Wild Surges.  Then, a few years ago I came across The Net Libram of Random Magical Effects Version 1.20, which is a list of 10,000 chaotic results for use with Wands of Wonder, Wild Magic Surges, strange artifact effects, or goddess knows what else, and I loved it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previously I&amp;rsquo;d downloaded The Complete Guide to Unlawful Carnal Knowledge and found it tremendously entertaining, with more than a little serious game application to be gleaned from it.  The spells were especially delightful, but I enjoyed the whole thing probably for the very reason that critics might decry it.  Eventually I had one of those weird little epiphanies suggesting that I make some kind of contribution.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the will or patience to research a lot of esoteric detail, nor did I want to spend too much time slaving over game mechanics or beta testing.  So I decided that the best way to contribute was to combine two of the more amusing aspects of gaming into one single Netbook.  And from that humble beginning, I came up with the tome you&amp;rsquo;re now perusing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
