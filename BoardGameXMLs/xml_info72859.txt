			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome, friend, to Thoumont's Rare Components and Tomes...a shop with a little bit of everything for the knowledgable and distinguished patron of the literary arts...and a few things that simply aren't sold anywhere else (perhaps for good reason). Located in the heart of Himmelveil's upscale mercantile district, Thoumont's is a sizable two-storey shop with room enough for Thoumont herself to maintain considerable storage, or even have her home upstairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thoumont's is the second in our line of Himmelveil buildings, following after the Harbormaster. The shop itself is sizable (7&amp;quot; x 10&amp;quot; on the ground, nearly 9&amp;quot; by 12&amp;quot; at the roofline) and the upper storey sprawls outwards beyond the edges of the ground floor. The structure itself is amazingly textured in 300-dpi hi-resolution by WorldWorks newcommer Peter Gifford.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it is when you step inside that you are truly amazed by what is in this set! The level of detail in the bookshelves, tables, countertops and crates is amazing! A wide variety of layouts are possible within the bounds of the structure's outer walls, and some of the details in the build have to be seen to be believed. The set includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Walls and floors enough to build the two-storey structure of Thoumont's, with alternate walls to bring the bookstore to life (as either a relatively &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; bookstore or a more fanciful &amp;quot;magic shop&amp;quot;) or to generic it down to allow for other types of shops...including a raised floor entrance and a bay window!&lt;br/&gt;     Alternate floors with dark designs patterned upon it, should Thoumont be a practioner of foul magics.&lt;br/&gt;     Adjustable interior walls for varied layouts.&lt;br/&gt;     The ceiling of the ground floor, and the ceiling under the roof are also FULLY TEXTURED!&lt;br/&gt;     Crates (8 types), Tables, Bookcases, a massive Countertop layout, Stairs going up, a Trapdoor going down, and a standalone Woodstove and Chimney that can be placed anywhere within the building.&lt;br/&gt;     Two styles of tiled roof...one that creates a simple peak, and another that has full gables on either side.&lt;br/&gt;     A transparency option for all of the windows to allow a peek inside.&lt;br/&gt;     A street sign.&lt;br/&gt;     A preview of Streets of Himmelveil, provided courtesy of Scott Reid and designed so that Thoumont's will fit seamlessly into said streets upon release, custom-fit to the shop itself.&lt;br/&gt;     As always, fully photographed instructions to take you through the build process.&lt;br/&gt;     Last, but not least...Thoumont's is featured in the new WWG fantasy adventure module, Under the Veil by Will Belford. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
