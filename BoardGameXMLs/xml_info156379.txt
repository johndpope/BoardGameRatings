			<description>from the title page:&lt;br/&gt;Doomslakers Adventures #1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;The wind whips through the standing stones making the hill moan like something alive. Or perhaps something dead.  You stand atop its barren crown.  There is a whisper in the darkness.  There is evil afoot&amp;hellip;Whether you come to the hill for glory, riches, or by mere chance you might not walk away the same as when you came&amp;hellip;if at all&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This OGL module for low-level characters can be used with most fantasy role playing games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is for a party of 4 to 6 characters of levels 1st to 3rd. It is intended to be a short, single session dungeon crawl you can either drop into a longer adventure or run as a side trek. The area is not described in much detail so you can easily fit it into most medieval fantasy campaigns. Any specifics of the setting, such as the Shekeltooth goblin clan or the elves of Pricklewood forest, are part of a fantasy world that could develop from this and future adventures in the Doomslakers line. Feel free to include or exclude any of these these elements to suit your needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
