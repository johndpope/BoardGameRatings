			<description>As a druid, players must restore Purity back into the Drachnel Forest by casting Enchantments throughout various glades. There are 8 rounds in the game also known as Sabbats from the Celtic Wheel of the Year. During a turn a Druid must build a glade of the forest and then perform actions by himself or with the help of a summoned animal. Druids must try to Enchant a Glade to earn Spirit points. Glades that have less purity than others will earn more Spirit points. Each druid that creates a Triad (3 adjacent glades with their own enchantment) will score Spirit Points. Depending on the position of The Wheel of the Year, glade enchanting may prove difficult. Certain glades are also abundant with Druidic Magick; swiping other&amp;rsquo;s enchantments, using magical bursts, or summoning forest animals for assistance, to name a few. The more the game is played, players will come up with new strategies and new ideas on how to best earn Spirit. Each game will create a random layout of the forest, never knowing which glades will be present that game. And you never know what changing events the Drachnel Forest will unleash - so be certain to store up your Mind Power to use only when needed. The druid with the most Spirit Points after one year, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
