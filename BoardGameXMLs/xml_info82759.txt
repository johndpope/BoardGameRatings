			<description>From the back of the package;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goblin Commander: Unleash the Horde calls upon your skill and courage to destroy the enemy, pillage the enclaves and scorch the earth. Wage war with a horde of specialized goblin warriors at your command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Action-packed strategy game made for the console!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Design a custom army from over 25 different goblins&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Take direct control of giant Titans and battle-ready Turrets to cause reckless mayhem&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Over 25 single and multi-player Campaign Levels&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goblin Commander: Unleash the Horde is a 2003 real-time strategy video game developed and published by Jaleco for the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube  consoles. It was released in North America for the Xbox and PS2 on November 11, 2003 and on the GameCube on December 16, 2003, and later in Europe on March 19, 2004, July 16, 2004 and March 11, 2005 for the Xbox, GameCube and PS2 respectably.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in a fantasy world, the story follows the tale of a civil war between goblin clans after their creator and master is killed. The gameplay is a combination of real-time strategy and light action where players gather resources and build up their horde of goblins while also being able to take direct control of certain units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goblin Commander is a hybrid genre with much of the gameplay revolving around real-time strategy while incorporating elements of action gameplay. Players take control of a number from five different goblin clans, each with their own unique units and designs with the objective of harvesting resources to build up their horde and warring with the opposing player clans. Through a top-down perspective user interference, each player begins with one clan shine for every goblin clan under their command and only one Hall of Titans, the former for recruiting and upgrading goblins and the latter for special &amp;ldquo;titan&amp;rdquo; units and turrets. The clan shrines are in a fixed location and if destroyed will have to be rebuilt. There are two kinds of resources to gather for purchases and upgrades: gold and souls. Gold is found throughout the map by locating treasure chests and destroying structures, both the terrain and foe&amp;rsquo;s. Souls are harvested through either defeating enemy units or capturing souls wells. Additional structures are located elsewhere on the world map and must also be captured for use. These include the Observatory for a greater line of sight, revealing unexplored areas of the map and the Alchemist Shop for purchasing rune magic to be used for their own benefit or against other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five different goblin clans in total; Stonekrusher (grey), Hellfire (red), Stormbringer (blue), Plaguespitter (green) and Nighthorde (purple). Each clan focuses on either combat or ranged orientated goblins, for example the Stonekrusher can recruit light, medium and heavy combat goblins but only just light range. They also have special goblins with their own ability such as the Hellfire scout for line of sight and the Stonekrusher drummer for healing other goblins. Additional units include a clan&amp;rsquo;s unique titan that is large beast that have a variety of high damaging attacks but only one can be control at a time, and turrets that can be built across the map to automatically fire upon foes. Every time a goblin is recruited, it joins up with its clan&amp;rsquo;s horde that is controlled as one unit, for example a player with three clans would have three hordes. Hordes can also be ordered follow other hordes and titans. The light action part of the gameplay involves players taking direct control of a horde or titan in a third person view and attack other enemies directly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game supports two modes, a single-player campaign where the player partakes in a series of missions with set objectives, slowly throughout gaining the command of the various goblin clans, and a two-player skirmish mode where two players can battle one-another via split-screen choosing the map and clans in advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Goblin Commander: Unleash the Horde&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
