			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FASERIP is a retro-clone that emulates an old out-of-print super hero role-playing game. For legal reasons, the game that it emulates can't be named anywhere within this site or within FASERIP itself. However, this doesn't matter. If you know the game then you will pretty much instantly recognise it, and if you don't know the game then you can play FASERIP on its own merits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FASERIP covers all types of hero from the lowest powered street-hero to the most powerful cosmic entity, and its mechanics can also be used for playing in other RPG genres, with four example alternate settings included within the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character sheets for FASERIP are included in the book itself, and can be easily printed from the PDF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
