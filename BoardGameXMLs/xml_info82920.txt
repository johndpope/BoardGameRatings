							<name  sortindex="1">Igor: Objetivo Uikokahonia</name>
									
			<description>Igor is a student on a typical USA University who is madly in love with another student, Laura, although she does not know it. While spying her, he learns about a travel to a paradisiacal island named Uikokahonia. Both her and Igor's worst enemy, Phillip, who is also after Laura, are going to that travel. Igor wants to join too, to be closer to Laura and watch Phillip. But to do so, first he must go through some requirements: he must be matriculated in Biology, submit an end of semester essay and provide the money for the costs of the trip. Of course, he doesn't fit any of these requirements, so his mission will be to fulfill them, at any cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Igor: Target Uikokahonia&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
