							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hell&#039;s Paradise</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dawn Adventures 2: Hell's Paradise is the second of a set of adventures by Gypsy Knights Games set in the colonies of the Dawn subsector of Tranquility Sector, located to trailing of Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TXE-605b, known to some as Calliope, is an untapped planet whose barren surface but breathable atmosphere and abundance of water promises to be an excellent candidate world for colonization. The Nordic Exploratory Service sent an expedition to the TXE-605 system to expand humanity's knowledge of this world. Now their vessel, NESS Arn, has not returned on schedule. The crew of the CCAS Clara Barton, a Cascadia Colonization Authority search and rescue ship, has now been tasked with finding out why the Arn has not come back from TXE-605b. Have they been attacked by pirates? Have they suffered a malfunction? Or is it something far more sinister?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dawn Adventures 2: Hell's Paradise is an exciting adventure filled with danger and intrigue.  It comes with nine pre-generated characters, the stats and deckplans for Clara Barton, a Trailblazer-class ship used by the CCA. In addition, it also features maps of TXE-605b and the overall TXE-605 system as well as deckplans for the NESS Arn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although Dawn Adventures 2: Hell's Paradise can be modified for use in any Traveller setting, it is recommended that Referees have access to Clement Sector, our core setting book, to make full use of this product. It may also be helpful to own Dawn Colonies, our sourcebook covering this subsector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all our products, the main intention of this book is to provide an extra spark to the Referee's imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
