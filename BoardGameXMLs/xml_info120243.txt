			<description>Mobile Suit Gundam: Zeonic Front (known as Zeonic Front: Kidou Senshi Gundam 0079 [1] in Japan) is a game for the PlayStation 2, which revolves around a Zeon Special Commando Unit during the One Year War, called the Midnight Fenrir Corp. This MS team was created by Kycilia Zabi and participated in the capture of the California Base during the 2nd Earth Invasion Plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You take command of Midnight Fenrir Corps in the game. Eventually, by completing missions, more pilots will join in the Fenrir Corps' long and hard fought struggle.  It is the first Gundam based PlayStation 2 game that lets the player operate solely as Zeon forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The campaign starts with early raids on Federation territories in North America and covers many of the events occurred in the One Year War, such as the death of Garma Zabi. Eventually Federation manages to develop and field Mobile Suits in combat which tips the balance of power to their favor. The Midnight Fenrir team joins many historical battles such as the Battle of Seattle, where Garma Zabi died and the Invasion of Jaburo, with Agar stalking them in almost every step. Eventually, even Midnight Fenrir's skills are not enough to save the war effort: Zeon eventually evacuates their forces in Earth to fight in space. The Midnight Fenrir team decide to leave last and cover the retreating forces. However, when the last operational HLV (Space Shuttle) is lost, they eventually join up with remnant Zeon forces in Australia. Their last battle was in Australian deserts trying to save a stranded allied unit from Federation assault. It is not confirmed whether or not they are survived the war. Some speculate that they either managed to return to Side 3, or stayed on Earth and eventually helped Anavel Gato and the Delaz Fleet in Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mobile suits list:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MS-05B Zaku I - An early mainstay mass produced mobile suit. Varying on the pilot it is upgraded for better suiting the pilot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MS-06F Zaku II - A mainstay mass produced mobile suit. Depending on the pilot, it is either replaced by J-types or upgraded or both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MS-07B Gouf - A unit that was originally developed for close combat but is later replaced by the MS-07B-3 Gouf Custom. The Gouf is originally used in a recon mission to find the Trojan Horse, one of the EFSF's V-Project ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MS-07B-3 Gouf Custom - An improved version of the Gouf. Given a sort of mid to long range weapons in place of the 5x75mm machine gun fingers, such as the 120mm Assault rifle and leader for certain pilots the 90mm Assault rifle as well as the new Zaku machine guns and an arm attached 3x35mm gatling guns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MS-09 Dom - An agile heavy assault mobile suit that was mass produced to replace the Gouf and its predecessor, the Zaku II. It is armed for frontal assault with an array of bazookas and missile launchers but it is also well suited for hand to hand combat due to its extreme agility and heat saber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MS-09F/trop Dom Tropen - Similar to the MS-09 Dom the Dom Tropen was developed for tropical and desert climates having additional filters and intakes to prevent corrosion in the internal parts. Its armor and shape has been altered to be more streamlined and to withstand more damage, as well as to hold more equipment. The unit given to the Midnight Fenrir Corp and is a Kinbareid force type Dom meant for the desert in the final mission in the sahara.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MS-09 Dom Funf - A Dom MP similar to the Tropen but without the extra filters, it is painted green. Armed with the usual array of bazookas but top class rifles as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Zeonic Front&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
