			<description>Hextiles are a new domino system based on hexagon pairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hextiles are domino-like tiles composed of two conjoined hexagons, each marked with a number of pips between 0 and 6. The standard &amp;quot;double six&amp;quot; hextile set contains all unique pairs of pips for a total of 28 tiles:&lt;br/&gt;00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 33, 34, 35, 36, 44, 45, 46, 55, 56, 66.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like Dominoes, Hextiles are a not a particular game but a gaming system with which a number of games can be played. This section describes some examples; all are played with the  following rules except where stated:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*&lt;br/&gt;      All tiles start randomly shuffled and upside down in the boneyard.&lt;br/&gt;    *&lt;br/&gt;      Players draw tiles until a double is drawn - this becomes the first tile played and the drawer the first mover.&lt;br/&gt;    *&lt;br/&gt;      Players then draw seven tiles each to form their pool (players cannot see each others' pools).&lt;br/&gt;    *&lt;br/&gt;      If the current player cannot move they must draw additional tiles from the bone yard until they can move.&lt;br/&gt;    *&lt;br/&gt;      Tiles must be played adjacent to at least one existing tile, subject to the constraints for each game.&lt;br/&gt;    *&lt;br/&gt;      Players must replenish their pool with a tile from the boneyard after each move.&lt;br/&gt;    *&lt;br/&gt;      Players cannot pass unless there is no legal move and no more tiles.&lt;br/&gt;    *&lt;br/&gt;      Play continues until neither player can move. Players then add their remaining pips to the opponent's score and the player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.cameronius.com/games/hextiles/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.cameronius.com/games/hextiles/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
