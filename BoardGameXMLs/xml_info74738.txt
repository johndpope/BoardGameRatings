			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crackdown 2 is a sandbox-style third-person shooter video game developed by Ruffian Games and published by Microsoft Game Studios. It was released on Xbox 360 in July 2010 and is a direct sequel to the 2007 video game Crackdown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has recieved mixed reviews. GameSpot gave the game a 7/10, praising the game's exploration, orb collecting and four-player co-op, while criticizing its similarities between its predecessor. IGN gave the game a 7.5/10, also faulting it for similarities between its predecessor and its absence of a true story, but also complimenting its orb collecting and cooperative campaign. Giant Bomb gave the game 3 out of 5 stars, stating that while the game was enjoyable, too much was lifted from the first game and little new was added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
