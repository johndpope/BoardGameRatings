							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Storming the Castle</name>
									
			<description>The game comes with a piece of cardboard, three balls, and two wooden bases to put the game together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes turns rolling the three balls up the drawbridges and into the openings: the castle entrances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the success of a player&amp;rsquo;s rolls, points are scored. Five points are given for each ball going through the outside entrances. Ten points are given for the center. If a ball falls into the Moat, five points are lost by a player. If a ball rolls back down the drawbridge, no points are given or lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the game is the player to first collect 200 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
