							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Psi-Watch Unlimited Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psi-Watch: Unlimited Edition presents a slick, stylish new way of looking at psionics, not to mention modern espionage and supers gaming. The campaign setting owes a major debt to my life-long love of comics, and is inspired by my generation's comic book renaissance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psi-Watch is designed to emulate the thrill of those early Image comics, to allow players and gamemasters alike to bring some of their sleek style and overwhelming firepower to the gaming table. Psi-Watch is designed with the player in mind, presenting an assortment of new powers, advanced classes, weapons, power armor and vehicles.... New tactics for a new kind of war game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psi-Watch Unlimited Edition is the same stylish modern action game you were playing already, but better. Incorporating new elements, such a greatly expanded version of the Powered Hero Basic Class introduced first in Otherverse America, new races, new classes, and new racial feats, the Unlimited Edition offers gamers more options. Filled with expanded world information, campaigns built using the Unlimited Edition will be deeper and more rewarding. New factions and adversaries give the setting additional depth and history. The already well-received Powered Armor construction rules in Psi-Watch get a comprehensive overhaul- the new system is quicker and easier to use without sacrificing depth and flexibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
