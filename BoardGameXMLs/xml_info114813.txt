			<description>La Febbre dell'Oro (Gold Rush) is a fun game and is set during the Wild West where the search for gold had become a &amp;quot;fever&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board has 72 boxes, game of goose style, and the players move their horse through a wheel numbered from 1 to 12. Some boxes (for example, the railroad, the saloon, the emporium, the river, etc.) can be bought to guarantee an income to the owner when another player will occupy the box.&lt;br/&gt;When a player reaches the box  #72 has the chance to enter the gold mine (and win) if he gets 13 points using twice the wheel numbered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
