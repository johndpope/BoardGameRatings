			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a modern list of 100 base items, with some possible alternatives, that could be found by looting or investigating a kitchen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The items that are listed are equipment, rather than food. Many are potentially dangerous, including some potential improvised weapons. Others are simply useful for cooking, or survival. These pieces of equipment can be found in all kitchens, from domestic to commercial. The main difference between a domestic kitchen and a commercial one is that in the latter the equipment tends to be bigger, better made and harder wearing, and capable of cooking more at once if appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some example results are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;47. Loaf Tins (Metal, usually rectangular, moulds for baking loaves)&lt;br/&gt;48. Mandoline (Handheld slicer, with plastic or metal frame, for thinly slicing vegetables, with spare blades)&lt;br/&gt;49. Meat Slicer (Electric meat slicer with a rotating circular blade)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
