							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lich Master</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the Best Lich You Can Be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For nearly as long as liches have existed in tabletop roleplaying games, players have wanted to have the chance to be one. The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary has a template for liches, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t designed with players in mind, and so many GMs are forced to tackle questions like: what do I need to do to become a lich? Is a CR +2 adjustment the same as two levels? Does that mean I have to skip leveling up and &amp;ldquo;save up&amp;rdquo; an extra level, or do I have to lose levels to become a lich? Even if the GM has the answer to all of these questions, he or she may be hesitant to allow players to take a template that lets them heal themselves infinitely, and which can permanently paralyze foes all day long, and while these abilities are powerful, they&amp;rsquo;re not very fun at the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents the lich master prestige class, a ten level prestige class that not only makes being a lich more accessible, by presenting it in prestige class form, but also provides abilities that are more player oriented. Far more than just divvying up the abilities in the template, this prestige class greatly expands the idea of what a lich can do, and makes liches more customizable. Not only do lich masters gain phylacteries, potent defenses, and deliver negative energy with a touch, they can also channel negative energy or project their soul into other creatures, easily control undead minions, sever the souls of his victims from their bodies and use them for his own dark ends, and far more. Finally, the book includes five feats intended for members of the class, which allows players to even further customize their lich.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you are a player who&amp;rsquo;s always dreamed of playing a lich, or a GM who wants a way to make a lich character more exciting and dynamic, this book brings these undead spellcasters to unlife in a whole new way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
