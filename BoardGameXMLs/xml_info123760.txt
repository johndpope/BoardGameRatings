							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Army of the Goblinoids</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains stats for both standard OGL play and Feast of Crows unit conversions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The orcs, goblins and bugbears of the land have a just reputation as ravagers, destroyers. Mindless barbarian forces intent on nothing more than rape, burn and pillage. They breed fast, live for war - even amongst themselves - and exist in a brutal hierarchy of strength, bowing their heads only to those breeds and powers that prove stronger and more ruthless than they are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goblinoids represent chaos and animal instinct, they exist at the fringes of the civilised world in the wild places and in the caverns underground, they inhabit ruins and the dark areas of the map. They are fear of the savage and dangerous side of nature they are beasts that walk like men and use their own tools against them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goblinoids are not the most intelligent or tactically minded of creatures, their options mostly being limited to attacking endlessly, relying on their great weight of numbers to succeed where others would fail. Their personal physical prowess and low animal cunning still makes them dangerous though and many a well thought out and clever trap has failed to take into account goblinoid tenacity and savagery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are the engines and footsoldiers of chaos and evil, bringing war and strife to every land and every people endlessly. Occasionally a great host will arise, lead by an effective leader and then the lands of the man-like races should tremble and fear what is coming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
