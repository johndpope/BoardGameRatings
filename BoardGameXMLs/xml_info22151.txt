			<description>Vintage Wheels is a trivia game about automotive history.  The game includes a game board, 1000 cards with questions and answers, 6 tokens, a die and instructions.  Each player rolls the die on his turn to determine which question an opponent will ask him from a card.  A correct answer allows the player to advance his token along a track the number of spaces indicated on the die.  If a player answers incorrectly, play passes to the left.  The first player to complete a circuit wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
