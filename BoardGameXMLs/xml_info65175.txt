			<description>From the cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A pity.&amp;quot; Tyrian pulled a small gemstone from his pocket. &amp;quot;I had hoped to hear your final words before you met your God.&amp;quot; With an almost insolent flick he tossed the gem into the corner where Lash and his friends stood. Lash caught the sight of a star-like pattern in the perfect sphere of ruby as it flew toward them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heat, flame, and excruciating pain filled the space as the gemstone hit the wall to Lash's right. The fireball expanded outward, burning everything in the small space. Two of the shadows appeared to succumb to the flames as they dissolved into nothingness. The fireball was unexpected, but not unsurprising. The pain and weakness that followed, as if his very life experiences were being pulled from his body was a surprise. As was the effect on the shadows, which seemed to fill with a new found vigor. Purin was unconscious, or possible dead already, and Lash's other companions looked no better than he felt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Tyrian laughed, the shadows moved in for the kill. Lash didn't know how they were going to get out of this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The science of harnessing gems and minerals has come a long way from the earliest days of the skill. When the skill was new, harnessing a gem was more art than science. Today, wizards spend hours pouring through tomes on geology and mineralogy to better understand the mineral they are working on. The process to unlock the magical potential in new minerals is one of careful research and experimentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mineral Magic: Volume Three gives you 33 new magic items, which can be made from 29 commonly found gems and minerals, including the deadly Star Fire Gem, the always useful Rogue's Helper, and the Metals of Purity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mineral Magic: Volume Three contains detailed descriptions of all 33 new magical minerals along with the necessary rules for creating and selling them to your players. Also included are 2 feats that will allow your players to harness their own magical minerals, and detailed tables allowing you to add these magic items into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
