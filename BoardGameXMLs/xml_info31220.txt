			<description>From the Manufacturer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 1943, and the only way for the Allies to carry the war to the Germans is from the air.  But strategic bombing is an experiment;  can they succeed where no one else has, or will the Luftwaffe&amp;rsquo;s air defenses cause the USAAF to fail, as every other bombing campaign to date has?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This decision-rich, tense Print N&amp;rsquo; Play game puts you in charge of either the US bombing campaign or the aerial defense of the Reich.  Not only do you have to select and achieve your military objectives;  you also must maintain enough support for your campaign to keep resources flowing to you.  Will you support ground offensives? Build currently available aircraft or invest in technology? Order your fighters to stick close to the bombers  or sweep the sky for interceptors?  Attack immediately with what&amp;rsquo;s in the air, or combine your fighter groups?  Defend each target as it&amp;rsquo;s attacked or wait and launch a huge strike against one raid?   The decisions are all yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a different game than Target for Today&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
