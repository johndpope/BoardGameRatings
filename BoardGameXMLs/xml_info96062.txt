			<description>The Curse Of Frankenstein is a game book in the Horror Classics series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a fairly typical move from one paragraph to the other game book. The book uses a sanitized version of the original story, and follows up from the monsters escape into the Arctic wastes. When the game opens we have the Monster fleeing to the icy wastelands of the Arctic, leaving a trail of bodies in his wake. Dr Frankenstein is in hot pursuit. You have a choice here to play as either the Monster or the Baron, which means there are actually two campaigns in this game book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Monster carries with him spare body parts that, when used to replace worn ones, function as healing potions. He also has two skills that increase his damage and combat durability as well as a skill called Love Affair that allows him on a successful roll of the die to befriend 50% of his opponents and avoid fighting with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Baron, meanwhile, has a skill that increases his defence, one that allows him to create a smaller version of the monster to fight alongside him, and a skill that randomly generates beneficial or dire effects depending on the roll of a die. The last skill can cause some really devastating damage on the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Monster and the Baron are equally sturdy - they both have 100 Life Points at the start of their respective campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
