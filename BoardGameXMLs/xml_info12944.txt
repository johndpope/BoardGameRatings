			<description>In Patriot Challenge players move their token around the game board, which features illustrations of U.S. postage stamps, and try to be the first to pass the year 2000. In order to move their tokens players must answer questions on cards that are divided by difficulty into three categories: white cards (basic), blue cards (challenging), and red cards (expert). The questions pertain to aspects of American history and culture. Correct responses earn points which a player uses to move his token.&lt;br/&gt;If a player does not know the answer to a question, he has the option of teaming up with another player, and if the team answers correctly the points are split between the two players.&lt;br/&gt;Some of the cards have bonus questions. If a player successfully answers a bonus question, the other players, as a democratic group, must decide how many points to award.&lt;br/&gt;The player who best combines teamwork, strategy, and knowledge will have the best chance of winning.&lt;br/&gt;The game components are: a game board, 650 cards, rules, an answer key, a magnifying glass, and six tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
