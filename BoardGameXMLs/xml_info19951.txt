							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">KLM Cargo Game</name>
									
			<description>In July of 1985, KLM Cargo wrote a letter to prospective contestants for a promotional effort to identify their most valuable employee. This letter launched the first installment of the KLM Cargo Game. It was KLM's stated intent to provide a total of four installments of the game. Each installment would add pieces and a new line-up card. At the end of the promotion, the players would use the four &amp;quot;line-ups of suspects&amp;quot; to identify their favorite employee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regrettably, the one copy that I have seen contains only the materials from the first installment of the game. that installment contained the following components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Game box and insert &lt;br/&gt;     Game board &lt;br/&gt;     Cover letter &lt;br/&gt;     KLM Cargo 'How to &amp;quot;Collar&amp;quot; a Suspect' guide (with the first 5 &amp;quot;suspects&amp;quot;) &lt;br/&gt;     A sealed stack of play money &lt;br/&gt;     A sealed bag with 6 pawns and 1 die &lt;br/&gt;     A sealed stack of Chance cards &lt;br/&gt;     A sealed stack of Departure/Clearance cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the promotion, the players were supposed to use the four &amp;quot;line-ups of suspects&amp;quot; (one per installment) to identify their favorite employee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
