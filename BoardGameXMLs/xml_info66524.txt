			<description>Originally entitled Actions Stations! (which was changed for copyright reasons), Supremacy at Sea - World War II Naval Combat is a the product of years of effort from a group of individuals known collectively as the University of British Columbia Sunday Night Crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supremacy at Sea can be used for either quick scratch battles, or as part of larger campaigns. The rules are best suited to be used  with 1/2400 scale models, but can be used with anything from 1/1200 to 1/4800 scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game contains rules for every aspect of naval combat including: ramming, laying smoke, searchlights, night-fighting, weather, radar, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One interesting feature of the game is that players on the same side must talk strategy loudly enough for everyone at the table to hear. (This simulates the ability of both sides to intercept communications). However, orders are written down secretly and executed simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    SAS: Spee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
