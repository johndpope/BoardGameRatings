			<description>Each player has vessels: Battleship, cruisers, battlecruisers, destroyers, torpedo boats and landing boats and submarines. On the board is a strait. On different sides of the strait players have their own port where are ammunition depots and workshop for repairing damaged ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main characteristic is that the game board is covered with a net of equilateral triangles. The vertices of these triangles are points at which players hold the position and move figurines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a display, which shows the characteristics, loaded ammunition, and received damage of vessels. The main objective of the game is to sink as many opponent ships as possible and to hit as many targets in opponents harbor. The game lasts as long as players have ships and ammunition, but may be finished earlier. The winner is the player who gave more hits, but the game can end differently - if a player manages to make a landing. That is a case when at least one landing boat succeed to land on the opposite shore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
