You will be fighting in conflict that was greatest fear of every politican and commander durning Cold war. Can you defeat Soviets before they could reach the Rhine? Or will you lead final push towards the Paris as Soviet commander?&lt;br/&gt;Able Archer unlike many games situated in Cold war gone hot scen&amp;aacute;rio, is played in 1:1 scale.
