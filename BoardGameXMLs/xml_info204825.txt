							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guide to Phaemorea</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phaemorea is a classic high fantasy setting designed for use with Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia though it can easily be adapted for use with any high fantasy setting. The world is designed to be compatible with all the old classic modules, as well as providing a fresh new setting for both new and old players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Guide to Phaemorea is a forty-page bookmarked PDF that gives an overview of the history, cultures and Immortals of the world of Phaemorea. A color hex map is included in the book. It is a world still reeling from brutal wars that engulfed entire civilizations and left a legacy of dark magic which still permeates areas of the land. Even now, the old foe sits silent on the other side of a great mountain range, and it's only a matter of time until they once again bring their undead hordes into the lands of the living.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In times now largely forgotten, the world was ruled by an ancient race of beings known as the Phaemoreans. Little is known about these people today, other than that left in shattered ruins which indicate a once thriving civilisation. Scholars believe the original Phaemoreans tore the world apart in some form of cataclysm, reshaping it into the world known today. Whatever happened, the Phaemoreans have ceased to be, except (as some believe) among the oldest of the Immortals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
