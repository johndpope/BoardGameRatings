			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Riotinto, one of the richest regions, where the land invite you to prosper and harvest your future.&lt;br/&gt;Players play the role of workers settled in the region, looking for opportunities and willing to take advantage of the natural resources and minerals of Riotinto, while contributing on the growth of the towns in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To this end, each player will be able to be sent 3 workers to the different areas of the region to carry out an action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workers in the quarry, will only be able to buy resources that the tradesman allows. Resources obtained in the quarry are sent out to the player's settlement where it may be used to settlement improvements, process them to be sold at the markets and build buildings and train stations in the towns along the railway route.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every time you sell resources in the market, you'll get money and a victory points bonus. The most resources are sold, greater will be the benefits. &lt;br/&gt;Each type of resource has a tracker where the player's marker will increase everytime she makes a sale of that resource. So you need to consider the type of resource you trades since each resource track has a different worth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improving settlement facilities, will allow you improve the production and access to better conditions when selling or build buildings in the towns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Improvements tiles are available in the towns that can be reached by train. The railroad will also give you bonuses along the Way between the towns.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there is an specific number of improvements tiles available (depending on the number of players) or when a player reaches the end of one of the market tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most VP will be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
