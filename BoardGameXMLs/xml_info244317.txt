			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a 48 x 30 inch full-color, map of a SciFi Police Station , with Hex, Square and No Overlays. The Zip file contains the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;My client wants an extensive operation destroying any and all evidence implicating him or his corporation in the murder. Then he wants the police station burned to the ground. It is highly illegal but potentially the most profitable job you&amp;rsquo;ll ever take. So what&amp;rsquo;s your answer?&amp;rdquo;--Intermediary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SciFi Police Station includes a single interior level of a futuristic police station complete with force field prison cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SciFi Police Station can be used in cyberpunk, horror, supers, and near or far-future science fiction games. It could also be used as a high-tech modern police station. The force field prison cells can be used to hold powerful abominations in a horror game, super villains in a supers game, or normal prisoners and aliens in a high-tech future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spoliation of Evidence: A CEO of a corporation has been accused of a murder and evidence has been gathered from his corporate HQ. He uses an intermediary to hire the group to hit the local police station. The intermediary gives them the following objectives:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Wiping of any files on the CEO and corporation from police servers.&lt;br/&gt;    Destruction of forensics lab.&lt;br/&gt;    Arson of evidence room.&lt;br/&gt;    Explosion of police station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This extremely dangerous mission is offered to the group at a rate about four times the going rate for their services plus a weapons contact that will give them a demolition kit and chest of explosives with more than enough extra for at least one more job after this one. As an added benefit, the intermediary suggests wiping police files on their group if they have time while on the police servers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
