			<description>Renegade Acolytes from the church had once attempted to carry out a dark incantation ritual with the help of an old rune tome. To do this, they created a demonic portal over a pentagram with magical gestures. As the rite progressed, some acolytes soon became clear with horror that they were not capable enough to keep these demonic circle upright. What happened to them was not handed down. But now you are in possession of this old rune tome. So what will you do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In SIGNS, 3 to 9 players try to sustain a sequence of numbers with their hands in each round. They are obliged to follow the rules imposed on them by runes. Each round comes with a further card, so the rules become more and more extensive. Anyone who shows a wrong sign and is caught by the other players must leave the circle. Only the bravest and cleverest summoner will succeed in maintaining the ritual to the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SIGNS is the first publication of Rocky Bogdanski, finalist of the 2016 Young Author scholarship and his co-author Kai Wetzel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
