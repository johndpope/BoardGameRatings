							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Giant: A Fellowship Expansion Pack</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We giants move carefully and deliberately. Our power is too great to act with recklessness or haste.When we act out of turn, empires fall, lakes are made, mountains are moved. So it is with great consideration and thought that I have come this day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have watched this dark being you name Overlord. I have seen their horrors, witnessed their power. This is not a quest for the giants to stand aside and watch from afar, as we have so many others. If we were to wait, I fear we would be waiting for naught but our own oblivion. And so, I shall join you, little ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am the Giant, and I am mighty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Giant is the first Fellowship expansion pack, and it&amp;rsquo;s a little different from the core playbooks. For one, it is far and away the strongest hero of the fellowship, and will likely be the strongest hero of the fellowship ever published by Liberi Gothica Games. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s a new type of playbook entirely - a Powerful Playbook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This playbook approaches the level of some of the Destiny moves that other players will eventually have, but it has access to that level of power right out the door. But this strength comes at a cost. If you want to play as the Giant, be sure you know all the ins and outs of both their strengths AND their weaknesses. The Giant is powerful, but the Giant is also terribly dangerous, and you need to handle your danger responsibly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
