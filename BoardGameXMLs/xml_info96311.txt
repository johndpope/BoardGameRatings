			<description>In the far future -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unknown creatures suddenly appear on the planet, and begin multiplying rapidly. They feed on humans, and once their food supply is gone, they travel to the past for more.  Now here they are - in the present. No one knows what they are and how they came to be. These powerful creatures are dubbed the &amp;quot;Twisted&amp;quot; because of their irregular, spiral shape. In response, the government creates a Counter Twisted Investigation team - the CTI. They declare a state of emergency and play their final card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Overdrive Investigation -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CTI is allowed a special type of investigation - one that allows the changing of the past to better the present. The only candidate compatible with the system is Aya, the protagonist and a CTI special agent. She wakes up with no recollection of her past, and is tortured by nightmares. And yet, she takes the investigation head on, in an effort to find out the truth of who she really is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
