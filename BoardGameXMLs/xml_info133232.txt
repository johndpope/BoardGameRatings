							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Bit of Banter Junior</name>
									
			<description>By encouraging children to share their dreams, thoughts, fears and aspirations in a fun and non-threatening way, A Bit of Banter Jr. is a game where anyone can become the &amp;quot;Best Banterer&amp;quot;. The goal is to collect the most gemstones and become &amp;ldquo;Best Banterer&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once everyone (including the first player) has answered, the first player chooses a gemstone and awards it to the person whose answer he/she like best* (for whatever reason &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s the fun part!). Players can (and should!) ask each other to elaborate on the answers, especially if the answers are too short! Players can skip a turn but by doing so they miss a chance to win a gemstone. The game ends when players simply agree to stop playing or when all gemstones have been distributed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The option &amp;quot;When you were my age...&amp;quot; allows children to get to know their parents and grand-parents better and involves adults in the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
