			<description>A new of its kind strategy board game for 2 to 6 players. Take your viruses and battle your opponent's occupied cells, but be careful, the cure syringe is also part of the game. Take risks and dominate the game. Challenge your friends and let them Infected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring built-in neodymium magnet characters and fully magnetized board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play Infected in single mode or in team mode with your friends. &lt;br/&gt;Each player takes at the role of one color virus and battles his opponent's occupied cells with the purpose of infecting other player's head viruses to win the game. Avoid the cure miracles, make the right moves to infect cells, take risks and dominate the game. Let your friends Infected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infected: The Board Game is not like other games. Here, players don't start in the same place each game played. Infected randomize the way to start each game by spinning the Infected spinning disk and throwing the dice at the beginning of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All viruses start in each player's head virus, so protecting your head virus is something to always keep in mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
