			<description>Author's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the beginning, the gods created the First Race, making them in their own image. But that race, having free will, felt the hand of temptation. They committed the First Sin. And because of that First Sin, the gods exiled the First Race from Paradise.&lt;br/&gt;You are members of that First Race, all of whom are in exile. All of whom have been tainted by the First Sin. Some have forsworn that sin, but others have not. You have had to keep your true Natures hidden from each other, for whomever sees your Nature knows your weakness. But despite all this, you have&lt;br/&gt;worked together to make up for what was lost. You have built a new civilization together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;Players compete, trying to bring the others down. They collaborate to create a web of relations and motivations between their characters. Play is divided into acts and scenes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
