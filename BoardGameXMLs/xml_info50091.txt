			<description>From the Back of the book...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Bob's super-Solo's killing everything he meets!' &amp;quot;My players always start the adventure in a bar!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Why can't I get anyone to play Netrunners??&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Refs. Let's be honest. You've heard this kind of whining before - and aren't you sick of it? I mean-just fed up to here...so much that you wanted to leap across the table and kill the guy!? Before you resort to cyberenhanced murder, examine the alternative: Listen Up You Primitive Screwheads!!!! The Unexpurgated Cyberpunk Referee's Guide. We grabbed six of Cyberpunk's best (and most opinionated) Referees, writers, and players, as well as the creator himself, by the scruffs of their necks and made them tell us what to do -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; How to properly start a Campaign&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Good character role choices - that aren't Solos&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; When your players think they're smarter than you&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Beef up your Lifepath: Why should the Cybergen kids get all the angst?&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Should your game walk those Mean Streets - or fly higher than Dynasty?&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; How to run combat against an ex-Marine - and not lose all your NPCs in the first round&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; As a bonus, you get Uncle Mike's Dirty Tricks: notes by the Master from a thousand savage conventions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BUT WAIT - there's more:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; A simplified combat system (for those that really want one...) that combines the best of Friday Night Fire Fight and Saturday Night Scuffle &lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Blowing Things up for Pleasure &amp;amp; Profit - an Explosives system that's realistic and works!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; And a completely indexed list of all the new skills and roles ever published!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
