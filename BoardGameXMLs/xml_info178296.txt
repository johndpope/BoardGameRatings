			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This quick start gives you the basics so you can start playing Blades before the final game is released. By definition, it's missing some pieces, particularly some instructional text and examples as well as the full guide to Duskwall city which will be in the final game. As such, it's a document that you'll have to interpret and bolster with your own understanding of roleplaying practices. If you're brand-new to RPGs, maybe ask a more experienced friend to run this for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary: This Quick Start Guide (currently on v4), as of November 2, 2015, is only available to Kickstarter Backers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
