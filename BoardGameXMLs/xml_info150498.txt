							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ZULU!! Battles of Rorke&#039;s Drift and Isandlhwana 1879</name>
									
			<description>Zulu!! is Richard Berg&amp;rsquo;s game series (Great Battles for Empire). It is unlike anything you&amp;rsquo;ve seen or played before. (Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s marketing hyperbole, but go along with us on this.) Zulu!! has no hexes, no squares, and is not point-to-point. It also has counters with no ratings. In some ways, it&amp;rsquo;s like cardboard miniatures &amp;hellip; with fewer rules. In that sense, it will be something new for many boardgamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a slight variation of Ye Olde Igo-Hugo play sequence, the game system highlights the firepower of the British Martini Henry rifle, the value of a solid defensive position, and the greatly superior numbers of the three Zulu Amibutho (divisions) that gave them something like 40-1 numerical superiority at times. And all of this without having to move hundreds of counters around, another innovation. The map scale is 1&amp;rdquo; = 4 yards. All of which plays in a couple of hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
