			<description>Willow is a video game released in 1989 for the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Famicom based on the 1988 film Willow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has the player taking on the role of Willow. Unlike the film and arcade game, this version of Willow generally travels alone, only briefly meeting other characters. In the tradition of The Legend of Zelda, Willow wields a sword and shield and many supplementary items along with a wide variety of magic spells. As the game progresses and Willow defeats enemies, he gains experience points and levels as in a RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Willow game was also released for the Amiga, Atari ST, and PCs (using MS-DOS), though it was developed by MidNite Entertainment Group Inc and Brian A. Rice Inc, and published by Mindscape in 1988/1989, and is an entirely different game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcade game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was also a coin-operated arcade game also released by Capcom, but it was an action adventure game and was not developmentally related to the NES or computer versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Willow (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
