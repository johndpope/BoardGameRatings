							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Balyna football</name>
									
			<description>Balyna usually made magnetic football games, but this one uses paddles to move the players. Advertised as &amp;quot;Outdoor Games Played Indoors&amp;quot;, the set contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- a cloth football pitch with two attached metal surround pieces behind the goals&lt;br/&gt;- 2 surround pieces for the length of the pitch&lt;br/&gt;- 2 metal goalposts with 4 metal clips for attaching to the surround&lt;br/&gt;- 22 football players in &amp;quot;distinctive colours&amp;quot; - usually flat, plain white plastic figures on either red, blue, green or white bases&lt;br/&gt;- 2 plastic &amp;quot;DIRECTORS&amp;quot; (paddles) used to flick the players about&lt;br/&gt;- 2 plastic pucks which are used as the ball&lt;br/&gt;- rulebook, endorsed by Stan Mortensen (!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game when set up covers an area approximately 18&amp;quot;x23.5&amp;quot;, making it ideal for tabletop use. It has quick setup time, although the metal surrounds and goals have extremely sharp edges and corners - health and safety would have a field day with it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a peculiar mix of Subbuteo (though you flick with the paddle rather than your finger) and tiddlywinks, and is surprisingly fast and fun; however, it is not as good as Subbuteo, which went on to become the dominant football game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
