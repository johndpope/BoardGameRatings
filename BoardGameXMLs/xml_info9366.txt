			<description>Ecolandia is a game about environmental problems. Players go around the board and each case has special effects. The map of Italy slowly covers itself of &amp;quot;Problem&amp;quot; cards; a special spot is used to keep &amp;quot;Problems&amp;quot; for the rest of the world.&lt;br/&gt;To solve each problem, a specific combination of &amp;quot;Resources&amp;quot; is needed: laws, money, petitions, media campaign and so on. When a player has the right set, he can go on a ZAT case and roll the die: the result is compared to the difficulty level of the Problem. If he succeeds, he gets a certain amount of &amp;quot;Green points&amp;quot;. Anyway, he looses all the resources.&lt;br/&gt;The flavor of the game is given by the trading possibilities: players can cooperate, exchanging resources for other ones or for a certain amount of &amp;quot;Green points&amp;quot;. They can choose to give them for a little amount of points, or to try the die to hope for a larger quantity.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one who collects the most Green Points. But if in any moment the map of Italy is totally covered by problems, all the players loose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
