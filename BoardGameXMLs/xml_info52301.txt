			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Crumbling Hall of the Frost Giant Jarl&amp;quot; is a Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons adventure for 10th-level characters in the style of 1st Edition AD&amp;amp;D classics such as the &amp;quot;Against the Giants&amp;quot; series. The player characters must stand against the machinations of Gungir, self-styled Jarl of the Frost Giants, while simultaneously discovering what evil lurks within Gungir's ancestral home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Preview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a preview of one room within the Crumbling Hall of the Frost Giant Jarl:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. Kitchen (EL 9)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pair of torches starkly illuminates this kitchen. Serving trays lie piled about, dirty utensils are scattered around the floor, and the stench of old food lingers in the air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two everburning torches (one each in the southeast and northeast corners) illuminate the chamber. Any ogre or giant heading into the pantry (Area 6) takes one to help light that room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creatures: A middle-aged female frost giant named Grunhilde (the jarl's mother) works here as cook, along with two ogres. Grunhilde hates her son; instead, she treats all the ogre servants as her &amp;quot;children.&amp;quot; For their part, the ogres make poor servants (though Grunhilde loves them anyway) and take great fun in making the giants angry, then hiding behind Grunhilde's protection. They also enjoy tormenting the cryohydra in Area 7, pelting it with rocks, then darting away from its frost breath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grunhilde: Female frost giant; CR 9; Large giant (Cold); HD 14d8+70; hp 125; Init ?1; Spd 40 ft.; AC 8 (touch 8, flat-footed 8); Atk +9/ 4 ranged (1d6+9, rock); Face/Reach 5 ft. x 5 ft./10 ft.; SQ Cold subtype, darkvision 60 ft.; AL CE; SV Fort +14, Ref +3, Will +4; Str 28, Dex 8, Con 20, Int 11, Wis 11, Cha 12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skills and Feats: Climb +15, Hide ?5, Jump +15, Spot +6; Cleave, Great Cleave, Power Attack, Sunder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cold Subtype: Immune to cold damage; takes double damage from fire unless a saving throw for half damage is allowed, in which case it takes half damage on a success and double damage on a failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ogres (2): hp 26 each, see Monster Manual, page 144.
