							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sword for Hire: A Solo Dice Game</name>
									
			<description>Solitaire dice game of fantasy combat. It only requires pen, paper, and 3 regular dice. The player controls a fantasy hero who is attemtping to defeat mighty villains and monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Hero turn the player chooses to roll and reroll dice. The result of the dice forms a temporary pool of damage points. Certain combos grant special abilities, like double damage or parry.&lt;br/&gt;When the player chooses the Strike action, the total from the temporary damage pool is applied to one of the enemies. The Hero's turn is then over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player rolls a 1 for any reason, the attack is a miss, and there is no effect. The turn was wasted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next, the enemies attack - each in different ways depending on the scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player wins by defeating all monsters, and loses if the hero is killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
