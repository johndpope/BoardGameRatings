							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fancy Pants Adventures: World 3</name>
									
			<description>The third installment of The Fancy Pants Adventures was released on April 5, 2012. A beta edition was available before release at bornegames.com for anyone to test out. There also is a new character in this game and new enemies. In this installment, Fancy Pants Man's little sister, Cutie Pants Girl, is kidnapped and Fancy Pants Man has to save her. Borne has released some art for the new game and asked followers of his site for feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the elements in World 3 are:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Water-based levels and swimming.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The little sister of Fancy Pants Man named Cutie Pants (who wears a dress) is introduced. She has the ability to swing from ceilings using her pet cat, Kitten Kabootle. It is unknown whether or not she will be able to swim.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A longer, more complex plot involving pirates and ninjas.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Pencil combat. Fancy Pants Man will employ a pencil as he does in Newgrounds Rumble. There are different ways of attacks: the pencil and the kick.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Spin attack.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Improved animation, backgrounds, and moves (eg. the character will no longer fall off of wall jumps, just slide).&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Special rooms where you perform a string of move combos for points.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; New enemies including angry ducks, frogs, parrots bats, pirates, and ninjas.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Fancy Pants has a new ability to wall run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Fancy pants adventures&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
