							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stanford The Game</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a new student at Stanford. The object of the game is to graduate (by accumulating 180 or more units) and become the most successful. Success is measured by three different criteria: Final GPA, Social Stature, and Resume Stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players make a few decisions on paths to follow, but the game is largely dice rolling luck. Strategically little more advanced than Candyland or Chutes &amp;amp; Ladders. You do get to travel around a campus map. Probably ONLY of any interest to Stanford grads and fans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flimsy and shoddy components and construction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
