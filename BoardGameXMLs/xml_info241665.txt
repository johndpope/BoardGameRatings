			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;ゲット★スイートラブ (Get★Sweet Love) is a Japanese card game of match-making, but with somewhat adult themes and language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players are dealt hand cards and draw and play more cards through the game. There are four female character cards dealt face up on the table, and the players are girl-chasers, competing to win the 'best' one. But which woman is best is only determined at the finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players play hand cards against their chosen targets. These attribute cards have positive values for virtues, and negative values for bad behaviour. Some cards are played face-up, some face-down, so there is a strong element of bluffing in the game. Some attribute cards alter the rules as they are played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is very social and encourages table talk about the good or bad attributes. For example, during game play, players will talk up the virtues of one girl, and talk down the vices of another. &amp;quot;She is Born Rich! That's 6 points! I'm after her.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;But she's also a Money-Waster. -8 points. Are you sure you want her? hehehe.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You know what? This girl is so Gentle and Kind and worth 8 points!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Poor you. You might have not known, but actually, she is a B*tch. -6 points!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Oh no, she's a B*tch and also likes Kinky Sex? Oh my oh my...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players also put secret tokens on the female cards, to show their likes or dislikes. After the cards have been played, the players must 'Express Love' by simultaneously pointing at the woman they chose. If only player chooses one woman, they get her. If more than player points at one woman, the player with the highest token wins her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then all the attribute cards are flipped and the value of the different women is calculated. The player who picked the best woman, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two Versions of the game, this original edition is themed on men trying to get the best girlfriend. There is another edition with the genders swapped, and the women are trying to get the best boyfriend - ゲット★スマートラブ (Get★Smart Love). Whilst the games are very similar, there are differences in the special cards which affect the gameplay. With both editions, you can combine and play an 8 player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game name has a couple of twists. The English name can be abbreviated to Ge★S Love, which for Japanese readers equates to 'guess love', trying to guess which girl to choose. But the name ゲスラブ in Japanese, has the word ゲス in it, which is used in many vulgar or even obscene words in Japanese. So the publisher is deliberately signalling to buyers that the game is for adults but still sociable, since the girl-chasers will be nice to some girls, and not so nice to others. This version has gone through ten reprints in Japan and always draws a crowd at game shows, with its risque design (by Japanese standards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's summary&lt;br/&gt;グループ交際の中で相手の女性に様々な『属性』を付与し&lt;br/&gt;最も点数の高い女性を恋人にした人が勝利。&lt;br/&gt;通称ゲスラブ（Guess Love）&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get★Smart Loveと混ぜて1名～8名で遊ぶ事も可能。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
