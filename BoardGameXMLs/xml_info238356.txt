			<description>A simple roll and move game where a two players play against each other to score the most runs before losing all 10 batsmen in cricket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To score a player rolls a die to see where the bowler has pitched the ball. A roll of 3 will automatically dismiss the batsman as bowled. Other numbers show the player has hit the ball to various parts of the playing field. A second roll of the die is then required to move the struck ball to its field location. This may result in a score (as runs) or dismissal in various ways (caught, run out, stumped or L.B.W).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The batting team continues to amass a score until all 10 wickets have fallen. This is their final score which then the other player must try to surpass to win the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board appears to be have been slightly modified over time with at least 3 versions showing minor changes is the players outfit, their fielding positions and postures, the title and the grandstand in the background. The national logo was also absent in the later versions, with just Made in Australia printed on the board&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally copyrighted 1913. The later versions were most likely produced around the 1930s and the 1950s based on the cricketers outfits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
