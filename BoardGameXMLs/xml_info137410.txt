			<description>In Potarutomm, each of four players is dealt 13 cards.  Using that hand of cards, you must bet on, and play 5 minigames of [mostly] traditional card games, in the following order:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Poker &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;Select your own hand for 5-card stud.  You get to take 2 of these back into your hand for the next minigame; the other 3 are your personal discard.&lt;br/&gt;     Target Trick &amp;mdash; The loser of Poker picks trump from his 3 discards.  Pick 5 cards for this minigame, and put the other 5 in your personal discard.  Everyone chooses a goal, and you play 5 tricks.  The cards played in this minigame are out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;     Rummy &amp;mdash; Play with the 8 cards from your discard.  Any cards you play on opponents' displays become theirs for the next minigames.&lt;br/&gt;     Twenty-One &amp;mdash; Shuffle the cards you have after the previous minigame, and be your own dealer for blackjack.  Revealed cards go to a common discard.&lt;br/&gt;     Mau-Mau &amp;mdash; For this bet, you're all in: Whatever money you have at this point, you bet.  Your leftover cards from the prior minigame are your hand, and the common discard becomes a central deck.  Play crazy eights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The highest cumulative score wins!  All of this is supported by a points track that wraps around a playfield with rules for the minigames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Components Required&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1 set of rummy cards, without jokers (i.e. 52 cards)&lt;br/&gt;     60 coins/cubes/chips to act as money&lt;br/&gt;     2 playing pieces for each player&lt;br/&gt;         blue&lt;br/&gt;         red&lt;br/&gt;         green&lt;br/&gt;         yellow&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
