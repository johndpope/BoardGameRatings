			<description>From LateForTheSky.com:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FRIENDLY, LOYAL, STRONG-WILLED, ENERGETIC,&lt;br/&gt;MEET THE WESTIE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With BIG personality, the West Highland Terrier is a bold and energetic little dog with absolutely no idea of its true size!  More commonly called the &amp;quot;Westie&amp;quot;, the breed is known for its friendly, strong-willed character and remarkably bright white coat.  Westies were bred in Scotland and used to seek and dig out foxes and badgers.  They love their two-legged companions and are generally willing to please them... as long as they think it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea!  To be fair, this is a dog bred for tenacity and if dealt with firmly and lovingly, a Westie makes an affectionate addition to any family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WESTIE-OPOLY IS A GAME OF TAIL-WAGGING FUN!&lt;br/&gt;COLLECT YOUR FAVORITE WESTIES AND PLAY HARD!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increase your rent by buying Toys for your dogs and upgrading them to Big Bones.  Sounds easy enough until you get fleas, have an accident on the carpet, or worse yet, get sent to the kennel!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GRAB YOUR TOKEN AND ADVANCE TO GO WESTIES!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who knows!  You may soon be Best in Show... or running with a pack of Westies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
