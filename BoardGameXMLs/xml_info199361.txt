							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Swords &amp; Soldiers II</name>
									
			<description>Swords &amp;amp; Soldiers II is a 2D sidescrolling strategy game exclusively available on the eShop for Nintendo Wii U.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Follow Viking Chieftain Redbeard in an adventure that takes him across the globe (from the snowy peaks of Redbeard&amp;rsquo;s homeland to the Netherworld and the even more demonic party island Barbeardos), and pits him against the all-new Demon Horde and Persian Army factions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world needs some serious savin&amp;rsquo;, and it looks like the meatloving Redbeard and his local Kebab salesman Al&amp;rsquo;Yucaneet have an important part to play in events to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Swords &amp;amp; Soldiers II, Ronimo Games seeks to create a serious strategy title in a not-so-serious setting. Don't let the cartoony visuals fool you - this is a challenging game, and playing it against other players in the local multiplayer mode will result in some serious competition. For younger players and users looking for a more casual experience, the game comes with an optional 'Easy Mode'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
