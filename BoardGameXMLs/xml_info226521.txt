			<description>Consists of 8 square cards printed on one side with an &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; and on the other side with a &amp;ldquo;+&amp;rdquo;. Three of the cards are printed in blue, two in black and three in red. The cards are arranged in a 9 X 9 configuration with the red cards in the upper horizontal row, the black cards in two of the three positions in the middle row and the blue cards in the bottom row. The number and placement of cards marked &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; or  &amp;ldquo;+&amp;rdquo; may be random or deliberate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to move the blue cards to the upper horizontal row and the red cards to the bottom row in the fewest possible moves.

The cards displaying a &amp;ldquo;+&amp;rdquo; may be moved only horizontally or vertically to an unoccupied space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game may be played as a solitaire or with two or more experienced players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
