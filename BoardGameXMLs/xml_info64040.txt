							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Den of Evil Room Set</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;Only 1,500 castings of this limited-edition set will be made, and each set comes with a signed and numbered Certificate of Authenticity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Den of Evil Room Set is the third set in the Den of Evil line, and it will allow collectors to set up some exciting large rooms. It contains 37 pieces, with 19 never before seen pieces in any Den of Evil set. This is designed to work perfectly on its own -- or with the other two DoE sets: The Den of Evil (Room and Passage) Set and the Den of Evil (Wicked Additions) Set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;x2 New 6&amp;quot; Long Walls w/black gem&lt;br/&gt;x1 New Book (mysterious, evil, blood-red tome)&lt;br/&gt;x2 New Fire Pot (pot and flame separated)&lt;br/&gt;x6 New Straight Wall (2 kinds) w/stars&lt;br/&gt;x4 New Floor with Tentacles&lt;br/&gt;x4 New Corner Wall w/stars&lt;br/&gt;x4 Straight Wall&lt;br/&gt;x6 Floor&lt;br/&gt;x6 Corner Walls&lt;br/&gt;x2 Doors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the set contains some totally new items like the 6&amp;quot; Long Walls and the Fire Pots, the 14 new standard room pieces were designed to be subtly different than their DoE Room and Passage counterparts. For instance, instead of just a normal Straight Wall piece, there are two new designs for the 6 new Straight Wall pieces which show that some of the bricks have fallen away to decay -- and that some arcane realm lays beyond them. These new pieces can easily be used with their standard counterparts -- as their subtle difference is not readily apparent. They work very well together to make an unique gaming environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the other two Den of Evil sets, this set is a limited-edition set of 1,500 castings. Each set will come with a signed Certificate of Authenticity, and the lowest numbers will be awarded in the order as they are placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
