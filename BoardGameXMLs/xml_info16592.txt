			<description>Objective:  To collect five neighborhood place cards depicting places shown on a neighborhood map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:  Each player selects a neighborhood map card and holds it in his or her hand.  The remaining map cards are set aside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dealer shuffles the neighborhood place cards and deals five cards face-down to each player.  The remaining cards in the deck are placed face-down in a pile.  The dealer draws the top card and lays it face-up to begin the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player picks up a card from either the deck or the discard pile.  If the card matches an item on his or her neighborhood map card, the player keeps the card and discards an unwanted card.  If the card does not match, the player places it face-up on the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns picking up and discarding cards.  When all cards have been drawn from the deck, the discard pile is reshuffled to start a new pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect five of the places displayed on his or her neighborhood map card wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
