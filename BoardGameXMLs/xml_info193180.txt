							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quick Slick Deadly</name>
									
			<description>Fly through space and overcome a variety of enemies and obstacles as one of three different classes.&lt;br/&gt;As the Fighter, you&amp;rsquo;ll fire a weapon that although very weak covers an increasingly larger area if you continue to destroy your enemies. You&amp;rsquo;ll also be able to copy the attacks of your enemies by destroying three of a kind in a row!&lt;br/&gt;As the Survivor, you&amp;rsquo;ll gain energy by daring to get close to enemy attacks. You could use this energy to either block attacks or wait for maximum energy to perform a screen-filling attack. If you manage to reach a high speed, your ship enters ghost-mode and becomes invincible!&lt;br/&gt;As the Trickster, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to perform various risky maneuvers to unleash powerful attacks. Wield a boomerang that is deadly to your enemies but takes away your control over your ship. Use energy to inflict great damage that returns enemy attack damage right back at them! If you have enough speed you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to destroy your foes by simply crashing into them!&lt;br/&gt;Learn to master Quick Slick Deadly through step-by-step missions and then show off the hardcore gamer within you with your perfected high-scores and excellent completion times. Are you ready to face a challenge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
