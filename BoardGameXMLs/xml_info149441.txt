							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DreadBall: Shan-meeg Starhawks</name>
									
			<description>The Starhawks are Asterians, the mysterious humanoid aliens that have the suspicion of many within the Corporate worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team rules stat them as fast movers on the pitch while  simultaneously making them fragile; their armor checks are harder for them to make if they are possibly injured.  They also have special rules that allow them to attempt to trick the referees into punishing the other team by faking fouls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The base team includes:&lt;br/&gt;3 Jacks&lt;br/&gt;1 Guard&lt;br/&gt;4 Strikers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Starhawks see themselves as clearly superior to the average DreadBall team, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they aren&amp;rsquo;t above bending the rules &amp;ndash; or just cheating! &amp;ndash; to gain any advantage possible&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
