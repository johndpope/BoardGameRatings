							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">2018: The War for Hell</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Last Book in the &amp;quot;Hot Chicks&amp;quot; Line!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things got bad for humanity in 2015; Aliens, Demons, and Human Greed threatened to put all of mankind of the dinner plate.  Only those brave enough to take up arms and fight for the future and destiny of all mankind have stood between humanity and total horrific exploitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2018, the stakes get higher.  Alien spacecraft rain from the sky and the powers that be discover that the threats to the Earth now threaten all of existence and reality itself.  The very structures of the Universe are threatened, and there's only one thing to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there's going to be a tomorrow, then the adventurers of the Earth must band together with their most hated enemies and make a stand in Hell itself.  It's all or nothing; defeat a horrible enemy that will stop at nothing to end the Universe, or say goodbye to existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One thing's for sure; either way, this is going to be EPIC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book brings the product line of Hot Chicks: The Roleplaying game to an end, but not the story.  If all goes well, and there IS a tomorrow, then it will be time to take up the battle for the Future and Destiny of mankind in the near future.  Will YOUR Hot Chicks Characters be able to stand up and say they fought the War in Hell to make way for the future of Destiny 2025?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
