							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Amar Role-Playing Game</name>
									
			<description>From the front &amp;quot;page&amp;quot;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is the result of more than 33 years of development and play testing. Its forerunner, The Mega Role-Playing System (Fantasy Edition) was published in the UK in 1987 and aimed to be the most realistic RPG. The target audience was seasoned RPG players. An RPG simulating real life was bound to be quite complicated and thus cumbersome. The developers (Geir Isene and Bent Brakas) decided to cut down and simplify the rule system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While still maintaining a high degree of realism, the rules were simplified and simplified and simplified. Until the rules themselves were only a small fraction of Mega. The system is now one of the simplest yet most realistic. The Amar RPG uses only a 6 sided dice (d6) for determining outcomes of risky events. It is easily learned by the Game Master in an evening. The players catch on in an hour or two. No sweat. Just pure role-playing fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
