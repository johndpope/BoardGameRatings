			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The War may be over, but there're still plenty of bad people looking to do bad things, and they don't seem to need war as an excuse to come after their fellow man neither. Some folk will happily turn out a bunch of orphans to make themselves a few coins. Buzzard Lake is one such fella, but like all men he's got a weakness. He don't like to lose. That's where you and your crew come in. Lake needs to learn what second place feels like, and you're gonna to teach him. You might even save some orphans in the bargain if he don't kill you first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shooting Fish is presented by Andrew Peregrine with illustrations by Jennifer Rodgers. This Episode is part of the Echoes of War role-playing adventure series, which is centered on a common theme: the Unification War.
