			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quite, Indubitably is a friendly and somewhat hybridized role-playing game of imaginative dexterity and excessive competitive verbosity &amp;ndash; that is to say, a game where you will need to be able to out-talk your fellow players, while being able to bring into play a variety of vocabulary that don&amp;rsquo;t enter usage much anymore. Think of it as a strange mix between The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen, Munchkin, and Apples to Apples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game requires a standard pack of French playing cards, sets of custom cards (provided as print-and-play components in the document), and a large number of d4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
