							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Two Pipers</name>
									
			<description>extracted from the Game Cabinet listing for the rules for this game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a strategy game with simple rules. The complexity of play could be compared to that of checkers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game requires a standard checker board and eighteen markers for the game. A set of markers for one player consists of a PIPER and eight creatures. You'll need two sets, one for each player, in different colors. The creatures' markers are two-sided. One side of the marker shows the creature asleep, and the other shows it attacking. Not surprisingly, these creatures are referred to as &amp;quot;SLEEPERS&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ATTACKERS&amp;quot; depending on which side is up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Object&lt;br/&gt;Be the first to move your PIPER across the swamp or to eliminate your opponent's PIPER.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning the Game&lt;br/&gt;If a player manages to get his or her PIPER across the swamp to the land where the opponent started, that player wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player also wins if he or she eliminates the PIPER belonging to the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For purposes of winning, it is assumed that both PIPERS could stand on one of the land squares at the same time. In other words, a player can't prevent a win by planting his PIPER on the land and refusing to move it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
