			<description>Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge is a 2012 action-adventure video game developed by Team Ninja and originally published by Nintendo for the Wii U and subsequently released by Tecmo Koei for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2013. It is an enhanced port of Ninja Gaiden 3 that includes all downloadable content from the original title, as well as additional enhancements made to improve the game. The game can be considered an equivalent to the Ninja Gaiden Sigma games, as it enhances the original title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many gameplay elements from Ninja Gaiden 2 were borrowed and implemented in Razor's Edge, while some elements from the original Ninja Gaiden 3 were discarded or completely remade, such as Steel on Bone being a grab counter chain and no longer requiring button spam, and the Kunai Climbing being much faster and easier to perform. Many other gameplay mechanics from Ninja Gaiden II were implemented in Razor's Edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional features include new exclusive weapons such as the Lunar Staff, Kusarigama and Dual Katanas, improved AI, and new enemy types, new battle areas and alternative costumes. The &amp;quot;Karma Counter&amp;quot; from previous games was bought back, now with enhanced features and bonuses. An upgrade menu will be implemented, and will allow players to spend their Karma points to enhance their weapons, Ninpo spells, and character traits, such as health bar length and special moves.&lt;br/&gt;The game features online cooperative gameplay mode, with new playable characters, such as the female ninja Ayane, was revealed in a preview of the game at the Nintendo of America Wii U press conference in New York. She has her own set of moves, similar to her Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 iteration, with additional cutscenes produced for her added role. A new Chapter Challenge mode allows the player to control Ayane, as well additional DLC characters, Kasumi and Momiji, in any part of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
