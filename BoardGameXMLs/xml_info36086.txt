			<description>&amp;ldquo;Players take the roles of rival Noble Houses in a war to control a neutral space sector.&amp;rdquo; The object of the game is to be the first player to control every planet on the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 10x10 hex grid, with the Homeworlds located in the corners. The other 20 planets are randomly distributed by rolling 10 sided dice to determine coordinates. All of the planets and Homeworlds are named and rated for type, income produced, and combat units available on the planet. Each player begins with identical forces, including randomly determined allies. The allies represent galactic powers that provide certain bonuses, units, or special capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
