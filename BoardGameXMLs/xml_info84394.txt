			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        There are monsters beneath the earth. You cannot fight them. You cannot run from them. And they are closer than you think. In a forgotten corner of Northern England, between the rolling hills and tranquil dales nestles a village plagued by terrible secrets and subterranean horrors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every 119 years the village of Manesty is torn apart, its inhabitants massacred. It happened in 1697. It happened in 1816. Now it&amp;rsquo;s 1935 and horrific events have been set in motion. Swimming through the soil beneath the village are loathsome creatures waiting, impatiently, to rise above the earth and reclaim the land they believe is theirs and kill anyone who stands in their way, including the Investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, as with all the best Mythos adventures, not all is as it seems. The Investigators must uncover the mystery that has killed many and doomed others in the tiny village while struggling to keep their lives and the last vestiges of their sanity intact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
