			<description>This is a tile-laying abstract, where the goal is to score the most points.  This is done by placing tiles that are made up of squares so that they:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Touch one of your previously played pieces (first turn, rule waived)&lt;br/&gt;2) Touch as many of your opponents squares as possible&lt;br/&gt;3) Close off small 1-2 square areas (optional for extra points)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players, after placing a piece, get one point for square they touch on an opponents piece and 1 or 2 points for each sealed empty area.  Player with the most points once each player has played 13 pieces wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a solitaire version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
