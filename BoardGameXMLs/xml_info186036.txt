			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player Handbook was published in final format as &amp;quot;Release 5.1&amp;quot;.  This was provided as fifteen ZIP archives of WordPerfect format files.  This same edition of the book was released in RTF and PostScript formats as well as in ASCII text format.  Numerous prior editions of the book exist in various formats.  A later single ZIP archive gathered all WordPerfect files into a single download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player Handbook was intended to provide a generic, universal framework for gaming in nearly any genre but retains much of the fantasy genre with which it originally was designed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The handbook primarily is focused on character creation and related information, including sections on economics, psionics, spells (extensive), deities, religion, and equipment.  Characters select a Race and other demographics, including Age, Quirks, Phobias, Outlooks, History, and so forth.  Characters have Attributes (Agility, Coordination, Dexterity, Education, Endurance, Health, Intuition, Learning Ability, Magic Affinity, Observation, Perception, Strength, and Willpower), each with an Attribute Score (2-11) purchased from a point pool.  Characters also have Skills, drawn from several Skill groups.  Combat is resolved through Skill use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
