			<description>Players play Vikings chieftains, seeking to develop their own territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player uses his own deck of cards (preconstructed or drafted). The deck includes Location, Unit and Treasure cards. Location and Unit cards are placed in the territory when played. Treasure cards provide an immediate effect and are then discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Common Location cards are placed in the center of the table and &lt;br/&gt;can be used by all players. Unit cards can use them to collect resources, become first player, gain Victory Points, launch Expeditions agains the other players, ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning, the players only have their Patriarch. By expanding their territory with Location and Unit cards, they will be able to perform more actions. Playing cards and restoring Units requires resources and these are scarce as players compete for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, players tally their points: VP gained during the game plus 1 or 2 VP per card in their territory (2 if the Patriarch became King).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who won the most Victory Points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game box provides all components to play a 2 to 4-player game. It contains 20 rare cards out of 40.&lt;br/&gt;Booster packs sold separately provide 16 common cards and 5 rare cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
