							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gateway Section 02</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a full-color, 40 x 30 Battlemap of a Gate Room, with Hex, Square and No Overlays. The Zip file contains a 360 degree view from the centre of the bay and also includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;ve been gone quite a while; I&amp;rsquo;ve readied a second team for an extraction mission. Wait the gateway is opening up&amp;mdash; indicates humans&amp;hellip;but that isn&amp;rsquo;t them! Take cover! &amp;ldquo;&amp;mdash;Lieutenant Browden&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gateway Section 02 is a single level interior map of a science fiction room with a center gateway on the ground floor with a surrounding walkway on the second floor. Gateway Section 02 includes a 360-degree panoramic view from the center west circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gateway Section 02 is intended for use in near or far-future science fiction or horror settings. It could also be used in a modern setting as a secret high-tech facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They Came from a World Beyond: The engineers at Besek Labs have created a functional gateway that can be connected to another world. Besek Labs has sent some of its security forces on an expeditionary mission. When they did not return on time, Lieutenant Browden had a second team prepped for an extraction mission, the player characters and some of his best men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As they prepare to open the gate, the gate opens on its own and instead of the return of their scouts, humans pour out of the gate in powered armor with a helmet having a prominent beak and feathered decoration, and razor sharp talons. Some of them are armed with weapons captured from the scout force. They fight poorly with the captured weapons, but are absolutely deadly in melee combat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters have to try and survive the onslaught of these strange warriors to successfully defend Gateway Section 02. If they can capture one of them, they remove his helmet to reveal a reddish-brown skinned man. He speaks a dialect of Nahuatl when interrogated with no trace of Spanish or Latin influence. If the group can learn the language or force the captive to learn their native language they may be able to use him as a guide in the other world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group may decide to enter the portal and bring their captive(s) with them. If they do, they enter a world at war&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
