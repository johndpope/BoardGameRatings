							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Musketeer Skirmish</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Board &amp;amp; card game for 2 players. Melee between the 3 musketeers and a handful of the Cardinal's bodyguards. Abstract skirmish level combat. Each figure (unit) represents a single man. Victory: Eliminate your opponents completely.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chessboard or any other 8x8 grid. Miniatures or counters are used to represent the combatants. Athos, Porthos and Aramis face off against a Captaion of the Cardinal's Guard and seven Guards. A custom deck of cards is central to the play of the game. The players draw hands of cards from the shared deck. Card play determines when units may move, attack, and defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An optional scenario provides for adding D'Artagnan as a fourth musketeer and three additional Cardinal's Guards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
