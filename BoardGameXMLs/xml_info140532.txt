							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Movie Bite</name>
									
			<description>It is a survival horror dungeon crawl adventure. Each player takes on a role as a cliche movie trope and tries to survive and evening filled with Zombies, Vampires and Werewolves. Players must collect items, deal with their quirks and try not to turn into the monsters that they are running away from. Of course, if they do they will gladly turn and try to kill their former partners&amp;hellip; gotta love contagious disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an action point based game where players move their characters toward the exit. Players must decide if they should search rooms for items, flee, or fight the monsters. Monsters move and attack based on specialized dice. As players take damage they become more likely to turn into a monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players earn victory points by killing monsters, revealing rooms, and achieving objectives on their quirk cards. Players who have died still can earn victory points by killing other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
