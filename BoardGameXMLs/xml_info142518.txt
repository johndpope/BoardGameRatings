			<description>'Hijack the Revolt is a quick game of calculated risk, cooperation and backstabbing for three players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout history rulers have treated their subjects badly enough for the populous to rise up against them. Though joined momentarily in their common effort to overthrow the tyrant, the rebellious forces are comprised of factions having different visions of what their new country should be. Only one of those ideals will win out, and only then if they can remain united long enough to make their rebellion a success and avoid execution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hijack the Revolt is a cooperative game, up to a point. In this game of urban warfare there are four objectives which the three rebels must take before the Dictator sends reinforcement. They are Communications,  Munitions,  Airport, Presidential Palace. The game proceeds by each player in their turn playing a road taking tile to move them forward. You  have farther to go than the Dictator who advances automatically at the end of each turn. The only way to take an Objective is to coordinate your assault as you advance block by hard won block  But only one of you can win each round. When is the timing right for striking out on your own?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the game Risk boiled down to its most excruciating 20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
