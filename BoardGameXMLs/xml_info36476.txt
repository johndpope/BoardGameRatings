			<description>This is a (relatively) straightforward card battle game that includes a pun (or two).  The &amp;quot;fighter&amp;quot; cards that battle are futuristic spaceships called &amp;quot;Multi-dimension Attack Ships&amp;quot; (M*A*S), yeah, you can say &amp;quot;mass.&amp;quot;  There are cards that destroy an opponent's M*A*S.  That card is called, of course, a &amp;quot;Weapon of M*A*S Destruction&amp;quot; (we warned you).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is a very powerful card, so before you are allowed to play it, you must announce it.  If opponent has a Search card, he gets to search some of your cards to try to find it and remove it.  The search card is called, of course, a &amp;quot;Search for Weapon of M*A*S Destruction&amp;quot; card. Cute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The search mechanics are interesting.  Players play to win battles and gain Respect Points.  When you find Weapons of M*A*S Destruction, you might gain respect (depending on which search card you have).  When you don't find Weapons of M*A*S Destruction (depending on the card) you could &amp;quot;lose all your Respect.&amp;quot;  (ok, no more puns).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns attacking, choosing between 3 types of attacks.  Each  card has a &amp;quot;weak spot&amp;quot; on it.  During one phase of the game players try to name the weak spot of opponent's M*A*S -- If they do it is destroyed.  (These &amp;quot;shots&amp;quot; at opponent's cards are called &amp;quot;long shots&amp;quot;).   Battles are usually &amp;quot;2 on 2&amp;quot; with extra &amp;quot;destroy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;search&amp;quot; cards.  Cards are awarded to each player based on rules, mostly &amp;quot;who won the attack?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a Draw Phase, a &amp;quot;Deploy &amp;amp; Destroy phase&amp;quot; a &amp;quot;Long Shot&amp;quot; Phase, and an&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Attack&amp;quot; Phase.  After the Draw Phase, each of the 3 remaing phases provides &lt;br/&gt;interesting and different types of action. (See 'more info' below).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 to 6 players, best with 2 to 5 singles or teams of 2 or 3.  64 cards + instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
