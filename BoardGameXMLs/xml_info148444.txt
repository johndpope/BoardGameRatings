							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Five Ancient Kingdoms Volume 1: Men and Mettle</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;It is an Age of Wonders! BARICA is the greatest land in all the world and BAGDABHA its greatest city! Here, the common people mingle with wealthy merchants and sultans in disguise, while heroes and saints rub shoulders with magicians and thieves! All praise to almighty HALAH, God most high!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FIVE ANCIENT KINGDOMS is a set of rules for a fantasy adventure game. It is divided into three volumes: Men &amp;amp; Mettle, Magic &amp;amp; Monsters, and Dragon Master Secrets. You will need several six-&amp;shy;‚Äêsided dice and at least one other person to play. Unlike some games, there is no board or playing pieces; instead, game play takes place in the minds and imaginations of the participants as they describe their actions and determine the events of the imaginary game world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;This is the one volume in a three volume set for the core rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
