			<description>Race against the clock to form as many words as possible by adding vowels and consonants to letter cards. Earn points for only those words that have not been written down by any other player AND include, in any order, ALL three consonants in play on the Letter Pot Board. The longer the word, the more points won. At the first sighting of an Oh Bleep! Card, be the first to shout, &amp;ldquo;Oh Bleep!&amp;rdquo; and gain advantages over other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh Bleep! is not your grandpappy's word game. Select one of three game-play options: (1) Zany, (2) Brainy, or (3) Bleepin' Crazy (combining both types of challenges). Depending upon the game selected, be prepared to perform comical, daring physical feats and/ or overcome brain-busting challenges. But watch out! Don't let yourself be distracted from your word-creating, opponent crushing goal. After all, only the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
