			<description>Bozo's Night Out is an action computer game developed and published by Taskset Ltd. in 1984 for the Commodore 64. The game centers around Bozo, a drunkard trying to get home safely after spending a night at a bar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bozo can run into many obstacles on his journey home; he can fall into trap doors, get caught by the police, run into people, and even run into ghosts and dragons. If Bozo can successfully get home, he drinks five more pints the next night at his bar &amp;quot;The Gibbons&amp;quot; and this process repeats until the Bozo reaches 60 pints. As Bozo drinks, the controls get looser and he starts to see &amp;quot;red elephants&amp;quot;. If Bozo cannot successfully get home he loses 1-5 pints, and the game starts over if Bozo runs out of his pints of drunkenness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bozo%27s_Night_Out,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bozo%27s_Night_Out,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
