							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Curse of Doomspire</name>
									
			<description>From the website&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Cursed! The legendary castles of Noble Lords and Ladies were all built by a power whose shadow has taken the shape of an ancient curse, a single Lord, the master of a castle which is said to exist only in nightmares . . . or does it? You would hope so, as these Nobles wish you to find the one strongest in their blood, Lady Rachael Vandragon, whose marriage can purify them all of the darkness. Guided only by fear, folklore and a stranger whose name echoes from the depths of your nightmares, Claus Vondream, you soon find yourself on a bent road through a realm where good and evil all wear masks, where nothing is as it seems, where virtue and villainy are indeed but masks in a dream. This road ultimately leads back to its beginning, as does any circle of time and fate, or of doom, for a marriage must take place between good and evil. This marriage is the dream of Doomspire...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
