			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So You Think You Can Steal?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyone with a few ranks in Sleight of Hand can be a pick-pocket, and it only takes a cudgel to be a mugger, but there is another class of thief as well, the cr&amp;egrave;me-de-la-cr&amp;egrave;me of crime, which has stolen hearts and captivated imaginations for hundreds of years: the gentleman thief. These princes of the night possess great cunning and guile, and prefer to outwit their opponents, instead of overpower them. They are also gifted with great charm, which allows them to win over the hearts of even those they steal from. Despite their crimes, it&amp;rsquo;s often all but impossible not to sympathize and secretly root for these dastardly scoundrels, and many are considered heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to be the best, though, and the role of gentleman thief is a hard one to play. That&amp;rsquo;s where Character Guides: The Gentleman Thief comes in. This book examines the archetype of the gentleman thief, providing perspective on what truly makes them what they are, and how you can go about making a memorable and effective gentleman thief character for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game or the 3.5 OGL, both from the perspective of roleplaying advice and information, and more mechanical angles, such as what feats, magic items, and so on will lend themselves best to well-prepared cat burglar, and a brand new prestige class specifically for those who want to be a gentleman thief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the book provides GMs with a wealth of information about running games involving gentleman thieves, with a close look at some of the more common difficulties that these types of characters can cause in an adventuring party, and how to resolve them, as well as advice on how to best support gentleman thief characters by providing them with ways to put their persona to good use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
