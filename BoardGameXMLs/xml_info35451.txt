			<description>Numbered counters valued 1 - 4 are placed upside down on the gameboard. From the middle of the board a pawn is moved according to the number of squares mentioned on the start counter.  An even number makes the pawn land on on counter, an uneven number lets the pawn get next to a counter. The start counter can be removed from the board and is the first gain of the first player. When the pawn lands on a counter, it is turned upside down, then the pawn is placed upon it, so the number becomes invisible. The player must name the right number in his next turn. When he is right the player may take the counter as a win, when wrong he loses a turn. When there are no more counters that can be gained in one turn, the game ends and the player having acquired the highest total when adding the number of the counters won, is the winner of Zipher.&lt;br/&gt;NB the game is a 3 player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
