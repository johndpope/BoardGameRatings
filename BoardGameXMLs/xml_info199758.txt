							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">d66 Compendium 2</name>
									
			<description>'From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As I mentioned in the introduction to the d66 Compendium, the idea for our d66 list series originally came from the Ultimate Toolbox from AEG, which I helped write. However, space limitations required that I cut some details. The first list of names I wrote for a roleplaying game came years before then. While running a Star Wars game (WEG d6, 2nd Edition), I had to come up with a planet name in a hurry, and I named it &amp;ldquo;Yaffa&amp;rdquo; after the blocks, because it was on a commercial the group saw before playing the game. Afterwards, one of the players suggested I write a list of names of people and planets so I would not have to think of one in the moment. That is a trick I have used in every game I have run since. So, the first D66 lists I published were lists that I created for my own use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No matter what edition of Traveller you play, this book is ideal for it. Additionally, this book can help you beyond the Traveller Roleplaying Game, in any science fiction roleplaying game. Anytime you need ship names, details on where a criminal is hiding, strange names for aliens that are easy to pronounce, or reasons for a planet-wide quarantine, this book will be right there to help you. Be sure to tell not only your friends that play Traveller, but also any fans of sci-fi roleplaying games you know, about the D66 Compendium 2 and the d66  Compendium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
