							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ancient Committee is an Emo Band</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game utilizes a standard deck of French playing cards as well as a second deck of forty &amp;quot;Emo Cards&amp;quot;.  The &amp;quot;Emo Cards&amp;quot; can easily be created from index cards using data provided for that purpose in the document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have characters that are band members in an emo band.  Humorously, the game allows for any number of player changes between session of the campaign, as long as at least one &amp;quot;original member&amp;quot; of the band (e.g., one of the players from the first, founding session) plays in each game session.  Characters are generated by drawing &amp;quot;Merit&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Flaw&amp;quot; cards from the &amp;quot;Emo Cards&amp;quot; deck.  The play is driven by the French playing cards and takes place over ten sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game setting, structure, and processes are quite unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
