			<description>After Burner III is a video game released for the FM-Towns home computer in Japan and later ported to the Sega Mega-CD in Japan, Europe and North America. It is the third game in the After Burner series, and a port of Strike Fighter, a game released for Japanese arcades, itself a sequel to G-LOC: Air Battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game again has the player flying the F-14 Tomcat, with the same weapons as before. Headquarters has informed you that &amp;quot;the enemy&amp;quot; (which the game's introduction does not identify) is reported to be building airfields and bases throughout the desert. Your mission is to take out those bases, and if you get rid of a few enemy planes in the process, &amp;quot;so much the better&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After Burner III differs from After Burner II significantly. Several new cinematic sequences are featured in the game. The &amp;quot;rolling mode&amp;quot; in the game is now optional. Also, two selectable in-game views are available from the main menu. The first view is the game's default, which is &amp;quot;cockpit&amp;quot;. This gives you a view similar to that of common flight simulators. The second type of view available is &amp;quot;back&amp;quot;, which is similar to the After Burner II arcade game. However, the &amp;quot;back&amp;quot; option has the rear of the plane obstructing the view of the targets that your vulcan cannons and missiles are supposed to shoot at.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another difference in After Burner III is the music. There are a number of new tunes, along with altered versions of After Burner II'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;After Burner III&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
