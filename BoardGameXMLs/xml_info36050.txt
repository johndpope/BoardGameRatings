							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goblin Quest</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Teams of Goblins run around, get into mischief, wreak havoc, and try to not get killed. Not unlike Space Scouts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played using a custom deck containing four types of cards: Mission, Threat, Mishap, and Aid. Each player starts with four Goblin characters, each of which has two to three skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first player to accumulate a specific number of Victory Points. Victory Points are gained by completing Missions (the amount awarded depending on the difficulty) and overcoming Threats. Victory Points may be spent to give your Goblin characters new skills and to replace a Goblin character than has been lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
