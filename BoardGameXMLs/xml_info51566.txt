							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dungeon of Kubla Khan</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction on page 3:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Hidden in an extra-dimensional space somewhere between Hell and Earth exists the infamous prison known as the Dungeon of Kubla Khan. It is in this place that the dread warlord has locked away those prisoners whom he desires to hold for ransom, and those foes who deserve the suffering his torturers would heap upon their flesh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the hundreds of thousands of poor souls which Kubla Khan has left beheaded or impaled in the wake of his ultra-dimensional conquests, these prisoners hold some covetous power to the Monarch of War. Some would claim that their torture and ransom insure his space as Demigod of Battles. It is suspected that their ultimate sacrifice at the hands of his executioner priests will grant his ascension to the upper tier of deities where he promises his worshippers to be the true Harbinger of Armageddon. All that is required, it seems, is the capture and sacrifice of the recent plunderers of his ancient tomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately for the Khan&amp;rsquo;s great plans, a recent prisoner Ulsier has escaped his jailors and flung wide the prison doors. There is a great prison revolt is in progress which threatens to erupt into the upper reaches. Riots are common within the Dungeon of Kubla Khan, usually brutally subdued by the Khan&amp;rsquo;s guardians. Menoshash the warden of the Dungeon of Kubla Khan, and Giarlock the Khan&amp;rsquo;s loyal executioner have kept this escalating situation secret&lt;br/&gt;from their master for fear that they may find themselves interred with others who have disobeyed the Monarch of War.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
