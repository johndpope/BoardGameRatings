			<description>From the instruction manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galactic Adventures is a science fiction role-playing game and adventuring system. You start out with a single character (from one of seven regular species), and can add up to 9 additional, individually defined followers. All characters start in their home system, Star Date 2918.1, with a Transport Cyborg and 30,000 Frilbees (the standard interstellar currency). Armed with this basic stake, and a few weapon and advanced skills, the player guides their character through life in the interstellar society of the 30th century. This life, at first, consists primarily of meetings with an ever-changing variety of your fellow creatures, including some very strange ones. These meetings are your source for money (job offers and seffing rare items), skill advancement (job offers and RNA tabs) and, most importantly, fellow adventurers. You can get followers by hiring them from the creatures you meet or by buying a special species, for example, a warrior robot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After you've gotten a band of adventurers together, equipped them, and trained them, you'll be ready for the next step -- taking them out on an adventure. These adventures can vary from exploring strange alien worlds for the Adventurer's Guild to working on cases for the Agency or the Space Patrol to visiting the ancient sites of a vanished race for the Sensitive's Guild to whatever your imagination can devise. If you survive your first adventure, you'll become a Trial Adventurer. This is just the first step on the road to the highest honor: the title of Independent Adventurer. There are many possible paths to the top, but they are all long, dangerous, and exciting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galactic Adventures, in addition to being a role-playing game, is an adventuring system. The various home systems and existing adventures provide a framework within which you can create your own adventures. These adventures can include activities such as piloting your own space ship through a hyper-gate; space battles with Gorsai pirates; hand-to-hand combat with such creatures as berserk robots, the Mole People, mutants, and anything else you want to create; and performing jobs ranging from picking a lock to working with a quantum black hole. In addition, since adventures can be linked together, you can create adventures as complex as you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Tom Reamy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
