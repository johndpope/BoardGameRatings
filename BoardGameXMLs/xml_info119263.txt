							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cultists of Havra Zhoul</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Order of the Dictum fights crime and corruption in a lawless society. They are the voice of the people, and an ally to those who desire law and order. But are they as benevolent as they seem? Is the code of order they seek to establish what the people truly want? A dark force lurks at the centre of this cult, and those that expect to find a kindred vigilant may instead discover too late that the people's wants do not count at all. For all that counts for the Order of the Dictum is the law. The law of Havra Zhoul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I am Havra Zhoul. Respect me. Obey me. Fear me. If you are unpure, take your spouse and offspring and their offspring, and flee, for it will be your undoing to stand and fight. Flee as fast and far as you can run, and faster and further still! Lest I track you down and slay you, you and your kin, until all discord is purged from this realm. And if, instead, you are pure, and free of the taint of chaos, then flock to me. Bow down and subject yourself to my edicts, to my commands, to my word. For my word is law.&amp;quot; The Dictum&amp;mdash;Section 1: Introductions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a Dual Format PDF. The downloadable ZIP file contains two versions, one optimised for printing and use on a normal computer and one optimised for use on a mobile device such as an iPad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ZIP file also contains a separate PDF containing the product's compiled stat blocks enabling the busy GM to build up a handy library of ready-to-go stat blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
