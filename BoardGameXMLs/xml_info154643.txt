			<description>Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UFO Defense Protocol is a strategy boardgame for 2 to 7 players, which can be played as a team versus team game (humans versus aliens), or alternatively, as a full cooperative game (all the players against the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in a situation of emergency.&lt;br/&gt;The existence of aliens has been discovered, and they threaten to invade the planet.&lt;br/&gt;The players either control a secret cell of humans or an imperial alien faction.&lt;br/&gt;They fight each other to protect or conquer the planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features construction, research, squad combat and air battles.&lt;br/&gt;All decisions and strategic actions are done in simultaneous turns. Ground and air battles still need to be resolved separately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features 7 factions (4 humans, 3 aliens), with their own abilities and special units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General gameplay &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn, Alien factions adapt stronger warships, clone more soldiers, and prepare their mothership.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the alien team is to successfully complete a mothership and have it land on planet Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To counter the alien invasion, human factions recruit soldiers, launch attack jets and develop secret weapons.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the human team is to build a spacecraft, and have it destroy the alien colony. They must also down any mothership that would come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other victory options are available.&lt;br/&gt;Aliens can win the game if they terrorize enough cities to create such chaos that the human directors will be dismissed.&lt;br/&gt;This happens immediately if the Terror Counter reaches 13.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And any team wins the game if at the end of 12 turns, no team has met victory conditions, and it has the most Prestige.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game modes: Full Cooperative or Team vs Team &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The normal game can be played with any number of players from 2 to 7, and can have an asymetric number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can choose to play in the Earth United mode, in full cooperation. &lt;br/&gt;Or they can play in the default Alien Invasion mode, with a team of aliens versus a team of humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player picks a faction at the beginning of the game.&lt;br/&gt;Earth United is limited to the human factions (4 players).&lt;br/&gt;In Alien Invasion, there are 4 human factions and 3 alien factions available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
