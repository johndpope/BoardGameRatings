			<description>Translated Box Text: In The Rotfather universe, Rats, Cockroaches, Spiders and other disgusting beings vie for control of New York's sewers through Sugar smuggling. Defeat your opponents using bluff and cold blood to attack and steal them. Form alliances between characters to perform more powerful actions and doubt the actions of your opponents. For in this game, everyone may be lying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player must try to eliminate all others. For this they can use the actions of the 6 available characters, even if he does not have such cards, paying the cost of the actions in clods of sugar. Just as players can bluff about owning a card, others can also doubt at any time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides adding a sixth character, the important differences from the Coup,  are the different abilities and especially the possibility of making pairs of characters and thus performing stronger actions. Some basic rules are also different, such as the possibility of paying clods of sugar to exchange a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
