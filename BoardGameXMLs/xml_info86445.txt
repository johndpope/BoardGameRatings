			<description>The Game&lt;br/&gt;A Victory Complete: The Battle of Tannenburg, 1914, is a boardgame covering the battle of Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes in August 1914 between Germany and Russia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Scene:&lt;br/&gt;The battle for Tannenberg and the Masurian lakes is one of the most famous battles in history. Even though the battle was insignificant in numbers of forces engaged compared to other battles fought during WW I, it represent a master- piece of exercising modern military strategy. One of the most astonishing victories ever was scored in a classical battle of local superiority and maneuver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tannenberg 1914 &lt;br/&gt;The game covers the battles of Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes during mid August through mid September. Two ill prepared, yet superior in numbers, Imperial Russian armies attack East Prussia in August 1914 in order to honor the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1894.&lt;br/&gt;Even though the Russian attack turned out to a disaster, it played an important role on the Western Front. German reserves were pulled from the West to East Prussia, that otherwise would have been used in the crucial battle of the Marne north of Paris.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game Design&lt;br/&gt;The game mechanics includes a chit-pull procedure. The low density of units provides a fast-pace battle where every move is vital for victory. &lt;br/&gt;The game is taught in 30 minutes and is easy to digest yet a challenge even for the more experienced players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Turn: 2 days&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 6.2 miles / 10 km&lt;br/&gt;Units: Brigade to Army&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More on the Game Design&lt;br/&gt;The game addresses the players on the classical elements 20th century warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;Importance of finding local superiority&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;Balancing between attack and defense&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;Timing of maneuver and decisive blows&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;Command and Control&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;Lines of Supply&lt;br/&gt;The German player has to work with small means and time his strategies in order to succeed and keep the Russian player from pressing far in to East Prussia.
