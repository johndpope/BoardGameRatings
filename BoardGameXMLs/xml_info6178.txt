			<description>Phaestos Disk is a real game from ancient Crete. The time frame is unknown, but it was before Minoan civilization according to archaeologists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is made up of the &amp;quot;Phaestos Disk&amp;quot; ancient boards - which are two different boards, one on each side of the disk. There are 2-6 players. Each player has seven pawns. Each pawn has the signs of Minos era. There are also three dice with the ancient Hellenic shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All pawns must enter the first board, complete it and then go to the second board, do the same and then return back to the beginning. The first player who manages to exit all his pawns from the two boards is the winner. Each square has its own sign, each sign has a command to do (f.e. go 10 spaces, back 5 spaces etc), there are some positions in which the pawns have some penalties and some other which give more rolls or movements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phaestos Disk has the following items:&lt;br/&gt;1. Two Color Boards (Disk of Phaestos, item from the Museum).&lt;br/&gt;2. Seven pawns different color and shape for each of the four player.&lt;br/&gt;3. Three dices with different shapes.&lt;br/&gt;Of course there is a 32-page leaflet with some informations for this game with many photos from the ancient Crete Greece, the island of Deus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
