			<description>From back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ancient throne of the emperors of Dara Happa has been usurped by the Golden Sun Dragon, an invader from the Empire of Wyrm Friends who wish to control the rich lands and convert the people to their blasphemous teachings. It has been over thirty years since the defeat of those who opposed this invasion, but now a man of great power, who is able to see the weakness of the Gold Sun Dragon like no other, looks to reassert the traditions and laws of his people, throwing down, by force of magic and arms, the pretender to Yelm's realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dara Happa Stirs is a campaign that features the rise of the hero Karvanyar and his struggles against the emperor. The Player Characters are heroes in their own right, and their actions will enable the ultimate victory, allowing Karvanyar to challenge and defeat the enemy of both his people and his faith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A truly epic campaign involving some of the most notable events in Gloranthan history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, Dara Happa Stirs; Dara Happa Rages. Join the fight for the Empire of Yelm! Death to the Dragons! In Every Man a Sun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
