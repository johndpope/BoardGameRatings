							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rise of the Dragon</name>
									
			<description>Rise of the Dragon is a graphic adventure game that was released in 1990 for DOS and Macintosh and later remade for the Sega CD (1993) as well as the Amiga. It was one of the few adventure game titles developed by Dynamix, a company that was better known as an action and flight sim game developer. In some sense, this game was an experiment by Dynamix to expand its development repertoire (to other game genre) since the company was bought out by Sierra On-Line in 1990. The Sega CD version added voice actors, (including Cam Clarke in the main role as William 'Blade' Hunter) to the game and was given a MA-17 rating by the Videogame Rating Council, most likely for profanity, references to a fictional illicit drug, cross-dressing, prostitution and partial female nudity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1991, Rise of the Dragon won a Special Award for Artistic Achievement from Computer Gaming World magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Rise of the dragon&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
