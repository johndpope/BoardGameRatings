			<description>Cymbergaj (pronounced like 'tsim-berr-guy') is a traditional tabletop game that simulates European football (soccer). It was quite popular in schools, the matches took place on classroom desks during breaks between classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of two players has a team of footballists represented by coins. There's one big coin 'the goalkeeper' and three medium-sized coins 'field players' in each team. To distinguish between teams one of them is 'heads up' the other is 'tails up'. There is also one small coin in use - representing the ball. The goals are usually gaps between two boxes or books each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game mechanics is similar to Carrom or PitchCar - players finger-flick their respective team coins to hit the ball and eventually to score points by shooting goals. The rules of fair and foul plays depend on the variant of the game. And the variants are numerous!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
