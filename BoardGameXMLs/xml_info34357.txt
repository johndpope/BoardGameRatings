			<description>This Milton Bradley Game (#4168) was produced in 1918 after America entered WWI. The cover artwork of American soldiers in the field in Europe is superb, but the game itself is simple. It comes with 10 counters (5 of each color) and 1 dial. The game board features 5 lines of 26 dots on each line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to capture your opponent's men. Players use a spinner to determine the number of spaces they can move on any given turn. With each spin, the player can move any of his five pieces. In order to capture an opposing piece, a player must spin and land by exact count on the opposing piece on that line. There is a &amp;quot;shell hole&amp;quot; on each line that offers safety from capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capturing a piece closes that line, and the capturing player can then place his free piece on any other still open line, increasing the opportunities to spin the exact number needed to capture another enemy piece on that line. The first player to capture all of the opposing pieces wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
