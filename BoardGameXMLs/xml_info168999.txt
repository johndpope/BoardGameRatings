							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DewDrop Inn</name>
									
			<description>website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;The DewDrop Inn is the most famous hotel on Trollworld. It's run by a retired adventurer, an old wizard who wants to try his hand at being Dungeon Master. You have nothing to fear in this hotel, unless you're an adventurer. In that case, you might be sorry you dropped in to the DewDrop Inn. For any humanoid character no more than 10 feet tall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;You know that there are establishments in many different lands--perhaps many different worlds. Still, this is the first time you've actually found one, and not seeing any other accommodations around, you decide to spend the night there. As you approach, the sounds of merriment and mirth echo out into the street--yes, this looks like your kind of place. Let's hope that the food is good, the beds are bug free, and the ladies (or gentlemen) are friendly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
