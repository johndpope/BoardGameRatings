			<description>This is a race game playable on a Byzantine Chessboard.  Players roll a die and move one of their pieces.  Players have a different piece in a different lane and attempt to navigate their pieces home.  In the dice version, each player has 4 pieces, one of which fits into each lane (4 of the rows), and each piece faces off against a single enemy piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes a diceless variant where how far pieces move is not governed by a die roll, but the position of the piece in relation to other pieces on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
