			<description>From front cover: Rules for Medieval/Fantasy Combat and Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Introduction: These rules were designed for man-on-man combat during the Middle Ages (c. 1200 AD). They were made for use with medieval and fantasy miniatures, with a scale of one inch being approximately ten feet; a playing turn equal to one minute, and a combat round of five seconds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set of rules is also augmented with a special CAMPAIGN section designed for medieval campaigns and adventures involving knights, their squires and other characters found in the Middle Ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
