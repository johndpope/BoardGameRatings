							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pig Tail</name>
									
			<description>Using the standard deck of cards, each player tries to have the fewest number of cards at the end of the game. All cards are spread out face-down in the middle of the game like the shape of &amp;quot;pig tail&amp;quot;. Everyone starts with no cards in his/her hand. In your turn, you either flip a card or play a card from your hand. If it is different color and different number form the previous one, then it stays there. Otherwise you take all the face-up cards to your hand. The game is over when there is no face-down card in the middle of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a lot of games with similar rules. This one is particularly strategic. As there are only 2 colors (black and red), you really want to time when you start decreasing the hand size. It is all about timing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is strongly recommended for even number of players like 4 or 6. The game is nearly as good with 3 or 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
