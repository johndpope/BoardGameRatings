			<description>A fresh take on a classic arcade concept. Cut your way through 12 levels filled with evil robots, bloodthirsty space mutants and neon structures. Click anywhere near borders to move there. Click + drag on an empty area to start cutting. (You can also hold down shift button if you are having difficulty cutting near borders) Guide your ship with mouse and land on a border again to complete your cut. You can let go of the mouse button at any time to stop mid-cut and backtrack. Your goal is to cut out 80% of each level. Avoid enemies and their projectiles. Collect bonus boxes by cutting around them. Higher cutouts than 80% give more points. You can surround and confine bosses into small areas to force them to shrink. The extra space will allow you to make higher cuts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
