							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">D20 Junker Extras</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those of you who have read Hell on Earth: D20 may have noticed that although the reliability score of junker devices was mentioned on page 129, nothing else about this rating was mentioned in the book. Some people (mostly competitors) would believe that we goofed and accidentally left the relevant rules out of the book, but of course, that was not the case. We put the paragraphs and table concerning device reliability right where they were suppose to go, but those darn manitous just couldn&amp;rsquo;t leave anything alone; especially something of such high quality as a Deadlands book. To make a long story short, the good guys managed to destroy all the troublesome little beasties at the Pinnacle office, but not before the book went to press. Therefore, without further ado, D20 rules for device reliability are presented below, along with a few D20 conversions of junker devices in order to help you defeat your own Manitou problems&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
