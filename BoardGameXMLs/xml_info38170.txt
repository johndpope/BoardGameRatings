			<description>&amp;quot;A long time ago, in a Universe far, far away, a race who had tyrannically ruled time and space in their Universe had to face the premature end of their Continuum.  The end of the Universe was prompted by a powerful being known as Dionysus.  Dionysus and some of his comrades escaped into the next Universe, which was an Antiverse to their original home.  That Antiverse is our own present universe.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Virtuous Dionysus, his comrades from the previous Universe and righteous Empire at the end of time strive to protect our Universe from the invasion of the previous Time/ Space Continuum&amp;rsquo;s natives.  Led by the mysterious Time&amp;rsquo;s Champion, the Exousia and Arche are struggling to establish a beachhead in our Universe (their Antiverse) from which they can write themselves into our Time Continuum&amp;rsquo;s history.  Only Dionysus, the Empress, Archaggelos, Malak&amp;rsquo;s, and Clade, can prevent the self proclaimed Time&amp;rsquo;s Champion, the Imperiatrix, the Exousia, Arche and Shed from conquering our Time/ Space Continuum.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player assumes the role of Dionysus, while the other plays Time&amp;rsquo;s Champion. Each player has a set of non-collectible cards to be played using the rules from the Magic: The Gathering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
