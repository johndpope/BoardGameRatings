Each card features an individual exercise and includes direction and tips on how to perform the excercise.

Additional points are awarded for completing the Joker cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     8 MINIGAMES - Intensely fun competitions that push you to the limit. When these cards are encountered, a mini game occurs that really ratchets up the game.  10 or 20 additional points can be earned for both participating and winning the minigame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stretch, Warm-Up, Cool-Down, Rule, and Information Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Playout deck can either used as an activity to facilitate an exercise routine, or it can be used to play several games.
