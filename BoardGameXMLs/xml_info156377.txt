			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four Soccer Simulators is a compilation of four previously unreleased soccer games. Three were different versions of soccer, a full outdoor 11-a-side game, an indoor 5-a-side game and a street soccer game, complete with obstacles such as cars, trees etc. The final game was a Soccer Skills mini-game compilation in the Hyper-Sports mould.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amiga and Atari ST versions (under the name &amp;quot;Pro Soccer Simulator&amp;quot;) were advertised, but not released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Inlay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;11-A-SIDE SOCCER - This is it - THE soccer game. It's got everything - fouls, corners, goalckicks[sic], penalties, throwins, off-side and much, much more. Play the computer or friends - you'll love this game, it's ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INDOOR SOCCER - Real 5-a-side soccer with full indoor rules. There's fast action and loads of goals because play isn't interrupted by throwins corners or goalkicks - the ball just bounces off the walls - A TRUE SIMULATOR!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STREET SOCCER - Excellent fun - soccer with no rules! Hack the other players and watch them roll around in agony! Be careful - don't lose the ball over a wall. You'll have great fun as you shoot the cars, off the houses and around the trees. JUST LIKE THE REAL THING!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SOCCER SKILLS - You've gotta train hard to be the best... 100m sprints, take penalties, goalie practice, dribble around cones, press-ups, sit-ups - faster! - bench jumps, weight lifting, full circuit training AND MORE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits (ZX Spectrum inlay)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four Soccer Simulators was brought to you by...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME DESIGN        Peter Williamson&lt;br/&gt;                   David and Richard Darling&lt;br/&gt;                   Mark Baldock&lt;br/&gt;GAME CODING        Gavin Raeburn and &lt;br/&gt;                   Smart Egg Software&lt;br/&gt;GRAPHICS           Gavin Raeburn&lt;br/&gt;                   Tim Millar&lt;br/&gt;MUSIC/SOUND FX     Gavin Raeburn&lt;br/&gt;PRODUCTION         Stew Regan&lt;br/&gt;                   Sh&amp;acirc;n Savage&lt;br/&gt;COVER ILLUSTRATION Rod Walker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
