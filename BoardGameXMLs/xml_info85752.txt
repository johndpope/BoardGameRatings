			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many wizards and warriors now learn to utilize both combative and magical skills, and a few, like the arcane archer, have begun to blend magic and combat into a single synergistic art. The skills and secrets in this volume will help you, too, learn what can be done to make your magical fighter or martial wizard into a distinctive, potent character with unique combinations of powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expanded edition updates the psionic content for the rules presented in the Expanded Psionics Handbook, as well as presenting epic-level content and new feats, spells and other goodies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     45 new feats including spell-powered feats for permanent arcane benefits, as well as martial arts styles for the magically inclined.&lt;br/&gt;     13 new prestige classes for creating eldritch warriors.&lt;br/&gt;     More than 45 new spells and powers.&lt;br/&gt;     Over 50 new enchanted items designed for usefulness in combat.&lt;br/&gt;     Full support for psionic campaigns including psychic feats, classes, powers and items.&lt;br/&gt;     New epic-level material, including 16 epic feats.&lt;br/&gt;     Six sample characters to illustrate how the material can be used, suitable for inclusion in campaigns of many power levels.&lt;br/&gt;     Updated for maximum compatibility with both revisions of the 3rd Edition, including the expanded psionics rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metablades: Warriors of Mind and Magic is the key to making your character more than simply a fighter/wizard or a barbarian/druid. As a guide to distinctive character creation, it is highly useful to both players and game masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
