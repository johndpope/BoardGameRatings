							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Twisted: A Steampunk Miniatures Game</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Twisted is an immersive new tabletop skirmish game for 2 or more players, with a world-class range of 32mm miniatures representing your characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in an uniquely interesting steampunk universe, Twisted&amp;rsquo;s absorbing gameplay and linked story-driven missions create a real emotional connection between you and your characters on the tabletop. Every character has an original backstory and distinctive role within the Twisted universe: guiding them through our richly-developed environments and exciting encounters will have you on the edge of your seat and wanting more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But beware the power of the Engine! The ever-present influence of the mysterious steampunk Engine pervades the world of Twisted. What makes playing Twisted excitingly unique is that the Engine itself brings a new and intriguing element to every encounter: the Eye of the Engine card deck and the unique &amp;lsquo;Favour of the Engine&amp;rsquo; game mechanic give the Engine an active role in the actual gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maintain the favour of the Engine to enjoy rich rewards, or tempt fate and risk it all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Engine is the hidden source of steampunk power permeating the world Twisted. But it is more than just a god-like machine: it has a selfish consciousness seeking to transform the world according to its own designs, and a jealous ego unwilling to share this power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rumours of the Engine&amp;rsquo;s influence are spreading throughout the world of Twisted, and competing factions have emerged seeking to discover the secret access points to the Engine&amp;rsquo;s power: the Nodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first faction to stumble upon one of these Nodes is the Dickensians: their discovery of an Engine Node hidden deep beneath the darkest sewers of London triggers an explosion of raw steampunk power as the Engine &amp;ndash; sensing danger &amp;ndash; fights back by summoning the Servants of the Engine!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
