			<description>Beware the toxic MonstaFish! Keep the water clean of polluting mutant MonstaFish in four different game modes, where you use various methods of lethal destruction to clear the pool. In &amp;ldquo;Fish Hook&amp;rdquo; mode lower the hook down to rescue the goldfish, or you can play &amp;ldquo;Fish Hunt&amp;rdquo; where you have to be as accurate as a sharpshooter with finger taps to hit the fish. Then you have &amp;ldquo;Time Attack&amp;rdquo; where it&amp;rsquo;s you and your finger against hordes of fish and the clock! Finally is MonstaFish! mode itself, where your local friendly super-Octopus releases bubbles that you have to use to deflate the cunning MonstaFish.&lt;br/&gt;With beautiful graphics, great sounds and a theme tune that will get in your head (free ringtone included in the full game) this is one water fight you will love to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
