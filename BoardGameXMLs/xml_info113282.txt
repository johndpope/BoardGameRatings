			<description>Make a splash with your underwater friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My Pet Dolphin tasks younger gamers with raising and nurturing their very own water-bound buddy, schooling them up on stunning tricks and performing to the crowds to rapturous applause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the stylus, trainers are able to directly interact with their new Dolphin friends. This includes playing simple ball games, feeding them with the right foods at the right time and stroking their heads to reward improvement in ability. The dolphins will react positively or with a degree of reticence depending on how you choose to communicate with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once your new friend is onside, it&amp;rsquo;s time to work out some tricks and routines. The performances in the pool in front the crowds let you know how much your dolphin has improved. Watch their reactions to judge how well your training has gone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-    Using your DS stylus teach your dolphin tricks and routines.&lt;br/&gt;-    Skills are assessed by reactions of audience and score board.&lt;br/&gt;-    Realistic scenery and time changes: blue sky - sunset - night view.&lt;br/&gt;-    Includes a 'Did you know section?' about dolphins and whales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
