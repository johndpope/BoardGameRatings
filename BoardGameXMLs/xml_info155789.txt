							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Japanese: The Game – Travel Expansion</name>
									
			<description>This 36-card Travel Expansion is geared to teach you words you&amp;rsquo;ll need to get around in Japan. Words like Hotel, Where, and Bathroom as well as Pay, Taxi, Fare, Train, and Ticket will make your adventures in the Land of the Rising Sun more comfortable and less stressful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each expansion to Japanese: The Game adds new vocabulary words, and thus the rules that go along with how each noun, verb, or particle can be placed to make a sentence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion decks are shuffled in with the main deck to accommodate more players (the game plays 2 by itself and needs either an additional core deck or an expansion to accommodate more), or just to add less common words to the mix for 1-2 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
