							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">To Hellion X and Back / The God Under the Mountain</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is the omnibus edition of two Fate Core scenarios from Smart Party Publishing, To Hellion X and Back and The God Under the Mountain. They share a theme of fiery disaster. The scenarios are ideal for one shots, and include pre-generated characters, or can be used to start off a campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Hellion X and Back&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this pulpy science fiction scenario, the crew of the starship Hussar must rescue a scientist from a doomed planet, in a tale of desperation and a race against time. The remaining infrastructure is literally falling to pieces, and people are stranded there. The system's star is about to explode!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The God Under the Mountain&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The God Under the Mountain is a fantasy tale with a dark ages fantasy feel and a smear of grime. It features a dragon and its twisted servants, and a village that more or less prospers under the dragon's shadow, albeit at a price. For some the price has become too much to bear. But who has the boldness and the skill to act?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
