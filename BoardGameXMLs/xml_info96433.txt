			<description>Launch into the black of space to save your Home Planet!&lt;br/&gt; Space Traders is a family strategy game for 3-5 players, ages 10 and up. Players mine their Home Planets for resources, then launch trading or raiding missions to the neutral Trading Planets. Space Traders uses modular building bricks for its game pieces, allowing players to upgrade ships during the course of the game. Multiple paths to victory are possible, some players will build many ships and try to restrict access to the Trading Planets while others may build only a few ships and rely on lightening-fast raids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
