			<description>Fingertip Fungal Farming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Troglobites, players take on roles as mushroom gardeners in the deep dark cave. Every turn you rummage through the great rubbish heap, bringing home prize mushrooms (or perhaps nasty pests).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, you are offered 4 mushrooms pieces, picked blindly from the central heap by the previous player. You must choose three to keep and one to discard. Each type of mushroom/pest has a tastiness value, and a placement rule. You are trying to grow the tastiest mushroom garden.&lt;br/&gt;After a player fills the central hexagon of their garden, the game enters the final round, ending when it returns to that player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces are deliberately textured, and the rules suggest that on the 2nd or 3rd game players should be blindfolded, relying on their fingertips to 'see'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
