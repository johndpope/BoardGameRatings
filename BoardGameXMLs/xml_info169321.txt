			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the greatest literary adventures ever written take place in the folds of time near the turn of the 19th century. Classics like Dracula, King Solomon&amp;rsquo;s Mines, The Lost World, and Mysterious Island all hold an ambiance of danger and daring-do. It is a setting beloved by many, known for its Romanticism. Pronounced for its noble heroes, dramatic villains, and its wondrous use of what are now simple scientific principles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this time frame, the world has yet to be fully tamed by man. Each continent offers dark unexplored recesses and mythic quests drawing the attention of quixotic treasure hunters. Yes, here adventure is still alive; peril is one footfall away. This is the world of Century&amp;rsquo;s Edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 18??. A traumatic result of &amp;ldquo;Dr. Well&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; experiments with time (see, The Time Machine) has created a splintered universe -a world, where man has never quite fully come out of the Industrial Revolution. Pockets of strange temporal energy have preserved areas of the earth in one time period or another -varying by several decades in some instances. Traveling across these invisible and largely unmarked zones sometimes results in interesting phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traversing these &amp;ldquo;quantum bubbles&amp;rdquo; sometimes results in aging, or rejuvenation. Equipment from &amp;ldquo;advanced&amp;rdquo; bubbles may become dysfunctional in primitive zones. The cure to this madness seems eons beyond the science of the realm, and civilization has begun to adapt to these peculiarities. The brave men and women of this &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo; time have grown use to living on the&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CENTURY&amp;rsquo;S EDGE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
