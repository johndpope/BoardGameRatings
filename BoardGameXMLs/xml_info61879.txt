							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Magesmithing 101</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magesmith--the word conjures up images of a burly figure, hammer in hand, beating on a red hot sword with a mighty hammer, sparks flying and flashes of arcane energies washing over both smith and forge. Which, for what it is worth, is not a terribly inaccurate image, but is somewhat incomplete. For all the time spent struggling with fire and steel at the forge, the magesmith spends just as much time hunched over an ancient tome, surrounded by stacks of books and scrolls, taking notes and sketching diagrams. In the end, that well muscled figure is as much a &amp;ldquo;mage&amp;rdquo; as a &amp;ldquo;smith&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system presented here is not meant as a replacement for the standard system of magic item creation, but as an alternative or supplementary system. The 101 series is all about options and choices. Entire campaigns can be run around the options presented in this book, from finding the right materials for your imbued weapon to gaining entry to certain organizations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
