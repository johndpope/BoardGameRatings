			<description>You are in the currency exchange market. You will be trading money with other players. &lt;br/&gt;You will have some possible secret partners. You can find out who your partner is or find out which currency is fake. There will be a secret card that shows the currency or the numbered bill that is fake for that round. Be the player with most money at the end. &lt;br/&gt;Don't get fooled by the counterfeit bills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: &lt;br/&gt;50 cards (1$, 2$, 5$, $10, $20) x 2 of 5 currencies&lt;br/&gt;10 counterfeit round cards (5 money denominations, 5 of the currency)&lt;br/&gt;15 secret player cards (3 of each that represent the 5 currencies)&lt;br/&gt;50 score sheets (or provide your own paper and pencil)&lt;br/&gt;1 starting coin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set up:&lt;br/&gt;Choose a dealer by drawing from the money cards, highest amount wins. If a ties everyone can draw and add total.&lt;br/&gt;Place the starting coin in front of the dealer. Shuffle and place one counterfeit card in the center. &lt;br/&gt;Deal one secret player card to each player, put the rest aside.&lt;br/&gt;Deal 5 currency cards to each player. (4-5 players deal 4)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play:&lt;br/&gt;The person to the right of the dealer will start.&lt;br/&gt;Their first action is to choose one face down card to look at. &lt;br/&gt;They can look at another player's secret card or the featured counterfeit card in the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;After the player secretly looks they pass one money card to the player of their choice.&lt;br/&gt;This card will remain face down on the table, not to be confused with the money in the players hands.&lt;br/&gt;play then continues to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;Repeat same action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play will continue for 5 full rounds, until everyone has used all the money in their hands.&lt;br/&gt;Once all the money has been played everyone will reveal their secret identity cards.&lt;br/&gt;They will flip over the money they have in front of them.&lt;br/&gt;They will flip the counterfeit card in the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring:&lt;br/&gt;Each player scores the amount of money in front of them&lt;br/&gt;They also score the same amount as a person with the same identity&lt;br/&gt;Ex. If player A has $21 and Player C has $9 and both are on the blue team, they both will get $30 for that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Any currency or denomination that matches the counterfeit card in the center is void.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br/&gt;After the first round, write down each player's score.&lt;br/&gt;Move the dealer coin to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;The money and identity cards will be dealt.&lt;br/&gt;The counterfeit cards remain in the center, once one is used, it is out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues for 5 rounds or till each player gets to start, your choice. Total up all the rounds, player with the most cash wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
