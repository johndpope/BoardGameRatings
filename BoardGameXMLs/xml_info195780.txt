							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Terribly Beautiful (Version 0.3)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the dream of humanity to escape death. No one lives forever, but we hope that our lives mattered, that we will be remembered by the next generation. We have a lifetime to create that legacy. All too often most of that lifetime gets squandered. We come to realize the importance of our legacy only when it is almost too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are the most desirable and seductive women in the city, the women of the night. Men are willing to travel into the most disreputable of neighbourhoods to meet them, offer money and gifts for but a few hours of their time or even less. They ply the oldest profession, selling their bodies into others&amp;rsquo; fantasies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But for the streetwalkers of the red-light district known as the Kaz, death takes its time. The disease known as the Pale stakes its claim by transforming its victims into visions of beauty, alabaster skin and elegantly thin. But beware, for death is a jealous lover, who lays claim to any who might make love to those already ill, and so they become known as the Terribly Beautiful. Shunned by society, they find each other and face the remaining days of their lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
