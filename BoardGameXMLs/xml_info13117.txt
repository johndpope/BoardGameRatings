			<description>The primary equipment in Novi is a set of 256 square tiles.  Each tile is effectively a 3x3 grid with each square being colored black or white.  All possible 3x3 grid patterns are represented, with the number of tiles for each pattern being the number of distinct rotational positions it has.  Each tile has patterns on both sides, with each being the inverse coloring of the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of different ways to play are provided.  There is a solitaire puzzle in which you try to fit a given number of pieces together so that the color patterns on the edges always match.  There is a two-player game using the provided 16x16 board in which each player takes a color and tries to create a continuous path of that color across the board.  A number of variants are provided for this game. Finally, there is a multi-player game (no upper limit on players is specified, but six seemed reasonable) in which players are trying to get rid of tiles by playing them to a common 3x3 array.  Unplayable tiles must be used to form a personal 3x3 array.  All the games use the same edge-matching rule as the puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
