			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once there was a world full of living robots. Everything was great until one day there was an accident at the power generator. On that day everything shut down. 10000 years later lightning struck one intrepid robot and it was enough to bring it back. Take control of this robot and bring power back to all the robots in this point and click adventure game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
