			<description>A reissue and reworking (and renaming) of FEZ I: Valley of Trees&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Werewolf terrorizes Wizard's Vale,&lt;br/&gt;Fez discovers fateful prophecies,&lt;br/&gt;Liches play killer bridge game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fez, the Wizard of Time Travel, has stumbled upon predictions which will have a profound impact on his future (whatever that means to a time-traveling wizard).  The prophecies state that a &amp;quot;band raised from the dead&amp;quot; will help a wizard defeat a dragon.  Fez can now overcome his lifelong enemy, the evil dragon Scarsnout!  Unfortunately, the band's members have little memory of who they were before they were raised.  Also, a werewolf has killed the only person who knew the Player Characters' identities.  Now, the adventurers must regain their memories and obtain the items necessary to fulfill the prophecies (while trying not to disturb the liches' bridge game)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this adventure, the Player Characters must sole riddles and think their way out of sticky messes to survive and successfully aid the wizard Fez.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wizard's Vale includes maps of Fez's castle.  Among the resurrected Player Characters are a lammasu and a twentieth-century human.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wizard's Vale can be played as the first adventure in the popular six-part series or played by itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
