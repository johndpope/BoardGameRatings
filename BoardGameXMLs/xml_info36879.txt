							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pizza Bake-Off</name>
									
			<description>Players attempt to complete pizza recipes by collecting different resources from various places in the kitchen.  Movement is done using addition and subtraction cards to move to various spaces - which reward the player with a topping or a special card they can use.  The board is two-sided, so that players can play with single or double-digit addition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
