			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jules Verne&amp;rsquo;s Secrets of the Mysterious Island (SOTMI) is the sequel to the Jules Verne&amp;rsquo;s Return To Mysterious Island adventure game that&amp;rsquo;s based on the Jules Verne&amp;rsquo;s novel. SOTMI picks up where its predecessor left off: Just as your character Mina was about to leave the island, a sudden volcanic eruption brings down the aircraft that came to rescue her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again, Mina ends up as a castaway on an apparently uninhabited island somewhere in the South Pacific. A monkey pet named Jep saves Mina&amp;rsquo;s life.  As the title suggests, you&amp;rsquo;ll solve lots of secrets that will fill in murky bits from the first game. For example, you&amp;rsquo;ll find out why Captain Nemo never escaped the island. SOTMI employs an old trick that breaks monotony &amp;ndash; switching between Mina and Jep who have distinct abilities and their own inventories. For example, Jep can reach places that are outside Mina&amp;rsquo;s reach, he can tap his highly evolved sense of smell to find objects, and even communicate with other monkeys via a special interface. Mina can dive in the lake, combine items, use complex tools, and read the documents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This being a sequel, everything is bigger and larger than in the first game so brace yourself for even more exploration, puzzles, and objects to collect. The inventory system remains unchanged and revolves around using a specific object at a certain place or combining several objects into a new item that solves a puzzle. For example, combine a hook and bait to cast a fishing rod. Fans of Myst and Secret of the Monkey Island should feel right at home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
