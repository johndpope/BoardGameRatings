							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crossing Olympus</name>
									
			<description>Fed up with the foolishness of mortals, the Gods of Olympus have gathered to debate the fate of mankind...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An exciting new 2 player abstract strategy game puts the power of the 12 Olympian Gods in your hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take control of the 12 Olympian Gods and Goddesses and use the powers of Zeus, Hera, Apollo, Poseidon, Hermes, Artemis, Athena, Dionysus, Ares, Aphrodite, Hephaestus, and Hades. Each brings a unique ability that can alter the fate of your competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will be the first to cross Mount Olympus?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is provided 12 Gods of Olympus cards, light and dark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gods and goddesses have individualized health points, movements, attacks and special abilities that match their characteristics, to deeply tie theme in with mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a diagonal board, 9 spaces wide and 9 across. The first space on both sides are the &amp;quot;gates&amp;quot; spaces. It will be your goal to either eliminate all the other player's characters, or move any of your characters onto your opponent's gate space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your first turn, select a character to &amp;quot;summon&amp;quot; onto your gates space. On subsequent turns, you will choose to move, attack, or bring additional characters into play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the cards are balanced so that they are equal in power. For example, even though Zeus has twice as much health as Hermes, Hermes has far more mobility and provides a &amp;quot;winged sandals&amp;quot; ability that also increases the movement of other pieces. Athena has even less health, but a powerful &amp;quot;aegis shield&amp;quot; ability protects other pieces and can alter the fate of the competition. All characters will be equally important to achieving your victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The balance between the cards not only provides fantastic gameplay, it also opens the door for expansions that will add deck building and asymmetric gameplay options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine playing chess with each of the 12 Greek Gods as your pieces and you will have a good idea of what Crossing Olympus is like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
