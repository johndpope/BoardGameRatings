							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Land of the Lost Board Game</name>
									
			<description>from the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Prehistoric Land of the Lost - a dry and hot desert, ferocious dinosaurs roaming a steamy jungle, and a steep, rocky precipice, these are just some of the dangers that await you! Join the Porter family and their friends in their quest for the elusive time portal and escape from this primitive land. Escape from Scarface, the ferocious Tyrannosaurus Rex. He will chase you around every path - look out because he's hungry and is coming your way! Also avoid Shung, the Sleestak leader, as he attempts to trap you in his lair! Be the first player to collect three power crystal cards and make your way through the prehistoric pitfalls to the time portal, and then spin to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is notable that this appears to be based on the Krofft Production's 1991 remake of the series rather than the 1974 series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
