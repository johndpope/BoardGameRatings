			<description>Apicultura is a card drafting, resource conversion game about breeding bees, harvesting honey and selling it to maximize your profit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player at the end of the game who has collected the most income is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Apicultura, each player has a player board representing their own individual honey farm and a hand of identical action cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game the players begin with 2 lowly Level A hives (these can be upgraded later).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn the Action Cards are drafted which allow players to Breed Bees (add a new hive in a space where there are already 2 hives), Plant Fields (increasing the maximum number of hives permitted), Produce Honey (&amp;quot;spending&amp;quot; hives for the round to generate honey), Upgrade Hives which increases the quality (and value) of the honey produced and as well as Sell Honey (either to exclusive honey boutiques or direct to the public at a reduced rate) depending on the demand for their particular product. The honey can also be marketed or refined which can increases its value, or simply opt to generate a small amount of income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
