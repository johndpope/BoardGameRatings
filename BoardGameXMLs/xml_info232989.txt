							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rail Raiders Infinite: Huckleberry&#039;s Riverboat Roll</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Huckleberry's Riverboat Roll is an exciting addition to the sci-fi western board game, Rail Raiders Infinite. When players are ready to take a break from snagging booty and ducking the Lawbots in Rail Raiders Infinite, they can gather around the poker table and play to take their fellow player's double dollars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Huckleberry's Riverboat Roll is a betting dice game, the object of the game is to win every other player's $$ tokens, using the custom poker dice. Players achieve this by playing a series of rounds, where players roll their dice and build a hand, bet on the hand, and then either win by having the best hand or by having every other player fold. Players' hands stay hidden behind the beautifully illustrated double-sided dice blinds and are only revealed once the betting is done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
