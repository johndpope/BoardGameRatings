							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kung Fu Skill Unlocks</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Show Your Kung Fu!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skill unlocks were first presented in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Pathfinder Unchained, providing new benefits for those specialized in certain skills. In Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Occult Adventures, they were further refined, with occult skill unlocks providing new uses for existing skills to those with an occult background. But there are more secret disciplines in the world than the occult, and more ways to use skills left untapped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents kung fu skill unlocks, a series of new skill unlocks in the style of those presented in Occult Adventures, but thematically appropriate for skilled martial artists. Perform graceful back flips and aerial assaults with Acrobatics, dodge attacks with Escape Artist, intercept incoming attacks with Sleight of Hand, and much, much more. Included are unlocks for 7 different skills, as well as 5 feats relating to kung fu skill unlocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
