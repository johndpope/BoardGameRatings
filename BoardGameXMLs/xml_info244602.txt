							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cultists of Cthulhu: Music Recital</name>
									
			<description>Old folks may disapprove of it, but college kids know that there' s just something magical about that Jazz. Includes a deck of 13 Music Cards and rules for how to use them. Music is an optional rule: play the 15 minute soundtrack, which functions as a timer. Every 15 minutes a loud, easily noticable bell will prompt you to draw a new card from the Music Deck. Music cards can be good or bad for the Academics, and are resolved by whoever the current player is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
