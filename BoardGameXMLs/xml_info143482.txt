							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Escape from Pulsar 7</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Catalog&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are alone .... or almost alone on the space freighter &amp;quot;Pulsar 7&amp;quot;. As you sit in the relative safety of the social room, your thoughts drift unwillingly back to the day two weeks ago when the nightmare began ....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It started out as a routine mission, an exploratory flight into the outer regions of the Xanotar system. The purpose of the mission was, as always, to deliver the precious ore Redennium to minor planetoids whose civilisations had evolved beyond primitive nuclear power and were seeking out new methods of energy transferrence from common elements found on their home planets. Redennium was rare in these far flung regions of the Xanotar system, consequently most governments of these planetoids were only too eager to accept samples of new elements, particularly Redennium whose energy transferrence characteristics were second to none.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After successfully trading the current load of Redennium and also receiving, as part payment for the consignment, a strange but interesting creature for the intergalactic zoo on your home planet, you and your crew set course for home. Initially the trip is uneventful except for a minor disturbance when the creature broke out of its cage and took to rolling about playfully in the remains of the Redennium ore left in the cargo hold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After recapturing the creature and placing it back in its cage, the Pulsar 7 resumed its monotonous course for home. In the following days, however, the creature becomes restless and begins to grow at an astonishing rate. It was decided at this point that the creature was likely to become a danger to the crew and should, therefore, be sedated and placed into suspended animation for the remainder of the journey home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The decision came too late .... the creature, now the size of a small horse, has ripped open its cage and savagely killed all of the remaining crew except yourself. Your only option now is to abandon the freighter and attempt to make your escape in the frail shuttle craft -- if you can avoid the deadly creature!.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
