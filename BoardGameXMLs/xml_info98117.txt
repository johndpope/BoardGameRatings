			<description>Barren Realms Elite or BRE is a multi-player bulletin board system strategy game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barren Realms Elite is a 25-player strategic war game originally by Mehul Patel. The setting is in the future -- nuclear destruction has spread throughout the planet, and now only a vast barren void exists. As a baron under a great king, you must expand your barony throughout the planet and become the ultimate baron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One feature of the game was the ability for a bulletin board system to compete against other BBSs. Each BBS would function as its own distinct planet in a universe of planets, where the universe comprised all of the BBSs that agreed to host the game together. Messages and attacks would travel from planet to planet on a regular basis as the BBS systems called each other to transmit and receive data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus on inter-BBS play completely changed the game dynamics, and both BRE and SRE continued to be developed for several years. In modern times, Barren Realms Elite has managed to maintain a fair number of players, most of whom connect to BBSes via Telnet in order to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was based on Solar Realms Elite (SRE), and is considered by many to be SRE's successor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Barren Realms Elite&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
