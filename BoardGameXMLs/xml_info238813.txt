			<description>Monsters! A big horde is coming from the south and you will face lots of angry creatures!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This rich expansion pack adds many brand new, never seen before cards which will reshape the battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Heroes will have to fight against new monsters and creatures, however all is not lost, the gods have bestowed upon them many new strengthening powers and items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poison! Giant Spiders, Snakes and Scorpions are poisonous creatures and have the ability to leave a lasting affect on their victims. If the attack of this monster does at least one damage to a player&amp;rsquo;s hero this hero will also get infected by the monster&amp;rsquo;s poison and will receive a poison token. At the start of each turn before other monster&amp;rsquo;s attack, this hero will lose one LP for every poison token which he is infected by. This poison can only be cured by the use of specific cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with the new creatures In this box you will find: invisibility potions, powerful weapons, dwarven beers, well forged shields, and of course, two new Heroes: the Slayer and the Thief (one of which will have unique abilities).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
