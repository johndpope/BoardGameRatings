			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Campaign Menu Option contains options to control your campaign. 'Credits, Background and Setting are individual options to enter basic campaign information. The Associate options are used to link a character/NPC to a particular campaign. When associated with a campaign, the characters will be listed with the appropriate campaign, and the characters will be printed with the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Encounters menu option will lead you to the encounter manager.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Databases menu controls the RGMC Database structure. Everything used in these menus is also used in Character Generation, as well as the Rifts Game Master Reference Screen, for use during game play. Example: If you were to add a new weapon into the database, it would become an option any time weapon selection came up. The RIFTS Index and the RIFTS Appendix are comprehensive indexes of the RIFTS line. They are further explained in the Index/Appendix section of this manual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From company website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program was released back in 1995 for a brief period of time before it was pulled from the market due to bugs in the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
