							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Full Auto</name>
									
			<description>Full Auto is a video game for the Xbox 360 console published by Sega. Originally Developed by Pseudo Interactive for the PC, it is a vehicular combat racing game. It features destructible environments and (in certain races) a mode called &amp;quot;Unwreck&amp;quot; which rewinds time if the player makes a mistake and wants to try again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Full Auto, there are four vehicle classes. Each has its own abilities, strengths and weaknesses. There is Class A, which are faster, but have less durability than their counterparts. Class B is the middle class of vehicles having a fair amount of speed, and decent durability. The slow, and highly durable class is Class C. A fourth class, Class S, is home to the &amp;quot;ultimate&amp;quot; class where its vehicle is very powerful, fast and durable. Note that in online play all players, regardless of how far they have gotten in the career mode, have access to all vehicles in whatever class the host of the room determines. However tuneable weapons are not permitted on Live play until the gamer has unlocked them from the career mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The weapons of Full Auto are mounted on the vehicles, and have unlimited ammunition, but require a cooldown period if fired too quickly. The weapons become active after approximately 10 seconds of racing into the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weapon presets come in three different varieties: front-mounted, rear-mounted, or variable (rear and front mounted). Weapons also have the ability to change levels which increase damage. Levels range from 1 through 3 with 3 being the highest. The only drawback to raising a weapon's level, is that the other weapon is decreased in level. For example, rear-mounted grenades can be upgraded to level 3, but the front-mounted shotgun is dropped to a level 1. This balances front and rear weapon strength, so no car can totally dominate another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Full Auto,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
