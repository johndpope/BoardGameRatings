			<description>Fromthe Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue of Pyramid, the PDF magazine for roleplayers, is called &amp;quot;Looks Like a Job for . . . Superheroes.&amp;quot; Devoted to supers campaigns and four-color fun, it includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An extensive alternate history of the Russian supers program, from before the fall of the tsar to the death of Khrushchev. Learn why Soviet heroes are so secretive, so skittish, and sometimes seemingly insane!&lt;br/&gt;     Information about powerful villains who use their incredible abilities to conquer less-than-incredible regions, plus three ready-to-use GURPS bad guys for mid- to high-power campaigns!&lt;br/&gt;     A group of low- to mid-power GURPS criminals - the Player Kings - who rely on their theatrical-style powers to commit outlandish crimes. Written by Stephen Dedman, the author of GURPS Dinosaurs!&lt;br/&gt;     Discussions about what it means to be a reformed villain, about using powers as metaphors in a campaign, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, this issue offers the odds and ends that make a magazine fun, including humor, Murphy's Rules with Greg Hyland, reviews and recommendations that fit the theme, and a &amp;quot;Last Word,&amp;quot; where we ask an industry luminary to pick one word related to the issue's theme. This month, Steve Long of Champions fame gives the last word on superheroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
