							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Noises in the Old Theatre</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rumour is that, yesterday, most of the goblin bandits that camp in the abandoned theatre left. They intercepted a fine merchant convoy, and now they are in the city, buying provisions or getting drunk on stolen wine. It's a perfect day for a small incursion into the goblin lair. In and out. Easy money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course it won't be as simple as that...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Noises in the Old Theatre is an adventure and quick-start ruleset for The Indie Hack (TIH), which is a minimalist fantasy roleplaying game that is played with pencils, paper, dice, and imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There should be one Game Master (GM) and two to four players. Three players is a good number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
