			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book provides eight complete pre-generated characters specifically designed for use in an Asian caravan-themed adventure path. Each character comes with a full stat block including campaign traits, a detailed background and personality, along with tips on advancement through 4th level. Just pick one that strikes your fancy and you&amp;rsquo;re ready to play. These iconics have been built using a 20-point buy making sure that would be all rules-legal and fully compliant.  In addition, each comes with instructions on how to adjust the stats to a 15-point buy, should your GM wish to use the standard adventure paths or if your group enjoys an epic fantasy feel for their characters, adjustments up to a 25-point buy are also included. There&amp;rsquo;s a little something for everyone. Whichever buy you choose, with a few minor adjustments your PCs will be ready to go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The iconic consist of four human characters and four unique races from the NeoExodus: A House Divided campaign setting such as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Cynean: These beings of living crystal are masters of magic. Crystalline scholars of all things arcane, the cyneans are as mighty in mind as in body.&lt;br/&gt;     Enuka: The most primal and barbaric of the savage humanoids have nothing on the enuka. Enuka are ferocious creatures with instincts for battle and the hunt, animalistic predators blessed with humanoid form and intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;     Gevet: The gevet &amp;ndash; or tiefling &amp;ndash; claim to be the first to have mastered magic and that it is their descendants that ruled their lands.&lt;br/&gt;     Prymidian: These are regal, red-skinned humanoids who are a communication and language-inclined race, dedicated to scientific reason, research, expansion of knowledge and discovery. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These iconic consist of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Chan-Ona: Male cynean wizard&lt;br/&gt;     Colm Durban: Male human alchemist&lt;br/&gt;     Dorozan Alned Jawal: Male gevet (Tiefling) witch&lt;br/&gt;     Horse-Breaker: Male enuka fighter&lt;br/&gt;     Saiyeth Inissi: Female human monk (zen archer)&lt;br/&gt;     Talar Meda: Female prymidian cleric of the Goddess of Travel&lt;br/&gt;     Valentina Yeris: Female human rogue (acrobat)&lt;br/&gt;     Vash Kandar: Male human samurai&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
