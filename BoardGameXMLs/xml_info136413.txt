							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rune</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very little is known about Rune, other than that he is a deadly assassin-for-hire who kills using otherworldly technology. He is on the international watch lists of major governments around the world... But are they on his hit list? Or maybe his client list? Rune is drawn by artist Kennon James, who has worked on the animated film, A Scanner Darkly, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic book, and his own online strip, Mohagan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;FOE FILE #02: RUNE&amp;quot; contains a briefing from TEACHER, the sentient computer system of the Crusader Citadel (headquarters of the Crusaders superhero team), character sheets with complete stats for Rune in VILLAINS AND VIGILANTES and LIVING LEGENDS, and a full page origin complete with background, tactics, personality traits, and choice dialogue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
