			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the years leading up to the orc uprising, the Empire saw incredible innovation, as constructs and other mechanical beings emerged. Although their creation was prohibitively expensive for large-scale manufacturing, wealthy individuals could commission such wondrous devices to toil in mines, haul cargo off and onto ships, and perform whatever other labors they commanded. In Lij, clockworks joined the ranks of other mechanical beings, but rather than be powered by magic or engineering, they derived mobility from souls anchored to their unliving components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although some believe these marvels to be recent developments, the methods of their creation can be traced back to antiquity, to the time of the Edene and older, lesser-known peoples before them. The dreaded prometheans and the unstoppable golems embody such ancient artifice. And though the means to produce such entities lies far beyond the abilities of most magicians, the mighty spells remain hidden in old tomes and in the notes of the legendary scholars of magic who pioneered their creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;False Lives joins the other entries in the Monstrous Pages series, examining beings created by magic and imbued with sentience. Here you&amp;rsquo;ll find new lore and variants for clockworks, golems, prometheans, and other constructs for use in Shadow of the Demon Lord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
