							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spy Catcher</name>
									
			<description>Spy Catcher is a game of espionage and skill set during the Second World War, based on a BBC television series.  Players are members of the British intelligence service attempting to catch German spies in England, France, Belgium and the Netherlands.  A player is based in each of these four countries and the winner is the first to identify the spies operating in their area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each country has three suspects who may be resistance workers, refugees or spies.  Players collect cards as the game progresses which help eliminate potential spies from suspicion until a player is able to make a positive identification.  If a player reaches an incorrect conclusion about the spies in their area then they are eliminated from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents are:&lt;br/&gt;1 playing board, 1 control spinner, 4 Spy Catcher (player) markers, 4 sets of information cards (potential spies) and 12 covering discs.  Rules are printed on the inside of the box lid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
