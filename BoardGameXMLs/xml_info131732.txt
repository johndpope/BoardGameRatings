							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Benjamin Bl√ºmchen: Sicher zur Schule</name>
									
			<description>A roll-and-move game that aims at teaching children how to safely get to school (traffic rules).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a game board, 4 player pieces, 16 cards, 60 plastic chips, a number die and a colour die. The board shows a path to school.  The aim of the game is decided by the players - either being first to reach school or winning the most chips.&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling the number die and move their piece according to the die roll. If you land on a space with a circle next to it, you earn a chip. Reaching a stop sign means you have to stop. On your next turn, you roll the colour die and can move on if you roll green. Landing on a space with an exclamation mark means you've put yourself in danger (board shows a dangerous situation) and you lose a chip.&lt;br/&gt;There is also a variant that uses cards: Before crossing a road, you have to answer a road safety question printed on one of the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
