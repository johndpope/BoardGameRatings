			<description>Race to amass 1500 days in space, get one rocket to the &amp;quot;splashdown&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;target&amp;quot; site, and have no rockets remaining in play on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players each start with an astronaut on the board's outer track, and roll a single die. The astronaut is used to collect the six components needed to build a rocket, as well as other &amp;quot;game effect&amp;quot; cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has all six cards, he may then roll two dice: a red die to move his rocket on the inner board, and the white die to gather the components for more rockets. A player may have up to two rockets in space at any one time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players score days in space by passing over the green spaces marking planets and other interesting features within the solar system. Some cards and spaces also allow a player to score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some cards and board spaces may be used to move your own rocket to your advantage, or another player's rocket to their disadvantage. The board contains three dead-end spaces pathways (&amp;quot;burn-out&amp;quot;, Uranus, and the Sun) that penalize a player as well as destroying his rocket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
