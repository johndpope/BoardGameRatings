			<description>Statistical sport game on track &amp;amp; field events, a companion game (but playable by itself) for Central Lanes Athletics.&lt;br/&gt;It features different methods for resolving middle and long races (from 800 to 10.000 meters), for resolving throws, long jump and triple jump, and a third system to resolve high jump and pole vault.&lt;br/&gt;The core of the game is based on average time (as in Central lanes) for each competitors, modified by several dice rolls (2 six sided dice rolls 4 time for each of the races, but with an initial roll to see which competitors are still in the leading group in the final part of the race).&lt;br/&gt;Throws and Jumps have an average measure, but there are also rules for fouls and other random events, that may greatly modify the result.&lt;br/&gt;The basic game comes with complete data for Olympic Games from 1972 to 1988&lt;br/&gt;A second (1992-2008) and a third (1936-1968) pack is to appear before the London Olympics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
