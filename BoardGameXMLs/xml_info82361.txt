							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stoke - Birmingham 0-0</name>
									
			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a role-playing game for 4 players. The game plays for 15 minutes, as a &amp;quot;role-playing poem&amp;quot;. You take the role of Norwegian Stoke supporters. They've all been supporters of their team for a long time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a year the characters fly over to attend a match in England, between Stoke and another team. This year they have seen Stoke holding Birmingham to a draw. It was a dull affair. No goals, next to no excitement, nothing much to talk about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The whole game takes place at a pub after the game. You play out the talk around the table, commenting the match, reminiscing on legendary matches, talking about the weather, the hotel, domestic affairs and any details you may contrive to make part of the characters' life. Try to engage in your character, and his/her relations to the other characters, and try to be a dull person in a dull life. The relations between the characters are improvised. If someone implies that they are married to your character, then they are. If someone talks about a joint experience, then you have had it. Go along with the ideas of other players, but keep it down to earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do not under any circumstance make any queer or interesting remarks. Be ordinary. Let silence speak if you find nothing to say. 15 minutes may be very long in a dull life. Try to stay in there till the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
