							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Zont Deck</name>
									
			<description>The Zont Deck is a unique card system that is completely different than a regular 52-card deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Zont Deck has three colors with 5 unique suits of 11 cards each. Each suit has three sets of 1,2,3 and one zero and one four.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes the Deck different however, is that the suits are more than just a name and a pretty face. Each suit represents a power theme, and how that power works depends on the game being played. For example, the Art suit (+) is Card Gain. So whenever you play a card from this suit, depending on the game, you may draw a card or play another card from your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The suits power themes are:&lt;br/&gt;Art (+) = Card Gain&lt;br/&gt;Change (-) = Card Loss&lt;br/&gt;Favors (4 dots) = Play State Change&lt;br/&gt;Great Zont (1 dot) = Immunity to power&lt;br/&gt;Giglets (infinity) = Wild power&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These suit powers give Zont Deck games a modern twist and present the opportunities for completely new card games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are six games for the Zont Deck, two of which come with the deck, and the other four can be found on &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.thezontdeck.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.thezontdeck.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
