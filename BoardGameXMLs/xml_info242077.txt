			<description>Each player has 13 infantry companies, 2 light batteries and one heavy battery. At the beginning of the game, the pieces are set up on the red, blue and yellow marked spaces. Each turn the players move 2 of their pieces 1 space in any direction. The infantry has a firing range of 1 space, the light batteries of 2 space and the heavy batteries of 2 and 3 spaces. A piece is destroyed if it is in the firing range of 3 enemy pieces. If a piece is at one of the two fortified spaces, it has to be in the firing range of 4 enemy pieces. If a player has less than 4 pieces left, he has lost the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
