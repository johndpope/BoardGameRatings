			<description>The last battle against the forces of darkness will be one that you won&amp;rsquo;t come back from.  Being one of the mightiest warriors in the land it is time to prove your worth the only way you know how, in brutal bloody combat.  In the frenzy of battle you will receive mortal blows but death can wait until after the battle.  It is time to prove that you are the mightiest warrior that the world has ever seen; punch and cleave your way through the enemy forces and earn your mark in history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eternal Glory is a game for 2 to 4 players, in which players compete to be the first to reach one-hundred kills in battle.  Along the way the warriors will break their weapons, face formidable foes and even receive mortal injuries.  Through the use of the cards in their hand they can punch, cleave and even come back from death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw a card to their hand, play or discard.  They must lay cards in order to increase their kill count and play axes to be able to perform weapon attacks.  Players may place Formidable Foes, Break Weapon and Mortal Wound cards on rival players to hinder their progress and then use your Warp Spasm to come back from death or a Furious Assault to defeat larger foes in one all out attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach or surpass the kill count goal ends the battle and will be written into the history books, while others succumb to the reaper knowing that their names will be forgotten in time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
