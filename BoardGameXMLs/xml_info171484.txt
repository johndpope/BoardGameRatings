			<description>Official description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It's a mad dash to get your car to exit the street as fast as possible. One  player is the Road Builder. He extends the road on every turn by placing a new tile down. The other players are Drivers  They roll the game die and decide which way to move, hoping to speed off the board before another tile is played. It's a frantic race to the finish!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round, a different player takes the role of the Road Builder, and all of the other players become Drivers. The Road Builder's goal is to lay down all of their tiles before a Driver can Exit the roadway. The Drivers are trying to exit from the roadway before any other Drivers, as well as before the Road Builder lays the last tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The road tiles have special features, including tunnels (which allow the player to &amp;quot;warp&amp;quot; to any other tunnel space when landing on one by exact count), or the dreaded &amp;quot;No Exit,&amp;quot; which blocks the road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recommended to play enough rounds so every player has a chance to be the Road Builder. Rules are included for both &amp;quot;Road Builder versus everyone else&amp;quot; and team play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
