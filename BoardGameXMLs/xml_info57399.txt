			<description>Each player has 6 balls in his or her color, also, there are six red balls. The goal of the game is to eliminate 4 of the red balls. The balls are randomly put (in fact: shaken) into little holes which are used as playing fields. A move consists of moving a ball to an adjacent empty hole or jumping over another one, which is then removed. The red balls may also move, but cannot jump.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
