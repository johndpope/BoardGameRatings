							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Plentiful Food Bounty</name>
									
			<description>In The Democratic Republic of Korea (North Korea), food is plentiful. Bluff your way through this game of taking food supplied by the Supreme Leader, but don't be greedy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;2 Bags for sorting your plentiful bounty of food.&lt;br/&gt;30 Food Tokens (Rice, Wheat, Fish, Chicken, Bread, and Vegetables)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player secretly takes any number of tokens from one bag and places them in the second bag. He then offers the two bags to any second player of his choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This player has three choices:&lt;br/&gt;A) Pick one bag as his own. Then, both players count the number of tokens in their bags. The player with the most tokens (food) in their bag should be ashamed for taking more than they need and the player with the least tokens chooses a token from their bag to give to the shamed player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the number of tokens in each bag is equal, all the tokens must be placed in one bag and one token is drawn at random and eliminated from the game. After this is resolved, the bags should be given to another player by the second player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B) Take both bags, move tokens, and then offer the bags to another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C) Take both bags, draw one random token from one bag, and pass the bags to another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play repeats until three types of tokens (food) are depleted or one player accumulates 15 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
