							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Clash: Ascension of the Elements</name>
									
			<description>A quick competitive card game for 3-6 players, where you and your opponents use the elements of nature to shape the world to your will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clash is a fast paced card game in which each turn you make tactical decisions to empower your elements or weaken those of your opponents. Every card played directly affects your score and can directly or indirectly affect other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players play a card from their hand and then pass their hand to the player on their right. The player on their left takes a turn. When a player receives a hand of cards, they draw a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the last card is drawn from the deck, one more round is played, and then the game is scored. Each card played is equal to its score card in the middle of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
