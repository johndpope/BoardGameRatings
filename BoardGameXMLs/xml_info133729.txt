			<description>The national Skate Tour is coming to your ramp, so now is the chance to show the judges your stuff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You started with an Ollie Impossible, playing to the judges for a while, but your buddy pulled a sweet Tail Slide followed up with a Double Kickflip, so now the judges think he&amp;rsquo;s the pro.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So should you go for a big trick right away? &lt;br/&gt;You have to decide right now, because as your first Skate Tour, you can&amp;rsquo;t afford to hesitate, otherwise your buddy will end up the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So pull some easy tricks to warm up, but don&amp;rsquo;t let someone else steal your big finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To compete, lay down a stronger trick than the previous skater or play a better executed one by laying down more cards of the same trick. If you run out of tricks, that&amp;rsquo;s good! It means you&amp;rsquo;ve gone the distance and shown off your whole routine!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only can you enjoy Skate Tour on its own, but the tricks are printed on a complete deck of poker cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A trick-beating game for 2 to 6 players, Skate Tour brings the heavy one-upmanship of skateboarding to your table!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
