			<description>This treasure hunt is played on a spiral board; there is a treasure in the middle that players are trying to reach. Each player is secretly assigned the color of one of the pawns, and each player gets three cards. &lt;br/&gt;The active player rolls two dice and multiplies the result with the number of one of the cards in his/her hands to move the pawn of the same color (as the card) the corresponding number of fields. If the pawn lands on a spiral, it changes positions with another pawn; if it lands on a feather, it can move the double distance. &lt;br/&gt;When the first pawn reaches the center field, the secret colors are revealed, and the player who has the same color as the winning pawn wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
