Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Krono is a free, digital Collectible Card Game (digital CCG) from Large Animal Games, designed to settle the age-old question: Which were the greatest warriors in history?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the distant future, time has started to unravel. Temporal Rifts have begun to appear, creating destructive links to the past and plunging the world into near-apocalyptic ruin. A few survivors, known only as Traversers, are able to harness the power of these Rifts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Krono, you play the role of a Traverser, travelling between the Rifts to assemble an army that lays claim to the greatest soldiers of the past, present, and future. Choose from samurai warriors, Viking berserkers, knights of Camelot, Aztec warriors, and more. Using this force, you will battle for survival and supremacy in this shattered future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Directed at strategy card game players, Krono is an innovative combination of classic CCG action and deck-building games. Combine unit and command cards from your custom decks to compete for control of three different zones. Capture two zones and you win the game. The premise is simple, but the gameplay is deeply strategic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planned for iOS, Android and the web in 2013, Krono emerged from one of Large Animal's Sandbox Days, where our staff are free to experiment with new game ideas. The game proved so popular internally that we decided to share Krono with the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
