			<description>Hero Express is a superhero re-theme of Arkham Express by David Willems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will select one of the six included Heroes, or make your own, each with a unique special ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a player's turn they will roll 5 Hero dice with unique symbols on each side, after rolling they have the option of re-rolling 3 more times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the &amp;quot;Villain&amp;quot; symbol is rolled on a die it is locked and cannot be re-rolled (unless the hero has an ability that allows it).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If 3 Villain symbols appear a new crime is reported and a new villain appears in Dark City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other sides of the dice include movement, Hero tokens (spent to use superpowers and items), recovery, and combat symbols (used when fighting the villains).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capturing Villains allow the gathering of Justice Points, which are spent at a super secret location to purchase new abilities and items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If at anytime there is 9 active crimes on the board, they Mayor will replace your team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player must carefully choose how to use their abilities, items and hero tokens to thwart crimes and ultimately draw the Crimelord from hiding and defeat him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Again I would like to thank David Willems for allowing me to create this re-theme, and for creating Arkham Express.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
