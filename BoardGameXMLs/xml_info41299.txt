			<description>Published by and using 28mm miniatures by Eureka Miniatures in Australia, this abstract boardgame is set in their Pax Limpopo universe. The British lancers can only move diagonally forward. The clockwork Russian pigs can only move orthogonally like a rook (again, never backward). The abandoned, unhappy horses are terrain pieces but can be moved like a pawn (but into any of the eight squares around it) if the dice are right. Movement is blocked by the horses, your opponent's pieces and your own pieces. However, if you can end a move on an opponent's piece, it is removed from the game. The first player to get three of his pieces to his opponent's start line (or prevents his opponent from winning) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, two six-sided dice are rolled and the results, like in backgammon, can move one or two of your pieces. On a result of doubles, a player can move one horse and then take his regular move, or on any result of one, can move a horse instead of moving one of his pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a full colour 11&amp;quot; x 17&amp;quot; board (not mounted), 6 British Lancers on unicycles, 6 Russian clockwork pigs, and 6 forlorn-looking horses sitting on their rumps. All figures come unpainted. The pigs must be assembled. There is a one-page instruction sheet with a &amp;quot;history&amp;quot; of the battle on the back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
