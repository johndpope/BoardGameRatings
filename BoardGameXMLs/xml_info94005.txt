			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tall Ships 8: The H.M.S. Victory is the greatest of our Tall Ships yet. &amp;quot;The H.M.S. Victory&amp;quot; gives you a historically accurate view the top deck of the famous British Ship of the Line. Perfect for bording actions, fending off sea beasts, or any other skirmish action. The total finished ship size is a monsterous 24 inches by 50 inches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set comes as a pdf product that is designed so you get the most for your money when you print them.  Designed to be easily printed on any home computer, print only the sections you need for game play.  (See the instructions page provided.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SPECIAL BONUS: You also get a matching set from our TopoTile line, making this set mesh perfectly with our upcoming line of beach and island tile sets and for extra open water battles!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning: Make sure that you are purchasing the correct scale! Many of our maps are available in four different scales and grid overlays, so getting the correct product will make all the difference! Also, this is a top-down view only of the upper deck which does not show multiple decks, nor is is a 3D papercraft model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
