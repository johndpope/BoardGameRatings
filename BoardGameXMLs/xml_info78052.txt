			<description>Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart 3D is a racing game in which the player controls characters from the Crash Bandicoot universe, most of whom race in karts. The game employs tilt-screen controls, allowing the player to steer the kart by tilting the iPhone or iPod Touch in a steering wheel fashion. The karts accelerate automatically. To get around tough turns on a track, the player can initiate a &amp;quot;power slide&amp;quot; by tapping and holding a finger on the screen. The game features a number of racing modes (including a story mode, a quick race mode and a tournament mode) and a total of 12 tracks to race on. Scattered throughout the tracks are weapons that can be picked up and used against the other racers in a bid to hinder their performance, such as bombs and oil slicks. Special &amp;quot;speed zippers&amp;quot; can be found on the ground that can, if driven over, boost the player's speed for a short time. The same effect can be achieved by picking up a certain power-up off the track and activating it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart 3D, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
