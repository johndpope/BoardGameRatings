			<description>ARKHAM TERROR: EXPERIMENTAL THERAPY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patients at Miskatonic State Hospital for the Insane receive state of the art therapy &amp;ndash; 1923 state of the art! There is something going on here. The players take on the roles of doctors and patients. Each turn they make up clues that show what is actually going on. After a plot is uncovered they must stop it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this Engle Matrix Game players pick a character to champion. Each turn they buy the right to make up what action happens next in the game. Action are not automatic. They pick another player to be their referee. The ref sets the &amp;quot;to happen&amp;quot; roll. Other players may jump in with counter-arguments forcing a dice rolling contest. At first the players uncover(make up) clues that reveal what the evil plot is. One they've created their enemy they work together to save the world... or at least most do. Players can opt to be evil and try and bring the plot to fruition. Since different plots emerge each time the game never plays the same way twice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the characters are mentally ill but this doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop them from helping. They were probably saving the world from Lovecraftian monsters before being committed anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an intermediate level Matrix Game. It comes in a box with a 20x15 inch hard board map, character sheet booklet, rules booklet, scenario booklet, wooden counters, plastic gold coins, and 2 dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TYPE: Intermediate Engle Matrix Game&lt;br/&gt;PLAYERS: 2 to 10&lt;br/&gt;AGE: 13 to adult&lt;br/&gt;DURATION: 2 hours&lt;br/&gt;COMPLEXITY: Moderate&lt;br/&gt;REPLAYABILITY: High&lt;br/&gt;COST: $40.00&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
