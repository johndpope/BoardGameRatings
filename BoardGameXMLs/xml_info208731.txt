Touted as the definitive American Civil War tactical strategy game, Scourge of War: Chancellorsville, is a must-have for all American Civil War wargamers.  Scourge of War: Chancellorsville offers twenty historical or alternate history single player scenarios set in the midst of the bloody action of the Battle of Chancellorsville, in which the Robert E.
