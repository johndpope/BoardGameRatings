							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">That Damn Dirty Word</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That Damn Dirty Word: Human&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the big, bold and ultimately blank space opera galaxy of Big Damn Sci-Fi there was one promise and one promise alone: Embrace the alien for there are no Humans. With this core companion we break that promise, providing a basic profile for Humans  along with a host of other pre-made Alien species ready to be used and adapted as the Game Master and players see fit for their galaxy and games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is a Core Companion?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big Damn Sci-Fi is a generic Space Opera game, open for any universe of film, literature or your own devises. Its Galaxy is as big and broad as the imagination of you or your places. With a canvas that wide and blank the doors are open for an infinite number of Species, planets, technologies, histories, biology and cultures... But sometimes it can be handy to have a few aliens, armoury items, unique Species Features, and other pre-made goodies ready to drop a into a game on and transform into an important extra, object of a quest, dire problem to be solved or whatever role you&amp;rsquo;ve envisioned. A Core Companion is provides just that; a bit more for Big Damn Sci-Fi, adding to the basic content already presented in the core book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That Damn Dirty Word contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    New rules for Armoury and Experience points.&lt;br/&gt;    An expanded list of Species Features for even more variety.&lt;br/&gt;    Additional Armoury items.&lt;br/&gt;    A Bestiary of pre-made Species, including the dreaded and controversial Human.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
