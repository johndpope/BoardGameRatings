			<description>A 13&amp;times;13 variant of Chinese chess, originally invented by artist and designer Chen Wei in 1987, then redeveloped and awarded a design patent in 2009. Each player has 12 pieces corresponding to the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each piece moves in a different way, appropriate to the type of animal, for example, the snake moves in an S-shape. The object of the game is to checkmate the dragon, which is the equivalent to the king or general in Chinese chess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name given to this game in Chinese is &amp;quot;中国棋&amp;quot; which literally means &amp;quot;Chinese chess&amp;quot;. (The game known in English as Chinese chess is called &amp;quot;象棋&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;elephant chess&amp;quot;, in Chinese.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameboard for Chinese Zodiac chess is the subject of Chinese utility model patents CN303396390S, CN301049385 and CN87300760.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
