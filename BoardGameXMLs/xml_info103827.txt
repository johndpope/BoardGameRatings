			<description>In Borderline, players race to bring their pieces across the board to their home row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is arranged in two 6x6 fields, separated by a two square &amp;quot;borderline&amp;quot;.  Rolling two dice, players bring pieces onto the board and move them, with each die being used to move one piece.  Pieces may only move two spaces in a single direction before being forced to change direction.  In this manner, the pieces will zig-zag across the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landing on an opponent's piece will cause it to be returned to the holding area.  Designated safe spaces will prevent this capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a piece lands on a square in the borderline it is possible for that player to bring on an additional piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to bring all 6 pieces to the home row is the winner.  Alternatively, a player may win by removing all opposing pieces from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
