			<description>It&amp;rsquo;s 1928 and the Don is dying! The latest attempt on the Don&amp;rsquo;s life has left him on his death bed with around a week to live.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seeking a worthy replacement to head the family, the Don has ordered his Captains to prove themselves before his final departure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As one of these Captains, its up to you to gain enough money and notoriety in the hopes of fulfilling the wishes stated in his last will and testament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will slowly begin to increase your notoriety by owning buildings, winning gang fights, and making heaps of money running extortion and speakeasy rackets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh , don't forget! The Don's other Captains intend to do unto you far worse than what you do unto them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
