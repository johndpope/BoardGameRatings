			<description>From the rule book:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Counting Town is an engaging, imaginative and colourful play set that invites the child to do something very special: learn while playing.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rule book provides 12 games for children to play.  Each game is provided as a learning excercise for the children playing.  The games focus on the language and number concepts such as colours, distance, time, quantity, sequencing etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All 12 games follow the same sequence of play:&lt;br/&gt;The teacher setups the board for play.&lt;br/&gt;A background story is provided for the game.&lt;br/&gt;The teacher poses questions to the children based on the board setup.&lt;br/&gt;The children then take turns based on the directions of the teacher (i.e.  the teacher directs the children to move the parts around the board - the teacher then asks additional question to the children).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
