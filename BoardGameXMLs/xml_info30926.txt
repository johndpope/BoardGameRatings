			<description>This game is designed to give its players first-hand experience with the problems confronting the countries of Central America and with difficult U.S. policy choices in the region. Between 20 and 40 players (this is obviously a classroom game) participate in a simulation of real-world political struggles and conflicts that will raise fundamental issues about Central America and the role of the US in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of four 15-minute periods of activity followed by a debriefing and policy discussion. Players are divided into five teams: the Guatemalan Government, the Army/Wealthy Class, the Guerrillas, the Peasants/Workers, and the US Government. An initial 15-minute Strategy Session within each team is followed by three 15-minute months of an electoral campaign involving discussions and negotiations among the teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team presents a brief Position Statement to start the action. Over the course of the campaign, each team may use means ranging from moral persuasion to military force in pursuit of its goals. The Army/Wealthy Class and the Guerrillas may opt to launch offensives. The Army can take over at any time, and they also have the option to &amp;quot;silence&amp;quot; members of any of the other Guatemalan teams. At the end, the team in power has the option of holding an election. All Guatemalans except silenced members and guerrillas are eligible to vote. Peasants/Workers have two votes; others have one. Guerrillas may vote by joining the Peasants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
