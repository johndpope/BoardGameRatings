			<description>Giac My  is designed for miniature wargaming involving the recent conflict in Southeast Asia. Several aspects are covered in these rules that are normally not found in other wargaming rules for the modern period, such as tunnel warfare and pungi sticks. Although large formal battles can be fought (and sometimes were in Vietnam), the main thrust of this rulebook is guerrilla and counter-insurgency warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Giac My is designed to simulate small unit combat in Southeast Asia, but it can be used for 'liberation wars' anywhere, or small unit infantry combat in general. Obviously,, many facets of unconventional warfare are difficult to simulate in a gaming format. However, we have tried to include whatever is applicable (and feasible) for tactical level engagements of a reasonable size. We hope that these rules will be well received by those interested in modern miniatures wargaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scale: one inch equals ten meters, one turn is forty seconds. Each figure equals one man or vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternate title: The game is labeled GI'AC MY on the cover, but referred to as Giac My throughout the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
