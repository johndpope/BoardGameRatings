			<description>From the designer's website...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you've been out drinking all night, now it's time to go home. The object of the game is to make it home safe (call a cab). You must drive your car all around the board to the end where home is. On your journey you will encounter some real wacky stuff, laughing your ass off the whole time. You might stop off at another bar or stop for some fast food. You might be able to call a cab to drive you home (that's the plan). You better hope you get a chance to call a cab because there are police cars all over the board waiting to pull over DRUNK DRIVERS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your car lands on one of these spaces you must take a sobriety test (30 different tests, tongue twisters, memory tests, physical challenges, etc...), if you fail, you get a DWI and will find yourself in JAIL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are over 100 spaces on the board (exploding with exceptional artwork and design) telling you to do all sorts of crazy things. The game can be different every time you play it. You can rear-end people, cut each other off the road and even get into an accident, 3 accidents and/or 3 DWI's and your out of the game. You can also take a different route the next time you play, there are forks in the roads so you can go two different ways, the long route or the short route, which way will you be going? Who knows what's going to happen to you on your way home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So call a cab and stay out of jail. The players in the cabs usually make it home before anyone, thus being the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
