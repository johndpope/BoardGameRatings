							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Peril</name>
									
			<description>A pseudo co-op game that secretly places one player against all their friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much like fabled assassins of old, one player must bide time and patiently wait for the opportune moment to strike. But should your strike fail, or you wait too long, beware the others may notice and your life be now in danger. For the others, however, a perilous fight for survival while the assassin stalks the shadows and his identity remain unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In PERIL, players play cards from their hand to either save or damage the turn player, secretly attempting to identify the assassin and destroy him before he destroys them. But be weary, who you destroy could be one of your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
