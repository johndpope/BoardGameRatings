			<description>Dicey is a new demon dice game, with a unique feature. Rascally shaped dice make a mockery of throwing a six in this fast, fun and furiously tricky game of chance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The result of Dicey's unique shape means the odds of throwing a 6 is now about three times harder (1 in 18) and throwing a 1 that much easier (about 1 in 3). Throwing the other four number has about the same odds as for a normal dice (1 in 6)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 ways to play depending on the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first game named Dicey is a 3-6 player game has the objective of winning all your opponents' counters. You take one dice and 8 counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players roll in real time and when someone throws a 6 they win the pot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you roll the following numbers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 - Add a counter to the pot&lt;br/&gt;2 - If someone spots you roll this, they can take a counter from you&lt;br/&gt;3 - no action&lt;br/&gt;4 - no action&lt;br/&gt;5 - Must stop rolling for 5 seconds&lt;br/&gt;6 - Win the pot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second option is a two player game named Double Trouble with the objective of winning all counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You each take 10 counters and two dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You both ante one token the pot and make a single roll in turn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you roll&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A single 1 - place 1 token into the pot&lt;br/&gt;A double 1 - place 2 tokens into the pot&lt;br/&gt;Double 2,3,4,5 - You lose the round and the pot goes to the other player&lt;br/&gt;A single 6 - You win the pot&lt;br/&gt;A double 6 - You win the game automatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third game is for 3-6 players named Last Man Standing, with the objective of not being the player to put the last token into the pot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start with an agreed number of counters each, three for a quick game or more for a longer game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player in turn rolls 3 dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 - Put a counter into the pot&lt;br/&gt;2 - Give a counter to the person on the left&lt;br/&gt;3 - Give a counter to the person on the right&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have no tokens you are not out as you may get some back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When only 1 token not in the pot  the dice actions change&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 - move a counter left&lt;br/&gt;3 - move a counter right&lt;br/&gt;6 - place a counter in the pot and lose the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fourth and last way to play is named The solo challenge and is for a single player. This is a challenge mode with the aim of rolling specific faces in the least number of rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
