			<description>FOOTY! is a table-top simulation of the game of Australian Rules Football.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FOOTY! includes all the charts and tables needed to play the game, as well as a sample scoresheet.  The game is being re-published by Hot Stove Games under license from Valgames, and will be initially available in electronic format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll the dice on the Play Chart to determine what type of play is happening on the field.  Additional rolls are then necessary to test player skills, team strength, or other ratings in play.  Goals and behinds are scored by rolling the dice against the chosen player's scoring ratings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All seasons from 1993 to 2004 will be available for owners of the game to purchase.  Additional seasons will be made available as data becomes available for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
