			<description>The &amp;quot;model&amp;quot; game for enhancing a child&amp;rsquo;s creativity. Based on the best-selling original Conjecture, Conjecture For Kids is designed for younger players. The object of the game is to sculpt modeling dough into a topic identified on your game card in hopes that your team can guess the right answer before your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game offers parents and teachers a wonderful tool to help children develop hand-eye coordination, and teach them to associate imagery with words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to the classic game of Pictionary, only using sculpting dough rather than drawings, Conjecture For Kids offers hours of entertainment for parties of all sizes. To assist the artistically-challenged, we permit the sculptor to make motions with the dough, however noises (aside from laughter) are forbidden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hilarious game features two varieties of uniquely scented dough that will last several years if maintained properly, and because it is water based, it won&amp;rsquo;t make a mess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
