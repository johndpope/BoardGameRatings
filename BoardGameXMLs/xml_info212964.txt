							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Void</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Into the Void&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the anti-spinward edges of Earth&amp;rsquo;s territory in the galaxy lies the Void. A roughly spherical section of space approximately one hundred parsecs in diameter, the Void is a place spacers avoid&amp;mdash;and with good reason&amp;mdash;there are no stars to be found there. The Void is so full of dust, gas, and debris that it effectively blocks any starlight from passing through, making it a dark circle in the night sky of many worlds. Within the Void are dozens of shattered solar systems, each made up of burned and blasted planets slowly orbiting the remains of now-dead stars. These brown dwarfs are compacted and frozen cinders&amp;mdash;all that&amp;rsquo;s left of once life-giving suns&amp;mdash;with most of their mass having been ejected into space as some unknown event consumed them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Void is a mini-setting for science-fiction gaming, meant to be easily dropped into any RPG setting dealing with space travel and the dangers thereof. It's system-agnostic, and while there's a great deal of excellent, well-researched material here, plenty is left readily open to the Game Master's imagination and capacity for customization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
