							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Victoria&#039;s Battles Scenario Book One: Egypt and the Sudan 1881-1898</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first of three scenario books that will provide both historical and fictional based gaming scenarios set during the period of 19th Century British Colonial conflict. The book contains 7 scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each scenario has been well play-tested. Each will provide the basis for an exciting wargaming experience using the Victoria's Battles rule system.  Not all of the scenarios are perfectly balanced and this is intentional as engagements were often less balanced affairs.  While it may be difficult to actually win the scenario outright, the tactical challenges make for exciting games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
