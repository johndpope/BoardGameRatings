							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quick Draw McGraw Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Quick Draw McGraw was manufactured by Edu-Cards Manufacturing Corporation, New York City. There are 36 cards in the deck, each 9cm long x 5.8cm wide. Cards are numbered one through ten in the upper right and lower left corners. Each card has circular symbols in the center representing one of four &amp;quot;suits&amp;quot; and matching the number printed in the corners. The circular symbols are supposedly &amp;quot;bullet holes&amp;quot; - the result of McGraw's ability. The &amp;quot;Ace&amp;quot; or number one card features a sketch of &amp;quot;Quick Draw McGraw&amp;quot;, with the words Lucky One printed across the top and bottom of the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
