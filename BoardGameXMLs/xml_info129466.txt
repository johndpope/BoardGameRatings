			<description>Card game with 52 cards. There are 10 of each colour, numbered 1 to 10. Plus there are 4 multiplication cards, 4 subtraction cards and 4 dividing cards. The latter three groups are called #Sign' cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules suggest you may play lots of traditional games with the cards (but I doubt it). The publisher does include the rules to three different games;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fives&lt;br/&gt;Players must build up a row of five cards that total a number multiplied by five. The normal cards must be of of the same colour but not the sign cards. You do not have to use a sign card if you don't want to. You add and discard cards from your hand as in Rummy games. The first player to reveal a correct hand of five cards, wins that round. The score is one point for each five generated by the total i.e. 20 would score 4, 45 would score 9, and so on. The rules helpfully suggest that the maximum number that could be achieved with five cards is 2,560, and that total would generate 512 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Auction Maths&lt;br/&gt;This is a trick taking game and the only game where the colours are ranked; Black, Blue, Green, Red. Black is the lowest ranked colour and Red is the highest.The game is for four players, playing as partners. Both partnerships bid to claim a number of trick (5 being the minimum, 13 the most). Your partner can overcall your bid if he wants to. The player with the winning bid can choose a colour to be the 'Double' suit. This means that every card in that colour counts as if it was doubled (A 4 card would be an 8 card, a x4 card would be a x8 card, and so on). One thing to note, players do not have to follow suit. Any card can be played to any trick. When the calling side wins a trick, it only scores if the four cards played (and in the order the cards were laid) total 25 or more. If not, the trick is laid to one side and doesn't count. You score for each trick made plus a bonus for making your game. The opposition score for every trick by which you fail to make your contract.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number Building&lt;br/&gt;Players agree before the start of a hand, the total that five cards laid out must achieve. The rules suggest a number under 50 is the wisest choice. Once agreed (before you see your cards), all players will work towards that total. Every player gets 6 cards and must lay a normal number card in front of themselves in the first round. In subsequent rounds a player may draw a card of the deck or a card of the discard pile or can lay a card next to his cards on the table. Once a player has met the total successfully, the hand ends and scoring is based on the small number in the corners of the cards. If you make the total with 5 cards of the same colour, an extra 150 is scored. This bonus reduces if two colours were involved. After an agreed number of hands, the highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
