			<description>This Hasbro release bills itself as being &amp;quot;The Official Cup Stacking game&amp;quot;. A team has 3 stacks of cups (the size and shape of typical party cups) that are positioned about 1 foot apart. To begin you must make 3 pyramids, one at a time, with your 3 stacks (2 outer 3-cup pyramids and a central 6-cup one). You must then convert each pyramid back down to the original stacks of cups. The first person to finish down-stacking wins. If a pyramid collapses while it is being built, it must be corrected before moving on to the next. However, if a fumble occurs during the down-stacking process, you may continue to down stack without having to rebuild the pyramid. The game has rules for one-on-one and relay race competition, and also stacking tips. &lt;br/&gt; Kup Stax is actually mentioned in the &amp;quot;Grade 5 Physical Education Required Curriculum&amp;quot; as a way for students to &amp;quot;demonstrate perceptual motor efficiency&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Crazy-Cups&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
