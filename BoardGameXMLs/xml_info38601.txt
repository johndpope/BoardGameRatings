							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Last Stand: The First Battle of Thermopylae (480 BC)</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;In the Battle of Thermopylae of 480 BC, an alliance of Greek city-states fought the invading Persian Empire at the pass of Thermopylae in central Greece. Vastly outnumbered, the Greeks held back the Persians for three days in one of history's most famous last stands.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The performance of the defenders at the battle of Thermopylae is often used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain to maximize an army's potential, and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds. Even more, both ancient and modern writers used the Battle of Thermopylae as an example of the superior power of a well trained army defending native soil.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A &amp;ldquo;fast and easy&amp;rdquo; set of wargame rules for use with miniatures. The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures mounted two per base. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every four turns represents a day of fighting, after which surviving units reform in their deployment area for the next day of battle. At the start of the third day, an encircling force of Immortals and skirmishers sets up at the rear of the Greek forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units portrayed in the game include King Leonidas, Javelin Skirmishers, Archer Skirmishers, Commanders, Spartans, Greek Hoplites, and Persian Immortals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
