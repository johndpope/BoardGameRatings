			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slapjack is a simple children's boardgame that appears to be related to, but distinct from, the Slap Jack card game...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game all 44 cards are dealt face down to the players. (These are kept face down during the course of the game.) Players use a spinner to move cardboard pawns around a board. Each space has an instruction for the player to follow. Some spaces ask players to perform physical actions (which have no real effect on game play). Some spaces ask players to give or take cards from other players. This is significant because the object of the game is to collect all the cards. If you run out of cards you are eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a few strategically placed Slapjack spaces on the board. If someone lands on one of these spots, then each player takes a card at random (again all cards are kept face down at all times) and puts it in the center of the board. If someone puts down a Slapjack card, then the first player that slaps the card wins the hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a variant game listed in the rules where players use just the game cards and play a single card down one at a time. If a Slapjack card is played, then the first player to slap the card wins the hand. The last player with any cards wins. (This is essentially the Slap Jack card game, albeit with a smaller  than standard deck.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
