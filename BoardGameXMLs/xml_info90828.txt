			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MotoGP 07 is the first game in the MotoGP franchise to be developed by Capcom. It is based on the 2007 championship season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues the franchise&amp;rsquo;s efforts to mesh arcade and simulation racing into a single game. There are 17 licensed tracks from the season, and 22 official racers. Players can choose from a range of game modes including Season mode, Quick Race, Time Attack, Challenge Mode, and split-screen multiplayer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The difficulty level has been ramped up from the Namco games, but many of the staple features were carried into the title, including a large number of advanced control options, response affecting weather, and three different driving settings that modulate how realistic the bikes handle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no online multiplayer included in the title, but players can face off 2 player split-screen action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
