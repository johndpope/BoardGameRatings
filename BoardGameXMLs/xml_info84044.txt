							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Magic Masks II</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Masks have enthralled us for centuries as a medium for mystic transformation, divine communication, and spiritual ritual. Here are 50 more masks that will enthrall your foes while the rest of your party whups up on them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sample:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animal Mask (bear)&lt;br/&gt;Three times per day the wearer of this mask can use it to transform into a bear. This spell functions similar to a polymorph self spell (as described in the Dungeons and Dragons Player's Handbook, Third Edition) as though cast by an 18th level wizard. The wearer can also talk to bears as though they were under the effect of a permanent speak with animals spell for as long as the mask is worn. The mask merges with the bear form and becomes part of the wearer while transformed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
