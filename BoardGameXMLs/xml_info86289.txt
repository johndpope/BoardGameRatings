			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Love is a sci-fi MMO created by Eskil Steenberg that is free to download. Players take the roles of scavengers on a small planet that must work together with other scavengers to survive. The game is very cooperation oriented, and players work together as tribes gathering resources and tokens that improve the abilities and equipment of everyone in the village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five other tribes that act as rivals for resources. These tribes will attack your village if they are provoked, and will rebuild if their village is destroyed. The art style in Love has an impressionist feel to it which marks the images with a unique display. The game is programmed using procedural algorithms that react to actions by players, making the game effectively unscripted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
