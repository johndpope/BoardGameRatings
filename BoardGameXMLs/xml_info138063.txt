			<description>Promotional game for the Dutch bank Raiffeisenbank and this is The Bank Letter Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple crossword card game, similar to games like Lexicon and Kan-U-Go. In your turn you may play a maximum of 4 cards. Words must be formed that use at least one letter of an existing word (except for the first word obviously which, incidentally, must be a four letter word). Any word can be extended though, if possible. Game includes two Jokers which have an image of an old motor car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to use all his cards wins the round. The other players total the values of their unused cards and the winner of the round scores a total of all those points (each card has a number value on it).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the game is the first player to reach a pre-agreed score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The backs of the cards are quite novel. They can be used to make four different jigsaws. It is suggested that 6 to 8 year olds might like to do the jigsaws. I doubt it, they are extremely difficult for their size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
