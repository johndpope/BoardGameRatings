			<description>The players lead a horde of monsters attempting to pillage various civilizations in EVENIA. To win, be the player with the most &amp;ldquo;Pillage Points&amp;rdquo; by the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt; Pillage! is a card game where each player controls a race of monsters attacking villages in Evenia. Each pillage deck acts as the location the monsters are pillaging; both its rich bountiful booty ripe for the taking and the powerful defenses set to stop the vile creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside the decks are loot, goods, weapons, and other ransacking potential, but also knights, militia, mercenaries, walls, and other various things to stop the monsters&amp;rsquo; onslaught. Many of these monsters do not play well together and will attempt to steal and harm one another just to be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the final card is drawn from the Pillage Deck. At that time the area is considered fully pillaged and the monsters leave to search for another place to ransack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
