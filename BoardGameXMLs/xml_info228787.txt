			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fantasy adventure compatible with first edition gaming and OSRIC&amp;trade;&lt;br/&gt;Recommended for 4-6 player characters of level 0 to1&lt;br/&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for Zero Level Player Character Creation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hello and welcome, adventurers and Game Masters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve spent your whole life among the stolid, staid and downright stubborn people of Breyburgh, a city of goat herders that actually takes its name from the tenacious animal&amp;rsquo;s vocalization. As a young person growing up in this boring backwater village, you always thought you were special and meant for something different. Something more than the life of a farmer, a goatherd, a miller or a tanner. You&amp;rsquo;ve dreamt of something grander: a life of adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your escape has always been just a dream, until now. Something strange and troubling is afoot in the village of Breyburgh. The cats in the village have gone missing. First one or two, which could be explained by forest predators, but now all the cats in the village are gone&amp;hellip;and no one knows why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As luck would have it, now there&amp;rsquo;s a visiting stranger involved, a magic user no less, whose feline companion went missing. He&amp;rsquo;s offered a reward if someone can find his lost cat Jasmine and return her to him. This is the chance you&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting your whole life for! It&amp;rsquo;s your time to shine; if you and your companions can find this mage&amp;rsquo;s cat you just might become &amp;ldquo;The Heroes of Breyburgh&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains an adventure into the Lands of Faerie, where the players will face all sorts of riddles, traps and nonsense before discovering the fate of the lost cats and, perhaps if they are very lucky, finding a leprechaun &amp;ndash; and nabbing his pot o&amp;rsquo; gold or coercing a wish from him or some other grand reward the bards always sing of! It is compatible with OSRIC, 1E and 2E game systems, and its recommended for 4-6 player characters of levels 0-1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find amazing Old-school style art and a completely detailed map in the Old School blue &amp;amp; white style, with detailed encounters for each area!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We also provide a fully detailed town setting, the Village of Breyburgh, for use in this module and others to come from Starry Knight Press or in the GM&amp;rsquo;s own adventures. The village comes with a detailed background history and map, done in the Old School style, and tagged with detailed information on the most important local buildings, landmarks and features!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The supplement also provides GMs with a well thought out system for creating a band of neophyte player characters with a shared history and background. Players will begin adventuring together from their very adolescence, and then set out into the wide world as a cohesive adventuring crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
