			<description>HARPE:  The Hugely Adaptable (Action/Anime) Role-Playing Engine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are built following a Template (Common, Daring, Dramatic, Heroic, Super-Heroic) to gain 0-4 Abilities and 0-4 Deeds.  These are narrative tags created by the player, with examples being things like:  Artistic Ability, Combat Ability, Linguistics Ability, Social Ability, Stealth, Survival, and Vehicle Operations.  Deeds indicate how often a character may utilize non-common Abilities before recovery periods (which vary), with values ranging from 1-7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different levels of Abilities have different dice pools, running from 1d6 to 4d6+4.  When an opposed action is resolved it causes the loser to accumulate &amp;quot;Points of Defeat&amp;quot; which are vaguely like abstracted hit points in other systems.  Points of Defeat regenerate during recovery periods.  Actions are resolved by rolling the dice pool and looking for successes in the results, the number of successes determining the nature of the outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat works in a similar way but offers various special situations.  Combat supports initiative, surprise, ambush, and so forth.  However, the combat round remains an abstracted series of events and the goal of the mechanics are to minimize the time spent rolling dice in combat in favor of developing an exciting narrative action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
