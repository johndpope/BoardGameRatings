							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes &amp; Hordes</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Solo Card game. Fantasy Theme. Summon Heroic Armies to beat back the Evil Hordes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a custom deck containing approximately 120 cards. There are eight types of cards: Men, Elf, Dwarf, Goblin, Undead, Dragon, multi-hero, and Event. The Men, Elves, and Dwarves are the player's forces (fighting in segregated groups), and the Goblins, Undead, and Dragons make up the three Evil Hordes. Whenever a Horde eliminates a group of Heroes, the player receives a Devastation Token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there are no cards left in the deck at the beginning of a turn. Victory is based on the number of Devastation Tokens received: four or more is a loss, two or more is a win, and three is a tie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
