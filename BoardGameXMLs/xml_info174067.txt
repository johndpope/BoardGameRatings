							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">FlipFight: Battle of Gettysburg</name>
									
			<description>FlipFight is a series of strategic manual dexterity micro-games. Battle of Gettysburg is the first game in the FlipFight series. The game pits Union and Confederate forces against each other in the pivotal Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players assume the roles of field commanders during the battle with access to different cavalry and infantry units. At the beginning of each game the battlefield is dynamically generated from a deck of key strategic locations -- from Round Top and the Devil's Den to Cemetery Hill and Seminary Ridge -- ensuring no two games will be the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turns, players select a combat unit from their reserves and flip it onto the battlefield in an attempt to seize control of a location or capture enemy forces to gain victory points. Infantry and cavalry units are not only different shapes, each has distinct strengths -- capturing a location featuring High Ground with infantry allows the player to perform an artillery strike, while cavalry can capture enemy infantry forces and remain in field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each strategic location has different values representing how difficult they were to control (units needed), and how valuable they were to each side's efforts (victory points). Combat units have varying levels of effectiveness, representing the makeup of their forces and the quality of their leadership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to earn 10 Victory Points through control of key locations or captured enemy forces wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
