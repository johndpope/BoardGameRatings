			<description>&amp;ldquo;In the early 1900's Germany began to build a fleet of warships to challenge the mighty British navy. When World War I began both sides anticipated a decisive battle of dreadnoughts that would leave one side in control of the Atlantic.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The two fleets met in 1916 at the Battle of Jutland. The conflict was marked by poor visibility and communications errors that created confusion on both sides. The battle was not decisive.

The game is designed to be played on the floor if possible, or two 7.5x5 foot tables may be used. Free print-and-play paper miniatures (flats) are provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a simplified order of battle that does not include cruisers, destroyers, and pre-dreadnought battleships. The German fleet consists of five Battle Cruisers and sixteen Battleships. The British fleet is composed of seven Battle Cruisers and twenty-four Battleships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Website for free rules and basic equipment: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.juniorgeneral.org/naval/jutland.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.juniorgeneral.org/naval/jutland.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
