							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bid</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The group game where brinkmanship collides with trivia to nerve-wracking effect.&lt;br/&gt;First use your knowledge to separate fact from fiction, then steel your nerves and face up to the dilemmas of the bidding. Bid too low and you'll be left behind, so you're tempted to go high - but it could all go horribly wrong. The only consolation is that everyone else is going through exactly the same thing.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt; Each round you have to bid according to how many facts you can identify as being correct from a list of ten. If you have the highest bid, you have to identify that many correct facts. If all your chosen facts are genuine, you score a point for each of them. If not, you get no points and the next highest bidder's choices are checked. Once someone has won the points for that round, the players who made lower bids score minus the difference between their bid and the bid of the person who won the points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
