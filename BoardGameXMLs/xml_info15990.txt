							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Storm Over Scandinavia</name>
									
			<description>Storm Over Scandinavia comes complete with nine map sections covering Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. The centerpiece of this new release is the re-issuing of Narvik. This release ties into Grand Europa by providing state-of-the-art Order of Battle information on Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish armed forces from 1939 to 1945 and German Northern Theater armed forces from 1940 to 1943.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five countersheets (1,400 counters) cover the entire theater of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Europa IV game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(from back of the box:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Narvik:&lt;br/&gt;This is an intense combined arms game. Germany has an overwhelming array of ground, sea and air forces for the invasion. The Allies have time and space on their side. While they can not stand toe to toe with the Germans, they can cause a lot of trouble; they can win the game. This is the second most popular The Europa Series game ever produced. It has a very even play balance and offers unending variations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Storm Over Scandinavia:&lt;br/&gt;The code name of the invasion: Weserubung. It started out as a junior officer and high command war game. A &amp;quot;what-if&amp;quot; scenario on how to invade Norway. It ended up as a full-blown, multi-corps invasion on the event of Germany's attack on France. The Europa level invasion of Norway. The combined arms are also present. The unit and time scales are at Europa levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Four Hour War:&lt;br/&gt;Germany invades Denmark. Will the Danes resist (that would make it a Five Hour War)? Germany used Denmark as a stepping stone to Norway. Germany had to have a perfect invasion of Denmark to ensure a chance of success against Norway. If you choose to play this scenario, as the Germans, good luck. It is an eye-popping special ops gamble. If you lose as the Germans, no easy invasion for Norway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Northern Theater of Operations (NTO):&lt;br/&gt;NTO Combines Weserubung and A Winter War. It begins with the Soviet attack against Finland. The western Allies may intervene to aid Finland. To do so they must transit through Norway. Norway may disagree with this and the Germans may intervene to prevent the Allied intervention. Makes your head hurt, don't it? Ownership of A Winter War (currently available from Games Research/Design (GR/D)) is required for this scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invasion Sweden:&lt;br/&gt;No tour of Scandinavia is complete without a visit to sunny Sweden, right? Well, why would the Germans invade Sweden? To prevent them from helping Norway? Maybe. To ensure a flow of iron ore to Germany? Perhaps. Because they can? Why not. Germany decided against this invasion, but now you have the option of testing out such an invasion in this scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
