							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">101 Dalmatians Puppy Rescue Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The object of this children&amp;rsquo;s game is to construct the longest line of rescued puppies. This is accomplished by bidding for either a Puppy card or a Cruella De Vil card as it is turned up from a draw pile. With a hand of numbered bidding cards the players bid simultaneously as each card is turned. High bid rescues a puppy and low bid must take a Cruella De Vil card. Once all the cards are won, and after subtracting one puppy card for each Cruella De Vil card held, the player with the longest line of rescued puppies wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
