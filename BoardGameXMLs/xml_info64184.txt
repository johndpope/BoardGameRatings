			<description>A high flying adventure in fun where rhymes rule! &lt;br/&gt; The Legend of the Book of Rhymes is an award winning game that takes you on an exciting adventure through the Land of Koob where an evil wizard has destroyed their wise ruler and the sacred Book of Rhymes.  Your journey will have you flying on a magical book, answering clues with words that rhyme and testing your fate along the way.  The people of Koob are counting on you to restore the Book of Rhymes and bring happiness back to their land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play - Each Scroll Card contains 3 clues.  To move along your journey, answer the 3 clues with 3 words that rhyme (Three + rhyme = Trhyme).  Encountering a &amp;quot;Twist of Fate&amp;quot; could be lucky or yucky.  Either way it's great fun!  The first player to reach the Tower of Trhymes wins the game and becomes the new ruler of Koob!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
