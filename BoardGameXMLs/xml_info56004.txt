							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Hunter Sen So</name>
									
			<description>Yes, you are a Space Hunter! Everything is your prey. Big or small, you hunt it all. Technology is your aid, but it is only used to enhance the thrill of the hunt. You delight in surprising your target, but savor when it surprises you. You have found something interesting, let&amp;rsquo;s hope it is fun to stalk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Space Hunter brings Auto Laser, Force Shell, Self Destruct and Distortion Shell to Sen So.  If you like starting with an advantage and having tricks up your sleeve, the Space Hunter is perfect for you.  The Space Hunter is a single player set that can be played against any of the Sen So variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sen So game system uses a unique set of octagon cards and card holders. Players have to set (program) actions before their current action is revealed. All players reveal actions together. This provides fast play for even large numbers of players.  Game scoring provides balance and keeps the leaders on their toes. Players are required to choose their weapons and abilities for each battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
