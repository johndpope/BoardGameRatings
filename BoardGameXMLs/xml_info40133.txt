			<description>Double purposed Italian game from Milan published in the '60s. A simple roll and move game played with bikes or cars on the same track (Giro d'Italia). A cycling race and a car race can be played on the same board. The cycling game features three teams of two riders (whereas the car race features 6 independent cars) and the race consists of eight stages, including a time-trial. Points are awarded to the first three riders in each stage, but not all the stages award the same number of points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
