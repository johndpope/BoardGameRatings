			<description>PICASSO - How quick on the draw are you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Be quick on the draw, then put a title to someone else's masterpiece.  Whether you're an artistic genius or just a doodler, PICASSO is a riot of fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick a card to see which title, phrase or saying you have to draw.  Each player has his own card, so everyone is drawing something different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Race to complete your drawing.  The first player finished yells 'Stop'.  Now see if you can recognize what each of the others has drawn.  Is that a picture of Pigs?  could it be Animal Farm?  Pigs might fly?  Surely not Hamlet?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a quick draw game that'll have you in stitches, but be warned - PICASSO might drive you to abstraction.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
