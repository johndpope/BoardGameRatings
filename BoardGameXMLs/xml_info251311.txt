			<description>Quest! is a tableau-building game in which your charter hires adventurers, equips them, and sends them out on quests in order to gain glory for your charter!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt a random charter which gives starting gold, a starting adventurer, and has a unique way to end the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you take to actions from among Acquire Cards, Activate a Card, Amass Wealth, Embark on a Quest, Mend Your Party, Reset a Row, or Retire Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can acquire adventurers or items for your adventurers by spending the gold gained from amassing wealth or from completing quests. Once embarked on a quest, a player must complete a series of tasks as stated on the quest card by rolling dice and checking for success. If a player succeeds at a majority of the tasks, that player retains the quest and gains its reward. Fail too many tasks and suffer the consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has retained enough quests to fulfill the charter's end game condition, the game ends. Each player counts the number of glory points on each quest they have retained they have won for their charter and the person with the most wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
