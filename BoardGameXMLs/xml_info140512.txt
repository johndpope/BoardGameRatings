							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sectorball: 12Touches Football</name>
									
			<description>Our ancestors invented a way to reduce the craving for playing football during the cold winter months. It was the year 1900. The game was coined &amp;ldquo;Gombfoci&amp;rdquo;, a rather self-explanatory term, which describes a game played with buttons from coats upon a kitchen table. It spread like wildfire and soon came to be well known in such far off lands as Spain, USA or Brazil. These people changed the rules and by this created a new game called &amp;ldquo;12 Touches&amp;rdquo;, which later became an even greater success than its predecessor. (Geraldo Cardoso D&amp;eacute;court&amp;rsquo;s, in 1928).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game simulates football, the board it is a small football field and both players control a team of disks (or rings), and move them by flicking or pressing their edges, in order to hit a smaller disc (the ball) with them. The players need to score   by moving the ball into the goal. &lt;br/&gt;A match takes 20 minutes divided in 2 halves of 10 minutes each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is turn-based, only the sector ball rule will change this. A turn normally consists of moving one of your buttons. The buttons have to slide on the table, but not by pushing or pulling. They can be moved by flicking or by pressing by the finger. The buttons cannot be lifted up and put elsewhere, only after goals and before goal-kicks, free kicks, penalties or corner kicks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sectorball actually means a valid pass in the football game. If you move a button and the ball stops close enough (maximum one button size) to another button controlled by you, then you get another turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is also suitable for solo play. The player then controls both sides. In this can be simulating whole world championships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can play single matches, tournament based matches, league or swiss system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are moving the two games in one box. Same board game, two approaches. East meets West on the same &amp;quot;soccer pitch&amp;quot;: Sector Ball Table Football vs. 12 Touches Brazilian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
