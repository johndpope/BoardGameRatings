							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Magical Land of Yeld (Playtest Edition 2.0)</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction to the Play Test Document:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome! The book you hold in your hands is a door, leading to the strange and dangerous world of Yeld. You and your friends can use this door to explore the dark forests and drowned castles of Yeld, to trade your childish ways for the strengths of a hero and to face off against the vampire prince Dragul and his mysterious Hunters of Yeld. All great adventures have a cost, but the price of this one is low. All this game requires of you and your friends is your time, creativity and attention, and a little bit of reading. Few adventures ask for so little.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Magical Land of Yeld is a fantasy adventure game for all ages. By that I mean it's a game that can be enjoyed by both children and adults. Nick and I are trying to tap the feel of classic adventure role-playing video games that we enjoyed as a kids (Final Fantasy 2, Legend of Zelda and Secret of Mana) and young adult oriented adventure anime we enjoy now (Full Metal Alchemist, One Piece, InuYashu). So what you get out of this game, what you get to do, is be a group of kids from our world that discover a magical door that leads to the strange, dark, dangerous land of Yeld. At first you'll be able to explore Yeld and safely return home. But eventually the door home will close, and you'll be trapped! Once you become trapped in Yeld you'll take Heroic Jobs and set out on an adventure to find hidden temples, defeat the Hunters of Yeld and win the magical keys to unlock the door back to the real world. You know how this works, right? It's like Final Fantasy + Alice in Wonderland, or The Legend of Zelda mashed up with Narnia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course that's not what the game is about. That's what you'll be doing while you play the game. The Magical Land of Yeld is about growing up, putting aside childish things and becoming the hero that you were meant to be. Each of us will take the role of a child from our world who finds their inner strengths and becomes a hero in Yeld. We'll take turns at the role of Game Master, directing the game and creating stories for our friends. Together we'll tell the story of how we discovered the magical door to Yeld, became trapped in that land, took on the responsibilities and duties of heroes and faced off against Dragul and the Hunters of Yeld to win back our freedom and find our way home!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hey, welcome to Yeld!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
