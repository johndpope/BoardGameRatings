			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fantastic Races of the Otherverse series converts the most interesting, unusual and powerful player races from Otherverse Games' D20 Modern-powered settings: Otherverse America, Psi-Watch, Galaxy Command and Black Tokyo, and adapts them for use with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. More than a just simple conversion to the new rule set, these short sourcebooks imagine how heroes from super-scientific worlds would look in campaigns where magic and the divine are the norm. This series of supplements also provides a few new hints at how the vast and interconnected multiverse of Otherverse Games fits together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Otherverse America, the Ubasti are a small species of genetically engineered lions which willingly serve the Choicer's Coven of Bast. Created as military working animals, Ubasti proved smarter than anyone expected. As soon as their sentience was discovered, the Ubasti were freed. As of 2107, the Ubasti work with the Choicer nation as free sentient beings, and are beloved by Choicer America for their loyalty and courage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Pathfinder setting the Ubasti have been re-imagined as nomadic, long-lived sentient lion-folk. Ubasti prides have prowled the veldt since before the bipedal races began recording history. Collectively, the Ubasti are ancient beyond imagining, with the race's rich oral history acting as their memory and conscience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This release gives you everything you need to add the Ubasti to your game as a player race.  Also included is a short history of the Ubasti, their pantheon, new feats specifically designed for these four-legged warriors and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
