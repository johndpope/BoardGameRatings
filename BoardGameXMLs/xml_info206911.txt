							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Target Ball</name>
									
			<description>This game consists of a target board inset into the box, a 3.75&amp;quot; long metal spring catapult, and three wooden balls about 3/4&amp;quot; in diameter. Holes designed to fit the balls are cut into the cardboard target at various points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These include a 50 point bulls-eye and four holes in each of three surrounding rings (30,20,10), plus half a dozen 10 holes and four diamonds worth 5 outside the main target. There is a &amp;quot;No Score&amp;quot; indented section in front of the target, where balls count for zero but may be re-shot. A ball that misses the box counts zero and is out of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns shooting the three balls, and the one with the highest total score after four rounds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
