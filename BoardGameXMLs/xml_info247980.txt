							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Walls of York</name>
									
			<description>A rich land is studded with churches, marketplaces, wells and mines. Vikings are longing for all these treasures. Time has come to enclose the territory with huge defensive walls. What will be the best? A fast-built small city with less things inside or a bigger one that defends more but takes longer to be created? What a dilemma for the Walls of York constructor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This family game with simple rules offers many strategies that need to be balanced in a different way each game to reach the victory.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has his own modular board. At the beginning of a turn a card is drawn, showing a wall pattern. Each player now has to add this pattern on his board trying to enclose areas with walls and thus benefiting from the bonuses of the enclosed areas. On the next turn a new wall pattern card is drawn and each player has to build this pattern on his board.&lt;br/&gt;Additionally players try to fulfill goal cards by enclosing the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After two rounds there is a final scoring of gems and vikings (held in a neat &amp;quot;piggy bank&amp;quot; castle. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
