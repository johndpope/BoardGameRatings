			<description>This is an easy playing card game which is something like Old Maid and Simple Rummy. Players pick cards from each other's hands trying to get matching pairs of comic strip characters and most important, 4 cards in numerical order of their own kind to form a comic strip. Players have to avoid the &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; cards while picking the ones they need to score points and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are from four comic strips - Beetle Bailey, Hi and Lois, Popeye, and Blondie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
