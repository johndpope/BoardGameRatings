							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Justice, Inc.</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Justice, Inc. is a role-playing game designed to simulate the adventure stories in the pulp magazines of the 1930s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was one of the first non-superhero applications of the point-based game system that had been developed for the Champions superhero game. The generalized point system would eventually be published as the Hero System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ad copy:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the frozen tops of the Himalayas to the steamy jungles of the Amazon.  The pulps and serials live again in the action packed world of the '20s and '30s.  Justice, Inc. includes all the campaign information you need to give your game a &amp;quot;period&amp;quot; feel, we've even included a slang dictionary!  The game includes special rules for Weird Talents, Psychic Powers, and super-scientific gizmos.  Play the &amp;quot;original&amp;quot; Super Hero game.  Live the adventure with Justice, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Note:&lt;br/&gt;This boxed set contained two books: The main rulebook (96 pages) and the Justice Inc. Campaign Book (79 pages) with information on the setting. It also contained three dice.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Justice,_Inc._(role-playing_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the preface&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of pulp adventure! Justice Inc. takes you to the world of the 1920s and '30s, where you and your friends will experience the action and excitement of those times. Justice Inc. shows you how to experience different types of stories, including Horror, Adventure, Mystery, Espionage, Romance, Science Fiction, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Justice Inc. is another game in the Hero System series; previous games include Champions (super hero role-playing) and Danger International (modern role-playing, formerly known as Espionage!). These games all use the same basic character creation and combat system; once you've learned how to play one of them, you know how to play all of them. So at certain places in these rules, you'll see reference to these other games. It isn't necessary for you to own Champions and Danger International in order to play Justice Inc., but if you want more material that you can use for Justice Inc. You should look into the rest of the Hero System series. More games will be coming out in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The authors (that's use) hope you enjoy this game. We've put a lot of time and effort into this project, because we've enjoyed pulp stories for many years. We hope you'll find out why we love the pulps by playing Justice Inc.; that is, if you aren&amp;rsquo;t one of the people who already loves the pulps. Come on, the adventure's about to begin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
