			<description>The box contains three plastic animals, a rabbit, a frog and a cow. Three large &amp;quot;theme&amp;quot; tiles, the vegetable garden (linked to the rabbit), the pond (frog) and the meadow (cow). Each large tile depicts a scene containing a combination of 10 animals, vegetables, tools... For example the scarecrow is on the vegetable garden tile and the dragonfly in the pond tile. There are also 30 smaller tiles each depicting one of the things present on the larger theme tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The smaller tiles are placed head down in the center of the table. The top one is returned and the children need to identify which theme the card belongs to. The winner is the first child to place the corresponding animal on the correct theme tile. He gains the small card and the next one is then revealed. If the player gets it wrong, he puts a previously gained card back under the pack in the middle of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game winner is the first to gain 5 cards or the one with most cards once all the cards in the center have been used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
