			<description>Gameplay revolves around sixty transparent tiles. Each tile has a letter printed on it in caps. Each player must make a word of up to five letters that has no letters repeated from the seven letters each player was dealt. Each player must also construct a crossword puzzle type clue for the word composed. A player may bluff if a word can't be constructed with the tiles dealt. The words are placed in the holder so that the letters of each individual word overlap. Players score points for deducing opponent&amp;rsquo;s words. The game is played until a goal the players have agreed upon is reached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components: four letter holders with rack, sixty letter tiles, one clue and a three-minute sand timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
