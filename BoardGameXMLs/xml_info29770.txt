			<description>Thlink is the family game of linking by lateral thinking for 2-6 players.  Imagination is the key because in this game there are no set answers - it is up to you to link as many of the 16 dealt picture cards to ghe given category as you can.  - Taken from the rule book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thlink is a family friendly party game in which players bid on a the number of &amp;quot;links&amp;quot; they can make between 16 picture cards and 1 category card.  Other players have the right to challenge a link and voting determines the outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
