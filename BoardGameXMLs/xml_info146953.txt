			<description>Powerhouses of Wresting! is a two-player dice game. Players take turns rolling five dice to get matching numbers (with 1s and 2s matching each other and 6s being wild). After each roll a player can decide to stop or re-roll unmatched dice, with a failure on the new roll costing a matching die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a few additional rules, e.g. getting all the dice to match allows a player to go &amp;quot;over the top&amp;quot; and start over with more dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules were originally printed and distributed as &amp;quot;shareware.&amp;quot; They are currently available online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
