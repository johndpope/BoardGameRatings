							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Orcland Raiders</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Raiders started out as the Severed Heads, but changed their name following a relocation to Orcland after financial trouble. Under the fierce coaching of Ogre ex-torturer Cruel-Eye, the Orcland Raiders won the first Blood Bowl Open Championship, and they are now looking for their second open title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field the Orcland Raiders on your Blood Bowl pitch with this resin and plastic kit &amp;ndash; in it, you&amp;rsquo;ll find a plastic Orc team (actually the Gouged Eye, but who&amp;rsquo;s counting?) and the resin components needed to upgrade them into the Orcland Raiders. These components simply replace their plastic equivalents, with the arms, heads and armoured shoulder pads giving you that authentic Orcland Raiders look with a minimum of fuss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also 2 coins and 2 markers included. In all, the kit comes as 76 components &amp;ndash; 40 plastic, 36 resin &amp;ndash; and includes 12 32mm Blood Bowl bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
