							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tiny Swords SMAAASH!</name>
									
			<description>A spin-off of the cute and casual card game Tiny Swords, Tactics is a completely new game. Flip, slide, and toss other player's tiles away to be the last one standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep your tiles close to the Heart of the Battle, and toss your foes away. If a tile is disconnected from all other tiles, that player has until the end of their turn to get it back to the battle or risk losing it forever! Tiles that are face-up can be pushed and tossed, while face-down tiles can act as walls to contain the ever-increasing chaos. Every time you toss a tile, they accumulate more Toss Tokens and get flung further each time, pushing any face-up tiles in their path!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On top of that, each team has their own Captain with unique powers. Utilize each Captain's ability to turn the tide of battle and knock the other players off of your actual table. The whole table is your stage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
