							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Taz Express</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taz A Delivery Boy? Would you trust THIS guy to deliver your fragile package?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tired of seeing Taz do nothing but hang around the house and watch TV, She-Devil decides Taz needs to find a job. She finds the perfect one for him - as a delivery boy for the next day courier service, &amp;quot;Taz Express&amp;quot;. Your job: Help protect the package long enough to deliver it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Taz moves like Taz - he can throw any object; jump onto sky-scrapers; eat anything that gets in his way; and demolish everything in his path with the famous Taz zpin!&lt;br/&gt;     Five huge worls to explore - the Tasmanian Bushlands, Tasmanian City, Mars, Monument Valley, and the Wild West!&lt;br/&gt;     Marvin the Martian, Wile E. Coyote, and Yosemite Sam guest star in over 25 levels of fast, fun gameplay!&lt;br/&gt;     A truly &amp;quot;living&amp;quot; environment - just about everything in the game is interactive and - uh-oh - breakable!&lt;br/&gt;     And with the internal battery, you can save your game directly to the game pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
