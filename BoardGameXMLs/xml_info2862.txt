			<description>From the publisher/designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Missing out on all the stress in today's high-tech industry?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ready for a sharp stick in the eye?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, get out your eye-patch because you're about to become the CTO of a hot new Internet startup. You drank a cup of bad latte and woke up with a billion dollar idea. With a dot-com in your company name and a cool million from a top VC, you're ready to assemble a team of the best programmers that money and free soda can buy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's just one problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your fiercest competitor drank the same bad coffee and is after the same programmers. And they're just across the hall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this 2-player strategy game, win by being the first to collect and debug a set of package cards with a total of 20 features. Skillfully bid against your competitor for valuable package and programmer cards. Since programmers must work together to remove bugs, your success depends on your ability to assemble the most productive teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.toylab.com/mrbunny/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.toylab.com/mrbunny/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
