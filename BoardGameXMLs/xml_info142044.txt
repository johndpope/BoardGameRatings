			<description>Game published in The Jolly Play Book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;'A Fascinating Board Game'&lt;br/&gt;In this game, you and a friend each try to reach the Treasure. All you need to play this game are two buttons and a coin. Get buttons which are different in colour, for one button will be your marker, and the other button will be your friend's marker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You both place your buttons in the Starting Box. The first player tosses up the coin. If the coin falls Heads, he advances his button two spaces; if it falls Tails, he advances his button one space.&lt;br/&gt;The players take turns. Each player, of course, follows the board directions. As you see, sometimes a player may have to go back a box or two; sometimes he may lose his next turn; and sometimes he may be lucky and advance a few boxes. That&amp;rsquo;s the fun of the game.&lt;br/&gt;The player who reaches the Winning Box first, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
