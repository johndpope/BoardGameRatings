			<description>Have you ever wanted to poop in someone&amp;rsquo;s yard? Well here is your chance. In Dog Poop, it is your objective to dig holes, trample flowers, knock over the garbage, and find mystery goodies in other back yards. Naturally, you are trying to do all this while keeping your own yard as clean as possible.  There are special things you can get like a scoop to clean your yard or the cat to draw other dogs away.  Get in touch with your inner poodle or wolf hound as the case may be.  All in all, this game is a bunch of laughs for everyone involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
