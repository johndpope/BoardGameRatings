							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nester&#039;s Funky Bowling</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Nester's Funky Bowling is a North American-exclusive bowling video game software for the Virtual Boy developed and published by Nintendo. It is not related in any way to the other Virtual Boy bowling game, Virtual Bowling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A long time ago, a spunky little boy named Nester originated from the early pages of Nintendo Power magazine's comic section. He was a conceited video game player and &amp;quot;a notorious smart aleck&amp;quot;. After approximately forty issues of Nintendo Power magazine, Nester called it quits. He wanted to prove that he wasn't just another comic hero. Before he went to play bowling alone, his over-confident twin sister, Hester, went to play with him. She is three minutes older and considers herself superior to Nester in every way. Deep down Hester has always believed that she could have been a bigger star than Nester, and she now has a chance to prove it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three game modes that can be played by one or two players: Practice, Bowling and Challenge. In Practice, players can set up the pins any way they like. Players will have three rolls, then they can set them up again. Bowling is a standard game of ten frames. In Challenge, the pins are set up in increasingly difficult positions. The player gets one chance to knock down all the pins. No points are given for knocking down less than the full set of pins. The more difficult the shot, the more points it is worth. The pin placements are randomly generated, but the last shot will always be a 7-10 split.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to two players can each be a different character or the same one, while they will alternate turns.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Nester's_Funky_Bowling,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
