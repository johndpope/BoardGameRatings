			<description>From Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PassCards&amp;reg; present the key to communication between individual players and the GM in a Conflict&amp;reg; game. During the setup time for a match, your PassCard&amp;reg; provides you the space you need to provide your GM with basic facts about your character, such as your saves, armor class, and so on. This information helps your GM when he needs to make decisions about certain actions, such as if one of your enemies attempts to cast dominate person on you without your knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
