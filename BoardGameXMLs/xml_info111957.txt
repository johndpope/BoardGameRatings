			<description>Each player is assigned an area of the board&amp;mdash;the classroom, the school bus, the cafeteria, or the hallway. Players must get rid of the bullies and protect the victims in their area of the school by answering true/false questions about the nature of bullying. There are two levels of play: for younger kids, and older kids, and a Bullying Quiz to assess how much children learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
