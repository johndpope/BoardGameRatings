							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">UEFA Champions League Season 1998-1999</name>
									
			<description>With Silicon Dreams Studio, who also developed the World League Soccer series, Champions League had four titles, 98&amp;ndash;99, Season 1999&amp;ndash;2000, Season 2000&amp;ndash;2001 and 2001&amp;ndash;2002 released, aimed mostly at the PlayStation, but PC releases existed for the games. It replaced the national teams with finalists of all competitions since 1960, also including scenarios (in 98&amp;ndash;99, with fake settings, in 1999&amp;ndash;2000, based on the previous finals, including the 1999 final last minutes). The first two games were published by Eidos Interactive, whilst the last two were published by Take-Two Interactive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League_video_games UEFA Champions League video games]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
