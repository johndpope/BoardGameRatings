			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weary from travelling the border country, you find yourselves relaxing to a hot meal and cool drink in the Black Opal Inn in the town of Tamris. You are woken early the next morning to a loud commotion. Because attacks upon border towns are not unusual, you quickly gather your gear and go outside to investigate the cause. It appears that sometime in the night Mayor Timbar&amp;rsquo;s twin 8 year old children, Malacai and Miranda, were kidnapped. Mayor Timbar is frantic with desperation and is trying to coordinate a search party. However, from what you gather is that the other town leaders are opposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From GM Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kidnapped! takes place in the border town of Tamris. This adventure is designed for a group of 4-5 characters between levels 8-12. Any party composition outside of these guidelines may require tweaking on the GM&amp;rsquo;s end. It is assumed that all of the characters know each other previously and are part of the same group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
