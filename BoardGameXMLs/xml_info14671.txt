			<description>In Jag vill ta k&amp;ouml;rkort, each player moves his vehicle according to his dice rolls about the game board while paying attention to the traffic rules. When his vehicle lands on a colored space, the player has to draw a card and answer the question on the card. Correct answers are rewarded with points. The first player to score 20 points wins the game and gets his driving license.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jag vill ta k&amp;ouml;rkort was published in conjunction with Sweden transitioning from left-hand traffic to right-hand traffic in 1967.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
