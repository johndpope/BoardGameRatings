			<description>The era of the First World War is sometimes seen as one of unimaginative mechanised slaughter with the humble infantryman no more than cannon fodder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In reality, personal skill and courage were often more important than ever to the men in the front line. Cut off from their comrades in the wastes of no man's land, without the communications which soldiers take for granted today, small groups men struggled to stay alive and defeat their enemies in ferocious close range battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To The Last Man is a 32 page set of skirmish rules for the period which enables you to take command of a section or platoon in such a desperate situation and lead it to victory or bloody defeat. Designed for fast, enjoyable and tactically challenging games, the rules are intended not just for the Western Front, but for all the far flung theatres of conflict in the early decades of the 20th century - from the steppes of Siberia to the jungles of East Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
