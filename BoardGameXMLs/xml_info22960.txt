			<description>Don't Crack is the game where you are not allowed to laugh smile, smirk, grin, or giggle however it is almost impossible. Imagine if you pick up a card and it says. &amp;quot; Coffee is a natural laxative for me.&amp;quot; You had to read it out loud without proofreading. Would that make you laugh? possibly. What if you had to get down on one knee and grab the persons hand to your left and confess your undying love for them. Would that make you laugh? Probably. If anyone laughs during game play they must move back spaces. Two categories are used, &amp;quot; Feel The Part&amp;quot; the acting out a silly situation category and &amp;quot;say It Out Loud&amp;quot; where you just pick up and read it. A game of non stop laughter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
