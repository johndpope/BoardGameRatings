			<description>PHD is a unique game of words in which a player earns points (credits) by using imagination, creativity, and knowledge of words.  To win the game, a player must initially obtain 80 credits and then be the first player to successfully fulfill the requirements of one of the four P.H.D professors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;P.H.D. is the hilarious and stimulating game of words and definitions that lets you match wits with your opponents or face the word challenge of the board.  Be crafty, deceptive, creative and imaginative.  Bluff with the right answer or deceive with the wrong one.  Be as cunning as you like.  Or be perceptive enough to overcome the challenge of the board.  You win both ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;P.H.D. is easy to play and no one can monopolize the game, even if they've memorized the entire dictionary&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
