			<description>[My own opinion:] Rulebook (and possibly only item) for the Mortal Combat fantasy role-playing game. Published in 1979, it is certainly a product of its time: fairly complicated and detailed combat system, lots of charts and tables, everything included in a single 62-page rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[From the front of the game chart insert card:]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playable: Easy to pick up, fast to use, the rules can be explained to any newcomer in a matter of minutes. There is no unwanted over-complexity, as with some rules. Melee is divided into three segments: attack and defense are factored for the throw-to-hit, followed by the damage throw and optional hit location throw. Three dice rolls... the minimum necessary for a comprehensive combat system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realistic: The rules describe a convincing world, where commonsense and initiative count for a great deal. There are no superhuman characters carving up a dozen men single-handed-- just ordinary mortals with some skill in swordplay or sorcery, trying to use their wits to stay alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clear: Presentation is lucid throughout. At a glance, you can see the range or duration of a spell, the attack factor of a creature, the cost of distilling a potion, etc. For quick reference during play, the essential combat charts are reproduced on back of this sheet;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adaptable: The book presents a logical and consistent representation of &amp;quot;sword and sorcery&amp;quot; reality, so that any concept from fantastic literature can be readily fitted into the structure. The rules are designed for flexibility, and with a minimum of effort can be adapted for use with other FRP games. There is no need to start a whole new campaign to reap the benefits of MORTAL COMBAT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[end of quote from game charts insert card]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
