							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kingdoms and Crowns</name>
									
			<description>Kingdoms and Crowns is a board game in the tradition of games such as Talisman. The game is set in a fantasy world of elves and dragons. The premise of the game is that the rule of the realm has died and many parties are now maneuvering their candidates to take the throne. However, absolute power will be difficult to achieve. To become rule of the realm you must have the backing of the most influential powers in the land, but you should also have support form the Otherworld. There is one way to become the undisputed ruler of the realm, and that is to recover a legendary crown that once belonged to the most powerful rule to have ever ruled the land. Legend has it that the crown was stolen and is now somewhere on the Planes of Damnation. Only a hero of great power and skill could ever hope to enter those lands and return. Alternatively it be just simpler to remove the competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
