			<description>A card game that utilises the board that came with it but the host must provide other equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a two player game (or 4 or 6, in which case the games is played as a partnership game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to fill your bucket or, at least, finish the game with the most water in your bucket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are laid from your hand, domino fashion i.e. as long as you match one of the numbers on the end dominoes, you can play that card. Most cards will say something like 5 Red Black 2. In this case, if you were Red, you would move your playing piece 5 spaces around the board. The spaces on the board let you add water to your bucket or cause your bucket to start leaking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends as soon as one player fills their bucket or it ends after both players have made two circuits of the board and then the winner is the one with the most water remaining in their bucket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
