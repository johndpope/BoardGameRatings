							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</name>
									
			<description>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare is a 2014 first-person shooter video game developed by Sledgehammer Games and published by Activision. It was released on November 4, 2014 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One. The game is the first main entry in the Call of Duty series since 2013's Call of Duty: Ghosts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The single-player story follows Jack Mitchell, a private in the United States Marine Corps. Development began in 2011, soon after the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. Sledgehammer engaged veteran actors, such as Troy Baker and Kevin Spacey, to perform in the game's lead roles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced Warfare, like the other Call of Duty titles, is presented in a first-person shooter perspective. However, the game features several changes; unlike other installments, Advanced Warfare does not use a traditional heads-up display; instead, all information is relayed to the player via holographic projections from the weapon equipped. The general gun-play remains unchanged, apart from new mechanics; for example, certain guns will be able to recharge slowly. The player can also switch between different types of grenades. The game will also be the first in the Call of Duty series that will allow the player to choose differing types of conventional weaponry; for example, the game will feature regular conventional firearms, but the player can also choose to use Laser or Energy directed weaponry, both of which have differing attributes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2054, Private Jack Mitchell (Troy Baker) of the United States Marine Corps participates in a battle against North Koreans in Seoul, along with his squadmates Private Will Irons (Paul Telfer) and Sergeant Cormack (Russell Richardson). In the midst of the battle, Will is killed in action, while Mitchell's left arm is severed from his shoulder, forcing him to be discharged from military service. After attending a funeral service for Will, Mitchell is offered to join the Atlas Corporation, the world's most powerful private military contractor, by CEO Jonathan Irons (Kevin Spacey), Will's father. As a reward, Mitchell is given an advanced prosthetic arm to replace his lost one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, a terrorist group calling itself the KVA, led by a technophobic man called Joseph &amp;quot;Hades&amp;quot; Chkheidze (Sharif Ibrahim), begins staging numerous terrorist attacks, with the world turning to Atlas to stop them. Mitchell, along with his teammates Gideon (Gideon Emery), Joker (Jeremy Kent Jackson), and other Atlas soldiers rescue the Nigerian prime minister and later capture a KVA technologist in Lagos, Nigeria during a technology summit. However, by 2055, the KVA's attacks soon become more sophisticated, and Mitchell and his team fail to prevent the KVA from forcing a nuclear reactor meltdown on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The KVA launch similar attacks against nuclear power plants worldwide, irradiating numerous cities, killing thousands of people, and putting national governments and militaries in turmoil. Atlas emerges as the dominant military force in the world, aiding civilians affected by the attacks, and holding back the KVA's rampage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four years later in 2059, Mitchell and Gideon search an abandoned downtown Detroit, Michigan to find Dr. Pierre Danois (Erik Passoja), the KVA's second-in-command. After having the doctor interrogated by Ilona (Angela Gots), an ex-Spetsnaz Atlas operative, they are able to track Hades down to Santorini in Greece where KVA leaders are having a conference. Mitchell corners Hades and mortally wounds him. Before succumbing to his death, Hades utters &amp;quot;Irons knew,&amp;quot; giving Mitchell a data chip with his last breath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ilona analyzes the data chip, only to find out that the technologist they captured in Nigeria was killed by Irons after the latter learned of the KVA global attack, proving that he deliberately allowed the attacks to occur to improve Atlas' reputation. Irons attempts to have Mitchell and Ilona arrested, but they escape Atlas' headquarters in the rebuilt Baghdad (called New Baghdad), guided by a mysterious soldier, while Gideon stays by Irons' side for further investigation. The mysterious soldier reveals himself to be Mitchell's old commanding officer, Cormack, who is now a member of the Sentinel Task Force, an international effort initially created to investigate the KVA power plant attacks, but now repurposed to to prevent Atlas' rise to power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2060, Mitchell, now a Sentinel, joins Cormack, Ilona, and Knox (Khary Payton) as they infiltrate Irons' private residence in Bangkok. The team discovers that Dr. Danois (now having changed his alias to Bellamy) is now collaborating with Irons on &amp;quot;Manticore&amp;quot;, a bio-weapon. They set up a tracker on a plane carrying the bio-weapon bound for Argentina. Sentinel later intercepts the plane, which crashes in Antarctica. Gideon appears and helps the Sentinels defeat the Atlas soldiers after discovering Irons' intentions for the bio-weapon. The team successfully retrieves the WMD, and they are able to take one sample of it. After analyzing the sample, they discover that Manticore is a weapon designed to attack the DNA of specific individuals, meaning Irons can use the weapon without risking harm to his own troops. The Sentinels, now joined by Gideon, infiltrate and destroy an Atlas bio-weapons laboratory in Bulgaria, eliminating much of the Manticore samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With his plot revealed, Irons releases his ultimatum to remove all politicians, whom he thinks are the problem of the world, at the United Nations General Assembly and declares war on the world. The Sentinels discover that Irons is planning a preemptive strike on the United States and try to stop an Atlas attack on the country in San Francisco, California. Atlas destroys the Golden Gate Bridge, trapping the U.S. 3rd fleet in the Bay Area, and attempt to destroy the fleet in a single strike. The Sentinels use a railgun aboard an aircraft carrier to destroy the Atlas ships attacking them. With the ultimatum and the attack on U.S. soil, the United States, along with the rest of the world, declares war against Atlas and Irons retreats to his headquarters in New Baghdad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seven months later, the Sentinels and the United States Army attack New Baghdad to stop Irons and bring him to justice. However, Atlas releases Manticore, killing Knox and most of the attacking troops. Mitchell, Ilona, and Gideon, whose DNA are recognized by Manticore as they are former Atlas soldiers, are spared, as well as Cormack who was outside the blast radius. The four are brought to an Atlas prison camp, which also runs Manticore experiments on its inmates. The Sentinels escape but Cormack succumbs to a fatal wound caused by Irons, while Mitchell's prosthetic arm is severely damaged. As they escape the facility, they discover that Irons already has enough Manticore to attack every military base in the world, and will be launching an ICBM loaded with the bio-weapon shortly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mitchell and Gideon launch a lone assault on the Atlas HQ while using heavily armored battlesuits (ASTs), and are successful in destroying the bio-weapon ICBM. They find Irons as the other Sentinels prepare to bombard the building. Irons disables their exoskeletons, forcing Mitchell to release the exoskeleton to chase Irons. Mitchell tackles Irons off the building, but he hangs on to Mitchell's prosthetic arm. Mitchell severs his prosthetic, sending Irons falling to his death. As Gideon arrives to carry him out of the building, Mitchell notes that Irons' death was only the beginning, and the war against Atlas is far from over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
