			<description>Manufacturers Blurb: Creeps! The game that strikes terror at the heart! Pick up a dagger and strike the vampire in his coffin... but tread carefully or he'll awake with a flash and a screech!&lt;br/&gt;A spine chilling game for children over 7 years and adults too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of chance and skill - pit your wits against the Vampire. Get him before he gets you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Summary: Players race to move one of their daggers to the centre of the board and slay the vampire. Each player begins the game with 5 daggers, and places one of them on the starting 'foot-print' at the beginning of the game. Each turn every player gets 6 movement points to share between his daggers (ie move 1 dagger forward 6 footprints, or 2 daggers 3 footprints each, or any combination up to a total of 6). You can 'leapfrog' your own daggers, (but may never have 2 daggers on the same footprint) and at the end of each move the dagger is 'stabbed' into the board. When a dagger is placed in one of the randomly selected footprints the Vampire will let out a bloodcurdling scream causing that dagger to be removed from the game. Players have to remember which footprints will wake the Vampire and avoid them for the rest of the game. The first player to reach the centre of the board and stab his dagger into the heart of the Vampire wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
