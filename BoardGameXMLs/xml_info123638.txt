			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arrowed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elgar Fletch, a backwoods hunter and trapper, finds his life turned upside-down as strange appearances in the woods foretell an invasion that threatens the kingdom. Can a boy who&amp;rsquo;s never set foot out of his small village defeat an unstoppable army? That&amp;rsquo;s up to you, the choices you make, and the luck of the die&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This stand-alone Party of One adventure is designed for a single player with no GM and basic rules. All you need to play is some dice (d6, d8, and 20), a pencil, some paper, and this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are explained as you play. Begin at paragraph 1 and proceed from there, taking notes as you go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elgar Fletch and the Dark Army includes both a 1st level and 3rd level character sheet for Elgar, fully compatible for use with any beginning Pathfinder Roleplaying Game party to continue your adventures!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
