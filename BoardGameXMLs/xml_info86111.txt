							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lost Cities (2008 / Xbox)</name>
									
			<description>Lost Cities is the Xbox Live Arcade version of the popular card game of the same name by game designer Reiner Knizia, published by Sierra Online. It has since disappeared from Xbox Live Arcade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is identical to the card game: each player is dealt eight cards, which consist of 5 &amp;quot;suits&amp;quot; that represent individual expeditions, with each &amp;quot;suit&amp;quot; consisting of 3 Investment cards which multiply the value of an expedition, and 9 Expedition Cards numbered 2 through 10. The players are dealt 8 cards and build their expeditions by stacking the numbers in increasing order, and may draw from the deck or the 5 discard piles. The round ends when all of the cards have been played or discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The round is scored by subtracting 20 from the value of each expedition, and multiplying each with the Investment cards. Failure to achieve 20 points in each expedition results in a negative score for that attempt, or no points if a total of 20 is exactly made. Investments in a failed expedition exacerbates the negative score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game consists of three rounds. The player with the most points accumulated after the rounds wins the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Lost Cities (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
