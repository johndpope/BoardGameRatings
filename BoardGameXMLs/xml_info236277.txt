			<description>Cat Hills is a simplistic but weird trick-taking game in which the leader can choose between a must-follow or a may-follow. With must-follow, other players must play the same suit as the leader, or any other color if they don't have the leader's color, and the player who played highest of the leader's color wins the trick. With may-follow, players can play any color, and the highest number regardless of color wins the trick, with ties cancelling each other out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take their won tricks to build small stacks that are worth points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
