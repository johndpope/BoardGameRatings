							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wild Arms Alter Code: F</name>
									
			<description>Wild Arms Alter Code: F (ワイルドアームズ アルターコード・F) is an enhanced remake of Wild Arms for the PlayStation 2. The game features entirely new 3D environments, five new playable characters and many other improvements. The game's North American release was postponed several times until it was finally released on November 15, 2005. The North American version comes with a bonus DVD featuring the first episode of the Wild Arms anime series, Wild Arms: Twilight Venom. It was never released in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features more characters than just the original trio. Other characters such as Jane Maxwell, Mcdullen Harts (called Magdalene Harts in the remake), Emma Hetfield, Mariel, and Zed will be able to join and the player may switch them into the battlefield. All of the dungeons have completely different puzzles and layouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has been graphically overhauled and now has 3D graphics both in and out of battles. The soundtrack has been heavily remixed or replaced entirely with new music. Numerous FMVs have been added at key points in the game and for the guardian summonings. The encounter cancel system from Wild Arms 2 and 3, which allows a player to skip a random battle, is present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Wild Arms Alter Code: F&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
