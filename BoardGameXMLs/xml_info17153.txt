			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MOTOYAMA AIRFIELD #2, Iwo Jima, 27 February 1945: The Marines of Colonel Kenyon&amp;rsquo;s 9th Marine Regiment had a rough time during their first day in the line, 26 February. They had made two determined assaults on &amp;lsquo;Hill Peter&amp;rsquo;, to no avail. After reorganizing during the night, the 9th Marines were ready for another push to the top of the hill. At 1250 hrs., their break came. Following a ten minute preparation by division and corps artillery, both battalions struck out in a coordinated attack. With the 1st Battalion on the right and the 2nd on the left, the Marines began their move up the slopes of Hill Peter. The 1st Battalion overran the hill and continued on down the reverse slope and up to the crest of &amp;lsquo;Hill Oboe&amp;rsquo; to the northwest. The 1st Battalion&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; Company did not enjoy the same momentum on their way to Oboe. &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; Company was stopped by a small enemy AA detachment with supporting fire from emplaced machine-guns in a small draw on their right flank. &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; Company rapidly deployed to meet this threat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ATS SEMPER FI! (aka Uncommon Valor Upgrade Edition) is the new COMPLETE GAME that depicts the battle for Iwo Jima. Three years into the Pacific war the United States Marine Corps had mastered the art of the amphibious landing. The landing force at Iwo still had much to learn about the enemy. Senior intelligence officers did not know until 27 February that General Kuribayashi was in fact personally running the show from his headquarters on Iwo Jima. As the Marines regrouped after their landing, it was obvious that something was different on Iwo Jima. No dense jungles, just ash from the island&amp;rsquo;s volcano, Suribachi. Steam could be seen rising from the natural sulfur water wells which bubbled to the surface all over the island. Worse, the dug-in defenders actually numbered half again the original estimate of 13,000. Kuribayshi was particularly pleased with the quality of his artillery and engineering troops. The Japanese defenders waiting for the advance of the V Amphibious Corps were well armed and confident. The game depicts the confrontation at Motoyama Airfield #2, a war waged with the most vicious weapons available to the combatants, including flame-throwing &amp;lsquo;Zippo&amp;rsquo; Shermans and Japanese heavy artillery. Everything is included to play!.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;    A collection of 517 color, die-cut counters representing the USMC and Japanese combatants that fought in the battle; &lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;    Six scenarios, ranging from small to large, that all play on the historical map; &lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;    A 22 x 34 color map of the Motoyama #2 battlefield on heavyweight stock; &lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;    A complete ATS system rulebook tailored specifically to the game; &lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;    Six Play Aid Cards; &lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;    Battlefield Walk around and Special Rules document (an ATS specialty!) &lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;    A color cover sheet (perfect for your rules binder) and a snazzy ziploc bag to hold it all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
