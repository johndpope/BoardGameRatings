Grab your elephant with his attached springy truck and go to home base, then start bouncing your elephant&amp;rsquo;s trunk on the snack cards to pick up a tasty snack! Once it&amp;rsquo;s caught, run back to home base and drop it off, then get back to the snackin&amp;rsquo; as quick as you can! Make a pile of snacks, and if your pile is the biggest at the end, you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snatch up snack cards with your elephant&amp;rsquo;s springy trunk! Whoever grabs the most snacks wins! 2 elephant heads come with handles and springy trunks. Bonus game: Find the golden tutti frutti cake snack card and win!
