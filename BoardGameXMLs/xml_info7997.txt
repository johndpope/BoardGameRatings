			<description>A Bullwinkle themed boardgame variant on hide-n-seek.  &lt;br/&gt;(Bullwinkle is a fictional moose character from the 1959-1964 animated television series Rocky and His Friends and The Bullwinkle Show.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme&lt;br/&gt;Players play a hide-and-seek game with Bullwinkle and his friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;Scoring the most points by finding picture chips which have been hidden on the balloon spots on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play&lt;br/&gt;Each of the two player gets a player's board and the 24 cardboard chips of the same colour.&lt;br/&gt;The player boards show Bullwinkle with 24 balloons, grouped into six groups of four.&lt;br/&gt;Each set of cardboard chips is composed of 14 blank chips, 8 picture chips (showing characters from the show) and 2 chips that have 'HOT' printed on them. At the bottom of the board, you see how many points (ranging from -3 to 5) you earn by finding which character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each player &amp;quot;hides&amp;quot; the characters by placing his/her cardboard chips on the balloon spots on his/her player board, blank side up and without the other player seeing which character goes where.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for hiding:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     HOT chips are hints for the other player and have to be placed in a balloon group that contains at least one picture chip.&lt;br/&gt;     One or more picture chips, with or without a HOT chip, may be in a group of 4 balloons.&lt;br/&gt;     It is allowed to make a group of 4 blank chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the &amp;quot;hiding&amp;quot; phase, players switch boards and the &amp;quot;seeking&amp;quot; phase starts. Players now take turns turning over two chips on their board according to the following rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Two chips from any group or groups of balloons may be turned over.&lt;br/&gt;     A HOT chip indicates that there is at least one picture chip in that group.&lt;br/&gt;     When a player finds a picture chip, he/she places it on the corresponding area of the board.&lt;br/&gt;     Finding one of the two characters with negative points not only loses the player that number of points, it also restricts his actions to turning over one (instead of two) chips per turn for the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player finds both of the two characters with negative points, the game ends immediately.&lt;br/&gt;The game also ends when one player has found all six characters worth positive points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the game has ended, each player adds up his/her points. The player with the highest score wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
