							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Tome of Wicked Things</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We here at Little Red have a thing for being a little &amp;quot;wicked.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To us, the villains are just as compelling as the knight in shining armor! With Pathfinder releasing the antipaladin class in its Advanced Player's Guide we thought we would give a facelift to one of our favorite D&amp;amp;D 3.5 classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tome of Wicked Things provides the following in approximately 11 pages:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for playing an antipaladin as a base class&lt;br/&gt; Favored class options for the antipaladin&lt;br/&gt; 5 new alternate classes for the antipaladin&lt;br/&gt; 11 new feats for the antipaladin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The real showcase of the Tome of Wicked Things are the alternate classes we present. The first in the book is the &amp;quot;Black Knight.&amp;quot; It brings back the sneak attack that blackguards had from D&amp;amp;D 3.5 at the cost of the smite good ability. The next alternate class presented is the &amp;quot;Wrath Reaper.&amp;quot; It presents a more necrotic take of the antipaladin. The wrath reaper is followed by the anarchistic &amp;quot;Disciple of Discord.&amp;quot; Instead of being concerned with the struggles between good and evil, a disciple of discord fights for the forces of chaos and individual freedom (Unfortunately, this tends to lead him down the road of madness!). The &amp;quot;Red Sword&amp;quot; alternate class is designed for paladins who have lost their way on the road of peace and fell to the rage and bloodlust of the battlefield (They are truly a force to be reckoned with in combat!). The final alternate class we've got lined up for the Tome of Wicked Things is the &amp;quot;Infernal Champion.&amp;quot; The infernal champion has made a powerful pact with a demon (or other dark patron) and now serves them. In return for their service they are gifted with the ability to summon dark creatures from their master's legions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
