			<description>Official Release Notes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As &amp;quot;Curses&amp;quot; opens, you're hunting about in the attic of your family home, looking for a tatty old map of Paris (you're going on holiday tomorrow) and generally trying to avoid all the packing.  Aunt Jemima is potting daisies and sulking; the attics are full of endless distractions and secrets; Greek&lt;br/&gt;myths, horoscopes, sixth-century politics, a less than altogether helpful demon, a mysterious bomb plot, photography, ritual, poetry and a dream or two all get in your way; and somehow you keep being reminded of your family through the ages, and all its Curses...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...could it be that even you are Cursed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
