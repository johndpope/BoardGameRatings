			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deave is composed of two large islands (The Isle of the Dead and Chernivisti), one secondary island (Caerlaen), and a handful of tertiary islands called the Inner Islands. The lands are mountainous in their center and hilly on the periphery. There are numerous valleys, but tend towards smallness. The only real flatlands in Deave are found along the east coasts of Chernivisti and Caerlaen, where the land remains level for almost a full 30 miles from the coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deave is a 3 page gazetteer detailing one of the islands in the Lyart Subsector in Worlds Apart. Deave was once the home of an ancient society, but a necromantic apocalypse has resulted in a dangerous and treacherous land!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
