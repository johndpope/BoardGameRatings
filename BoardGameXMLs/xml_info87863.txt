							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Exodus: Aufstieg und Fall</name>
									
			<description>Exodus: Aufstieg und Fall (Rise and Fall) is a light 4x game. The players take control over an intergalactic race and have to explore the universe, expand their Empire, build trading routes and send ressources to the matching planets and attack trading routes and planets of the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exodus is played with 2-4 players on a random hex-board. Each player builds an unique deck of 60-80 cards (out of 8 different types of cards). During the game the empires rise and each player desides, when he wants to fall to get victory points. The the player builds up a new Empire with a different starting planet. To conquer a planet, the player have to build an outpost and get influence on this planet (depends on the number of possible ouposts on this planet). Each time he get influence, surrounding planets with other players outposts will also get influence-tokens. &lt;br/&gt;Each planet needs one out of four ressources to get victory points . To get the right ressources to the matching planet a player has to trade with the Galactic Senat, other players or move ressources through the trading routes. At the end of the turn each player bids on a special Senat-action for the next turn.&lt;br/&gt;If a player counquers a planet, he'll get a special action each turn, but can't play as many cards as before. So each planet makes the players game more static and predictable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the deck a player chooses, each player tries to get victory points through conquering, producing, attacking or trading or a mix of these types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
