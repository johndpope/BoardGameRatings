			<description>The world of CONSORTIUM has only recently come back from the brink of annihilation, following an immensely destructive global war in the early-to-mid 2020s. Hundreds of millions lost their lives as factions and alliances were forced into conflict with powerful modern weaponry, mostly fighting for what little was left of Earth&amp;rsquo;s oil reserves. The invention of safe, cheap, and sustainable fusion power stopped the war dead in its tracks. It suddenly became far cheaper to convert the global population&amp;rsquo;s reliance on oil, than it was to continue killing each other over it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combining the core mechanics of a first-person shooter with fully interactive conversations of Role-Playing or Adventure games, our custom Interactive Dialog System (I.D.S.) simulates real conversations so they flow logically and follow realistic rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
