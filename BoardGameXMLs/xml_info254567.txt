			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Famous Harlem stage magician Benjamin Rucker needs your help. A rival, the self-styled King of the Cats, has a new routine and it's cutting into Rucker's bottom line. Just what is that mummy-thing the King has on display? Why does it seem to move under its own power?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario pits the investigators against minions of an Outer God, and all of New York may be forfeit if they fail. The King of the Cats thinks he has his Children of the Sphynx under his control, but the Children have their own instructions. The city will obey, or it will be wiped off the face of the Earth - unless the investigators step in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is a sequel to The Man Downstairs, but players do not have to have played that scenario to enjoy this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
