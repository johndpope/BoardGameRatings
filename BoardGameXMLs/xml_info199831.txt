			<description>A Garden in Hell gives you a complete pick-up-and-play campaign containing everything you need to roleplay in the Faith Universe right out of the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background: The fragile truce between the Iz'kal and the Corvo had been compromised by a series of murderous attacks on far away settlements. Mutually Assured Destruction was days away as both species laid blame on each other... when the Battle of Izuan Tai shook the groundwork of the known Universe. It was the first big blow the legendary species of the Ravager would deliver to civilisation, but it wouldn't be the last. A new menace had awoken from a long sleep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Garden in Hell takes place 23 years after the Battle of Izuan Tai, where the rival Iz&amp;rsquo;Kal and Corvo species joined forces to stop the mutual threat and formed The Coalition. This entity has now become a &amp;ldquo;third state&amp;rdquo; independent of both the Iz&amp;rsquo;Kal and the Corvo, with emergency powers over all areas threatened by the Ravager.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On its last military council, the Coalition high command agreed it was time to leave their defensive stand and strike back in full force to capture a Ravager Queen. At first, the attack was a thundering success, but when the injured Ravager Queen entered the Labyrinth only your group was able to chase her unscathed deep into Ravager territory&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In A Garden in Hell you might...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...survive in the alien planet Ujara, fighting off its dangerous flora and fauna.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...set up camp with allies who will help in your endeavours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...run combat, diplomacy and reconnaissance missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...meet the Kira, the native species, whose lives are shaken by your arrival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...discover the origins of the mutant Ravager, their motivations, and their goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...take advantage of their power struggles, as a Herald of Extinction revolts against her Queen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...participate in an epic final showdown against the ultimate enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...behold the awe-inspiring landscapes and alluring vistas of this GARDEN IN HELL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
