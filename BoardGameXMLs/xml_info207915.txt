			<description>A board game based on the reality show &amp;quot;L'isola dei famosi&amp;quot; (Survivor in English).&lt;br/&gt;There are 12 castaways, independently of the number of players. Each player receives secretly a card with 6 castaways they have to keep on the island.&lt;br/&gt;Each round players challenge to be the group leader. There are different kinds of challenge: dexterity, acting, memory, trivia, words, calculation, deduction.&lt;br/&gt;The winner receives food, chooses which castaway will be immune and votes the castaway he wants to eliminate. Then, the other players vote the castaway they want to eliminate.&lt;br/&gt;There is a runoff voting between the 2 selected castaways: after it one castaway is eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;After the last round the castaways are ranked according to their position (from 1 to 12) and players score points accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most point is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
