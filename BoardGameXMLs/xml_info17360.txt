							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Riot: Revolting People from Watt Tyler to Watts</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Riot is a slightly tongue-in-cheek game about urban violence between unruly mobs and 'security forces' through the ages.  It can be played either multi-player or solo, with the mobs being controlled by the game system and the players taking the role of either the forces of law and order quelling the rioters or journalists recording the event and reporting scenes of police brutality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has been written purely with fun in mind and it is not an attempt at a simulation of urban violence per se.  The rules have been written for 1:300 scale, but can be easily adjusted for 15mm or 25mm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
