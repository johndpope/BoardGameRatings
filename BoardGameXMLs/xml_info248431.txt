			<description>You are a Privateer in an alternate history Steampunk Caribbean. Sailing the seas of New Caribbean for wealth and fame. The Royal family, no longer interested in directly governing, have decided to appoint a Governor of New Caribbean. The first Privateer to dock at the recently ordained Governor&amp;rsquo;s Island with the support of 2 million Loyalists will be appointed the first Governor of New Caribbean by the Royal family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plunderous is a game of area control, resource management, hand building, dice manipulation and negotiation. Each round you must strategically navigate and explore the islands, use your Crew to manipulate resources, parley with other Privateers, complete Patron requests and defend and conquer Ports to help acquire gold, resources, rewards and Loyalists. Only through piracy, pillaging and politics will you be the first to amass 2 million Loyalists and take your place as leader of the New Caribbean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
