							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warhammer 40,000 Battle Manual</name>
									
			<description>Between the original Warhammer Rogue Trader, released in 1987, and Warhammer 40,000 second edition in 1993, Games Workshop released the Battle Manual.  This book combined most of the Rogue Trader rules, with an overhauled combat system and with new rules for shooting.  The book also included most of the new weapons that had been published in White Dwarf during the five years for Rogue Trader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One might argue that this book is REALLY Warhammer 40,000 second edition, but that would conflict with the system numbering that is widely accepted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 96-page book has 18 pages of rules, 68 pages of weapon stats, 4 pages of catalog, and 8 pages of pull out charts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
