							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Idunn&#039;s Apples</name>
									
			<description>Loki once got in trouble with the gods by helping the giant Thjassi steal the goddess Idunn and her marvelous Apples of Youth. Loki was successful in getting Idunn back, but the gods are not done punishing Loki for his misdeeds! They demand that Loki find all the missing apples and return them to the Gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to find 5 Apples of Youth and return them to the gods, before Loki is caught or killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 15 Story Cards which the player reads through on Loki's quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loki, trickster that he is, has four options for getting through the encounters on the cards.  He can:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Whisper sweet lies.&lt;br/&gt;2) Leave and sneak back later.&lt;br/&gt;3) Boast of greater treasure.&lt;br/&gt;4) Transform into a falcon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But will those options be enough to steal back the apples?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was an entry in the 18 Card MicroGame Contest [2014].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; It won first place for Best Theme.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; It won second place for Originality/Innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
