			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure pits a group of investigators against a terrible foe, one who has been raised up from death into a grisly and hideous form by a descendent. While the investigators' ultimate enemy is the grisly revenant, they will have to cut their way through several levels of deception, not to mention several potentially dangerous opponents. Success will free the town of Bracken, Maine from a great evil. Failure will result in the destruction of the town and death (or worse) for its innocent inhabitants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is fairly challenging for normal investigators and a minimum of three investigators is suggested. The adventure is set in 1996 and the action takes place in Maine. However, with some effort, it could be modified for an earlier time period or another setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
