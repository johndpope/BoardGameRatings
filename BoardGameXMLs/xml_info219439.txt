			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For centuries the Temple and the people of the Ro-Kan have lived in symbiotic harmony and for centuries the secrets of the Kami and the mountain have passed between these two allies. Misao, like all village elders has for decades made the decisions for his village and acted as apothecary using the secrets passed down from elder to elder. When his special mix of herbs, found on the mountain, are burned in his censers it clears those of aliments, clears the mind or soul. The peasants in his village follow his every word without question and although physically weak his strength lies in the wise words he draws upon to inspire those around him to great feats of combat prowess in the defence of their lands and peers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
