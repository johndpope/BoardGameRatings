							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anima Tactics: Grimorium Verum</name>
									
			<description>Grimorium is the heaviest Combat Gear model developed by Wissenchaft. Almost unstoppable, this Lost Logias weapon enters the battlefield to annihilate everything in his path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutral Wissenschaft Warrior/Mystic- Lv. 55+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At 4 | Dm 8 | Df 7 | Ar 6 | LP 35 | Re 10 | Mo 6/10 | AP Varies/4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innate Abilities:Damage Resistance, Immunity (Poison).&lt;br/&gt;Armor Piercing: Any hand-to-hand Attack made by Grimorium ignores 2 points of the defender's Armor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;oo+ - Exodia Cannon (Magic, Ranged Attack)&lt;br/&gt;Distance (8 inches). For each additional Action Point spent, Exodia Cannon attack gets 4 inches of additional Distance and +2 Damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ooo - Magus Burst (Magic, Charge)&lt;br/&gt;If this Charge hits its target, Grimorium makes a new Attack on every Unit (except the Charge target) within 2 inches of itself. Each new Attack must be rolled separately as a normal Hand-to-hand Attack (they don't get any of the Charge bonus).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ooo - Veritas (Magic, Attack)&lt;br/&gt;Veritas affects all enemy Units within 2 inches of Grimorium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grimorium - Pilot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gear: A Gear cannot have Advantage cards associated and you must select a Pilot for it. The cost of the Pilot is added to the Gear's Level. The Pilot selected for a Gear determines the number of Actions Points it will recover per Turn and may give additional abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unique Pilot: The same Pilot cannot be selected more than once in the same party, regardless of the Gear he is in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technomagical Powered Armor: You can take any number of Grimorium Gears in your party, as long as you follow the Unique Pilot rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reist Ebersbacher - Lv. +25&lt;br/&gt;Recharge: ooo&lt;br/&gt;Innate Abilities: Initiative.&lt;br/&gt;As Pilot: Grimorium obtains +1 Attack, +1 Defense, +2 Resistance and Critical Mastery.&lt;br/&gt;Leader: Grimorium becomes a Leader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frederick Mausser - Lv. +15&lt;br/&gt;Recharge: ooo&lt;br/&gt;Marksmanship: Grimorium obtains +1 Attack to its Ranged Attacks.&lt;br/&gt;Aim Shot: If Grimorium doesn't use any Movement during its activation, it gets +1 Attack to its Ranged Attacks that Turn. This bonus stacks with Marksmanship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steiner Wenzel - Lv. +5&lt;br/&gt;Recharge: oo&lt;br/&gt;Repairs: Grimorium may spend 1 Action Point each Turn during its Activation to recover 5 Life Points.&lt;br/&gt;Additional Armor: Grimorium gets +1 Armor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
