			<description>This quiz game is played in two rounds. In the first round the theme cards are used, the theme cards show names of historical persons or titels of wellknown works of arts or literature. The players must name the right time for either life of the person or the time when the work was generated. If the time is named correctly, the player may take a token from the board. In the second round event- and person-cards are used. Now a series of events must be ordered chronologically, or the players must name a year within the lifespan of a certain person. The game ends when all tokens are taken off the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
