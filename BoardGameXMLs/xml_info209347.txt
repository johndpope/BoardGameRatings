			<description>This is a small manual dexterity game produced by French game publishers Villard et Weill in the late 19th Century as part of a large box of mixed games marketed by the company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a small wooden top and a game board set into the box. The board is a 4 x 4 grid of squares with a diamond in the middle. The 17 resulting spaces are numbered and separated by raised cardboard ridges except for a gap between each square and its numerical neighbors. Players start the top spinning in square 1 on the upper left corner and must tilt the box to guide the top through the gaps up to the 17 (diamond) space in the middle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules printed inside the box lid sets three possible victory conditions. The winner can be the player who reaches the highest number with a single spin, the one who can record the highest total from three spins, or simply the first to succeed in reaching the centre space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
