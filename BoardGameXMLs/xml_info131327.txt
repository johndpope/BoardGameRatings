							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wild Oltrenatura</name>
									
			<description>Wild Oltrenatura leads players into the most uncontaminated habitats on Earth: Kenya's savannah, Namibia's desert, Colombia's jungle, and Alaska's glaciers and forests. Explorers will parachute into regions waiting to be explored. Here, they will have to walk or swim, seeking out the best routes, in order to meet the wildest animals and survive. They will have to face &amp;ndash; and collect &amp;ndash; scary sharks, huge cats, aggressive pachyderms, the most poisonous snakes, and many more animals they've probably never even heard of, all while carefully monitoring their energy, water and health supplies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Wild Oltrenatura is to meet as many animals as possible and, of course, to survive in the different extreme environments. During your turn, you have to decide whether to move 1-3 spaces (consuming water and energy) to receive an animal card or special natural resource benefits, feed (discard an animal card to get energy back), or rest (to recover one energy, water or health). Players can challenge opponents to take over their animal cards, and the game ends as soon as one player has explored all four environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
