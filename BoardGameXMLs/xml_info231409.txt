			<description>Strategy meets fun and fast gameplay! A card game you can play anytime, anywhere, with anyone, regardless of your experience level!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play, you will start the game with a single shared Spellslingers deck and draw five cards. During your turn, draw one card and play one card of your choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a Spellslinger, your objective is simple: eliminate your competition! Cast spells to attack your opponents, and if successful, they are out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To keep yourself from being defeated, you'll have to block attacks by discarding a card from your hand that shares a color or has a higher spell level than the card attacking you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, there are reaction spells that can be played at any time, that changes the game in an instant!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players continue taking their turns until there is one play left standing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
