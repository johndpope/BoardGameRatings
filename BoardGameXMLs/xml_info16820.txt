			<description>Card game for Ages 5 and up based on the popular children's books. Players watch for Waldo as cards are played face up into the center of the table. Waldo Watchers hurry to be the first to slap down their &amp;quot;I Found Waldo&amp;quot; cards when they spot him. The winner crosses off one of the letters of &amp;quot;WALDO&amp;quot; on the score pad. Cross them all off and you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
