			<description>Taktikus is a simple two-player abstract strategy game. The game is played with eight wooden marbles for each player (white and black, respectively) on an 8 by 8 square grid of indents. The objective of the game is to capture the opponent&amp;rsquo;s marbles. At the beginning each player places his or her marbles in the first row (i.e. the row closest to the respective player).  Each player then on turn moves one marble of choice. A marble may move horizontally or vertically (but not diagonally) as far as the player wants but is not allowed to jump over other marbles (of either color). Change of direction during a move is not allowed. Marbles are captured in one of two ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     by capturing one or more of the opponents marbles (in an unbroken row or column) between two of one&amp;rsquo;s own marbles.&lt;br/&gt;     by moving a marble into an empty space in-between two of the opponents marbles, which are both captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player is left with only one marble (unless he/she is able to win the game in the subsequent move by capturing two of the opponent marbles) and the other player is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rule sheet that comes with the game has a couple of diagrams illustrating the two types of capture.&lt;br/&gt;The nice, small wooden board is in two hinged halves with storage compartment for the marbles inside when closed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
