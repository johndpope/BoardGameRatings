			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tenement blocks that make up the north side of Woebegone Crescent, Folly Hills have recently been served with a Condemnation Order by the Department of Public Health, part of the Three Canals Metropolitan Area Authority. The characters will be begged to intervene on behalf of the residents. After some investigations, intimidation, bribery and possibly some corruption, they will eventually find some dirt on a local politician responsible for the decision. This dirt will be enough to persuade him to reverse the decision. All's well that ends well. Or maybe not...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure originally appeared in Valkyrie (Issue 28 - 2003) and was subsequently published as a standalone scenario (retaining the exact format used in the magazine).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
