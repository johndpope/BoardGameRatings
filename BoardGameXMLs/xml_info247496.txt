			<description>One complete game consists of two game rounds. The first round is a hiking tour played with 1 die, the second a bicycle tour with 2 dice. Each player starts with a score of 10 points. On the hiking tour the players have to draw an event card if they get on a &amp;quot;DJH&amp;quot; space. If a player rolls a 1, one point is deducted from his score. On the bicycle tour an event card is drawn after each roll and a point is deducted by the roll of a double.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to finish the bicycle tour gets a Bonus of 5 points, the second player gets 3 points. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
