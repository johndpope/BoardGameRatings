			<description>A long, long time ago, after a loot of a cursed treasure, a pirate ship was devastated by an intense storm and pushed into the lowlands of a distant archipelago. The enigmatic medallions recovered by the natives over the years and the strange events that have taken place ever since, make the population on the islands fear that the curse is upon them. In Medallions, players embrace the characters of the natives charged with exorcising the curse and seeking to recover the medallions to launch them into a giant furnace. The purpose is to transform them into pure metal ingots. But beware: not all members on the mission are well-intentioned...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Medallions players have to collect medallions of 3 colors within the islands to transform them into gold ingots (VP's). In their turn players move their disc on the track up to 3 cases. Then, their pawn inside the board repeats the move selected. To continue the movement and go further a player may use cards from a common stack. At the beginning of the game each player receives a secret role (there may be a traitor or not in the team). If you are a good charater you will try to transform the highest number of medallions you can, trying to identify and accuse an eventual traitor (there are risks doing so). The traitor will have another goal: collect secretly the highest number of black medallions (traitor VP's). A traitor only can be accused until 3/4 of the game track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a simple but important economic gestion. To have money to buy new medallions arriving in a island, players will need to sell medallions and special ability cards that may be played in your turn. As they are sold, the pile will increase and someone can buy them all! Note that sold medallions are put face down, and only buyers can have access to the information about who sold what.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
