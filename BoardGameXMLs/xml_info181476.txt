							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grandpa Beck&#039;s Nuts about Mutts</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuts about Mutts is a high-energy game that is challenging enough to keep all players on their toes but simple enough to be enjoyed by the whole family. The pile in the center of the table is your dogs&amp;rsquo; home! You can send your dog home if its color, number, or dog breed matches the card on top of the home pile. The home pile is also where fun &amp;ldquo;wild cards&amp;rdquo; like the mutt, flea, fire hydrant, and pedigree cards are played. The first player to empty their hand wins, so players want to get all their dogs back home as fast as possible while ruthlessly preventing other players from doing the same! If players choose to use advanced game rules, all players must be on the lookout for opportunities to steal someone&amp;rsquo;s turn by matching a card to the one in play or starting a numeric run. Being a sly dog is the best way to succeed at Nuts about Mutts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
