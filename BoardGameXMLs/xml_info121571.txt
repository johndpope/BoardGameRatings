			<description>From the back page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ancient tower brooded over the landscape for as long as anyone can remember. Animals and people alike avoided the bleak ruins. Old Beric claimed an ancient evil rested beneath, dreaming of its release. Strange lights were spotted dancing within the crumbling edifice during the last full moon. Now the trees nearby have become twisted and rotted, while the grass has blackened and died. Do you have the courage to take up your sword and shield, venture into the unknown, and discover the dangers within?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This booklet is a sample of the Sword &amp;amp; Shield game. It provides the basics of game play and character creation. The full rules contain many more classes, more magic, special abilities and more monsters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
