							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dirty Devil</name>
									
			<description>The object of the game is to earn the dubious title of 'Dirty Devil' by collecting the most cherub cards.  There are four piles of coloured cards.  Each player receives an equal number of cherub cards.  A player spins the devil&amp;rsquo;s fork to determine the card category: debauched, dexterous, dramatic or despicable.  The card is read out.  The fork is spun again to determine the player&amp;rsquo;s partner/victim.  If either victim finds the deed too distasteful they can get out of it by surrendering a cherub card to the other player.  Bluffing is the name of the game.  A player is out of the game when they lose all of their cherub cards.  A game for consenting adults!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
