			<description>Designer's Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I finally did it.  I wrote a sci-fi adventure.  Echo Patrol is a straight forward adventure, but I had a lot of fun changing up the genre.  I've been toying with the idea of doing a sci-fi micro-adventure since I first created my Patreon.  I plan to sprinkle in more now that I've broke the Martian ice.  And I've finally bought a few of the systems so I can get some ideas.  Just need to read them now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the things I added into Echo Patrol was the mission objective.  More of a military or company set of goals they want to achieve.  The other thing I added is salvage.  One of my favorite things in futuristic games is scavenging for parts hoping to make something useful.  You'll find various objects assigned a salvage value.  Make of them what you will.  I'm open for suggestions.  It's a system I would like to develop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Micro Adventure published on Tim Shorts's Patreon page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
