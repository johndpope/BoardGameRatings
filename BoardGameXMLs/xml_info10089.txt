							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tough Luck</name>
									
			<description>Tough Luck is similar to Tripoley (aka Michigan Rummy) but with trick-taking instead of set collection. Each player antes on the 8 money card spots on the game mat plus the Bonus Pot. Players who win cards in a trick that match the spots on the mat get to collect the chips on that spot UNLESS that trick also contains a Tough Luck deuce. In that case, the chips stay on the mat until the next round when that card will be worth even more chips. The Bonus Pot goes to the player who takes the most tricks in a round UNLESS there is a tie in which case the bonus pot is carried over into the next round too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2 to 6 players Ages 8 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
