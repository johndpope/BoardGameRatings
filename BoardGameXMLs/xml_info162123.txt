			<description>War Games Rules for the Great War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great War has never attracted the attention of war-gamers in the same way that conflicts both before and since have done. There are probably a number of reasons for this but the common perception, especially in the UK, that Great War battles were little more than exercises in mass slaughter ordered by remote and uncaring generals probably has much to do with the reluctance to game this period.&lt;br/&gt;These views are now being re-appraised by a fresh generation of historians and researchers who, without playing down the horrors of the trenches, the scale of the suffering or the terrible cost of a &amp;quot;Big Push&amp;quot;, are challenging many previously held ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flanders Fields is a set of rules which allows players to war game actions from Regiment (Brigade), to Divisional level actions from the war on the western front between 1914 and 1918.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules seek to provide an enjoyable gaming experience for all players, regardless of the final result. As such a degree of sportsmanship is necessary between players, it is perfectly acceptable to seek to slaughter the toy soldiers on the table top but in dealings with other players please maintain a degree of sportsmanship. In cases where the interpretation of a rule might be in doubt, for instance whether a unit is in or out of range let the roll of a die or toss of a coin decide.&lt;br/&gt;The rules are divided into four main sections&lt;br/&gt;A brief consideration of those aspects of the Great War which serve to distinguish it from previous and later conflicts.&lt;br/&gt;The main body of the rules.&lt;br/&gt;Generic tables of divisional organisation which may be used to pick forces for a game.&lt;br/&gt;A number of appendices providing extra information and examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
