			<description>&amp;ldquo;Air Challenge&amp;rdquo; is a board game that lets players experience the thrill of runway operations and the challenges they pose, bringing the excitement of this world-famous airport into their living room!  To win the game, players need to manage their cards to arrange aircraft takeoffs and landings on the two airport runways and collect stars as fast as possible.  The first player to obtain 10 stars or points WINS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Setup:&lt;br/&gt;-Each player takes two Aircraft of the same color.&lt;br/&gt;-Shuffle the Action Card deck and deal each player 5 cards.&lt;br/&gt;-The rest of the Action Cards are placed face-down in the section of the board marked &amp;ldquo;Action Card (Draw)&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;-Shuffle the Aircraft Cards with the Scenario Cards. Place the deck face-down in the section of the board marked &amp;ldquo;Aircraft Card (Draw)&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;-The order of play is to be determined by the players.&lt;br/&gt;-At the start of each player&amp;rsquo;s turn, the player should make sure that each of the three Aircraft Card spaces, both North and South, has an Aircraft Card as shown here. If any of these spaces are empty, the player should draw cards from the Aircraft Card (Draw) pile to fill them. After the player finishes his turn, the next player should again replace the Aircraft Card spaces from the Aircraft Card (Draw) pile if necessary.&lt;br/&gt;-If a Scenario Card is turned up before the game starts, no action is needed, and the drawn Scenario Card should be inserted back at the bottom of the Aircraft Card (Draw) pile. In subsequent turns, the instruction on the Scenario Card must be executed prior to any other action by any player.&lt;br/&gt;--A player can take a maximum of three actions on each turn; in other words, he or she can play a maximum of three Action Cards. All played Action Cards are discarded at the area marked &amp;ldquo;Action Card (Discard)&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action Descriptions:&lt;br/&gt;-Take off from the Runway, Play a &amp;ldquo;Takeoff Permit&amp;rdquo; Action Card, or &amp;ldquo;Landing Permit&amp;rdquo; Action Card.&lt;br/&gt;-Select a face-up Aircraft Card from the &amp;ldquo;Aircraft Card space.&lt;br/&gt;-Place an Aircraft on the selected Aircraft Card and place the set at the first space of the Runway.&lt;br/&gt;-A player uses &amp;ldquo;Arrow&amp;rdquo; Action Cards to move the Aircraft on the runways by matching the number of stars on the Aircraft Card. For example:&lt;br/&gt;-1-Star Aircraft: Requires one &amp;ldquo;1 Arrow&amp;rdquo; Action Card to move the Aircraft one space forward.&lt;br/&gt;-2-Star Aircraft:Requires one &amp;ldquo;2 Arrows&amp;rdquo; Action Card OR two &amp;ldquo;1 Arrow&amp;rdquo; Action Cards to move the Aircraft one space forward &lt;br/&gt;-3-Star Aircraft: Requires one &amp;ldquo;3 Arrows&amp;rdquo; Action Card, OR one &amp;ldquo;2 Arrows&amp;rdquo; Action Card plus one &amp;ldquo;1 Arrow&amp;rdquo; Action Card, OR three &amp;ldquo;1 Arrow&amp;rdquo; Action Cards to move the Aircraft one space forward.&lt;br/&gt;-So, the higher the number of stars an Aircraft Card has, the more difficult it is to move because it requires more arrows on the Action Cards. Using more &amp;ldquo;Arrow&amp;rdquo; Action Cards than what is required is acceptable for moving the Aircraft, but the player will not receive the difference back. For example, a player can use a &amp;ldquo;3 Arrows&amp;rdquo; Action Card to move a 1-Star Aircraft one space. However, the other two arrows will be forfeited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-When a player has moved the Aircraft to the third space on the South Runway AND then uses one or more &amp;ldquo;Arrow&amp;rdquo; Action Cards that allow the Aircraft to move one more space forward, the takeoff process is complete. The player may keep the Aircraft Card and get a score according to the number of stars shown on the card. The first player to obtain 10 stars wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-An Aircraft that has not completed the takeoff process in one turn will remain in its final position on the runway until the player&amp;rsquo;s next turn. Aircraft idling on the runways are subject to other player&amp;rsquo;s actions, including &amp;ldquo;Diversions&amp;rdquo; and instructions shown on drawn Scenario Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diversion:&lt;br/&gt;-When a player wants to take off, land or move an Aircraft on the runway but is obstructed by another player&amp;rsquo;s Aircraft, he may use a &amp;ldquo;Diversion&amp;rdquo; Action Card to divert it.&lt;br/&gt;-When a player uses a &amp;ldquo;Diversion&amp;rdquo; Action Card to remove another player&amp;rsquo;s Aircraft, the player being diverted can use an &amp;ldquo;Emergency Takeoff / Landing&amp;rdquo; Action Card to stop the diversion. Without the emergency card, the affected Aircraft Card will be removed tothe &amp;ldquo;Diverted Flights&amp;rdquo; area.&lt;br/&gt;-When 10 Aircraft Cards have been removed to &amp;ldquo;Diverted Flights&amp;rdquo;, the game ends in a draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other Important Points :&lt;br/&gt;-A player cannot keep more than 10 Action Cards at any time; otherwise, he or she needs to discard the extra cards in the &amp;ldquo;Action Card (Discard)&amp;rdquo; area.&lt;br/&gt;-When no more Action Cards remain, shuffle the cards from the &amp;ldquo;Action Card (Discard)&amp;rdquo; area and place the shuffled deck face-down at the &amp;ldquo;Action Card (Draw)&amp;rdquo; area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
