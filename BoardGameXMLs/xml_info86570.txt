							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Arcane Duelist</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Straddling the world between the training grounds of the professional soldier and the secluded schools of the spellcaster, the arcane duelist is spell-wielding warrior. An arcane duelist is too free-spirited or multitalented to study martial discipline or magical training exclusively. Instead, he combines elements of both to deadly effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many arcane duelists are self-taught swordmasters and mages, relying on personal genius to excel in a unique form of combined combat. Others are the products of special academies devoted to the art of the wand and sword. Some of these schools specialize in particular weapons and spells; others encourage arcane duelists to explore their gifts through duels and adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arcane duelist is ready for almost anything he encounters. His combination of mundane might and magical techniques makes him a formidable opponent. An arcane duelist excels at protecting himself from magical attack while he assaults his opponent with spells and steel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
