			<description>In this game players have to climb a mountain. The one who does that the first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start all players take chance tokens and place them upside down on various board tiles. Later each player gets energy tokens. Then they roll the die and move as many tiles as the number they rolled. If a player wants, he/she could lose one (or more) of his energy tokens and go climb as many spaces as the number of energy tokens he/she gave up. If player steps on a chance token, he/she must take it and do whatever it says. There are various tokens - some orders to go some spaces up or down, some orders to roll die again. If player takes a card with a lion or aborigines, he must fight by placing any number of energy tokens between 1 and 5 and rolling die. If rolled number is higher than tokens placed, player will lose. If player   loses to the aborigines, they will rob him/her and the player will lose all energy tokens. If player loses against the lion, he will have to fight again and again (each fight is one turn). If player loses all of his/her energy tokens, he/she loses the game. If player passes another player, he/she must give him/her one energy token. If player steps on tile occupied by other player, that other player must give him/her energy token. If player wins against lion, he must go back to the nearest village. If two players step on lion at the same time, they must fight against the lion together by placing energy tokens. They can place no more than 5 tokens as a group. &lt;br/&gt; This game was released by Azar in Lithuania so it could be unknown in other parts of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
