			<description>Blurb From Publisher --&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;16 page adventure&lt;br/&gt;3 unique creatures&lt;br/&gt;2 pre made characters&lt;br/&gt;A form fillable characer sheet&lt;br/&gt;several maps&lt;br/&gt;&amp;amp; more&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first adventure packet that I&amp;rsquo;m writing for the 13th age roleplaying game system and is intended to be a suppliment to add to your game world. The 13th age roleplaying game core rule book is required for the full experience. Included will be a pair of premade characters, unique creatures and locations as well as the first in a series of the &amp;ldquo; Creeping Dark&amp;rdquo; encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The geographic location of the township of Tymore, its surrounding farms &amp;amp; the Sahasi guild are not stipulated to allow them to be slotted anywhere in your gaming world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the GM and of course the world is yours &amp;amp; your players to shape.  Feel free to follow the guidelines or use them merely as inspiration to craft your own stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though this is written &amp;amp; intended to be run using the 13th age roleplaying game, the contents herein are easily compatible with many D20 products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
