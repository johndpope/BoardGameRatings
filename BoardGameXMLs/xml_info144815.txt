							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doctor Who and the Doom of the Daleks</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Doctor Who and the Doom of the Daleks&amp;quot; is an as-yet unauthorized cooperative board game for 2 to 4 players. Players play as Companions to &amp;quot;the Doctor&amp;quot; and together try to rid time of the scourge of the Dalek invasion. Each turn more Daleks enter the board at different Eras of time (similar to the spread of diseases in Pandemic) and it is up to the Doctor and his Companions to &amp;quot;purge&amp;quot; them. On a player's turn, more Daleks spawn, and then the player gets 2 actions: 1 Companion action, and 1 Doctor action. Play continues until either the Daleks win by 1) killing the Doctor 4 times (the Doctor starts with 3 regeneration tokens), 2) spawning all Daleks from the supply into the timeline, or 3) taking control of 3 Eras; or, the Companions win by purging the entire timeline of Leader Daleks, AND placing Time Seals in 3 Eras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
