							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">My Little Pony Game</name>
									
			<description>The Little Ponies have gone to the fair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players travel around the board representing the fairgrounds. The primary feature of the board is the merry-go-round. While going around the fair players try to collect gold rings. Riding the merry-go-round is the best place to get them, but you only get to ride once each trip around the board unless you have a free ride token. The first player to collect five gold rings and leave the fair wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a great game for kids, but has enough to keep adults entertained as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
