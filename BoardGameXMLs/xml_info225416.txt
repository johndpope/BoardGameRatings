			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are senior members of Cardiff University's archaeological Department. They have been called in to support, and investigate, a troubled dig deep in the Black Mountains of Wales. The locals are hostile to the dig, a student has gone missing and the head of the dig, Professor Graham Stuart, has begun to act strangely. The university wants the player to assess the continued viability of the dig, and find out if Professor Stuart is competent in running the dig site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
