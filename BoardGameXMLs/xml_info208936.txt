							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Phailin</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town of Phailin was once a large adventuring hub, but has undergone a decline in trade and population due to the reduction in the number of adventurers, due in turn to the introduction of adventuring licenses. An adventuring license is required to legally explore the surrounding ruins and dungeons; trespassing in these ruins is a jailing offense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The land around Phailin is made up of heavily forested hills, with a number of ruins scattered through them. Phailin has a number of major points of interest that the characters can utilize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 1st - 4th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
