							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Storm&#039;s Edge</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the desolate planet of Tatooine, hope comes in many forms. One of these is the tree keeper Momaw Nadon. While not as critical as secret Death Star plans or as inspiring as the legend of a farm boy who became a Jedi Knight, rumors of secret groves of bafforr trees give delight to the children of Tatooine and hope to the adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Storm&amp;rsquo;s Edge is a short adventure for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game designed for four 6th-level heroes. It is also suitable for larger parties of lower-level heroes. For larger 6th-level groups, add three thug 4s for each extra hero to the sail barge battle (see Scene 2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Storm&amp;rsquo;s Edge is written for the Rebellion era, but you can run it in any era with a little work. In The Rise of the Empire era, Momaw (see Background) may be just beginning to cultivate his bafforr grove, with local gangsters plotting for his valuable land. In the time of New Jedi Order, set the start of the adventure in Mos Entha or even the remote Eidolon Base. Specific details about how the different eras affect Tatooine can be found in the Secrets of Tatooine campaign pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is suitable for any mix of heroes, but having several ranks in a few skills makes the adventure much easier. The Pilot skill makes the adventure more manageable during the eventual maneuvering of the sail barge (see Scene 2), and Gather Information is useful for the cantina encounter in Scene 1. While the Gamemaster (GM) shouldn&amp;rsquo;t discourage nonlethal solutions to this adventure, the scenario does lend itself primarily to combat-oriented classes such as soldier and Jedi guardian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
