The player also win points by jumping, smashing and flipping in the room. There are 8 racetracks in the game, all of them are taking place in one of the rooms of the house and are filled with obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the singleplayer, there's a multiplayer mode, where up to 8 players can battle online, and leaderboards, where players can see their high scores.
