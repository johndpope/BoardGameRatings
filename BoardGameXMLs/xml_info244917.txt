							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carried Away</name>
									
			<description>Carried Away is physics based puzzle game where you construct chairlifts, drag lifts, gondolas, jumps and bridges to help skiers and mountain bikers navigate a range of mountain terrain. It is inspired by the classic bridge building genre. Using tension and compression created by cable systems, it flips what we love about bridge building upside down to create entirely new physics puzzles!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The campaign will dish out large doses of entertaining failure as the player attempts to build strong structures with a limited  budget. Set amongst the clouds in a colourful, low-poly world, you have the tools to create your own puzzles and engineer seemingly unfeasible chair lift systems. Once you have learned the ropes in the campaign, you can challenge your friends and the community and share your awesome creations and replays online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Chairlifts, Draglifts &amp;amp; Gondolas with original rope physics&lt;br/&gt;    Classic bridge &amp;amp; jump building with controllable skiers&lt;br/&gt;    50+ level campaign with regular content updates&lt;br/&gt;    Sandbox level designer&lt;br/&gt;    Steam Workshop&lt;br/&gt;    Replay sharing system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website: Press Kit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
