			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you will play either a spirit who has passed on or a living person. Everyone will be given a role, along with a description of who you are, who you are looking for, and what your ultimate goal is when you find them. As you search, you can traverse the border between life and death numerous times during a game. This happens naturally and calmly; you may barely notice it. At the end of the hour, though, your character will be stuck on their current side of the border and your ability to communicate with the other side will be forever lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
