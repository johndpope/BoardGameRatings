			<description>Publisher Blurb/Designer Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He sat tall in the saddle. His eyes, shadowed by a dusty wide brimmed hat, scanned the buildings in the valley.  His features were rugged and handsome, and he had the look of a man who had seen more hardship than one his age should have.  He was wide of shoulders and narrow at the waist where the gun hung loosely in its holster.  The Colt was old, but well tended, with a worn grip that was the telltale sign of much use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shotguns &amp;amp; Saddles (S-n-S) is a cinematic role playing game set in the American wild west.  The player characters take the role of cowboys, drifters, the town sheriff, or other desperados.  The referee creates adventures for these characters full of fast paced action, nail biting showdowns, and barroom shootouts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S-n-S takes its cue from the movies, books, and TV shows that dramatized this period.  It downplays the importance of specific dates and continuity while focusing on the romance, drama, action, and adventure of a good western tale.  This allows the referee to include any of the trappings of the genre, whether historically accurate or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S-n-S uses old school type mechanics inspired by the earliest role playing game.  The goal was to develop a familiar, simple, yet comprehensive set of rules that can be learned very quickly.  While concise, you will find them extremely versatile and able to satisfactorily handle most situations with a minimum of confusion or guesswork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
