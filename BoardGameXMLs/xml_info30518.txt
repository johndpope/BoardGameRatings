			<description>Palisade is played with a Go set.  Points available to Player 1 are interspersed with points available to Player 2 in a checkerboard pattern.  When you form a loop which surrounds enemy stones, you remove the enemy stones from the board.  Neither player may place stones into a loop.  A player owns the perimeter of his loop as well as all of the points contained within the loop.  When all of the board points, both occupied and unoccupied are owned by the players, the game is concluded and the player who owns the majority of points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rule sheet:&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.marksteeregames.com/Palisade_rules.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.marksteeregames.com/Palisade_rules.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Super Duper Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
