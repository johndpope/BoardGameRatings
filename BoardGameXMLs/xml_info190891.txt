			<description>Rack n' Ruin is an action adventure game featuring Rack, a demonic wizard with a flair for chaos and destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use a combination of malevolent magic, apocalyptic abilities, woeful weapons and insidious items as you journey across a vast open world. Ransack ancient dungeons, defeat hordes of heroic and unholy forces, battle a collection of behemoths and bosses, and discover the secrets of the land you seek to conquer. Watch your demonic powers grow as you enslave and corrupt the land, twisting fairytales into nightmares and turning paradise into pandemonium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wonderful hand-painted artwork within the game is created by former Blizzard artist Tyler Hunter, whose work you may have seen in World of Warcraft, Starcraft 2, Diablo 3 and Prey. Rack n' Ruin aims to recapture the magic of classic adventure games like Legend of Zelda and Alundra, while also drawing inspiration from modern indie titles such as the Binding of Isaac. It's a nostalgic yet fresh experience - a cheeky adventure that leads players on an enchanting journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
