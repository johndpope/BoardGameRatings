							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rising of the Storm</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long time ago, five heroes faced the forces of nature. They turned the world of chaos and danger into the world of humankind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their deeds gave rise to myths. Myths that bind, shape and guard the reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now, the bindings start to crack. The laws of myth are no longer absolute. Alien things lurk in the shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A storm is coming. One unlike anything seen since the mythic times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rising of the Storm is a setting designed to be used with the Fate Core system. It presents the kingdom of Klart, a land ruled by myth and tradition, but now shaken by civil unrest and by strange powers awakening in people who least expected it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as members of a noble House; as a gang of criminals and runaway slaves; or as a group of spies and agents. Explore the politics of the king's court and of the Port District's alleys; the mythic paths of High Arts; the mysterious creatures that shouldn't be able to exist. Try to survive in a world that breaks down around you &amp;ndash; or take a chance and give it a new shape of your design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 85 pages, you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Outline of Klart's geography, culture and politics&lt;br/&gt;    The myths that rule the world&lt;br/&gt;    The Arts, magic of the myths, and Wounds, new powers born of pain and madness&lt;br/&gt;    Monsters that plague Klart and a roster of example NPCs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
