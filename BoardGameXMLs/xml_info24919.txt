							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Aristocrats</name>
									
			<description>In 2005, Penn Jilette sponsored a contest for the DVD release of his documentary, The Aristocrats.  The best submissions of the joke, The Aristocrats, would be included on the DVD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was one of the submissions.  It lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, Insane Game Designer Mike Young has placed it on his website free for download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Aristocrats card game plays just like Crazy Eights or Uno, except that you must play two cards on your turn instead of one.  The object is to rid yourself of all of your cards before anyone else does the same.  You tell the story/joke of The Aristocrats during the course of the game and are encouraged to be as creative, clever and, well, disgusting as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The more players you have, the longer the game will take.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning: This game contains graphic descriptions of disgusting and perverted acts both sexual and scatological.  It is not intended for children, the easily offended, the general public, or people who can't take a joke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
