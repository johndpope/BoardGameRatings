							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">WORLD WAR THREE: The Last Option</name>
									
			<description>After more than 40 years of tension and arms build-up between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., it has become clear the Soviets must take action in order to survive as a global empire. It is the summer of 1985. It has become World War III.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take control of Soviet or NATO forces in a conflict that stretches from Oslo to Riyadh! With an all new combat system based on our favorite parts of the Axis &amp;amp; Allies series of games, you will nuke, bomb, and battle your way to victory using 7 different types of units, supplies, and diplomacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing board is a map of Europe, Western Asia, and the Middle East divided into areas that players control with their combat forces, represented by plastic figures like the ones from Axis &amp;amp; Allies or Table Tactics. Players can influence neutral countries, launch nuclear missile strikes, fly air combat missions, and attack with ground units to take control of the other side's countries and resources to force the enemy into surrender. Combat system works best with D12, but optional rules are included for a D6 system. The game is over when the victory conditions are met. Can be played by 2,3,or 4 people dividing the factions of USA, NATO, Soviet Union, and Warsaw Pact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
