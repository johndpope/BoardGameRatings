			<description>A Checkers variant played with red/white reversible pieces, five to each player, on a 6 x 7 grid of red, white, and blue squares.  The rules on the back of the box include three variants of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts on either narrow side of the board; the objective is to capture all the opponent's pieces to win.  Movement of the pieces is dictated by the color of the square which each piece is on.  Pieces are captured by landing on them, turning them over, and placing them on the capturing player's side of the board.  The three variants have slightly different rules to increase difficulty of winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
