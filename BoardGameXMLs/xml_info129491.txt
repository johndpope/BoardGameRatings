			<description>FreshBiz is a game that fundamentally changes the way its participants play their business and life by simulating and then practicing new, creative methods of entrepreneurial thinking, and problem solving to achieve their most vital goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through its game-based learning, participants travel through the game on a mission to win, while gaining skills, understandings and strategies that not only help them to achieve the goals in the game, but also to excel in their lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Utilizing common business practices, and years of insight from entrepreneurs, FreshBiz uses tools such as the buying &amp;amp; selling of businesses, leveraging, negotiations, loans, business opportunities and more to simulate a business environment. Simultaneously, relationships are being forged and the atmosphere of the room buzzes as participants engage with themselves and others in entrepreneurial, multi-dimensional thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insights gained during a 60 to 90-minute game last far into the future, as our participants claim that the game impacts them for the rest of their lives. There is a distinction between change and transformation. Working harder, doing something less, spending more time else, etc are change, while transformation through FreshBiz is what shifts your paradigm completely and offers you the opportunity to play business, relationships, and life in a whole new way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you play FreshBiz, your goal is to reach the &amp;quot;Winner&amp;quot; lot in 90 minutes. In order to achieve your objective, as you pass from section to section (paying tolls to pass), you will have to handle different business dimensions and practice entrepreneurial skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Businesses&lt;br/&gt;In order to pay tolls as you cross through the board on the way to the Island, you will need to earn money. One of the many ways to do that is by starting businesses. Each player gets different businesses cards and each business card has an establishment cost and a profit. You will have to be creative and smart in handling your budget, cash flow, and strategy in order to turn your original capital into the profits you need to move ahead in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just as in life, each player starts the game with their own unique set of Action Cards. Essentially, these are your gifts, talents and special abilities in the game. It's up to you to use them in the best way possible, and they can be played during any turn. So, be creative and you will make money and friends The Stock Market, Loans, &amp;amp; Partnerships As you go through the game, there will be many business dimensions that you can leverage to help you win, such as the Stock Market, Loans, Partnerships and more...&lt;br/&gt;The more dimensions you master the better results you will get and the more fun you will have...in FreshBiz and in life! So go win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
