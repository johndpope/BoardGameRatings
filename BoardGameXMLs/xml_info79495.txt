			<description>SiN Episodes is the title of a series of episodic games for the PC that would have expanded upon the 1998 computer game SiN. A total of nine episodes were planned with only the first one released. Developed by Ritual Entertainment and powered by the Source engine, the first episode &amp;quot;Emergence&amp;quot; was the first computer game by a major developer to both be produced episodically and delivered over the Internet without the intervention of a publisher. This was accomplished through Valve Corporation's Steam content delivery system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Released on May 10, 2006, &amp;quot;Emergence&amp;quot; is the first episode in the series and introduces the various characters that will play a part. Reviews of the game were mixed. Gamespot gave it a 7.3 out of 10, while G4TV's X-Play gave the game a 2 out of 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;SiN Episodes&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
