			<description>A plug and play game is an interactive entertainment device designed for use on a television set that integrates the video game console with the game controller. The game software is built directly into the unit, which is typically designed to look like a toy or classic game console/controller with the addition of two AV ports. These systems usually contain either highly specialized games or activities, or a collection of classic games. Thus, it could be viewed as a video game console without interchangeable game software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although several manufacturers produced these devices before 2002, such systems became better known following the release of Jakks Pacific's Atari Classic 10-in-1 TV game. Most manufacturers have their own trademarked names for these systems, such as Radica's &amp;quot;Play TV&amp;quot; or Majesco's &amp;quot;TV Arcade&amp;quot;; however, most retailers refer to all of them as TV games or Plug &amp;amp; Play games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Handheld TV game&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
