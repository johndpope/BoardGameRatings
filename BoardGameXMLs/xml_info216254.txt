			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Less writing, more fighting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nothing slows an exciting battle down like pausing to calculate Unit Intensities and Glory rewards. The Book of Records, Vol. II puts an end to all that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This digital download bundle includes a set of three record sheets for Gamemasters and Player-knights in the King Arthur Pendragon roleplaying game. The easy-to-use PDF files, made to complement The Book of Battle 2nd. Ed., are designed to help players stay focused and on-task by automatically calculating Army and Unit Intensities as well as Glory totals. Beautiful, full-color sheets are provided in addition to printer-friendly black-and-white versions for those who still prefer the pen to the sword (or computer), but who want a lasting record of their triumphs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These indispensable sheets help players and Gamemasters spend less time crunching numbers and more time cracking ribs &amp;mdash; as it should be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This, the long-awaited second volume in the Book of Records series, features three Battle Records &amp;mdash; one each for the Gamemaster, Leader, and Player-knights &amp;mdash; for use with Book of Battle, 2nd Edition, a supplement for KING ARTHUR PENDRAGON. The sheets help clarify the battle rules and speed play through auto-calculating fields that determine the correct Unit and Army Intensities for each round as well as Glory awards for each player. Best of all, the record of your heroics can be preserved for posterity by simply saving a copy of the battle record to your computer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Book of Records, Vol. II: Battles includes designer&amp;rsquo;s notes and annotated versions of the record sheets. The sheets works for all Phases of The Great Pendragon Campaign and are provided in both full-color and printer-friendly black and white versions. The battle records require Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Reader and have been tested on both Macintosh and Windows platforms. They are recommended for use with laptops and desktop computers. Using the sheets in third-party PDF readers or on mobile devices may render unexpected results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Tab through fields to fill out your records quickly and easily&lt;br/&gt;     Auto-calculate Army an Unit Intensities, based on the ebb and flow of battle&lt;br/&gt;     Auto-calculate Glory rewards&lt;br/&gt;     Record &amp;ldquo;checks&amp;rdquo; for critical successes in battle (NEW!)&lt;br/&gt;     Save your data, preserving the details of the battle for all time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
