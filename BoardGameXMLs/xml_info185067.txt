			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the system, Characters have Characteristics, which are physical or mental abilities.  Attributes are derived from Characteristics.  Characters also may have Advantages or Disadvantages.  Characters also have one or more Skills which are specific talents and abilities.  Characters purchase Characteristics, Advantages, and Skills from a Character Point pool (usually 100-200 points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have 7 Characteristics:  Strength, Agility, Constitution, Intelligence, Power, Size, and Appeal.  Attributes consist of things like Hit Points, Stun Points, Fatigue Points, Power Points, and Damage Modifiers and for the most part are derived values.  Skills include Climb, Knife, Throw, Shield Parry, Drive Car, Pistol, Computer Ops, and so forth.  Characters usually select one Professional Skill, one Weapon Skill, one Environment Skill, one Transportation Skill, and Literacy, spending 24 Skill Points among them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is fairly complex and three distinct methods are provided:  Simple Combat, for streamlined encounters where the issue is in little doubt; Normal Combat, for typical use; and Mass Combat to handle large groups.  Combat rules provide for a very wide variety of actions, offensive, defensive, and movement.  The resulting combination of possibilities is complex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Appendices include Equipment, Non-Human Races, Wizards, Priests, and Monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
