			<description>This is a Hungarian space strategy game created in the 80's. One of the players, Captain John Konig protects the valuable energy packages while the others trying to get those from him. To achieve this he has to stop the other players, who have to get over various obstacles such as meteoric zones, narrow pass-through gates. These obstacles form concentric circles, the attacking players start on the outside, and their goal is to get to the center, get the energy packets, and take one of them to the starting zone. The quickest one wins the game. Each of the attacking players as well as Captain John Konig are controlling four spaceships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
