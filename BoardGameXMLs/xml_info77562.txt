							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guns of August 1914 - 1918</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher / Developer Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guns of August puts players in command of waging World War I at a grand strategic scale from Paris to Baghdad. The entire Western, Eastern, Italian and Balkan fronts are included as are the three fronts of the Ottoman Empire. Production, Combat, Diplomacy, Research, Trenches, Fog of war &amp;ndash; Land, Sea and Air combat are all included! Use land units like infantry corps complete with separate artillery units to precisely directing barrages on the enemy&amp;rsquo;s line. As time goes on, players must deal with changing combat situations like the introduction of the Stosstruppen and even mighty tanks charging though lines to break though the stalemate! Guns of August fully supports a robust AI to fight against as well as full support for play by email. Step back in time to the early 20th Century and hear the Guns of August!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
