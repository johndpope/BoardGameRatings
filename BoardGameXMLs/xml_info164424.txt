							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombie: Shambling and Hungry</name>
									
			<description>Zombies. Mindless, shambling, and existing only to feed. Much like you and your friends. It&amp;rsquo;s a 56 card game which is actually two games in one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombies: Shambling and Hungry: Use these zombie cards to simulate a zombie outbreak at your next party or family gathering! Sit yourself down for a fast and furious game of zombie dominance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game each player takes the role of a shambling and hungry zombie, trying their best to get to the front of the zombie horde where they&amp;rsquo;ll have the best chance at a juicy bite from one of those still living. Each zombie player will do their best to rid themselves of other nearby zombies (game cards) by pushing them back or foisting them onto other zombie players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to break away from the horde by discarding all of their cards wins! Play begins with the player to the left of the dealer. That player must play one card into a central pile. This card will be one of four suits: Hearts, Splatters, Biohazards or Palms. This card determines which suit will be the active suit. The first player ends their turn by drawing cards from their draw pile until they have 5 cards in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player cannot play a card of the same suit as the active suit, they must pick up all of the cards in the central pile and place them on the bottom of their draw pile, ending their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has also has a number on it. If a player has 2, 3 or 4 of a kind, which includes a card with the active suite, they may play all of these cards. The card with the active suit must be played last so that the active suit is still the top card on the central pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player ever has all 5 cards in their hand with the same suit (i.e. all biohazard), on their turn they may place all five cards on the central pile and then draw five cards (if possible) into their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to discard all of their cards in their draw pile and hand has successfully outdistanced the horde and wins! Watch out for Infected cards though, they're hard to get rid of!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombies: Infection: Each deck of Zombies: Shambling and Hungry comes with 20 Infected cards. They are used to infect your friends, who in turn can and should infect other friends! Use as many Infected cards as there are players. One person becomes Patient Zero, and starts off with 8 Infected cards. They then try to infect others! A the start of the game, only Patient Zero can infect other players. All players should agree on a time limit for the game &amp;ndash; it can be an hour or until the end of an event&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
