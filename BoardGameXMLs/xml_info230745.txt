Focus on WHAt You do!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1-48TACTIC you command a small force based on a real world army of WWII and attempt to attain victory over your opponents with your superior tactics and a little luck! The aim of these rules is to provide the simplest possible set of wargame rules that generate a fast playing cinematic game and which gives an involving, passionate and satisfying experience, but also respects real battlefield tactics simulated with intuitive and realistic mechanics.
