			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a GMless game where all but one of the players are Max Tuna. To be more precise they are all part of the Big Tuna&amp;rsquo;s Brain. The other player is the bad guy and represents everyone else. The game consists of the players running Tuna through a series of acts. They get to say how he deals with the challenges put forward by the script and the bad guy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game progress is scripted.  Play involves collaborative narrative construction around the scripted events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note an earlier implementation of this rules set was developed under the title &amp;quot;Bond's Brain&amp;quot;, by the same (unknown) designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
