							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ChaOS: Touhou Kontonfu</name>
									
			<description>Touhou Kontonfu is a dueling card game based in the Touhou universe using the ChaOS system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Main Deck is built from 50 cards, including characters, events, set cards, and the like. You may have up to 4 copies of cards with the same name. Extra cards can't go in your Main Deck; you may have an Extra Deck with up to 10 cards. If your Extra Deck has under 10 cards (for instance, 0) you can still play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Chaos TCG, your Main Deck is your Life. Each player's goal is to reduce their opponent's Main Deck to 0 through attacks and card effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ChaOS (Character Operating System) is the second dueling TCG by the makers of the extremely popular Wei&amp;szlig; Schwarz. This system focuses more on individual characters and their abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translations of the rules and cards are available from the websites listed below in the links section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
