							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dinky Dungeons</name>
									
			<description>Dinky Dungeons is a bare-bones role-playing game published by &amp;quot;Doc's Games - an Uncle Morty Production.&amp;quot; The game is very small in size and all contained in a tiny plastic bag a few inches across and down. The rulebook, a Game Master screen, an (incomplete) errata list, an adventure, a map and character sheets were all included in the baggie - with two 5mm dice rounding out the package&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is about as simple as can be - characters have two attributes (&amp;quot;Physical&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Mental&amp;quot;) but they go pretty far with very little. Standard RPG stuff like character classes/races and equipment are included plus a nice selection of monsters and pretty extensive rules for regular RPG play like magic systems, skills rolls and saving throws. It's impressive for such a small package. They even have a great but stupid race called Fuzzy Winkers (undesirable rodents that are just bad characters, period) to add to the fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
