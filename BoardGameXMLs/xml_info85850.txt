							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kiloblaster</name>
									
			<description>Kiloblaster is a top-down space shooter based on the Galaxian style of gameplay. The player faces a wave of enemies that stay on screen till defeated, shooting at the player ship and occasionally flying downwards towards the player ship in hopes to destroy it. Unlike Galaxian, Kiloblaster allows the player ship to move in all directions, rather than just left and right. It also includes power ups and allies who occasionally show up to assist the player ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was created by Allen Pilgrim, and released via Epic MegaGames&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
