			<description>ABACA is a game of endless variety. The deck consists of 108 cards.  Each card contains either a single letter or a combination of two letters as well as a scoring value.  There are five variations of the basic game that can be played: Primary ABACA, ABACA Royal, Argo ABACA, ABACA Rummy and Combination ABACA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABACA: Ten cards are dealt to each player.  The object of each hand is to try to be the first to use all ten cards to form words.  Play is simultaneous and each player uses their cards to form words.  After each player has made as many words as possible they discard one unused card and dealer then deals a new card to each player.  Cards are exchanged until someone declares ABACA meaning that all ten cards have been used in words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primary ABACA: Seven cards are dealt to each player and for each hand, every player places down a card - the winner of the hand is the person with the card closest to the letter &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;.  Player with the highest number of cards won is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABACA Royal: Players add to previously played cards to create a new word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARGO ABACA: Players are dealt seven cards.  Players will add multiple cards to previously played cards to create words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABACA Rummy: Players are dealt seven cards. One card is placed face up.  First player takes either face up or top of deck and create as many words as he can in front of him and then discards one card.  Play continues and players can pick up any number of cards from discard stack as long as they play the bottom card each time.  Play continues until someone has used all their cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combination ABACA: Can be played as game of solitaire or with several players.  Shuffle deck and place 25 cards face down in a 5 by 5 grid.  The remainder of the deck is placed on the center card.  Play begins by turning over any two cards.  If they form a word player places cards in their pile and is allowed another turn.  If they do not form a word, cards are turned back over and player takes a penalty card from center deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
