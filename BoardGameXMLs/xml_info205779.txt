							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Road to Armageddon D10 System Players Handbook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dogs of war have been loosed &amp;ndash; the world is facing down nuclear and biological Armageddon between the West and two ruthless power blocs aiming at nothing less than total victory and the complete emasculation and/or destruction of anyone who opposes their cultural dominance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The struggle between these blocs has been going on for years, but has only recently become a hot war ... normally called the Three Way War in the west, the Anti-Imperialist War in the Russo-Japanese alliance and the New Jihad in the Islamic states ... and a nasty one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rationing is commonplace, consumer goods in short supply or, in some cases, completely unavailable ... even the militaries of the nations involved have begun to suffer from the inability of their damaged national economies to build the needed equipment for their expanding war efforts (or, indeed, even to repair or replace damaged equipment).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is against this background that your campaign will be set, and in which your players will be running the characters that they create using this rule booklet. They will have the opportunity to defend their nation and its allies and to oppose the fanatical plans of the opposition ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can they do enough to make a difference?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book covers a cut down version of the Core Rules &amp;ndash; for Character creation, combat, and for many actions Characters are likely to be faced with. There is also a small selection of Personal Gear, Weapons and Vehicles to enable a basic game to be run using this book alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
