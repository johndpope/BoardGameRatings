			<description>Trapped! is an abstract game of capturing the opponents pawns, played on a 5-per-side hexagonal board (61 hex in total). Players take turns to either move their pawn(s) or add walls to the edge(s) of a playing space. Pawns cannot jump walls or other pawns and become trapped when they are confined to a single cell - when all edges are blocked by a combination of walls, pawns (of either player) and/or board edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have two 'moves' per turn, so can move one pawn 2 spaces, two pawns 1 space each, move one pawn and place one wall, or place two walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player wins when all opposing pawns become trapped at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with three pawns and can play walls from a shared pool of 120.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
