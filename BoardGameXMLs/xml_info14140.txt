			<description>Players move their spaceship miniatures (the game includes 10 rocket ships in different colors) around the board collecting tokens representing the various signs of the zodiac. Each player must collect eight different tokens (plus a single token common to all players) to win, and each player has a different set of eight to collect. Spaces on the board allow you to steal from another player, draw and play a card, or gain additional tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
