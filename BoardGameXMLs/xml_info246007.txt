			<description>Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're stranded at cathedral-like train station in the near future, searching for a ticket out of town. Explore the secret passageways, interact with strangers, dig for records, and get hypnotized by the soundtrack &amp;ndash; a new batch of never-before-heard Archie Pelago tunes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Mysterious Setting, Plus Ramen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Off-Peak, players will uncover a world where the fate of it's musicians and artists is unclear, yet their tools of the trade are highly prized. Meanwhile, the station itself provides all the comforts a commuter could ask for: great food, the best beer, entertaining board games, relaxing gardens. But *who* is really benefiting here? It is entirely up to the player how they want to engage in and interpret Off-Peak's stories, characters and themes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Off-Peak is a short first-person adventure game and takes place in one giant area with multiple nooks, crannies and some hidden passageways to discover. Within its own bounds, the game can be explored at any pace or direction the player so chooses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Off-Peak is Freeware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
