			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the mad Malachite throne in Rauxes to the bejeweled city in Chendl in Furyondy, the Flanaess is at war! In the east, Overking Ivid V thirsts for conquest. Vatun, Great God of the North, meanwhile unites the barbarians and Fists into a fearsome force. Not to be outdone, the dread Iuz masses humanoids and fiends in the northwest. And the Scarlet Brotherhood in the south hangs over all the Flanaess, pulling the strings of war like a mad puppeteer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take command of the armies yourself and change the dark course of history! Between two and six players can battle, deciding the Flanaess's fate in diplomacy and war, and leading armies and heroes across two full-color maps. Muster your armies from over 300 counters, ranging from light infantry to dragons -- with your favourite demihumans and monsters as well! With over 150 cards, you can search for treasure or mercenaries and receive the gods' blessing (or curse) through special events. When the battles come -- the times that try the souls of all -- you'll want your armies backed with the wisdom contained in the 32-page history of the actual war. The boxed set also includes an easy-to-read 8-page book of rules, with optional advanced rules for hard-core wargamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Flanaess awaits an heroic deliverer -- or an oppressive overlord! Which will you be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
