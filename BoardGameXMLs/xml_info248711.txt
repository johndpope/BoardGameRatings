			<description>&amp;quot;You&amp;rsquo;re Stuck in the Muck and there&amp;rsquo;s only one way out &amp;hellip; lay out a series of stepping stones and run your way across. Easier said than done, for in this game you are your own worst enemy &amp;hellip; well OK, you&amp;rsquo;re the only player, so just try not to goof it up too much! A puzzling challenge for the analytical thinker &amp;ndash; or a mindless diversion for the rest of us.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A solitaire game for the piecepack game system. Win by moving all four of your pawns safely over the Stepping Stones and back to their home tile. The game is played in two phases. The first phase uses the results of dice rolls to move and flip coins. When all the coins of a given color have been flipped, the die of that color is used in the second phase to move the pawn and coins of that color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
