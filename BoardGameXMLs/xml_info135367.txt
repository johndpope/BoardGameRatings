			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compact Castles is a compendium of historical keeps, towers, and fortified dwellings from all over the world. Each of the fifteen entries has the history and description of the castle, illustrations showing the overall structure, and pages of detailed floorplans that can be printed out and used in-game. Examples include a Norman border keep, an Iron Age Israeli fort, a Corscian coastal watch tower, a North American cliff-dwelling, Scottish tower houses, and many more. Also included is information regarding numbers of occupants, breeching the defenses, and finding loot. Compact Castles gives the gamer an instant portfolio of genuine, real-world castles to use in any historical, low-tech, or fantasy game setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
