			<description>Southern Rails &amp;mdash; one of three titles in Winsome Games 2015 Essen Set &amp;mdash; is played on a map of the Southeast United States and is similar in style to many of the stock-based, cube-rail games released by Winsome Games since 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with the players spending two rounds selecting stocks from among six available companies. Each turn, a player must place a track cube from one of the companies in which he has stock. Once the tenth cube of a company is placed, the players score. Scores are based on the rail lines and awarded to players that own stock in the lines that meet certain criteria. Player order is reassigned and players get to select an additional stock. Players once again start placing cubes. This is repeated until the fourth scoring round, after which the game ends. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
