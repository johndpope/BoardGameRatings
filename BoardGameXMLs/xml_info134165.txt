			<description>Attack the Tower is a card game inspired by defend the tower videogames. There are a print &amp;amp; play version on the publishers website. Two players duel in a fast paced turn based battle. Each participant chooses an army, and must dispose of their heavy and light infantry, shooters, cavalry, siege weapons and special abilities to defeat the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 types of cards: bases and abilities. Bases must be played on a territory. Each player has 3 territories and each territory can have up to 3 bases. Troops are recruited on a base and a base can have up to 2 troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn a player must decide to reload or not. If he does both players recruit a troop on each of his bases and draw 2 cards. The player can also attack on his turn. Attacks are always from a territory to another. All troops must participate on an attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each troop has a power that counts both for attack and defense. Bases always have a power of 4. To destroy a base one must destroy all its troops first. The goal is to destroy the opponent's Palace that sits behind his territories and has a power of 10. The Palace can only be attacked if at least one of the territories has no bases on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
