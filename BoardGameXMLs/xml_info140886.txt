			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Superior Soccer the player can play an Arcade soccer game, a Management simulation, or both (the Complete game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arcade game can be played as one or two players. In the one player mode, a skill level of 0 to 9 can be set for the computer player. In the two player mode, the skill level determines the quality of both computer-controlled goalkeepers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played from a top-down viewpoint with the action in a large window taking up most of the screen, showing a zoomed-in portion of the pitch. The game is played vertically with the goals at the top and bottom of the play area. To the top-left is a mini-map showing an overall picture of the position of the players on the whole pitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the bottom of the screen is the match clock, the score and a speech bubble providing a text-based commentary of the game, featuring quotations which will be well-known to British soccer fans!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Management game, the player selects any of the teams from the four divisions of the British Football league (this in the days before the Premiership). The team is then placed in the fourth division and the aim is for the player to make it to the top of the first division. Each footballer in the game has a skill and strength statistic. Playing more games reduces a footballer's strength, so it is important to balance playing the most skilful team with preserving their strength. Winning games increases the popularity and gate receipts of the team, which can be used to trade for better players. After selecting the team, the game is simulated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Complete game, the user plays the Management game, but also has the option of playing each match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Real team and player names are used throughout (again this was in the days before licensing!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Author: Peter Scott&lt;br/&gt;Loading Screen Design: Michael Hutchison&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
