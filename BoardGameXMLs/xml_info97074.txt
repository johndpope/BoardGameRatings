			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mental Health Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One thing missing from GORE is a set of rules  for mental health. This void is significant, as it  is a major component of one of the classic  games  GORE  seeks  to  emulate.  If  player  characters  aren't  struggling  to  keep  from  succumbing to madness, or dealing with non- player  characters  who  have  obviously  gone  'round the bend, the flavor of the game just  isn't the same. Unfortunately, the original rules  for  such  are  not  available  under  the  Open  Gaming License, which explains their absence  from the GORE Core Rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is presented here is not an attempt to  recreate the classic mental health rules, but an  all-new, original set of mechanics for covering  the same ground. In addition to filling a gap in  GORE's  Core  Rules,  it  can  be  used  as  an  alternative system for the classic game, or for  any  percentile-based  game  using  the  same  algorithm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment:&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is available as a free download from basicroleplaying.com.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
