			<description>The USS Prometheus (NX-59650/NX-74913) was a 24th century Federation Prometheus-class starship operated by Starfleet. Prometheus was an experimental prototype designed for deep space tactical assignments and equipped with regenerative shields, ablative hull armor, and multi-vector assault mode. She was the fastest ship in Starfleet with a warp factor of 9.99 when she was launched from the Beta Antares Ship Yards on stardate 50749.5 in late 2373. The vessel was also equipped with holographic projectors on every deck, allowing its EMH Mark II free range of movement throughout the ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion comes with one new ship and a new set of cards for Star Trek: Attack Wing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S.S. Prometheus Federation Expansion Pack is part of the Wave 15 expansion packs from WizKids Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
