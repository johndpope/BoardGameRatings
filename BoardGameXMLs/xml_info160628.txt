							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dilemma</name>
									
			<description>Dilemma is a two-player strategy game in which players compete by moving pawns around the board to collect tiles worth varying points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 49 tiles are placed in a preset pattern on a 7x7 grid, and two pawns are placed on top of two tiles in the central diagonal. One player can move the pawns along columns, while the other moves them along rows. Players cannot move the same pawn they moved the previous turn, so strategy is built around knowing which choices your opponent has next, and working to make those choices miserable &amp;mdash; thus putting them in a dilemma. Some of the tiles affect the board when collected: moving tiles or pawns, returning pieces to the board, or stealing tiles from an opponent. When neither player can move, the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skillful maneuvering and forethought are the name of the game in this engaging, classical board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
