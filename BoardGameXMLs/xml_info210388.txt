			<description>Description from the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a war brewing in the heavens!  After a particularly nasty fight, Sarastro and the Queen of the Night are fighting over custody of their daughter, Pamina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two players take on the rolls of Sarastro and the Queen of the Night, each trying to either move Pamina to their respective strongholds, or to have their respective symbols of power reach the Tower of Wisdom at the center of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By using the cards in their hands, Sarastro or the Queen of the Night attempt to sway Pamina, move their symbols, or create trials which everyone much face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is based on the opera The Magic Flute by Mozart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game tied for first place in the Girls Got Game design contest at Ares Magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
