							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Golden Goliath</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Divine Remnants&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now known only to a few brave arcanists who dare to delve the deepest depths of the Astral Sea, the Golden Goliath has a long a storied past. He was once the lighter half of a pair of gods worshipped before even Snake Eyes was born. Great icons devoted to both of them once dotted the earth in great numbers, though they have since disappeared beneath the ever-grinding sands of time. They have seen the rise and fall of countless minor deities, and even those who are mighty, like Selmiral the Morningstar, Lord of Two Crystals. And yet, such power does the Golden Goliath consist of, that still he lives on, mindless and blind, a giant mass of incarnate divinity floating through the nether void.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Would that he had worshippers, to sing songs of his glory, to partake of his mana, to make his thoughts a reality upon the material plane. But lo, see what misfortune has befallen this lord of antiquity! For only those fiends of the Cult of Chaos pay him any heed in this fallen age, and there are few who despise the servitude of religion more than they.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
