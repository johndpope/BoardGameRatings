			<description>In Euro-Express, players can create or expand nine speed rail connections with a total of 28 sections that are primarily links between the capitals of the European Community. Important regional sub-centers of some countries are also connected to the network. Existing train connections are shown on the schedule as rails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to create a train through Europe, and only through team work can players hope to achieve this challenge. Each player takes the role of the Minister of Transport of the EC countries. In the EC, the ministers meet regularly in the Council of Ministers of Transport. The Common Community Commission proposes the construction of a particular route. The European Parliament may accept this proposal or reject it. This also applies to the Transport Ministers Council, which will decide after discussing the planning and financing of the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any Minister of Transport can try to fund the project through national budgetary resources, which he can invest in the construction of the Euro-train. In addition, the Transport Ministers Council may fall back in the game on loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and funds from the EC transport budget.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until all the capitals of the community are linked by the Euro-Express, the Council has to overcome many hurdles and crack many hard nuts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
