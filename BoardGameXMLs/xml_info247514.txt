							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Endeavor: Age of Sail â€“ Charter Companies Mini-Expansion</name>
									
			<description>This is a complete mini-Expansion for Endeavor: Age of Sail that includes six brand new Charter Company tiles!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the building phase, if you have at least 6 presence in a region, you may establish that region's Charter Company instead of constructing a normal building, and add its tile to your mat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six different Charter Companies provide a strong attribute boost and a unique double action. They are very powerful, but choose wisely; you may only establish one per game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mini-expansion will be included in Kickstarter editions but will be made available to purchase by itself for the retail edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
