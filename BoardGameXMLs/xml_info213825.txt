			<description>It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Rhino Hero!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No building too high, no street too dangerous for this caped crusader, as he scales buildings and patrols the city protecting the citizens. On his quest for safety, he must use caution as even the most solid buildings may start to sway and wobble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you help Rhino Hero accomplish the challenge to build a skyscraper as tall and solid as can be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the physics-based game kids will be able to control a crane to build the highest skyscraper possible. Evil-doers of all kinds try to get the construction site to collapse. But the kids are not alone: Rhino Hero will help them and protect the skyscraper against the nefarious villains and their diligent minions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is loosely based on the board game Rhino Hero from HABA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
