			<description>Objective: Collect as many bonus points as possible by crossing a 11 x 11 board (+ start/target positions) like Halma by&lt;br/&gt;1. capturing other meeples 2. fast finishing &lt;br/&gt; - acting by turns -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players (2 or 4) move their meeples (vertical/horizontal/diagonal) out of starting position upon a 11 x 11 grid board. The board is divided into 4 areas, pictured with Skat-cards; starting from such a place you may move or jump trying to come closer to your finish positions; if you jump over opponent's meeple(s) you will capture them - but this isn't allowed if your starting position has a lower or equal value (according Skat). You may jump in all directions ('chain-jump') starting from a Jack-(=Jungs)space. Transition spaces between the 4 areas have additional restrictions/advantages. The earlier you finish the higher the bonus points. Game ends after last player reaches target positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note:&lt;br/&gt;Likely published during 1930's&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
