			<description>Ultimate Basketball is a NES basketball video game. It was released in September 1990 by American Sammy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays like a conventional sports video game. The player chooses from a list of seven available teams, and controls five players on the team on the court, though only one player may be directly controlled at a time. There is a championship mode and a single game mode in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is unlike later sports based video games in that doesn't use real professional or college basketball players. The players a player may select for his team are entirely fictional, as are their statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was possible for so many players to foul out that only three or four were on the floor at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ultimate Basketball&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
