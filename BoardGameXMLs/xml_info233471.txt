			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure is in Your Blood!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But this time, the adventure is literally in the blood &amp;hellip; or at least, in Blood Space. Blood Space and Moon Dust takes a group of adventurers into Blood Space, a system where night skies are red and the viscera of a dead star risks tainting everything. What is supposed to be a simple delivery gets complicated, and before long players are caught up in piracy, mega-corporations, and a plot to change all life on an entire inhabited astronomic body!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood Space and Moon Dust is an introductory adventure for 4 to 6, 1st level characters. It presents a series of settings and events designed to allow players to explore and do things their way, or follow a fairly direct path of adventure, as they prefer. You can turn the locations in Blood Space and Moon Dust into recurring locations for an ongoing campaign, or leave them behind once the players have some experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can make their own characters, but the adventure includes four pre-generated 1st level characters and a pre-built tier 1 starship for them to fly, so you can get right to the action immediately!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
