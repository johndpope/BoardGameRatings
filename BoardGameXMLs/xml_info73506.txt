			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was the best of guns, it was the worst of guns. Okay, it was mostly the worst of guns. They called it the &amp;quot;Plumber&amp;rsquo;s Abortion&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Stench Gun.&amp;quot; Soldiers shot themselves and each other with it, or saw it jam up in combat instead; they feared it more than they feared their enemies&amp;rsquo; weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the British paratroopers used it at Arnhem rather than pick up the &amp;quot;Schmeissers&amp;quot; that littered the ground around them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And all across Europe it spelled power to the Resistance, and death to the Nazis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And after the Serpentfall, it may be the only gun in town. Inside this 6 page PDF you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The history of the STEN gun, and how it fits into the world after the Serpentfall.&lt;br/&gt;     Game statistics for the Sten, for either Savage Worlds or Hero 6th Edition.&lt;br/&gt;     Options, both mechanical and mystical, to enhance your Sten.&lt;br/&gt;     Adventure hooks involving this most democratic of weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Happiness is a) Sten Gun was released for both the Savage Worlds and the HERO System (6th Edition) RPGs. Serpent Scales #2: (Happiness is a) Sten Gun (HERO 6) is the HERO System (6th Edition) release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
