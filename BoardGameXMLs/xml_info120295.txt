							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grittier Races: Elflings</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grittier Races presents new races to The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, visiting fantastic races in a darker, grittier point of view.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elvenkind has lost it's immortality and the once magical race has succumbed and fallen apart. Out of it's demise, four new races have emerged:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Tellare: elves who have left behind their forest realms to seek solace in frozen wastelands. There they live the dangerous lives of court schemes as they search for immortality in any way possible.&lt;br/&gt;    Peredhil: acceptance has come to some elves like those who became the peredhil. Learning to live the moment as life is short, they have integrated themselves with other races societies.&lt;br/&gt;    Hoorea: immortality can be achieved by having a name in history and the hoorea believe that this is the way. Living in cities on the top of mountains, riding giant eagles and wyverns, these daredevils risk life for a chance in history.&lt;br/&gt;    Leitha: returning to what they consider the primordial elves, the leitha are savages in the eyes of most races. It is no wonder as they belive that ritual sacrifice is necessary, for elven magic is trapped in the blood of all living things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
