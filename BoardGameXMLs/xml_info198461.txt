							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Powers of the Lifechain</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;he Lifechain is a star-spanning (and multiversal) ecosystem that binds mortal life firmly to the primordial gods who created the multiverse. The Lifechain is a web of blood and divine heritage which has touched billions of living worlds and millions of timelines. Lifechained creatures have powers far in excess of their kind. They are planetary champions, conquerors, heroes and messiahs, and they owe their vast gifts to the infusion of a few molecules of ancient, divine DNA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All Lifechained creatures share a connection, however tenuous, to Phallus Space and its gods. Some Lifechained creatures are the direct descendants of one of the Third Pantheon&amp;rsquo;s dieties, and even if they do not know it, can trace their heritage back aeons to the dawn of the Multiverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Others are hereditary royalty, a genetically superior planetary champion whose bloodline has been preserved through gene-treatments and selective incest, in the hopes of breeding a superior creature. Other Lifechains are the products of experimentation and reverse engineering- artificially grafting Lifechained DNA to a humanoid genome, or are products of strange magic that awakens the Lifechained DNA lurking in otherwise ordinary creatures. The most feared and spectacular Lifechains are the monstrous Nemesis Lifesapwn, super-predators which hunt the cosmos in search of Lifechained prey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players might choose to enter the Lifechain by selecting a species with an innate Lifechained heritage (including several of the player species found in [Species of the Otherverse] or Culture of Choice). Even if a character comes from a species not normally known for its connection to the Lifechain, that character can choose the Awakened Heritage feat to unlock their divine heritage. Once a Lifechained heritage is unlocked, a character can choose additional Lifechained feats, offering new capabilities, anytime a new feat slot opens up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lifechain feats grant amazing powers. Lifechained creatures can shapeshift into virtually any form, heal wounds that would kill entire platoons of mortals, manipulate energy, unleash primal sorcery, alter molecular structure and reality, and some wield even stranger abilities! However, power comes with a price. A Lifechained creature is easily detected by another Lifechain, and some Lifechained abilities allow a Lifechained hunter to more easily kill his demi-god brothers and sisters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powers of the Lifechain is a companion to Horrors of the Lifechain, foucsing on player abilities, where the earlier sourcebook was a collection of setting-specific monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
