			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you car coach your own pro football team when you play Tuesday Morning Quarterback, the first of our EPYX Sports series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you've finished watching the big game on tv, you can take an active part in a game that has all the excitement--and frustration--of the real thing. You're the coach and captain, and the outcome of the game depends on whether you can outguess your computer opponent and call the best plays. Choose from 16 different offensive plays--7 running plays, 8 pass patterns--plus an option play. And there are 6 defensive options--96 possible combinations. But you've only got a few seconds in the huddle to make your decision!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tuesday Morning Quarterback is a game of both skill and strategy. But you don't reed to be a football expert to play. A glossary of football terms and tips on strategy help the novice make decisions. You can even practice your kicking skills before the game starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But after kick off, you'll fight for every yard--gaining momentum as you march forward--or losing confidence as you're pushed back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll see the progress of your half back as he dashes toward the goal line, watch as your quarterback completes a pass to your tight end, and cheer when your team scores a touchdown, a field goal, or intercepts a pass! But watch out for fumbles and penalties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pit your favorite teams against each other. A special program lets you keep your team rosters up to date. Transfer players to other teams, make substitutions, or even create your own all-star team. You can even set your own time limit, so you can play for as little or as long as you like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Tuesday Morning Quarterback. you call the shots--you make the decisions--and you make the difference in the race for the Super Bowl!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Graphics! (Apple uses color!)&lt;br/&gt;     Sound!&lt;br/&gt;     Real time!&lt;br/&gt;     Nearly 100 offense/defense combinations!&lt;br/&gt;     For ages 10 to adult&lt;br/&gt;     Complexity: Intermediate&lt;br/&gt;     Playing time: 20 minutes to 2 hours&lt;br/&gt;     For one player &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
