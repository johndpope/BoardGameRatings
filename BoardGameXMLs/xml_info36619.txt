							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orion Emperor</name>
									
			<description>This Orion Emperor is 4X game designed in the spirit of Master of Orion series for PC. The players take roles of leaders of the different races and factions and start to develop their newly founded space empires via exploring the space, making political decisions, managing of their parliament and preparing against all the possible encounters the game provides and of course against the other players who happen to share the same interest to rule the whole galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The essence of the game is your own parliament which needs constant management by strong leader to make sure the parliament makes the right decisions for the future of your empire. As your power and respect grows during the game, with careful planning your empire's parliament suddenly is making just the decisions their strong leader wants...but then also starts to happen the first contacts to other players which surely will open a can of worms of new challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orion Emperor (play test name: Master of Orion IV) has been under development for 2 years. The newest release is the 4th edition of Orion Emperor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
