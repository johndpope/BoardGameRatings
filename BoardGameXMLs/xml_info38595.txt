			<description>&amp;ldquo;The Persian invasion of Greece launched by Darius in 490 BC failed when the Athenians won a great victory at Marathon. After Darius died his son Xerxes resolved to succeed where his father had failed. In 480 BC he bridged the Hellespont and invaded Greece with an enormous army . . . Victorious on land, Xerxes concentrated on defeating the Greek navy. His fleet outnumbered the Greeks by about 3:1, but the Greeks drew him into a trap. His fleet was soundly beaten. The defeat of the Persian navy forced Xerxes and his army to retreat back across the Hellespont bridges, ending the invasion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8).
