			<description>In this dexterity game, disks are flipped Carrom-style. The large game board contains the sheep stables in the center. Each player has seven sheep (disks) and seven dogs (disks), trying to get as many sheep into the stables as possible. The dogs have to hit the sheep and push them to the stables - when they cross the middle line, they can be used by the other player. As soon as there are no sheep on one half of the large board, the round ends. Each sheep in the stables counts 2 points, each remaining dog on one's side counts 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
