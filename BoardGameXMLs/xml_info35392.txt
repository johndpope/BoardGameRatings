			<description>Can you bluff your way to &amp;pound;1million? Based on the hit quiz show, you don't necessarily have to get the questions right to win, you just need to bluff your way through the rounds and pressure your opponents into folding.&lt;br/&gt;You don't have to be the brain of Britain to win, you just have to be clever enough to make them think you are! (taken from back of box)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players secretly answer 5 multiple choice questions, then try to bluff their opponents into folding a 10second countdown. If no one folds, then the player with the least correct answers loses all their money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
