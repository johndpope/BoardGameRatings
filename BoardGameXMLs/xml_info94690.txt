							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Army Game</name>
									
			<description>The Army Game is based on the British TV comedy show of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to four players take the roles of the Boys of Hut 29 who are conscripts attempting to abscond from an army camp and get into places of entertainment in nearby Itchwick, located around the edge of the board.  A fifth player takes the role of Sergeant Major Snudge who tries to catch the Boys.  Any Boy who is caught must go to the detention centre (The Glasshouse) in the centre of the board.  If all of the Boys get into places of entertainment at the same time, they win.  Sergeant Major Snudge wins if all of the Boys are in The Glasshouse at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played via roll-and-move, and there are chance cards for each building, as well as for the Boys and Snudge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
