			<description>Wall Street Kid is a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System in which the player must prove himself worthy by taking $500,000 in seed money in order to gain a six-hundred-billion-dollar inheritance from the extremely wealthy Benedict family. Successfully investing it in the American stock market results in rewards like going shopping on the weekend and being able to acquire expensive items such as a house. The player is also encouraged to spoil his girlfriend, as all men of the Benedict family pampered their wives. If the player is unable to raise the money needed for a key item, such as a boat or the house, he is disowned by the family, in which case the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wall Street Kid is indirectly based on a series of Japanese Famicom games. These games were individually titled as Money Game and The Money Game II: Kabutochou no Kiseki. In both games, the same goal to acquire as much money as possible remains. However, Wall Street Kid uses American dollars while Money Game uses Japanese yen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the game is spent in a single office in New York City, where the player makes decisions on investments and other matters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Wall Street Kid&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
