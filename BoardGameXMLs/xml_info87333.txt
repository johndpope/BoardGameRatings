			<description>From the PDF Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Web Enhancement for Deities and Demigods&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new Deities and Demigods supplement provides everything you need to create, control, and call upon the most powerful beings in your campaign. While the book includes plenty of information on advancing characters to godhood, we thought it would be helpful, as you begin to explore the book, to have at hand an example of a recently ascended deity. Presented here &lt;br/&gt;for your use and enjoyment is a divine character-Erbin, the beggar god-for your player characters to encounter in any of five different divine ranks. In addition, this web enhancement provides 21 campaign hooks offering suggestions for how this character might enter the PCs&amp;rsquo; lives as part of, or as a result of, divine ascension. The wide range of these adventure&lt;br/&gt;ideas helps show DMs how to develop their own stories around mortals becoming deities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To use this web enhancement, you must already have the new edition of Deities and Demigods. This bonus material is exclusive to the official DUNGEONS &amp;amp;&lt;br/&gt;DRAGONS website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
