			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fan-created mission for Orpheus.&lt;br/&gt; From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MISSION TYPE: Intelligence Gathering/Fumigation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LOCATION: The Smithsonian Institute of Fine Art, Washington DC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EMPLOYER: Dr. David Greene (Head Curator)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;11 Months ago, Herbert Carey (a purchasing director for The Smithsonian institute) was found dead in his office. It was deemed a suicide. Carey opposed the purchase of a 6 million dollar work of art titled The &amp;quot;Dies Ignes&amp;quot;. The Dies Ignes was painted by Salvatore Giovanni during the renaissance. The piece features a radiant angel wielding a sword, and flying high above a barren landscape. The piece was purchased by Lee Anne Crowley, The Institutes other senior purchaser. Shortly before his death, Carey vehemently opposed the purchase for reasons unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each month, Carey and Crowley were given an allowance of 7 million, so for the month the Dies Ignes was purchased, it took most of the allowance. As stated previously, Carey opposed the purchase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The painting was purchased from a previously unknown dealer named Thomas Augustus in Venice. Crowley insisted on sealing the deal herself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
