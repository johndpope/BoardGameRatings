							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Final Twilight Customizable Card Game</name>
									
			<description>In the near future, on the western coast city of New Metropolis, an evil that has lain dormant for centuries is about to be awakened to the 21st century. Forces of darkness and magic strive to unleash a horror upon the Earth unlike any mankind can remember. The only forces capable of stopping it are rendered impotent by an age-old fear and hatred. Will humanity set aside their differences and stand as one against the darkness? Or will this be humanity's Final Twilight?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final Twilight is a modern fantasy themed card game for two players.&lt;br/&gt;Players each select a Major Character featured in the game's storyline and build a deck around that character; supporting characters, special action and spells, weapons and items, all ripped from the pages of the story come to life on the game board. &lt;br/&gt;Using Location cards to build a small portion of the great city of New Metropolis, players move between sites and backdrops of the story, dueling other characters including fantastic creatures, horrors of the shadows, and helpful, though innocent, bystanders. &lt;br/&gt;Magic is scarce and unusual in the world of Final Twilight. While hiring goons and allies from our normal world can be easy, summoning the vast forces of nature takes its toll; fantastic characters, spells, and magical abilities all require a small piece of the mage. To cast these spells players spend a portion of their life total, potentially granting them greater power but opening them up to easier defeat. Winning is balancing the quest for power against the will to survive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final Twilight is customizable and non-collectable, with each release featuring pre-constructed decks and expansion packs containing just the right cards for a character or an assortment of universal cards suitable for any character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revised Edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;April 2013 The Revised edition officially released! Title available through print-on-demands services DriveThruCards.com and TheGameCrafter.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
