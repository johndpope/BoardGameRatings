							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Classic Dungeon Crawl</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;This simple card and dice miniature game is based off of the very original Dungeons and Dragons, back in the days of Chainmail and the Classic Dungeons and Dragons boxed set. If the game rules seem a bit simple and occasionally clumsy, they are supposed to be. That was the charm of the &amp;lsquo;Proto-D&amp;amp;D&amp;rsquo; fantasy miniature wargaming.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;This game can be played with 1 to 3 players. For solo play, this is a simple solitaire adventure system for &amp;lsquo;proto-D&amp;amp;D&amp;rsquo; fantasy miniature battles. For two to three players, it becomes a competition to survive (be warned that multiplayer games can get very lengthy; it&amp;rsquo;s best to take this game in sessions like you would a modern D&amp;amp;D adventure, breaking between dungeon levels.)&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each dungeon level uses a different deck of cards composed of the types of monsters found on that level of the dungeon. On each turn the player draws the top card from the deck for the dungeon level his character is on and fights the monster. If the player&amp;rsquo;s character is killed, the player is out of the game. If the monster is defeated, the player receives gold and experience points. A certain number of experience points is required to advance to the lower dungeon levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
