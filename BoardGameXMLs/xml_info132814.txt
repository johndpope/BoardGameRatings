			<description>Mixed Hill is a team board game of the roll-move-action type. Two players per team, they represent time traveling agents from the future racing against opposing agents to the top of the mystic hill where a reward awaits the most successful team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn the dice is rolled to move the active player and the action on the landed tile is then undertaken. These actions vary and most of them pitch players from different teams against each other. The winner of the action earns points so the winner is not just the first team to the top but the team with most points collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to easy and quick to grasp rules, the speed of the game, constant involvement in the action and a variety of tile actions, Mixed Hill appeals to non-gamers and gamers alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
