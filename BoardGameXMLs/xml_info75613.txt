			<description>From the game's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aarklash Warpack is played without dice or rulers. Miniatures and the accompanying cards are all you need to start playing. Rules are easy-to-grasp and rich in strategic potential; you&amp;rsquo;ll learn them quickly and setup will only take a few minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player leads a small company of fighters portrayed by miniatures. The goal is to defeat enemy companies by moving miniatures around on a gaming area that represents a battlefield (a table is enough). Fighters&amp;rsquo; actions (moving, attacking, and so on) are simulated with the use of a deck of cards. Victory is gained through a subtle mix of chance and cunning. Imagination and strategy are key here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aarklash Warpack is a game meant for two or more players ages twelve and over.&lt;br/&gt;A game lasts roughly 30 minutes (rules reading included).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
