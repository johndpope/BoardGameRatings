							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Little Black Sambo</name>
									
			<description>Understanding and appologizing that this is a very politically incorrect game for this day and age. I have included this game (dated from 1924) for completeness. The games information comes from the AGPC Archives of Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot; Happy Children are found whenever they are grouped around the new board game of LITTLE BLACK SAMBO. If the eager child listens in open-mouthed wonder to the story of how Little Black Sambo met all those 4 tigers in the jungle, gave up and then won back from them his little red coat, the pair of beautiful blue trousers, the green umbrella and the purple shoes with crimson linings what do you think he will do when given a handsome game board on which he and his little friends play out the story. There is Little Black Sambo himself, he is pursued by the 4 great tigers with the clothes as forfeits,  when he is overtaken and of course returns home at the end. The game board is handsomely lithographed in colors. There is a separate carton which contains the substantial spinner and the men.&amp;quot; Each game comes in a separate wrapper and is attractively labeled and sells for $1.00 per game.
