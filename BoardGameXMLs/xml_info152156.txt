							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tropical Cataract</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 48 x 30 inch Floor Plan of a Tropical Cataract, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play. The map suits Modern rpg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Look at what washed up on shore this time&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tropical Cataract is a single map of a waterfall and a cave built into the rocky bluff. The river below has a wooden bridge across it and wooden scaffolding leads to the cave with overgrown shrubs on each side of the river.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tropical Cataract is intended for use in primordial, fantasy, or modern games. It could also be a sci-fi location on a lush jungle world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mad Hermit's Cave: The person who maintains the bridge and scaffolding leading up to his abode is a mad hermit who specializes in his medical knowledge. He heals those who survive the fall from the cataract as his calling in life and ekes out a meager existence by foraging from the surrounding flora that he knows intimately well. The player characters may get involved with him if they have a member of the party or ally who is extremely sick and needs medical attention that the local villagers think only the mad hermit can give. In exchange for attempting to heal their ally, the mad hermit wants the group to collect plants much farther into the jungle than he dares to go. A part of the jungle filled with all manner of dangerous beasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group must defeat or evade these beasts to get the herbs. However, the beasts of this part of the forest are highly territorial and follow the scent of the group back to the cataract. If the group flees, the beasts will surely kill the mad hermit and their ailing ally, setting up a climatic and dangerous fight where scaffolding and the bridge could be destroyed by the beast, limiting the options of the group to maneuver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
