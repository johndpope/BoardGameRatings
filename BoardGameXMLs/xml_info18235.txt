			<description>This is a game simulating the famous cycling race &amp;quot;Paris-Roubaix&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls a team of 6 cyclists. Each cyclist has got 6 characteristics (stamina, power,....).  At the start of the race, you set their characteristics to a specific profile (total team value 110, no cyclists may have the maximum value of 5 in all characteristics). This way you tailor your team to the chosen strategy - which cyclist is expendable, which one is team leader, which one is the sprinter,....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All movement is directed by playing &amp;quot;strategy cards&amp;quot; (1 or 2 per turn). These are chosen and revealed simultaneously by all players. There are some squares where you have to draw &amp;quot;event cards&amp;quot; which influence the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
