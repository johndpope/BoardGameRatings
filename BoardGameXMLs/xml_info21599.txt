							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fractals!</name>
									
			<description>Fractals!(tm) provides an exceptional challenge as all players simultaneously work to find a home for their tiles on the game board.  The first person to place all their tiles wins.  The name of the game is derived from the property that the game board itself is an enlarged image of the tiles being placed.  Each placed tile will be a member of four interlocking numerical series that appear on the tile diagonals.  There is a built-in tutorial game for learning how to play Fractals!.  But really it's not hard: Anyone who can count to nine can play.  Even though there are 320 game pieces!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
