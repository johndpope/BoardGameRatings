							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dust Tactics: Blutkreuz Starter Set â€“ &#039;&#039;Kampfgruppe Von Stein&#039;&#039;</name>
									
			<description>The year is 1947. The war that started a decade ago has now spread worldwide. The discovery of a crashed alien spacecraft in the Antarctic has led to the development of revolutionary combat walkers that surpass the most advanced tank technology. Old alliances have fragmented and new ones arisen as three major blocs, the Allies, the Axis and the Sino-Soviet Union (SSU) fight the world over for VK, a valuable new resource that power their new fighting machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dust Tactics is a miniatures board game for 2 or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BlutKreuz Korps has arrived in the Middle East! Along with the rest of Operation Babylon's forces, the dreaded Korps is now fighting the Allies and the SSU in this part of the World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
