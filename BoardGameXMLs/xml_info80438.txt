			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;Before starting, the players decide the number of countries to &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot; in order to win the game. To complete a country the player must obtain all all three types of cards belonging to said country.  The three cards are the flag, the coat of arms, and the capital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two phases of play, the &amp;quot;road&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;boardwalk&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Road:&lt;br/&gt;Players roll the dice and move their peg along the road traveling through 85 countries that existed during the mid 1980's.  When players land on a country, they must choose which card they think they can correctly guess.  When the player guesses correctly, the player obtains said card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Boardwalk:&lt;br/&gt;A person can only move to the boardwalk when they have the necessary number of cards.  For instance, if the players agreed upon 3 countries to complete, the player must obtain 3 cards of the coat of arms, 3 of the flags, and 3 of the capitals (it doesn't matter if they are of the same country or not). During the boardwalk the players have chances to take away cards from other players and to correctly guess the remaining types of cards of the countries the player has already obtained cards for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Box:&lt;br/&gt;Capitals - Flags - Coat of Arms in Flags The Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the teen who has to learn geography!&lt;br/&gt;For the adult who wants to know more!&lt;br/&gt;A fun game for everyone no matter what is your knowledge about geography.&lt;br/&gt;You can play easily and with fun, because, Flags The Game makes a brain without strain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;RDN Games division of Publibec Limited&lt;br/&gt;Sorel, Quebec, Canada J3P 6K5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
