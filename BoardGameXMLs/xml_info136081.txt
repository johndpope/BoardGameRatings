			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The early days of adventuring in Exodus can be traced back to the days in the aftermath of the First Ones&amp;rsquo; reign.  In those days, groups of soldiers and warriors fresh from combat and unwilling to align themselves with the new  nations of Exodus found work as mercenaries dealing with the remaining servants and monstrous creations of the First Ones.  They worked mainly for treasure - and in some cases power - and were often as dangerous to the people they were helping as the monsters they slayed.  The concept of adventurers as heroes did not take shape until the appearance of the adventurer known as the Red Mage and his companions The Company of the Staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Treasures of NeoExodus: Staff of the Red Mage is created for use with your NeoExodus: A House Divided campaign setting home gaming for the Pathfinder RPG. The Treasures of NeoExodus series focus on creating unique and interesting magical and mundane items that you can use in your NeoExodus home games that give you more a personal connection to the item. This PDF comes with a background and history of the Staff of the Red Mage, its special mundane and/or magical qualities plus magic item containing detailed information and blank versions of the cards. Everything you need to incorporate the Staff of the Red Mage into your character&amp;rsquo;s background and your gaming sessions is here making them even more appealing, special and personal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
