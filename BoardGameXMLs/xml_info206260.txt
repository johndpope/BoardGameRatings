			<description>Welcome to Askrias, a fantasy game which allows 1 or more players to take role as an adventurer as they delve into a 9 quest campaign in one of the many stories that happen in Askrias.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game system is designed so it allows players to fully customize what they wish their characters to be with the modular dice and ability cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of each scenario is a story line which will require the players to complete the 'Core' quest. However to complete the quest they will need to travel to different locations, which may result in a safe haven, a treasure coffer or monster encounter!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat will be turn based and there will be no 'actual' board for enemy placement - only player placement. The monsters and players will take turn at activating and attacking each other - where the monster will always attack with random results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At times, players will find loot as well, which will be either 'Shards' or 'Gear', which they can use to upgrade and customize the modular dice that they have, or 'Spellbooks' where it allows them to use new abilities!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Askrias players take on the role of an adventurer (or hero) whom is on a Quest in the lands of Askrias.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quests (as well as sub / side quests) can vary and the paths players take can change from game to game opening up a great deal of replay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tension is at times met in the forms of monster battles and/or player ailments in which players can venture off on side quests to remedy or even instead brave the final encounter despite such ailments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character creation is quite open to players creating a mix of skills and powers to suit a broad range of classic role playing archetypes and is flexible to allow players to mix and match to generate very creative characters that they may imagine or wish to play as.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Items appear in the form of Die faces allowing the player to customize their gear Dice and improve their favorite items in some fun ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quests can be tailored to a particular players play group by modifying encounters, events, locations and more... providing interest for both casual play and advanced role play depending on the mix of players joining in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
