							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Story Mechanics: Incremental Antimagic</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've all been there some time in the past. The ancient, magic-sapping wasteland, the golem fabricated of nullstone... there are things in a campaign world that just HATE magic. Story Mechanics: Incremental Antimagic introduces a concentration-based system that is much more satisfying to players than a percent chance to lose a spell. What could be more satisfying about another way to lose spells? Simple - once tied to a check, character investment can mitigate the odds of failure! Different levels and consequences of antimagic are presented (hence incremental), as are ways to integrate this system into your home campaign by altering the CR of monsters and encounters containing the mechanic. To some extent, this work is already done for you. Presented in this little supplement is the nullstone golem, an example of monster creation with this mechanic as a central tenet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     4 kinds of incremental antimagic:&lt;br/&gt;         Chaotic - On a failed check, spells change form.&lt;br/&gt;         Delaying - On a failed check, the caster must either try to cast the same spell using the same spell slot next turn or allow the spell to blast himself.&lt;br/&gt;         Eliminating - On a failed check, the spell fizzles. It sucks to be you.&lt;br/&gt;         Hindering - On a failed check, the caster must either let the spell fizzle or expend an additional spell slot to cast.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Rules for adding incremental antimagic into your game.&lt;br/&gt;     The nullstone golem, a CR5 antimagic bruiser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
