							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eglantine et les fourmis</name>
									
			<description>Eglantine et les fourmis was the first in a planned series of games titled &amp;quot;Nos amis les insectes&amp;quot; (our friends the insects). It is a simple wargame involving ants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two scenarios provided. The scenario for two players has one controlling black ants and the other red ants. The black ant player sends workers out to find breadcrumbs and twigs and return them to the anthill, and sends soldiers out to protect the workers. The red and player has a small number of ants who invade the area and try to capture the workers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The black ant player does not know where the breadcrumbs and twigs are, as they are among a bunch of pieces randomly placed face-down on the board at the start of the game. Other pieces are impassable obstacles and an antlion which immediately kills the ant finding it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a solitaire scenario in which the player controls the black ants and has to get a certain number of breadcrumbs back to the hill. Making this difficult is Eglantine the praying mantis, who moves around the board randomly and kills any ant it gets near.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
