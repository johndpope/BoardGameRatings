							<name  sortindex="5">The Genius Guide to Loot 4 Less: Volume 3â€”Hot Rods</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hot Rods</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this volume we focus on rods, the nearly undefinable class of petite poles that can do anything, as long as you're holding them. Rods have less tradition in fantasy literature that other arcane sticks such as wands and staves, but they enjoy a long history in fantasy rpgs (not even counting epic quests designed to put together artifact rods broken into little pieces). Fighters in particular have often found a rod or two useful over the course of their careers, and we have the entry-level examples they need until they can afford anything with &amp;quot;lordly might&amp;quot; in the name. Rods can be of use to anyone, making them perfect for GMs who need generic treasure fast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the third volume in the Loot 4 Less line, in which we deal exclusively in items with a cost-to-consumer of 2,500 gp or less. And just to up the level of difficulty, we also don't deal in one-shot (or even two- or three-shot) magic items. Here in Volume 3: Hot Rods, we're specifically looking only at magic items that are longer than they are wide. Think of it as the Freudian Spellcaster Special.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
