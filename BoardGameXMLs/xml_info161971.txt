			<description>Mars 04:45 &lt;br/&gt;In Mars 4:45 each player is a Mission Director, racing to establish the first colony on the Red Planet. Mission Directors compete to construct all the modules necessary to start a Mars settlement, sourcing as many parts internally as possible to maximize profitability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During game play, players will use their deck and tableau set up to add cards to the middle of the table. Players can start a new module or add to an existing module. All modules in the middle of the table are public and can be started or added to by anyone at anytime. Players are playing simultaneously so don't wait to play your cards or another player will beat you to it! When a unit is completed, it is added to a player's colony, waiting to be scored at the end of the round...that is.....if you were not sabotaged!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mars 04:45 can be played by as many people as there are unique decks, 4-6 players works best. Mars 04:45 has a play time of 15-20 minutes. First player to 150 points wins the game and play can be adjusted depending on how many points the group sets as the goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
