			<description>The game is played with a deck of standard size cards.  On one side is a player's name and small picture.  On the reverse is the player's statistics through to the year the deck was printed.  The object of the game is to sort the players based on one of nine categories:  Jersey number, number of teams played for, rookie year, total goals, total assists, total points, penalty minutes, number of seasons and position drafted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck is placed with the stats side of the cards face down.  One card is stats side up and a category is selected.  The object is to place the player on the top of the deck with the other stats-up cards, in order, for the given category.  Keep going until you make a mistake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the basic game, one category is selected.  Whoever gets the most players positioned correctly without making a mistake wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the tournament game, nine rounds are played, one for each category.  Each round you receive one point for each correct placement, to a maximum of five.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six different decks exist, one for each of the Canadian NHL teams (Ottawa, Montreal, Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary and Toronto).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
