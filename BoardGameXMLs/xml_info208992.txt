			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Racial Profiles presents a new playable PC race in both Pathfinder RPG and 5th Edition mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About this Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tavi are a mongoose-like people about the size of halflings. They are often nomadic travelers who enjoy the freedom of the open road, rarely staying long in one place. They have a wanderlust for new locales and people, partly driven by an unquenchable love of new experiences, and partly motivated by a need to find and kill their nemeses: snakes and races with strong ties to snakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tavi think of their friends as their &amp;quot;pack&amp;quot; and form powerful bonds with their adventuring cohorts, often taking an measure necessary to protect their packmates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The story of Rikki-tikki-tavi for those unfamiliar with the Rudyard Kibling classic.&lt;br/&gt;    Two pages of ecology and personality information written by Gwendolyn Kestrel.&lt;br/&gt;    Mechanics for creating tavi player characters in both Pathfinder and 5th Edition rule systems.&lt;br/&gt;    Alternate racial traits for Pathfinder tavi PCs.&lt;br/&gt;    Favored class options for all Pathfinder Core classes.&lt;br/&gt;    One racial subtype (the &amp;quot;Meerka&amp;quot;) in both PFRPG and 5e rules.&lt;br/&gt;    4 new 5th Edition feats of interest to Tavi PCs (Alertness, Danger Sense, Fleet, and Lookout)&lt;br/&gt;    3 new 5th Edition spells of interest to Tavi PCs (burrow, sacred watch, and soilslip).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
