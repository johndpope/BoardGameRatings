			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the fourteenth release in Superior Software's popular series of Play It Again Sam compilations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It includes four games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Predator - An action adventure game based on the movie.&lt;br/&gt;Ballistix - A futuristic sports game.&lt;br/&gt;Superior Soccer - A top-down Football game which can be played in both management and arcade modes.&lt;br/&gt;Star Port - This was a previously unreleased game included in this compilation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Port Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The STAR PORT BETA has been attacked by hostile alien forces. A brief semi-coherent message was received from the STAR PORT requesting assistance... then all contact was lost. This message, and information on the STAR PORT are reproduced for you before the mission commences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your overall objective is to recover five cases of medical supplies and then to use the escape ship at the top of the port.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Port is a platform game interspersed with puzzles. The player needs to move around a base populated with robots, which must be destroyed to successfully complete the game. There are locked doors, which need to be opened using numbered keys dotted around the base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player needs to act quickly, as the oxygen supply is continually dwindling. This can be shored up by picking up additional oxygen cylinders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blue doors are locked with a puzzle. This consists of four interlocking wheels, with the letters A-I inscribed upon them. The player must rotate the wheels such that the letters are in alphabetical order. The first puzzle needs one wheel to be turned, then second needs two to be turned, etc. The puzzles need to be solved in a time-limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player loses the game if they run out of oxygen, run out of energy, or run out of puzzle time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
