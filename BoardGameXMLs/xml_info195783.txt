			<description>Attention golddiggers! As you move your piece from start to finish on the board, you accumulate and discard husbands, always keeping track of your growing liquid cash assets (a tiny calculator and note paper is included in the box). Sometimes, you get to roll to steal other players' husbands. When possible, sink your liquid assets into real estate and businesses, in case a divorce goes wrong and you are the one who loses your shirt. Along the way, you land on &amp;quot;Up&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Down&amp;quot; spaces which provide windfalls or disasters that affect your net worth. Once everyone has reached the finish space, everyone tallies up their total net worth and the one with the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From game description: Up to 6 players. Each player begins with a zero balance in their bank accounts. Using the custom dice included in this game, each player takes turns moving their number of spaces around the board. The object is to become the richest by collecting Men, Homes &amp;amp; Businesses. Battle it out with your friends to see who will become the wealthiest. Travel around the game board trying your luck at earning great riches while dealing with the rewards and pitfalls of real life. Marry men, buy homes and collect businesses to end up the wealthiest player. The Game of Divorce is an absolute must to add to your board game collection. For entertainment purposes only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
