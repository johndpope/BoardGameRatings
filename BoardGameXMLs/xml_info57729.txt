			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meister der D&amp;auml;monen (Demon Master) is the second book of the Die Sieben Gezeichneten campaign (The Seven Marked Ones). It compiles the original adventures Pforte des Grauens and Bastrabuns Bann into a single volume, and adds a new adventure: Schatten im Zwielicht. It also presents background information and ideas for additional adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning: Spoilers ahead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first adventure in the book is Pforte des Grauens (Portal of Dread). After Borbarad's temporary defeat, the characters head to Punin, where they are sent to investigate the theft of large amounts of the magic metal Endurium on the isle of Maraskan. The metal should have been transported to Punin, but never arrived. The sea voyage from Khunchom to Tuzak goes not as expected and the party is stranded on the Maraskan shores north of their destination. They have to find their way through the jungles where they meet Achaz, the lizardmen. The Achaz want the characters to return an artifact that was robbed from them, a mission they can accept or decline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After days in the jungle, the party finds the Endurium mine, human sacrifices and a demon that is forced to mine the Endurium ore. The Endurium has already been moved away from the mine, but the thieves also been slain. The characters can track the murders to the Friedhof der Seeschlangen (Graveyard of the Sea Serpents) where followers of Borbarad and lizardmen try to open a portal to let a demonic army into the world. After the destruction of the cultists, the adventurers find the artifact they were sent to recover for the good lizardmen tribe. When they bring it back they fight a ritual duel, and one of them becomes the third Marked One. At last they reach the city of Tuzak and reveal an infiltrator in the ruler's palace. They find Borbarad himself in disguise and finally fight him and force him to flee, capturing his staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Bastrabuns Bann (Bastrabun's Banishment), Borbarad is able to widen his influence. An ancient spell - Bastrabuns Bann - held off the lizardmen from invading the lands of the Tulamids in former times. It is thought that this spell can be used against the invading  demon forces, if only the relics are found that aided in casting the original banishment. In the desert and mountains they discover another evil wizard who summoned the arch demon Asfaloth. Asfaloth creates an army of insectoid creatures and is threating to release the Great Swarm to conquer the Tulamid lands for himself. While the characters can defeat him, this only strengthens Borbarad who did not intend to share with the arch demon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last adventure of this book is a completely new one: Schatten im Zwielicht (Shadows in the Twilight) It was designed to tie together several loose threads of the original campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the adventure, the party almost get's poisoned, but are saved by a member of the Shadows, a secret organization of dark mages opposing Borbarad. They are invited to participate in assassination operations against Borbarad's followers throughout Aventurien. After a few successful, though ethically questionable, attacks, a large-scale assault on Maraskan leads the party and a large fleet of ships manned by almost all Shadows into a trap. The characters only barely escape after having seen the real power of their nemesis. Here ends the second book of the Borbarad campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
