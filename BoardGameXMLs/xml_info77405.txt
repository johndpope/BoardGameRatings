			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fun House is a NES action video game which is based on the United States version of the TV show Fun House. The player must travel on roller blades while attempting to hit all the required targets by throwing tomatoes.  This is done while avoiding traps and enemies and finishing under the time limit in order to advance to the next level.  Later levels require that the player hits some of the targets in a particular order.  Additionally, there are occasional warps to advance multiple levels at a time.  If the player does not hit all the targets under the time limit, the player loses a life and the player must start the stage over again.  The game is played from an overhead view, and only the player's head, arms, and occasional legs are ever visible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
