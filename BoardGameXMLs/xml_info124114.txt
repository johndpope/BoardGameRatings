			<description>Four games together in one magnetique book with magnets as pawns and a spinning wheel as die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You dream of tournaments and attack castles? Play with this book and delve into the world of proud medieval knights! &lt;br/&gt;In the first game you will discover all about the equipment of the knight who is preparing to battle: the various parts that make up his armor, his weapons, the horse's harness. &lt;br/&gt;The second game takes you to storm a fortress to rescue his lord and discover the architecture of a castle. &lt;br/&gt;In the third and fourth game you'll find yourself immersed in the thick of the fight, and to awaken the slumbering knight in you, you must be brave and respect the honor code of chivalry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
