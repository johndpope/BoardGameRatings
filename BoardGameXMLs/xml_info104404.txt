			<description>NOX MAZE is a horror game of wits and cards and dice for 2-6 mature players (4 is optimal). Players create the NOX MAZE by using two decks of cards: Doors &amp;amp; Rooms. Open doors allow players to pass between Rooms. Within rooms, players interact,&lt;br/&gt;search, hide and fight. Once all twelve rooms are placed, any door that does not lead to another room is a way out. The first player to escape the maze, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will roll 2 to 5 six-sided dice to perform the following actions: OPEN, MOVE, SEARCH, HIDE, HELP or ATTACK. Throughout the game, you will search for HAND cards and try to avoid SKULL cards. HAND cards (Useful, Useless and Charmed items) help you defeat the maze, influence others, intimidate them, or just plain force them to do your will. SKULL cards (Bad Scares, Devious Traps, Wicked Hexes and Dark Entities) await those who roll below 9. Skulls can kill you or drive you insane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, you are YOU. Imagine yourself awakened in a dark room without knowing why or how you came to be there. Act as you might under those circumstances. Strike out on your own or explore as a group; it&amp;rsquo;s up to you. FAIR WARNING: few make it out of the maze alone. You must cooperate as you compete--tricky!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delta version of the game can be downloaded at the game's website: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.noxmaze.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.noxmaze.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
