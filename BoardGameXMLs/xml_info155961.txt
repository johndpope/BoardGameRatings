			<description>Gadget Racers (known in Japan as Choro Q HG 3) is a role-playing, racing game for the PlayStation 2. It is the sequel to Road Trip Adventure. It was also meant to be published in North America by Conspiracy Entertainment under the title Road Trip: Adventure Avenue but was cancelled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gadget Racers is like the same as Road Trip Adventure with many elements of racing in it but there are new things that the player can perform. There are three types of race courses: there are short, middle and long. The player's main goal is to become the legendary meister. There are many races to complete before becoming the meister, each race contains a flag after the player wins nor completes the race. The player goes around to four towns to do biddings and other sorts of things from the inhabitants that needs help with. There are a few mini-games such as Rental Courses, Drag Racing and also Football Regulation. Players may also acquire car bodies after winning races, and there is a reward for acquiring 151 bodies. Players can then acquire gadget parts that will make them fly, float and go faster to enhance the performance of their cars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Choro Q HG 3&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
