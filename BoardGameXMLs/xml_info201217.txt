			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gypsy Knights Games is proud to present the first in a line of products dedicated to the great ships of the Clement Sector setting's past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trent-class destroyer is a reaction drive vessel used by the United States Space Navy in the early days of colonization into Clement Sector.  The 1500-tonne destroyer was launched in 2185 to provide security and to protect the United States' fledgling interstellar colonies. The Trent-class was the most capable of the first generation reaction drive interstellar warships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historical Ships of Clement Sector 1: Trent comes complete with beautiful views of the Trent as well as full deckplans and statistics to make your use of the product simple, easy, and fun.  The book also comes with deck plans and views of the ship's boat and work pod.  Also included are adventure seeds to help Referees get their characters involved with the action immediately.  Though designed specifically with our Clement Sector setting in mind, the Trent could easily be used in any science fiction setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get on board!  Adventure awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
