			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Danny &amp;ldquo;The Hammer&amp;rdquo; Scarborough, the notorious mob enforcer, has had a change of heart. Two weeks ago, after the birth of his son, Scarborough realized he didn&amp;rsquo;t want the boy raised in the dangerous, violent world that produced him. So he&amp;rsquo;s decided to testify before a grand jury about the city&amp;rsquo;s organized crime syndicate. Scarborough has told the District Attorney he will make a full confession at police headquarters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, Scarborough is in jail for attempted murder. Most of the prison guards are on the mob&amp;rsquo;s payroll and alerted the crime families to Scarborough&amp;rsquo;s turn. In order to make sure &amp;ldquo;The Hammer&amp;rdquo; never arrives at police HQ, the mob has hired their newest hit man, Death Vulture, to take out Scarborough. The plan is to attack the prisoner transfer when it is on the highway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also includes three new powers and a new combat maneuver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroic Moments is the aschan series of single action scenes for four-color superhero games. This series is designed to be dropped seamlessly into any existing superhero campaign. No prep: just a set-up, some bystanders &amp;amp; a villain for your heroes to clobber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
