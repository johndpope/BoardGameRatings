							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fire the Cannons!</name>
									
			<description>Fire the Cannons! is a tile laying game where players compete to build the largest castle, while strategically using cannon fire to ruins their opponents' castles. Its a Euro-style game, no die rolling for mechanic resolution. Playing the tiles builds your castle, situates the cannons, and when a sufficient number of flag-tiles are played, fires the cannons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting with the player holding the cannon and proceeding clockwise, each player should take one territory&lt;br/&gt;tile from the face-up pile in the center of the board and add it next to another tile in their kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;The tile may be rotated when being placed.&lt;br/&gt;Only when an area is completely enclosed by walls, however, is it considered &amp;ldquo;secured&amp;rdquo;. If an area has one or more gaps, it is considered &amp;ldquo;under siege&amp;rdquo; until all of the gaps are filled.&lt;br/&gt;Each tile will generally have one or more special symbols on the tile. Adding three commander (red flag) symbols to one&amp;rsquo;s kingdom will trigger a round of attack. The player will score during this time as well.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the round, refill the center play area with new tiles from the territory tile stack&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest score when no tiles remain in the center of the play area wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is freely available from &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.vbasementgames.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.vbasementgames.com/&lt;/a&gt; after you create an account.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
