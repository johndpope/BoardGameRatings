			<description>BACKGROUND: GLORY FOR FRANCE is semi-historical simulation of the Napoleonic Wars at the dawn of the 19th Century. The Game begins in 1803, shortly after Napoleon Bonaparte seized power from the French Directory. The French are building up their forces and gathering their fleets in order to expand their Empire and spread the glory of France to neighboring Territories. In the meantime, those neighboring Territories are forming various Coalitions to halt the French Invasions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: As the Commander of the French Naval and Land Forces, you must gather your Army and Naval Forces to conquer the surrounding Territories. Territories are conquered by capturing all of their Key Settlements. Each Territory has a Victory Point (VP) Value if Conquered. The Player must attempt to conquer as many Territories as possible before the last Campaign Card is Played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME FEATURES: GLORY FOR FRANCE includes many, many colorful Game Counters for both Army and Naval Forces. All the Key Arms of a Napoleonic Army are featured including Infantry, Artillery, Grenadiers, Dragoons, Hussars and Cuirassiers. Naval Forces feature 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Rate Ships of the Line. Combat includes Land Battles, Attacks on Forts and Naval Battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GLORY FOR FRANCE can be found at the following URL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.berserkergames.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.berserkergames.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
