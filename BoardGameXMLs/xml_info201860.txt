			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;Potions are found all over Lythia, in markets and fairs, on the shelves of apothecaries and physicians, in castles and in hovels. Some potions are well-known, but perhaps only in one region. Others are rare because they are difficult to prepare, have a short shelf life, or include rare or illegal ingredients. Magical effects are claimed for some potions, but most are intended as common remedies. Where guilds thrive, potions are a monopoly of Apothecaries, but there has always been a broad overlap between home remedies, herbal teas, and legitimate potions. Despite serious legal sanctions, unguilded sellers of potions are common, especially at fairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most potions are created according to guild-approved formulas, and packaged and sold in accordance with strict rules regarding composition, quality, claims of efficacy, and packaging. Breaking these laws can bring severe penalties, including public humiliation, heavy fines, and loss of guild franchise. Forging the guild seal is a serious breach of guild privilege.&lt;br/&gt;Most potions require herbs as ingregients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;32 Potions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nectar of Wisdom&lt;br/&gt;Euphoric hallucinogenic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maermal's Blessing&lt;br/&gt;Enhances strength&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worried Worreen&lt;br/&gt;Strong poison&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ichor of Agrik&lt;br/&gt;Disinfectant / painkiller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hru's Might &lt;br/&gt;Strength / Stamina potion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Halea's Brandy &lt;br/&gt;Aphrodisiac&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potion of Right &lt;br/&gt;Navehan Hallucinogen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fletharasha&lt;br/&gt;Recreational Drug&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;White Death&lt;br/&gt;Strong Poison&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corruption Jelly &lt;br/&gt;Khuzan Strength Potion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uhla Oil&lt;br/&gt;Brain Stimulant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heir-in-a-bottle&lt;br/&gt;Fertility Drug&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two More Legs&lt;br/&gt;Horse Stimulant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tirrala's Pillow&lt;br/&gt;Antibiotic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eye-of-Dwarf&lt;br/&gt;Eye Stimulant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tharin's Rock Salt &lt;br/&gt;Seasoning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heavy Curtains&lt;br/&gt;Soporific&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salt of Kamil&lt;br/&gt;Narcotic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uhla Ink&lt;br/&gt;Invisible Ink&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watcher's Ale&lt;br/&gt;Stimulant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dryad Sweat &lt;br/&gt;Aphrodisiac&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elmithra &lt;br/&gt;Medicine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baby-can-wait &lt;br/&gt;Contraceptive&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ilvir's Crook &lt;br/&gt;Hallucinogen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daddy can't wait &lt;br/&gt;Emetic / Laxative&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spirit Ale &lt;br/&gt;Disembodiment Potion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eye-of-Elf &lt;br/&gt;Eye Balm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Halea's Tresses &lt;br/&gt;Narcotic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goodheart &lt;br/&gt;Heart Stimulant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heal-All &lt;br/&gt;Antidote&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Green Demon &lt;br/&gt;Brain Stimulant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Khalmet's Theriac &lt;br/&gt;Antivenin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
