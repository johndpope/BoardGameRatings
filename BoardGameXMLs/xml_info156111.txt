							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Folk</name>
									
			<description>from The World of the Folk:&lt;br/&gt;The stories told using this role-playing game take place in the World of the Folk. It is a world much like ours; it has seas, mountains and other topographical features that we possess in our world. It contains creatures we would recognise, and others that we might not. The Folk walk about like you or I but their world has one crucial difference to our own: it is magical. Not in a showy, spells and wands, way but in a far more subtle and essential way. It is filled with the magic which comes from stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from The Basics:&lt;br/&gt;The Folk is designed to encourage enjoyable storytelling, with the storyteller and the players interacting to bring the narrative to life. This is done by players having an awareness of their character&amp;rsquo;s mindset and limitations and acting accordingly. It is also achieved through the storyteller knowing the nature of those characters and ensuring they are central to story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, it cannot all be description and having a shared understanding of the limitation of the characters. Dice rolls in The Folk, whilst not as frequent as in other role-plays, are vital to the storytelling. At key moments, such as a leap across a gorge or when attempting to stare down an Ogre there is only one way to decide which way the winds of Chance will blow the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
