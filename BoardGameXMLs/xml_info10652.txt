			<description>Versus 50 - an abstract board game in which players try to reduce their opponent's pieces to below a total value of 50. The board is a 12x12 checkerboard with some squares marked as barriers which cannot be crossed. The player's pieces are marked with numbers from 3 to 24 and with orthogonal or diagonal crosses, which indicate the direction they may move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After putting their pieces on the designated starting places, players move them any distance as allowed and try to strike opponents pieces off by landing. This is only allowed if the attacking piece has a higher value, but not allowed though if the defending piece is a divisor. So 12 could hit 10, but not 3. When their total value drops below 50, that player loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
