							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">American Monster Hunters</name>
									
			<description>Hunt it.  Find it.  Slay it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the small towns and lonely highways of America, monsters lurk in the shadows, stalking and terrorizing innocent victims.  You are a small team of monster hunters &amp;mdash; average citizens that know the truth about the creatures of the night.  You are on the hunt for an unknown monster.  Can you identify the monster and track it to its lair before it claims its victims and disappears once more into the shadows?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;American Monster Hunters is a cooperative card game set in a mythic rural America haunted by monsters. You and your friends collect clue cards and work together to reveal the identity of the monster, determined by random mystery cards at the start of each game. Each turn, you must decide whether to protect victims, prepare for the coming fight against the monster, or progress the hunt. Variable powers, ever-increasing risk, and fast-paced turns make for a tense, exciting, and unique game each time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Print-and-play coming soon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
