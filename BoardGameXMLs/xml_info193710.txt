			<description>Two players square off to reign supreme in the wizard world. High point total wins a point. You must win 3 points to win the round. Win 5 rounds to win the game. Each player squares off with 45 Wizard cards and 18 Wacky Wizard cards. Each round consists of 5 Wizard cards placed face down in front on the player. Each player sets the order before they lay them down. You can never look at them again. You draw two Wacky Wizard cards that you hold in your hand. The Wacky Wizard cards modify your main Wizard cards. Such as changing the cards color, adding or subtracting from your card or your opponents card. You each reveal your top Wizard card and let the battle of wits begin. How will you use your two Wacky Wizard cards to ensure that you win 3 points? Did you create a order of your Wizard cards that best uses the abilities of your Wacky Wizard cards?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wacky Wizards may also be played in teams of Red verses Blue when more Wacky Wizard Decks are added. You may add two people per Deck added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
