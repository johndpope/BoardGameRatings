			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNPUBLISHED PRODUCT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;it appears this Item will never be published&lt;br/&gt;this Item has been moved to (Unpublished Products)&lt;br/&gt;there should be no product images submitted to this entry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the last Kickstarter update:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an update on the Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry version of Fire As She Bears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We converted the game and discovered that it was not up to par when it was done in Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry. Although we could have definitely fulfilled the orders by sending out a poor game, Matt finch has decided to take the route of not sending out a poor game just because we had promised to convert FASB. It would be a betrayal of our commitment to always send out only what we consider to be top-notch quality. We are left in a bind both ways, and in order to make FASB into a game that works well as an expansion to the S&amp;amp;W naval combat rules, we would have to essentially create a new game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the decision has been made to offer a refund rather than send out something low quality. We apologize and will be contacting those who added this product on to offer refunds and our apology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
