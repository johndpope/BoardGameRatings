							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Long Shadow</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The environment of today was created in the histories of the past. Some deeds are significant and their implications are like a long shadow, stretching far beyond their original source. Alas, the truths of these events are sometimes lost to history through turmoil, or are deliberately hidden. Scholars, such as the members of the Emerald Society, seek this knowledge so that past truths may be reclaimed and understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sadly, turmoil is not confined to the past. Work on the infamous road known as the Red March &amp;ndash; so named for all the blood spilled in its construction &amp;ndash; has been terminated by the Swords of Nier. While this is perhaps one of their more popular edicts, not all are pleased. The Emerald Society has depended on the presence of both workers and taskmasters for a dig located near the border between Canceri and the Hinterlands. Now they need additional stout backs and strong arms to ensure the security of a supply train to continue and expand their site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This INTRODUCTORY LIVING ARCANIS ADVENTURE is designed for 1st through 5th-level characters (APLs 1, 2, 3, and 5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
