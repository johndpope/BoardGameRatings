							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GOV&#039;NOR!    The Dartmoor Prison Boardgame</name>
									
			<description>Be the first to get released from the Infamous Dartmoor Prison. Shrouded in mist and mystery! A game of twists and barbed wire turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE GUV'NOR! You play rival prison gangs; the Landing Mob, the Kitchen Gang, the Gym Boyz, the Garden Crew, the Laundry Syndicate and the Library Club&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win the game by earning 20 parole points and be the first to get released!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed by people who know what it's like, so the game has an authenticity beyond the traditional escape scenario!. In this game it's a bad move when a gang member escapes, because it weakens the gang left inside!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete to gain territory across the prison map.  Winners place their cards in one of the vacant cells in the block.  The block makes a decision by a majority vote about who is to be The GUV&amp;quot;NOR.  Unless one player has more than half the cells deals need to be done between players. Players then move along the track (called the perimeter wall) and where they land decides what actions take place.  Actions can change the number of cards in the block, place or remove trouble cards on the prison map, or require the block to make decisions.  Decisions will be determined by both the cards in the block at the time and the relationship  between the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game enables all members of the family to play as it provides lots of times when &amp;quot;I win you lose&amp;quot; scenarios to arise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple rules means they are easily mastered and that enables more sophisticated game play as players try to use the rules to get ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further rules including challenging the leadership of the GUV'NOR - making  regular decisions about who to back and what parole points to deal with  and lockdown - which gives the current GUV'NOR power to make the decisions the block did, including being ale to win a leadership challenge whatever the number of cards in the block raise tension as players try to find away to either stay in control or wrestle it away from others without the wrong rivals taking control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If no one player dominates the Block then deals have to be done between players to form packs. But trust no one. Each turn players roll a dice and move around the board along the perimiter wall as they serve their sentence and have to make decisions about who they support. Decisions are determined by the number of gang member cards they have in The Block. Each turn can change the number of cards a player has and so alter their influence. Players have to manoeuvre themselves through their sentence until one player has gained 20 parole points. Points are lost or gained by getting caught by the staff, taking control of the Block, time served and from doing deals with other players to get their support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This leads to a fast paced game, players are constantly changing sides, working out who best to support, and not getting caught by the staff. Watch as the  staff increase security, send you to solitary and threatens lockdown!   It is an exhausting game of wit, strategy, coercion and survival that brings out the best and the worst in participants! In the end you don't just win you probably get rehabilitated!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are designed to be interdependent, hence the block makes decisions that effect the level of security.  At both extremes, ie too high or too low the scale has a trouble space.  If the scale is on trouble and all of the trouble cards are placed on the map then trouble starts.  this is a spontaneous battle for territory that lasts 4 turns and enables a potentially dramatic change in who runs the block.  This rule, like many others provides an exciting tension where players can predict what could happen next (within the dice roll) to change who is winning or what opportunities were lost to defeat who is currently in charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is very visual, so it matters where the players pieces are along the perimeter wall, how many cards are held in the block, what bonus cards are in solitary, whether the prison is in lockdown or not, and how many trouble cards there are on the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
