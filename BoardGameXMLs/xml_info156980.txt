			<description>The goal of the game is to move 4 meeples from the center of the labyrinth the finish spaces at the outer rim. The first player to accomplish this wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with one die. The meeples may only move in the direction indicated by the arrows on the game board. If a meeple lands on a white dot, it follows the arrow  outwards into the next roundcourse at its next turn. Whenever a meeple lands on an occupied space, it kicks the other meeple back to a starting (a) space of it's color. If a player rolls a 6 he gets an extra roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was most likely published in the 1930s or early 40s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
