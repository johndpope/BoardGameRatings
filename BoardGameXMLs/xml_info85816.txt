			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Touch of Chaos is a challenging adventure designed for four PCs of 10th to 13th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark powers, covetous of the rewards an imprisoned god would grant his liberators, have commanded a succubus named Trillabeth to find the Heart of Osiris and free Apep on their behalf. To this end she has awakened Khertoosk, now an ancient mummy, and together they have stolen the gem from Arkusdard's heir and are awaiting their dark masters' instructions on how to end Apep's imprisonment. It is around this central theme of a dark god's restoration that A Touch of Chaos has been designed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure begins for the PCs five days journey north of the great desert city of Khardrist. Motivations for making this journey can be found amongst the character hooks after this synopsis or can be supplied by DMs to fit their campaigns. Regardless of the hook used, the PCs will encounter Arcanphilus, a huge adult blue dragon and the grandson of Arkusdard. On this day,Arcanphilus will present the PCs with a simple choice; retrieve the Heart of Osiris or be destroyed. Acting on information provided by the dragon, PCs will travel into the foothills of the Patar Mountains where they will discover an ancient temple of Apep, Trillabeth the succubus, Khertoosk the mummy priest, and the 3000 year old prison of the great chaos serpent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
