							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mission to Ecuador</name>
									
			<description>Mission to Ecuador is an entertaining and competitive card game of strategy for two to four players. Mission to Ecuador duplicates some of the real effort and uses some inspirational biblical verses required to establish a working mission as based on an actual mission to Ecuador.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: [ The Publisher Website].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns drawing cards until a mission card is played. At that point players stop drawing cards and start playing their convert cards that match the played mission. When a player can no longer play a convert card the mission ends and all players who placed convert cards places them face down in their &amp;quot;good works&amp;quot; pile. The player with the most &amp;quot;good works&amp;quot; when the deck runs out wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
