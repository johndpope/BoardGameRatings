			<description>On February 3, 1852 was the final war between the Argentine Confederation and the Empire of Brazil, which began in 1851 during the Uruguay civil war, in the great Battle of Monte Caseros!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 60,000 soldiers fought in one of the bloodiest battles in the history of South America... After this battle, for the first time in history, a non-European army marched on the streets of Buenos Aires...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monte Caseros is a card game for two players whose theme is the Battle of Monte Caseros. Each player must manage their armies composed of Infantry, Cavalry and Artillery. Each player must correctly apply their strategic cards, trying to trap the enemy officers and annihilate your troops!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At each turn the player must place on the battlefield cards that represent their armies and, when appropriate, to attack the enemy army, applying their strategic cards. For the resolution of the fighting we use the military force of each cards, the strategic factor, and a combat resolution table as the best war games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
