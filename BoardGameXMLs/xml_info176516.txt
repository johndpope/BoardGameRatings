							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Magician Archetype</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This release for Supernatural Supers &amp;amp; Metahuman Mystics provides you with a new archetype, the Magician. A magician is a normal person who has learned the extraordinary skills and tricks of stage magic -- prestidigitation and illusion. No actual magic is involved, yet the feats a magician can pull off often still manage to seem supernatural because they cannot easily be explained. Whatever the reason, the magician has decided to use their talents for more than entertaining an audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes the a base magician archetype template so you can more easily and quickly make magician characters of your own, as well as guidelines on their origins, appearance and personality, tricks of the trade (including sample tricks and sample magician's gear), how they may be improved, and a number of variations on the basic theme. Rounding out the product are two new advantages, two new extras, and a sample magician character, Presto.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
