							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Storm Over Wolf&#039;s Hill</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While traveling through the wilderness of Barsaive, the player characters are surprised by bad weather. A storm arises. Luckily there is a small settlement, which they reach just before the rain starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wolf&amp;rsquo;s Hill is a village that is mostly surrounded by forests. Most of the inhabitants are lumberjacks or working in the lumber mill. Though they have arranged themselves with the wolves that gave their village its name, fear is in their eyes when the group arrives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the last days two people were attacked by a pack of wolves that are taller than usual. The first victim was a young woman, who was killed in that attack. The second victim was a lumberjack, who escaped. The wolves also threatened other lumberjacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spokesman of Wolf &amp;rsquo;s Hill asks the group for help against those creatures. Investigating the incidents the player characters quickly find out that the dead woman&amp;rsquo;s husband had lost his voice a few days ago due to some mysterious sickness. In fact, he is Horrormarked by a despairthought, who forced his wife to perform the marking ritual on him. Two days later storm wolves that sensed the touch of the Horror on her killed the woman. They also sensed the Horror&amp;rsquo;s victim in the village and investigated those, who left the settlement. They didn&amp;rsquo;t attack anyone else. The second victim attacked the wolves by himself, trying to avenge the death of the woman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While they talk to the inhabitants, the player characters may perceive a boy observing them. What first seems to be just a curious child will tell them later about a frightening silhouette in a cave, which has talked to the woman a few days ago. The boy can bring them to the cave where the player characters encounter the despairthought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From publisher: This  scored Third Place in the Earthdawn Adventure Resource Contest of 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
