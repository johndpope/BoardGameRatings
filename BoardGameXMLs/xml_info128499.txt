							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ratz Fatz auf die Baustelle</name>
									
			<description>A construction-site themed educational children's game in the RatzFatz series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 16 picture tiles, three wooden pieces (excavator, road compactor, concrete mixing transport truck), a color die and a booklet with several game ideas for kids of various ages. The picture tiles show different tools (pincers, hammer, shovel, drill, ladder), materials (cement, bricks, stone, sand), pieces of clothing (helmet, boiler suit, glove, protective vest, shoe, tool belt) and screws.&lt;br/&gt;The basic game idea is that an adult reads or tells a story or a poem, and the children have to grab tiles when they hear the names of the items on those tiles. The player with most tiles is the winner, but it is also playable with just one kid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other ideas presented in the booklet include memory games, sorting activities (sort tiles into tools, clothing, construction materials), and telling what an object is used for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
