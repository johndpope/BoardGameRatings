			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can customize a bowler and gradually compete against better and better opponents in 9 alleys, each made unique by alley backgrounds and the ball's different action. As players win, they increase their abilities of power, accuracy and spin control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action of the ball and pins can be toggled to be more realistic, just as the game can be put into different modes of pin or match challenge as well as quick match, league, or tournament play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
