			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARE YOU READY TO EMBRACE YOUR DESTINY?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 217 CM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over two centuries ago, Terrath's second moon shattered and fire fell from the heavens. Ancient Empires and vast kingdoms that had once stretched across the known world were wiped out in a single day. A chosen few were selected by the gods to survive inside the sanctuary known as Aegis. As they struggled to adapt, they were unaware of the savagery that existed beyond their borders. But now, as overpopulation and a limited food supply have caused the Great City of Av'Talen to become a symbol of corruption at the heart of the realm, the shattered and deadly lands of the old world call out like a beacon to those who crave power and yearn for freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shroud of the Ancients is a dystopian fantasy roleplaying game that focuses on character interaction without sacrificing the excitement that you crave from tabletop gaming. Based on the newest incarnation of the D5RPG system from Dark Tavern Press, The Adventurer's Guide to the World of Terrath features complete rules for creating and playing your own dynamic characters that live and breathe adventure in the world of Terrath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you begin playing the Shroud of the Ancients Roleplaying Game, you will be utilizing a classless, levelless rules set that doesn't constrain your creativity, along with a flexible magic system that frees your imagination to shape your own destiny.
