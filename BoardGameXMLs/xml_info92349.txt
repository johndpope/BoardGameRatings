			<description>Develop a nimble mind by computing basic multiplication facts or, inversely, breaking products down into factors and possibly prime factors. In the game, players use two spinners to generate numbers, and have cards that track the results of the spins, depending on the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Product Capture, players claim the product of two factors they spin. Three or more chips in a row earn points keyed to the color zones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Factor Pursuit, players compute the product of two spinners and mark any set of factors for this product on their scorecards. Be the first to fill your scorecard and win! A bonus investigation guides students in exploring the multiplication table for repeating, reflecting, and growing patterns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
