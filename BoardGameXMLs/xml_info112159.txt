							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Time Lord Companion</name>
									
			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;This is the second edition of this booklet and was designed as a set of rules to allow published adventures from FASA Corporation's Doctor Who Role Playing Game to be used in the Time Lord environment.  To do this, the GM controlled characters and pre-generated Player Characters (PC's for short) need to be converted over to the Time Lord game system.  This booklet provides the rules, tables, and guidelines to do this.  Included in the Appendices are statistics for the Eighth doctor, presented in May 1996 in a made-for-TV movie shown simultaneously in the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things new to the second edition of this booklet are a revised set of rules written by the co-creator of the game, Ian Marsh on creating Companions.  Also included is Allen Shock's set of rules for creating characters.  As this set of rules seem to be more elegant than mine, I have decided to use it instead, but not without some adaptations on my part.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
