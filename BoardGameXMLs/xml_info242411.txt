			<description>The People have spoken...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What would a Museum be without the people that visit it? How would all these treasures shine if not through the eyes of all those that behold them? A Museum lives, and dies, by the will of the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this expansion, you and your friends can battle it out for public acclaim as well adding a 5th player to your games of Museum!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The People&amp;rsquo;s Choice, you&amp;rsquo;ll be competing for a common objective that is drawn at the beginning of the game. For example: The &amp;ldquo;B.C.&amp;rdquo; card awards players with the most BC dated cards in their museum. The player with the most cards takes the People&amp;rsquo;s Choice token and keeps it until another player amasses a bigger collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game the player with the token earns bonus points! There are 10 different People&amp;rsquo;s Choice cards, each one with different criteria: Date, value, regions and themes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, by public demand, this expansion also includes the necessary material to play Museum with up to 5 players! This includes a Museum board and tokens for the base game, as well as all the elements necessary to play each of the expansions with up to 5 players. Also, for the Kickstarter version we&amp;rsquo;ll be including an additional KS exclusive Discard tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
