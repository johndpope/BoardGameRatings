			<description>&amp;quot;Board &amp;amp; card game for 2 players. Battle between two Norse Tribes. Abstract skirmish level combat. Each figure represents a single man (unit). Victory: You win if you kill the opposing Chieftain.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chessboard or any other 8x8 grid. Miniatures or counters are used to represent the combatants. Each player has sixteen units: a Chieftain, three Huscarls, two Berserkers, eight Warriorss, and two Pathfinders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A custom deck of cards is central to the play of the game. The players draw a hand of cards from a common deck. Card play determines when units may move, attack, or defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
