							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hench: The Game</name>
									
			<description>There Must Be No Competition, Before World Domination&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Hench: The Game, you take on the role of an evil mad scientist that has the means to rule the world, but so do a few others just like you! Before you can take over the world, you need to eliminate the competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hench: The Game will be a simple card and dice game (recommended for 2-4 players). From your hand of 6 cards, you build your army of henchmen to protect you using Recruit Cards, and who will also do all your dirty work for you. You can strengthen your henchmen army by building enhancements to your secret hideout or equipping them with weapons. You can also attack, sabotage, defend yourself and many other things using Event Cards from your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic gameplay will go like this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.As your turn begins, you may play a Recruit Card to play henchmen from your hand (but keeping some hidden in your hand may be beneficial to you later)&lt;br/&gt;2.You then can play one Enhancement, Weapon or Event card from your hand (see FAQ for card type explanation)&lt;br/&gt;3.If an Event card is played, instead of a Weapon or Enhancement card, then all effects from the card are resolved&lt;br/&gt;4.Draw back up to 6 cards.&lt;br/&gt;5.Next player's turn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If an Event card, such as Direct Attack or Provoked Attack, are played, then combat starts. How combat works is your opponent and yourself add up your &amp;quot;Hench Power&amp;quot;, which is +1 for each henchman you have in play, and any modifiers from Weapon or Enhancements in play. Each battling player then rolls one D6 and adds it to their &amp;quot;Hench Power&amp;quot;. Higher number wins, and the loser can either lose a location enhancement or half the difference between the &amp;quot;Hench Power&amp;quot; numbers (round up) in henchmen they have in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some other Event cards would allow you to avoid a battle (but you end up losing a turn), forcing a battle between two other players, performing suicide attacks, etc.You lose when all of your henchmen are destroyed, and the last player standing wins the game, and the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
