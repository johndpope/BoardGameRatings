							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Concerning the Conquest of the Holy Land</name>
									
			<description>Take command as the grand master of one of the holy orders as they explore, conquer and pillage the Holy Land. Recruit masters to take control of the holy cities, employ crusaders to construct fortresses and ensure the safe journey of pilgrims as they bring wealth and prestige to your order. However, Saladin and the Saracens are lurking beyond the dunes to defend the land and only a true commander of Christ can bring faith to the heathens and treasures back to Europe.&lt;br/&gt;The game, as it is coming to life, enables the players to apply multiple strategies when competing against friends and family. One may recruit a mighty army while another set forth to discover the relics of ancient times. He who manages his masters most skillfully, while controlling most aspects of the game, will stand victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
