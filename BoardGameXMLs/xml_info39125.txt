			<description>Subtitle: European Land Warfare from 1853-1871&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction: &amp;quot;This rules set has been written for the wargamers who enjoy a good &amp;quot;afternoon match,&amp;quot; and not for those who like to get &amp;quot;bogged down&amp;quot; in rules minutiae. This is not to say that the historical integrity of this era in warfare has been compromised, It has not.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are designed for 15mm miniatures, but has general conversion notes for 5mm and 25mm. Turns equal 15 minutes of real time, with castings representing approx. 60 individual troops. Units are rated with Quality Points (QP) and have a typical number of castings (marked as lost as combat occurs). It has a basic &amp;quot;orders&amp;quot; system and units fatigue if given too many attack orders in a row. Unit types have a set number of performable functions in a turn for movement, formation changes and other actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook itself is 32 pages, including eight pages of general troop listings for the major conflicts of the period. There is also a four page discussion of unit organizations and tactics for the armies listed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
