							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Across the Dniepr: Kiev-Zhitomir &#039;43</name>
									
			<description>This small game deals with the Soviet attack to liberate Kiev, Ukraine in November-December 1943 and the subsequent counterattack by Balck's 48th Panzerkorps (1st, 7th, 19th, 25th, 1st SS Leibstandarte, 2nd SS Das Reich panzerdivisions and the 68th infantry division) against the 3rd Guard Tank army of Rybalko, the 38th and 60th armies, on Zhitomir, Korosten and the Malin pocket. After a quick Soviet initial advance overwhelmed the German defenders and liberated Kiev, the German counterattack with fresh reinforcements coming from other theaters of operations, destroyed several Soviet units, but could not regain much of the lost territory and was too weak to reach Kiev.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;11 X 17 inches map,  64 counters, divisional level for the Germans plus the 506th Tiger battalion and corps level for the Russians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
