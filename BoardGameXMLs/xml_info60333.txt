			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for characters of 3rd-5th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the summer months, orc warbands have been striking out of the Broken Plain across the Nonddharya River, raiding human settlements all along the frontier. For weeks, as you have traveled throughout the North, the seemingly endless hordes of orcs are all anyone talks about. Farmers fear for their crops and livestock, villagers fear for their families and homes, and soldiers fear for their lives. One band in particular, the Bloody Hatchet tribe, has become infamous throughout the region. The tribe's warchief, Rexas, is reputedly an orc-ogre halfbreed and a fearsome opponent on the battlefield. Local legend has it that Rexar has sacked more than a dozen villages, specifically targeting churches and shrines and stealing their sacred icons before burning them to the ground. Now, the word is out that orcs have been spotted in the forests near Goodland, a small village on the Nonddharya River. Lord Reisling, the frontier baron whose responsibility it is to protect Goodland, is reportedly offering bounties and rewards to anyone who can turn back the orcs and protect the village. There have been sightings of Rexar's bloody banner in the area. Can you stop the orog warrior from raising it over the burning ruins of Goodland?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
