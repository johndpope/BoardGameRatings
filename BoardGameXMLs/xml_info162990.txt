			<description>Specifically for 1/300th scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic object of the game is for either opposing player to achieve a required number of victory points. This is achieved by capturing a number of defined objectives while simultaneously destroying enemy units. The &amp;lsquo;Initiating Player&amp;rsquo; commences their game turn by selecting a particular command (usually a Company or Squadron) and then attempts to move and fire it in order to attain their game objective(s). The game turn is relinquished to the opposing player immediately the current &amp;lsquo;initiating player&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rsquo; selected command fails a morale test. If the command passes a required morale test it continues to move and or fire until it either completes its current orders or fails a subsequent morale test. Command Morale tests are always carried out immediately a platoon is disabled. Once the currently selected command completes all the tasks the initiating player requires of it and it passes all required morale tests, the player may select another command to move and fight or they may relinquish the initiative to the opposing player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Constructing a force&lt;br/&gt;Both players begin the game with 6 command headquarters of any type within their selected country organisation. Once the types of commands are established, each player rolls 2D6 for each command and this represents the number of platoons or batteries contained in each&lt;br/&gt;command. If larger forces are required, players keep adding blocks of command headquarters as required. Commands may not exceed their T&amp;amp;OE strengths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
