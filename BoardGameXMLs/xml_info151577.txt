							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Priest</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Enemy Doesn't Have a Prayer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your foes gather against you in hordes, armed with dire magics and unholy power. A lesser mortal would quake before such an onslaught. But you have the power of the gods behind you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement provides a new character class, the Priest, for use with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game (tm). The Priest draws his power from the gods, like clerics and druids, but isn't limited to prepared spells. Instead, his powers are fueled by his inner grace, and renewed by ritual and sacrifice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are new spells, a new feat and a new magic item, as well as advice on best using this new class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
