							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Salamanca: Marmont vs Wellington</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salamanca: Marmont vs Wellington covers the turning point of the 1812 campaign on the Spanish Peninsula, where Wellington showed he was not just a skilled defender, but could also deliver a decisive attack. It uses the Napoleon's Later Campaigns system, for a fast, low to moderate complexity, brigade-level game of Napoleonic battles.  Interactive Sequence of play, orders, and a modern, fire-based combat system (no odds optimising!).  To win, you have to use your army like a Napoleonic commander. Maintaining morale is the key. Running away will inspire defeatism in your troops just as heavy losses, but no side will emerge unscratched when encountering the enemy. Among all this you have to contend with multiple subordinates on a battlefield where no information can be sent faster than a rider can go.  How you are able to orchestrate your leaders to enable effective concentration of force will decide the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system combines a grand tactical perspective (battle strategy, not micromanagement) with a focus on a historically sound use of your units. Four pages of basic rules aim at an easy entry into the world of Napoleonic command and combined arms with four types of orders and assault combat, cavalry charges, and artillery bombardment. Nine pages of full rules add concepts such as additional order types, written orders (although markers are provided for those who do not wish to write), reaction charges, and enfilading fire.  Finally, 2 pages of Advanced and Optional rules add hidden movement, division level doctrine, and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Salamanca special rules deal with particular units of the campaign (such as the British Light Division), reverse slope defense (used by the French in this battle!), and supply.  Scenarios cover the historical battle (playing time 2-3 hours between experienced players), and the full day (3-4 hours), enabling both sides to set the strategy for the battle as they choose.  Can you repeat Wellington's crushing victory or, as Marmont, draw your head out of the noose?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scale: &lt;br/&gt;500m per hex&lt;br/&gt;1 hour per turn&lt;br/&gt;brigade level units&lt;br/&gt;Individual army and division commanders&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A professionally produced version of the game is planned for the future through Clash of Arms Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
