			<description>From the Avalanche Press website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the early summer of 1898, the United States embarked on war with Spain. The Spanish actually declared war first, but no one doubted that the United States was the aggressor; whether said aggression was designed to acquire control over Cuba or liberate the island depended on one&amp;rsquo;s point of view. The small U.S. Regular Army would quickly be joined by tens of thousands of volunteers, who answered the war&amp;rsquo;s signature battle cry &amp;quot;Remember the Maine!&amp;quot; with the less-well-remembered response:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;To Hell with Spain!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Hell With Spain is a supplement for the Infantry Attacks series, based on the battles fought in Cuba and Puerto Rico between June and August 1898. It is not a complete game: ownership of any boxed game in the Infantry Attacks series is necessary to provide the rules and markers, and maps are drawn from the following Panzer Grenadier games and supplements: Elsenborn Ridge, Road to Berlin, Battle of the Bulge, Kokoda Trail, Eastern Front and 1940: The Fall of France. There are 10 scenarios, each based on an actual battle or situation from the Spanish-American War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Hell With Spain is sold exclusively via .pdf download. The playing pieces are not die-cut and mounted, nor is the scenario book printed. Instead it comes as a series of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game&amp;rsquo;s components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
