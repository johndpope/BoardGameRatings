							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Albiele Island</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Albiele Island is a haven to some of the worst scum to ever sail an ocean. Pirates, smugglers, slavers and similar sorts all use the island as a convenient place from which to ply their trades throughout the seas of southern Anuire. The island is slightly over 50 miles long and varies from 6 to 25 miles in width. Albiele Island is in fact one of the few pieces of the once mighty Deismaar range not swallowed by the Straits of Aerele. &lt;br/&gt;The western end of the island is heavily wooded. A low range of hills extends down the centre of the island for most of its length. Steep cliffs protect a small, natural harbour which is the home of the thriving Albiele Town. Sparse plains and empty beaches make up the rest of the island&amp;rsquo;s geography. Each of the areas of the island is presented in more detail below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
