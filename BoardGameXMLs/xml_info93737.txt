							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">El juego de las comunidades europeas</name>
									
			<description>The players move trough squares at the sides of the board, like in Monopoly. The central part of the board is a map of Western Europe, with 18 squares over each country divided in sets of three. Each set of three has a different colour, and a letter inside. The three &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; stand for Industry, T is for Tecnology, P is for Pesca (fishing), Tr is for Transport, A for Agriculture, and E for Energy. At the beginning of the game each player picks a card with the objective for the game, for example: &amp;quot;Take control of all the Fishing of the Mediterranean countries plus Portugal&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Take control of the Energy and Industry of Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg&amp;quot;. Each player has plastic counters to put over the map, on the squares with letters he needs, so when all three squares of one resource have plastic colours of one colour, their owner takes control of the resource. To put a counter on one map square, the owner must first gather a license of the resource he wants, then land on the squares of the board that allow you to place counters on the map, and then pay for them. A player can put any number of counters in one go, as long as he has the license needed, and as long as he can pay for them. &lt;br/&gt;The sides of the board, where players move, have several different squares. In some of them, the players can get money, or purchase licences, in others the players can put plastic counters on the map, in others they can alter the price of each counter (for example, &amp;quot;Rise 4000 ECUS the price of Tecnology&amp;quot;), and in others they can put counters at half-price or for free.&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a table to track the ups and downs of the prices of each resource, and money (1000, 5000 and 10000 ECUS banknotes. ECU, by the way, was the first name proposed for the currency that we all call Euro now.).&lt;br/&gt;When one player gets his Objective, the game ends, and the player who has gathered more money wins, so sometimes the first to get the Objective is not the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
