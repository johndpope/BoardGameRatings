							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Complete Netbook of Demons and their Relatives</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Complete Netbook of Demons and their Relatives begins with an introductory statement about demons and demonology in Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons and also presents an apparently exhaustive list of demon names mentioned in the official game materials.  Several of those names not already detailed in any of the game's official products are here provided with statistics and descriptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the DOC version of the book is dated 1997, the completed work apparently was extant prior to ca. 1989 because no mention or allusion is made to tanar'ri et. al. or other aspects of 2nd edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
