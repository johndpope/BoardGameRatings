			<description>In Quick 6, players participate in 6 simultaneous games of Tic-Tac-Toe, using dice to determine allowed moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you roll two dice and pick one of the faces rolled for your move - there are 9 faces showing specific squares, one showing all corners, one showing all edge spaces, and one allowing a move in any square. You can move in any of the 6 grids that has the appropriate space open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When someone achieves 3 in a row in a grid, or a grid is provably a tie, further play there is prohibited. If 3 in a row is made, the player making it scores points for the squares involved (10 for an edge, 25 for a corner, 100 for the center), and opposing players lose points for the squares they occupy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game seems mainly intended for 2 players (only 2 sets of dice are provided), but the rules say 3 or 4 can play using 12 grids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
