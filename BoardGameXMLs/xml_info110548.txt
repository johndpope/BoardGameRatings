							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horrors of the GOW</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The undead, demons, malignant ghosts stalk the Lands of GOW. In the late fall, just before the first flakes of winter, the veil between the worlds grows thin. Necromancers feel a surge in power, spirits manifest for longer periods, and those who revel in horror and blood find themselves even more driven to commit foul deeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This short tome is designed to collect a handful of the horrors witnessed in the Lands of the GOW. They range from celluloid-inspired monsters, a magical incantation, a re-animator prestige class, new witch hexes and patron, cursed and blasphemous objects and sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horror often results with the violation of natural boundaries. Many items and creatures in this supplement violate the most natural boundary of all - the boundary of the self. Possession, obsession, reanimation and consumption all take the individual and bend them to another's will. While not everything here fits that category, it was our overarchingtheme with many items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
