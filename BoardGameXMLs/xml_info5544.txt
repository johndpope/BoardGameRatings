			<description>The game is played on a 24X24 grid that has 24 areas designated as 'mobster hideouts'.  In each of the hideouts a scoring marker (a small cardboard gun inserted into a random scoring base which varies in points from 1,000 to 5,000 points) is placed face down so that none of the players know the values beforehand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player (up to four) is given a set of 30 tiles on which is printed a 'chain' (or in game terms... a police cordon).  Tiles must be placed on the grid so that the 'chain' is continued.  Certain squares on the board provide an additional turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the 'chain' forms a closed loop and encloses one or more 'mobster hideouts', the player who closed the loop takes the scoring markers for all of the hideouts inside the loop.  Placement within the loop is now forbidden and any tiles that exist within the loop are returned to their owner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all 24 hideouts have been surrounded, the player who encircled the last hideout gets 1,000 bonus points.  Players add up the values of all the mobsters that they captured and the one with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
