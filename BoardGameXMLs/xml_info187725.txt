			<description>VersuS is a board game for two to four players. Players take turns moving their pawns around a uniquely designed board, trapping and capturing other players' pawns until there is only one player left on the board, who wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pawns move like castles in chess: up, down, left or right, as far across the board as the player wants, and can also push and pull other pawns or jump over pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With three moves each turn and a new turn after every capture games move quickly and the winner is never clear until near the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
