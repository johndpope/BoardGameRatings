			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing Pictionary may remind you of Charades, but with drawing on paper instead of acting out the answers. In Pictionary, though, both teams' (or even all three teams') clue givers may be drawing at the same time as players strive to be the first to guess the correct answer. When the answer is not designated &amp;quot;All Play,&amp;quot; one team simply tries to come up with the answer before the timer runs out, which is usually but not always possible thanks to the varying difficulty levels of the answers. No great drawing talent is required; instead, players gain an edge if they have a good imagination when guessing, empathy for their team mates, and/or a general ability to communicate in restricted circumstances. A board is provided, just to keep score on, which focuses the competition. Pictionary was a big hit when it first appeared and has been a classic on the party game scene ever since.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version of Pictionary, the beloved game of quick sketches and hilarious guesses, features a different board for faster gameplay. There are also two levels of clues (1,200 adult and 800 junior) so that everyone can play. Designed for 3 or more players. Recommended for ages 8 and over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
