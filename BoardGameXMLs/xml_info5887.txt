			<description>Upbid is billed as a game of Business Strategy and Risk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principle component to the game are 48 cards with two strategies, A and B, cross referenced with the roll of a pair of dice, and a payoff. For example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STRATEGY A: 2-7: -10$, 8-10: +100$, 11-12: +1250$&lt;br/&gt;STRATEGY B: +300$, -100$, -120$&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the basic game players take turns revealing the cards, choosing a strategy, and rolling to see the gain or loss. In the slightly more advanced game each player is allowed to buy partial information on a card, by rolling a single die before committing to a strategy. In the example above partial information costs 90$, and if you bought it then rolled a 6 you would be more inclined to choose strategy A.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the advanced game players take turns revealing cards, and auctioning them off to the other players who then play them against the auctioning player, rather than a bank. Additionally each card has a set indicator, and when you collect six cards in a set you can turn them in for 500$ from each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
