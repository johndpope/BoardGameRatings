			<description>This game in the Ratz Fatz series of educational games for children makes the players run, hop and jump. Like the other Ratz Fatz games, this is a collection of games for kids from 3-12 years that can be played with the same material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: 20 picture tiles (for use on the floor), 20 bracelets, 1 booklet with rules, stories, poems and tasks for different ages&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The picture tiles show vehicles (bike, car, bus, train), furniture (chair, table, bed, closet), animals (dog, cat, horse, cow), toys (doll, ball, building blocks, picture books) and food (apple, bred, salad, pasta).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games that can be played include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Naming and grouping: The children say what's on the tiles, which pictures might go together, or they try to find something that fits a certain description (something made from wood, something that has four legs etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Listen, run and win: The tiles are distributed on the floor. When the game master mentions one of the pictures while reading a story from the game booklet, they have to run to that tile as fast as possible. The player who is the first to stand on the correct tile earns a bracelet, and the player with the most bracelets wins the game. A variant includes jumping from tile to tile instead of running.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Running memory: Similar to 2., but the tiles are played face down and the children have to remember which tile is where.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Throw the tile: The players have to find something to match a description, but they only earn a bracelet if they manage to throw a fitting tile into the bottom of the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
