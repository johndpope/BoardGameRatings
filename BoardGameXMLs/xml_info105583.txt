			<description>In Rollerblade Racer, the player's goal is to win the &amp;quot;super rollerblade challenge.&amp;quot; This game was a budget video game with a suggested retail price of $19.99 in American dollars for the NES version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When roller-skating went out of style with the 1970s, there was a huge void left in the what-to-do-on-Friday-night list of options. But a few years later, a new skating phenomenon took the world by storm: rollerblading. Various events from barrel jumping to half-pipe can be accessed by the player. The full experience can finally be achieved without having to wear pom-poms on the skate laces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will first need to qualify by earning 5,000 points and completing several obstacle courses. These points are earned by performing stunts on suburbs, city streets, beaches, and parks. Additional points are earned by completing the course under the time limit. The main character is Kirk, who brags about purchasing a new pair of rollerskates. Even the game over screen is unusually optimistic for a video game; asking players to &amp;quot;try again&amp;quot; instead of just placing the eight ugly letters &amp;quot;GAME OVER&amp;quot; on to the screen. The best ending in the game even has a typo, where the main character, Kirk, says, &amp;quot;I can't wait wait for us to try again.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The audio driver for this game is the same as Sesame Street: Countdown, which was developed by RSP, Inc. it is likely that Radiance reverse-engineered Countdown and took the audio driver that way, or RSP probably stole Radiance's audio driver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Rollerblade Racer&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
