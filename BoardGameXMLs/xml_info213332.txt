			<description>From the creator's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;16 page booklet, 2 3/4 inches x 4 1/4.&lt;br/&gt;Featuring, as cover art, a photo of Jackson taken by Megann and manipulated digitally by Jackson.&lt;br/&gt;And, furthermore, illustrations selected by Jackson from the depths of the interwebs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a ridiculous hipster sex comedy dice / story / party game. You don&amp;rsquo;t know how to play? I&amp;rsquo;ve known for a while now, like, since before it was cool. It&amp;rsquo;s a turn based monologuing players-roll-dice-against-one-another and add-to-their-character&amp;rsquo;s-appearance-and-hobbies-while-describing-what-they-did-today kinda game. No biggie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 3 &amp;ndash; 5 players.&lt;br/&gt;Plays in 1 &amp;ndash; 2 hours.&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll like it if you like making fun of hipsters, things that hipsters like, joking about sex, talking about sex, rolling dice and making up weirdly specific things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game about flighty, self-obsessed, over-indulged douche bags hooking up with one another night after night at a bar where they hang out. They&amp;rsquo;re in their twenties and thirties, annoyingly hott, and really really into their individual internal monologues that they tell themselves about themselves. You play one of them for a few days. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll even hook up with the singer of that band that everybody&amp;rsquo;s talking about. Oh, you don&amp;rsquo;t know that band? Well, they&amp;rsquo;re pretty alright. I mean, their early stuff was better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
