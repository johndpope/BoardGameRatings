							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Boulder Greenbelt</name>
									
			<description>Boulder Greenbelt is a game themed around life in the city of Boulder, Colorado. Spaces on the game board resemble actual places within the city and each space does something for or to the player akin to its real life counterpart.&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game players roll a die twice to determine their starting bankroll. This bankroll is not denoted by any type of token and is instead to be remembered in the players head or on paper. This is important as any player may contest a players bankroll at any time in the game and if it is found to be faulty that player suffers a punishment. Once all players have their bankroll play beings and each player rolls a die to move the indicated number of spaces and take the actions on the space on which they land.&lt;br/&gt;A player wins when they achieve &amp;quot;Nirvanna&amp;quot; which can be achieved by a number of different means as they pass the 9th street bridge space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
