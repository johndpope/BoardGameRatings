							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bedlam Cards: Unexpected Mini Expansion</name>
									
			<description>The Unexpected Mini Expansion was offered to Kickstarter backers in an update just as the base game was getting ready to ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the layout of our printing there was a very small amount of space left on one of the sheets. So we went ahead and made a mini-expansion utilizing works of classic Mike Foxall art. AN EXPANSION BEFORE THERE IS EVEN A GAME, YOU ASK? Haha, we say, because we are mad. No, seriously, we had the space - why not use it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus we are proud to bring you the 'Unexpected Mini Expansion'!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evil Knievette - The only card that can take things from the Ditch! What a Buddy.&lt;br/&gt;Sensual Simon - This troll who just wants to come in for &amp;quot;a coffee&amp;quot;. He's one sexy Enemy.&lt;br/&gt;Story Time - During this Event Uncle Morty tells truly terrifying tales.&lt;br/&gt;Lynched By Witches - Something isn't right with this Ordeal. Shouldn't we be lynching the witches?&lt;br/&gt;Think About Feet - An Effect to make your opponents think too much about feet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will bundle it with your game, so do it now before we send your game. There are less of these available than there are Bedlamites, so first come, first AWESOME. Second come, second MISSES OUT AND CRIES IN A CORNER LIKE A MINI EXPANSION-LESS LOSER.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
