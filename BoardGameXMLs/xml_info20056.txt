			<description>Only one objective for everyone: become the Master of the World. Two ways to achieve this goal: destroy the planet or build a better world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose the way of destruction and start-up an arms race: escadrilles, missiles, atomic bombs... Do not neglect any possibility!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose construction and develop the equitable trade: if you receive the Nobel Prize of peace, you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But whatever your choice, you will have to inevitably exploit richnesses, to negotiate with WTO and avoid the stock exchange crashes. You will be in trouble and you will face virus, scandals, guerrillas. Nothing will be saved to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will have to vote for resolutions with WTO concerning of the countries located at the other end of the world, whereas yourself directly do not seem to be implied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't be blind! To become the Master of the world, it is necessary to introduce you into the international businesses, create a network of alliances and partnerships, because if you are not with a player, you are against him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, do not forget that to win, it is necessary to be the last in race. These alliances cannot be eternal... Keep you to reveal your strategy with your partners, preserve your secret charts and be careful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
