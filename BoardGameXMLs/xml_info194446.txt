							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Path of Villains</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's So Good to be Bad! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Villains are key figures in establishing the story of a world, but great villains are more than just statistics. Path of Villains brings you essential advice on creating and staging your villain, crafting a personality and theme that will make your players hate this guy's guts, creating their motivation, method, and means of being bad and marking every malevolent milestone along the way. On top of that, Path of Villains also offers a wealth of mechanical options to keep your villains one step ahead of the heroes, always prepared for your players and their dirty tricks, and even when they fall it's never the end. Path of Villains supplements the mythic ranks and tiers introduced in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Mythic Adventures and introduces a brand-new villain path, filled out with almost three dozen brand-new mythic path abilities from apparent demise to your children's children. Craft legendary and memorable villains with a blood pact or subtle chains of bondage, menace your heroes with bloodtheft and anunspeakable name, and make sure your villain is prepared for the worst as a clone arranger, undying hatred, or back from the grave.  If you want to create villains that can stand up to mythic heroes and leave an indelible mark on your campaign, pick up Path of Villains and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
