			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Once upon a time there was a land of numbers.&lt;br/&gt;The inhabitants counted everything they saw. They knew that there was one sun, three hills and twelve sunflowers. However there came the day when they had counted everything that could be counted in the land of numbers, and they became very sad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's when the little grasshopper remembered an arithmetic game his grandfather used to play with him. He invited the inhabitants in the land of numbers to play with him. So they competed with the little grasshopper, counting and jumping.&lt;br/&gt;Up until today this is the favorite game of all the inhabitants in the land of numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dear Parents and Educators:&lt;br/&gt;The game Grasshopper in the land of numbers combines, in a playful way, the physical activity with the learning of numbers. The games stimulate motor skills and acquaint the children, depending on their age and the variation chosen, with the numbers 1 to 10. For children a little older they offer a first approach to adding and subtracting. For the games, it is not always important that there is a winner. Children often have fun resolving a task together.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
