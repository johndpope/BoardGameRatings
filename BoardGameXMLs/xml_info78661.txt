							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Age Of Sail II: Privateer&#039;s Bounty</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Privateer's Bounty: Age of Sail II&amp;quot; immerses players into the era of sailing, a time when shipbuilding hadn't quite reached it's pinnacle but the spirit of the age and the wonder of recent innovations in sailing technology inspired nautical heroes. The romantic world of sea adventures, political intrigue, piracy and massive ocean battles, ancient sea customs and a first glimpse into a future epoch - these are only fragments of the multi-faceted universe of &amp;quot;Privateer's Bounty&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game expands upon the sailing tactical simulation concept, using Age of Sail II as its launching point for innovation. This solid foundation makes &amp;quot;Privateer's Bounty&amp;quot; the ideological successor of this remarkable game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player mission objectives vary from the total annihilation of the enemy to brutal fort assaults, from &amp;quot;capture the flagship&amp;quot; to fleeing from an enemy-seized bay. Experienced players will note changes to the fleet control system, battle conducting principles, networking and several other aspects of the game. These changes result in a deeper emergence into the game and, as a consequence, a popular alignment towards the sphere of tactical real-time games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dynamic, intuitive unit interface simplifies the control of large squadrons. New damage calculation algorithms have been specially optimized for the needs of a dynamic tactical game. This enables a realistic battle situation to be simulated with precision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've analyzed the suggestions of our sea-strategy game fans when designing the game interface. As a result, the new interface allows for individual adjustment of windows arrangements and numerous hot key customizations. Additional game adjustment options allow the player to tune the game for computers of any configuration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The single-player game includes three large campaigns based on some of the historical events of the 19th century. While the campaigns are grounded in a historical context, the design emphasis is placed upon the unique spirit of each epoch. In one campaign, the player may set off in search of an expedition that has mysteriously disappeared in the northern sea. In another campaign, they may be seeking out the gold of the notorious pirate F. Dreik.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Privateer's Bounty&amp;quot; features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Over 2000 ships and 11 nations&lt;br/&gt;    * 20+ battle unit types, including steamships, submarines, and an air balloon&lt;br/&gt;    * 3 military campaigns&lt;br/&gt;    * Over 20 single-scenario battles&lt;br/&gt;    * Advanced multiplayer mode, with up to 16 players via LAN or Internet with Game Spy Arcade service support&lt;br/&gt;    * Session-based network mode allowing new players to join in the action&lt;br/&gt;    * Customization options that include the use of your own name and flag in network games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
