							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Raven of the Scythe Fantasy Role Playing Game</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Raven of the Scythe?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game takes a lot of the &amp;quot;standard fantasy tropes&amp;quot; and dials them back just a bit to hopefully create a more grounded experience without going full on &amp;quot;grim-dark&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;dark and gritty&amp;quot;. Your characters are powerful, but always vulnerable. There aren't rules for bloody disembowlment, but at the same time your characters could be seriously injured by something like falling off a horse or something like that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, Who should play Raven of the Scythe? &lt;br/&gt;Anyone who wants to play in a slighly more grounded version of a fantasy RPG than is the standard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do you play Raven of the Scythe?&lt;br/&gt;It has a pretty simple system where you roll 2d10 and add some modifiers to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Kind of characters can you play in Raven of the Scythe?&lt;br/&gt;Any type really, I tried to make the various fantasy archetypes all available and fairly balanced against each other so that everyone can feel like they are contributing something to the game, even if that something isn't raw combat skills. You can be a warrior, thief, bard, priest, as well as practice any of six different schools of magic. Exactly what you play is up to you though, as there are no classes or anything, you are pretty free to mix and match skills and abilities however you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
