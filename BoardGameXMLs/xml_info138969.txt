							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Old School Spells</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old School Spells is designed for players of pen and paper RPG games who like the old-school rules better than the new ones! Great for players who love the magic-oriented classes but find it a pain to constantly flip through spell listings to find the spell they want to use. All the spells are here for Magic Users, Clerics, Druids, and Illusionists, in an easy to use reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All spells are also added to a database so that spell names are searchable in a snap!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now including a completely customizable spellbook that knows how many spells a day you get, allows you to pick from just the spells you have in your personal book, and remembers what you have cast!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally designed with tablets in mind but we find it completely usable on a phone - particularly with that search function!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
