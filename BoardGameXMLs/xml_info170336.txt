			<description>Two monkey pirates engage in a tough dialectic struggle to get the last box of bananas that survived the shipwreck. But this time they will need to have his tongue sharper than his sword...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARRRH! Is a fast, tense and addictive memory game for 2 players upon 7 years old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must distribute the shipwreck cards around the board and place the pirate marker in the middle of it.&lt;br/&gt;In turns, one player must raise a wooden grog card, where he will meet with the offense that has to perform to the other player, who must find between the wreckage the answer to that offense. In case of luck, the procedure is to repeated and advance the track approaching it to the player lifting the offense. Otherwise the roles are exchanged.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one of them leaves the board overboard!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
