			<description>Kung Fu Rider, previously known as Slider, is an upcoming 2010 action video game for the PlayStation 3. The game is developed by Japan Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for use with the new PlayStation Move controller. It was officially unveiled at the 2010 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. It will be released in September 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take the role of Tobio or Karin in the game, Tobio is a typical white-collar office worker while Karin is his secretary who has to escape from the Triads in Hong Kong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have to utilize the Move controller to navigate through the crowded streets of Hong Kong on a sliding office chair. Players can move the controller up and down to increase speed while tilting it left and right would turn the chair while tapping the Move button would cause the character to spin and kick items out of the way. Players can cruise through the streets hopping over cars, juke left, right and pick up money along the way which act as points in the game and sliding through onscreen ticket outlines which will boost the game's meter which can trigger a burst of speed by jabbing at the PlayStation Eye.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features realistic physics similar to the PlayStation Network game, Pain, where players will fly off the chair and crash in slow motion if the players loses the game. As players proceed deeper into the game, Yakuza enemies begin appearing on the way and attempt to attack the player using B≈ç staffs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Kung Fu Rider&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
