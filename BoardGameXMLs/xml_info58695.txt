			<description>The idea of this game is to teach children about the inequality of the world and the idea of development work in third world countries. The game takes place in a fantasy world of insects that is secretly ruled by the evil Tyrant and his sidekick Niljake (Slimy). In the beginning, the insect realms have different amounts of resources; some are poor while some have plenty. The poorest player, being the most desperate and thus also bravest, starts. The game is a mix of co-operative and individual play, as typically the players can only advance on the board by sharing their income. Likewise, the draconian measures of the Tyrant usually affect all the players and not just the intended victim. The idea is to expose the Tyrant and fill everyone's resources, and the winner is the player who accomplishes the second goal after the first one has already been accomplished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three types of resource are: Food &amp;amp; Water, Money &amp;amp; Wealth, Education &amp;amp; Rights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The insect realms are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Dunghill of the Beetles&lt;br/&gt;2. Spiders' Webbery&lt;br/&gt;3. Butterfly Valley&lt;br/&gt;4. Beeland&lt;br/&gt;5. Castle Ladybug &lt;br/&gt;6. Mosquito Swamp&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has been designed and published by the humanitarian organization UFF Finland with Tactic's help. The title translates literally as 'Draw' (as in a game with shared victory).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
