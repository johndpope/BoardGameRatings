							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Burrowing Dead</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The village of Greenhill is the birthplace of the paladin Gedrick Averness. Averness gained fame fighting the Lich King&amp;rsquo;s forces when the undead first made strikes against the empire in this age. He held off a legion of zombies with his mace Purifier. Gedrick Averness fell just before the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s army arrived to finish off the undead horde and save the town Gedrick had given his life protecting. Gedrick was returned to the village of his birth, where he was placed in a family tomb, and Purifier was displayed in a glass case in the village church.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of late, the graves in the Greenhill graveyard have begun to be mysteriously emptied. The first sign of this is a grave taking on a sunken appearance. Upon unearthing, the grave is found empty. Recently, and even more disturbing, villagers have disappeared without a trace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Burrowing Dead is meant for 2nd level characters using the 13th Age role-playing game. Reference the 13th Age book to balance encounters by number of players. The scenario itself means to be an open setting with adventure potential, allowing flexible, collaborative, non-linear play. Feel free to change anything to better suit your needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
