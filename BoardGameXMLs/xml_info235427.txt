			<description>Tanto Cuore: Doki Doki Beach Volleyball is a quick fifteen minute two-player spin off game to the Tanto Cuore series. Featuring new art from Tanto Cuore artists, Doki Doki Beach Volleyball takes a few maids from Romantic Vacation on another adventure! Laura, Adorianna, Fea and Valencia have taken a day off and hit the beach to play a quick and easy combat beach volleyball game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two players will battle their teams against one another to become queens of the net! Each player is dealt character cards, action cards and attack/spike cards. Taking turns, the players will play special actions and make attacks against the opposing team trying to score points. Whoever wins the most of 3 rounds wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
