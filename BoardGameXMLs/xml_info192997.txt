			<description>Killer Snails: Assassins of the Sea is a deck-building game in which the players are scientists collecting predatory cone snails that prey on fish, worms and other mollusks. The type of snail determines its strength and the type of prey eaten, and the snails produce different peptides.  To win the game, the player must build a venom arsenal of the correct peptide toxin combinations- much as the marine biochemist who co-created the game does. The winning combination of peptides always changes as it is drawn at the beginning of each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to a starter deck for each player, cards may be purchased from a card market. Cards with scientific events ranging from &amp;quot;research&amp;quot;, which provides a peek at part of the solution, to &amp;quot;tsunami&amp;quot;, which shifts all the prey cards on the table, offer strategic opportunities for victory. Additionally a variety of predators may be deployed to attack the competition's snails. The game offers a dynamic play experience in which players have to react and adjust their strategy accordingly&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win Killer Snails: Assassins of the Sea, you must out-strategize your opponents to build a venom cocktail that matches the venom cocktail created at the beginning of the game. This game was designed in collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
