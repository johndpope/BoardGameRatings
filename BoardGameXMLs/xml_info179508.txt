			<description>Are you brave or are you chicken? Play Chicken Out, a fast game of risk taking and second guessing.&lt;br/&gt; Play the turtle and mosey along. Play the frog and take a big leap. But beware the snakes and the vultures!&lt;br/&gt;Chicken Out is a game for 2-6 players and is recommended for players of at least 8 years old&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game players secretly choose a character to play each turn and then take a die roll and advance on the track.  The die rolls become riskier every turn and the characters that other players choose can change the results of the turn. Players may decide to chicken out and score points, but the player who is furthest along when they chicken out gets the most points. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
