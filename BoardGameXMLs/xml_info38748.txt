							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elan Deluxe</name>
									
			<description>Elan Deluxe is the latest version of Phillip A. Jones' tactical Napoleonic miniatures wargaming rules.  Elan is designed to have each player controlling roughly an augmented division of troops.  &lt;br/&gt;&amp;Eacute;lan Deluxe is the latest and final evolution of these tactical-level Napoleonic wargame rules designed for 15-25 mm miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Deluxe version also includes campaign rules Etat-Major, new optional rules, and also included in the rules are extensive unit ratings for over twenty nations and over 40 Army lists for every nation that took part in the conflict including multiple theatres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;Eacute;lan is a flowing game that accurately reflects historical tactics. Players are placed &amp;quot;on the table&amp;quot; and granted wide historical latitude to control their units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules sequence features both simultaneous and alternate actions, resulting in an intuitive and balanced game that captures the feel of the period strongly. Individual units represented are the battalion and regiment and players can do sub-unit actions such as company and squadron actions. Players can use any basing system and the default scale is 1:50, but players can use any ratio such as 1:20 or 1:60.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a game that replicates the tactics of the period and enables gamers to play the period and not get bogged down in complex rules! The game can also be adapted for other Horse and Musket periods from the SYW to the Crimea War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will appeal to players who enjoy tactical nuance and want a game that grows with them in subtlety and tactical complexity. &amp;Eacute;lan is written in a clear, concise style. The rules are well indexed, logically laid out and easy to comprehend.  The PDF file also has bookmarks for ease of navigation and players can print out just the sections that interest them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
