			<description>Mix &amp;amp; Match ABC is a self-correcting matching game designed to teach the alphabet and reading.  It consists of a series of matching cards, one side with a letter and word printed on it, and the other with a corresponding picture.  The cards have a puzzle piece edge, and each card only fits its pair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two possible ways to play.  One is called Match Out.  In this game, cards are placed face-down and each player draws an equal number.  The first player places the top tile on their stack face-up.  Each player in turn then turns up his or her top tile.  If it matches any of the turned-up tiles, the player matches them, puts them aside, and turns up the next tile in his or her stack.  This continues until no matches are made, and play passes to the next player.  The first player to eliminate his or her stack wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ABC Rummy, letter and picture tiles are places in separate piles.  Players take turns drawing from either stack until they all have four tiles in their hand.  If any players have matches, they may lay them down immediately.  Each player then draws a tile from either pile and tries to match it to tiles in their hand.  If there is a match, they are put aside and the player may draw again.  If not, the player may keep up to four tiles and must discard any others face-up in the middle of the table.  Further players may draw from either the piles or the face-up tiles, making as many matches as possible.  Play continues until one player has five pairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
