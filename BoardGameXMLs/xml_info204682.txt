			<description>From the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think of a person whose inner world you want to explore. I suggest keeping her or him fairly ordinary, the extraordinary elements will come easily from the inner world. If you are finding it difficult to think of someone, think of some of the people you've encountered in passing recently and make your person a fictionalized version. All you need is a name and a short description which you write as the first entry&lt;br/&gt;in your People List.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then think about your vision of the inner world. What will it look like? A fantasy kingdom, a skyspanning tree, a giant city, or even a heavily populated galaxy? From here you can pick the number of cardinal directions for your map. Two for a giant tower. Three or four or even more for a vast land or dream city, and six for space where you squish up and down into the plane of the map. You can also start thinking about whether your inner world has more layers than the one your map represents. You won't need to make that decision yet, but if you already know one way or another it simplifies things as&lt;br/&gt;you go on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
