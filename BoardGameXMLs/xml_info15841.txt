			<description>This simple track game was released in 1928 as part of a four-game set including Ludo (i.e. Pachisi), Checkers, and Backgammon. The board depicts a colorful racetrack with illustrated obstructions. On your turn, you roll a die and move ahead the number indicated. There are five obstructions on the track, such as &amp;quot;REPLENISH OIL&amp;quot; etc., representing two spaces, all of which must be jumped in the progress of the game. If your roll would land you on an obstruction, you lose your turn instead. The first player to circle the track and cross the Finish Line wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
