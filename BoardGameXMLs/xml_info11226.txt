			<description>The object of When Good Neighbors Go Bad is to aggravate all of your neighbors sufficiently that they sell their houses an move out of the neighborhood. Game play proceeds with the players going to work, making purchases (with the intent of inflaming their nosy neighbors), and engaging in anti-social activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each person is assigned a specific neighbor-type and each has a special ability:&lt;br/&gt;The Po' White Trash - can burn any item they possess at the end of the turn (the more smell the more aggravation).&lt;br/&gt;The Yuppies - can call the cops once each turn on any other player for no apparent reason.&lt;br/&gt;The Old Farts - are able to make any single item illegal at the end of their turn.&lt;br/&gt;The Danged Furiners - can barbecue the neighbors pets.&lt;br/&gt;The Psycho Neighbors - can shoot up to four items anywhere on the board.&lt;br/&gt;The Eco-Nazis - do not require a vehicle to move around the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
