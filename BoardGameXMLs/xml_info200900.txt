			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hexbox is a portmanteau of two well-established tabletop gaming terms, the Hex-Crawl and the Sandbox. A Sandbox Game is one in which minimal restrictions are placed upon the players, enabling them to go forth and interact with the setting as they see fit. A Hex-Crawl is a type of RPG adventure in which players explore the wilderness through a map divided into hexes, that allows a systematic method to providing things for the players to discover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Put them together and you get a Hexbox, a structured approach to exploratory tabletop gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book, in particular, describes a system to run and play these exploratory adventures as a campaign structure, simplifying the record keeping involved. While designed for use with Dungeons and Dragons, 5th edition, it is easily adaptable for play with nearly any system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Book&lt;br/&gt;- Chapter One, Introduction, covers the basic elements of what a Hexbox campaign is.&lt;br/&gt;- Chapter Two, Running the Hexbox, provides the GM with the systems and procedures he can use to run a Hexbox campaign.&lt;br/&gt;- Chapter Three, Playing the Hexbox, is intended to be shared with players as a guide to this sort of gaming.&lt;br/&gt;- Chapter Four, Building the Hexbox, gives DMs instructions and advice where it comes to designing a Hexbox style campaign.&lt;br/&gt;- Appendix A, Example Hexbox, provides a mini-hexbox campaigns, fully ready for play, that DMs can either use and expand themselves, or use as a basis for their own games.&lt;br/&gt;- Appendix B covers adapting these rules for use with other game systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
