			<description>Description of the game from the Spielbox:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resi and Rudi Ringel, the two young caterpillars, were brought to life by Brigitte Pokornik. Resi and Rudi want to know which of them is faster! Ready, set, go: The race over stick and stone is on. On a player's turn, he rolls the die. The end of the caterpillar is always placed ahead of the head, so long as the color collar is ahead as well. Then, the caterpillar's head is moved to that color. If a player rolls a color that the head is already on, then he may put a barrier up in front of the other caterpillar. That player must now navigate past the barrier. As soon as a caterpillar touches the goal flag, the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
