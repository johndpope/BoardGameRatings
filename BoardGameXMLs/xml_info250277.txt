							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1975: A Card Game for 2 About the Cold War</name>
									
			<description>Do you remember the seventies of the previous century? In those days, world politics were a simple thing. There were two superpowers, who lurked at each other in deep distrust and emphasized their ideological contrasts, and a third one, who stood aside with no emotions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nevertheless, World War III was never a real option. But both the USA and the USSR were always keen to harm each other in the Third World, and to drag every dingle despot to the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; side. Both giants wanted to have governments of their favor everywhere in charge as long as possible -- in order to draw out as much as possible of there wealth of all these countries...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this two-player card game, players use a set of action cards to win control and influence in countries around the world. Yellow &amp;quot;China Chips&amp;quot; play a special neutralizing role. The aim is to win the most money by winning the sympathies of the other countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was self published by Franz Benno-Delonge years before Twilight Struggle. When Twilight Struggle appeared with such immense (and deserved) support, Benno-Delonge produced a few more copies of 1975 for those interested in another approach at this interesting time period in world politics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
