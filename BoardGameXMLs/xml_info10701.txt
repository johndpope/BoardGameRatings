			<description>The objective of this game is that as each player obtains sponsorship money they must invest it to build a Formula One racing team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do this, the players complete four laps of the Game Board before entering the first Grand Prix. Whenever a player lands on Car, Engine, Engineer or Driver squares, they can purchase these various elements to form a racing team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a team has been formed, players then complete one lap of The Jigsaw Board. The Jigsaw board consists of six double-sided track sections, which can be combined in various ways to create all sixteen circuits around which the players will race. Clever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move their cars around each circuit in procession. No dice rolls. The mechanics of racing come from overtaking lanes, which are positioned at critical points around the track. To overtake and improve your race position, you move your car into an overtaking lane and draw an overtaking card for either a straight and a corner. These cards list different elements that must be compared to the car you are overtaking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, You succeed if CAR + ENGINE + ENGINEER ratings are higher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the crux of the game. If you have assembled a team with high ratings then overtaking will succeed and therefore your team will succeed.&lt;br/&gt;Whoever has the highest points after 16 races wins the championship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
