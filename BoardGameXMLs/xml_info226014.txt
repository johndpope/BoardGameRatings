			<description>Each player begins with 4 cards depicting a friend or follower. The object of the game is to be the first to get rid of those cards. Phone and notification cards are flipped one at a time from a central deck. The first player to slap the deck when two phone cards are flipped consecutively loses one of his friends or followers. A notification card requires players to compete in various battles, such as writing a humorous response to a hashtag. The winner of a battle loses one of his cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
