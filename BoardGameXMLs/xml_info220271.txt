			<description>&amp;quot;For our friend and her new beginning...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Balloon is a colorful game dedicated to friendship. Balloon features a color-friendly Cards and peaceful feelings with a sky background and lots of balloon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Balloon has 2 modes of gameplay; party mode and couple mode. Party Mode is the easier and more fun mode of the game, where players need to make a balloon party merrier by adding confetti (flip Balloon Cards from clear side to confetti side) and by doing so they also sabotaging other players in a fun way. Meanwhile, in Couple Mode, players are required to use strategy to make sure they can fill their board faster or get higher Victory Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On both Party Mode and Couple Mode, winners are determined by most Victory Points, but how they acquire it is different. On Party Mode, Victory Points are distributed at random but on Couple Mode are based on how they perform on their player board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are one unique way to end the game, each time a player trade their resource to a Balloon Card, one resource has to be discarded, if there are 5 cards discarded with same color, the game immediately ends and Victory Points counted!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
