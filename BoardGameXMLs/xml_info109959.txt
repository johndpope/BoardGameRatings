			<description>Race game which tries to be original in that you have two pieces (an animal and a rider) you can consider moving after you have thrown the die. After both pieces have started separately, the players must get their two pieces together on the same square. Once achieved, you can move both as one unit because you cannot win whilst your two pieces are apart.&lt;br/&gt;First to the end of the track with rider mounted on animal, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
