			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters' lives have gone through significant change in a very short period of time. The world has been plunged into absolute anarchy due to the rise of the Living Dead. Cities have crumbled and governments have fallen. The military as they once knew it is a thing of the past, and lawlessness rules the landscape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Determined to make it to the Citizen Relocation Zone in Colorado- a promised infection-free haven established by the remnants of the Federal Government- the characters now find themselves the de facto leaders of a growing convoy of survivors composed of families, children, pregnant women, and abandoned military personnel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are they ready for such a burden? Can they look beyond their own survival, and to the well being of those that have come to depend on them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And when tragedy again strikes, will they have what it takes to hold everyone together?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
