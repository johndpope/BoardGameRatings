			<description>Each player starts with the tip of the nose of their own crocodile (4 different colors). The rest of the crocodiles are mixed and turned face down between the players. Youngest players starts by rolling the special die, which has 4 sad faces and 2 crocodiles. If the player rolls a crocodile, he may immediately start trying to collect his crocodile, by turning over a piece. The pieces have to match both color and place, although you will alway have two end of your crocodile open. If the piece match the player picks it, otherwise he has to turn it back. The player may continue to turn over pieces until another player rolls the crocodile. So you will always have one player collecting his crocodile, while the rest are rolling the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever finishes their crocodile first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
