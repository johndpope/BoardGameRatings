			<description>The game consists of 108 letter cards valued 1-4 and a simple board (a score pad is also included).  Players start with a hand of 7 cards, then take turns adding one card to the front or back of the word being formed on the board, drawing a new card from the deck at the end of each turn.  A player who cannot add a card that makes a legal word fragment must &amp;quot;Take My Word&amp;quot; and put all the played cards into a penalty stack.  The game ends when the deck runs out; lowest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
