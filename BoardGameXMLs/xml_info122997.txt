			<description>From the Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Big Game Hunter 5, you can experience the hunt of a lifetime without leaving your home. Plus, you'll experience a realistic hunting simulation because it actually uses live-action video.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunting destinations include Arizona, British Columbia, Louisiana and Wyoming. Stalk and hunt 17 different animals including mule deer, whitetail, bear, moose, elk, turkey, pronghorn and caribou. The new varmint hunting option lets you test your skill on raccoons, rabbits, squirrels, coyotes and possums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose from a variety of weapons--16 different firearms with 23 ammunition types or high-tech compound bows. Hunt with a wide assortment of authentic Cabela's gear including calls, decoys, maps, a GPS, adjustable scopes, binoculars, and rangefinders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Move freely between first and third person perspective hunting with the movable hunting blind and tree stand. Place decoys, practice shooting at video targets or even make your own hunting maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three hunt modes: Quick Hunt - bag one trophy; Challenge Hunt - complete a series of mission-based levels of increasing difficulty; or Campaign Hunt - a complete hunting extravaganza. However you choose, you'll have the unique thrill of taking aim at live-action video taken on actual hunts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes:&lt;br/&gt;Regions&lt;br/&gt;Live Action Video&lt;br/&gt;Varmint Hunting for the First Time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
