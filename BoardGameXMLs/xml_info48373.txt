							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mysterious Tower</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Adventure for Character Levels 3-5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A world of heroism and epic adventure lives inside each of us. We can all imagine a world where stalwart knights battle ancient dragons, powerful wizards duel one another with mighty magics, and the brave-of-heart rescue mystic artifacts from the clutches of evil villains. With the Castles &amp;amp; Crusades roleplaying game from Troll Lord Games, you can take the role of a hero seeking adventure in a fantastic world populated by mythic creatures and legendary beasts. Or, as the Castle Keeper, you can design the worlds and stories that make up the game, guiding friends and fellow gamers through epic adventures in your own wondrous settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mysterious Tower was first released as a d20 module in the Dungeon Crawl Classics line. Now this classic adventure is available in an officially licensed Castles &amp;amp; Crusades edition! Specially authorized by Troll Lord Games, The Mysterious Tower is a classic fantasy adventure perfect for a C&amp;amp;C campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters come across an ancient wizard's tower. The nearby keep has been reduced to rubble over the ages, but the tower is in perfect condition. It is surrounded by an impenetrable force field that cannot be breached - not even by the ghost of the long-dead wizard, who has been trapped within for centuries. Surely there must be great treasure within this magical abode. But how to get to it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
