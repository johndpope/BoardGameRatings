			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What it is:&lt;br/&gt;Killer Dice is a quick and easy dice rolling game for two or more people that plays in less than 10 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you get:&lt;br/&gt;Killer Dice comes with 6 dice of different colors, 2 sets of dice labels (in case things get messy), 5 red damage counters, directions, and a drawstring bag to hold all your goodies together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you do:&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a single turn of five rolls of the included dice. After each roll, the rolling player may choose to use one rolled special ability to affect the roll results or damage the Killer Die. They then remove any eliminated victim dice from the game. The player then rolls again until they either complete five rolls, run out of victim dice, or chase off the Killer Die by dealing at least 5 damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How you win:&lt;br/&gt;After each player has taken their turn of five rolls, the player with the most surviving victim dice is declared the winner. In case of a tie, the player who also dealt the most damage to the Killer Die wins. If no player has any surviving dice, the Killer Die wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
