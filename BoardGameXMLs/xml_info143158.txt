			<description>Objective: be the first getting all of the meeples in your home base on board of the Zeppelin&lt;br/&gt; - acting by turns -&lt;br/&gt;each player starts with 6 meeples, placed on her/his home base;&lt;br/&gt;roll the die: if it shows a 1 - 5, place one of your meeples onto the correspondent waiting position; with a '6' it ends up with a safe seat in the cabin. Turn ends after a '6' or if all waiting positions are occupied; if not - it's up to the active player to roll the die again.But if a waiting position is occupied you must take that meeple and put it into your home base.&lt;br/&gt;remarks:&lt;br/&gt;published ~1920/30s&lt;br/&gt;due to the fact that these kind of games were played for money players must 'bought into'; before the game started they had to draw a chip - top was neutral, reverse was yellow or (in one case) black. The lucky one (socalled fare dodger) got her/his stake back at the end of the game - no matter what position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
