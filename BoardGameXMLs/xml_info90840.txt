			<description>Sushi High Battle is a game about colors, faces, and racing to the top of some ambiguous track of colors. Yes, by battle I mean race!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sushi High Battle consists of 10 custom dice with multiple colors per die. Each is marked with a face that corresponds with a color. Also, each die has a number which indicates the turn in which you may roll it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed for 2-5 players but more may join in the fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to have the most pieces on the board, in the highest places of each colored track, after all 10 dice have been rolled by all of the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
