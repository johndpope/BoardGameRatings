			<description>Vampires are running rampant and you are the world's only hope.  Players create teams of vampire hunters in a race to hunt the most vampires.  The trick is you only have two actions on your turn.  In order to gain extra actions you must help equip your opponents hunters, giving them a leg up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Nocturnal, cards can be used in three ways.  As currency to hire and build hunters and bases to your team.  As equipment to help your hunters ready for the hunt.  And as Hunters, bases or artifacts for your team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can take two actions on their turn.  Actions are; draw a card, hire a hunter, build a base, equip a hunter, or kill a vampire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To hire a hunter, a player discards cards equal to the hunter's level.  Same with building a base.  A player can equip either their own or an opponents hunter.  When equipping an opponents hunter, players will gain extra actions according to the hunter equipped.  To successfully kill a vampire, a player's team must be properly equipped with weapons and hunter types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a race to kill vampires, with the amount needed to end the game scaling for player count.  After the last vampire is killed players tally their points from killed vamps and hunters, bases and artifacts in their team.  The player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;113 Cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 55 Hunter cards&lt;br/&gt; - 24 Vampire cards&lt;br/&gt; - 10 Artifact cards&lt;br/&gt; - 8 Bases cards&lt;br/&gt; - 8 Starting Hunter cards&lt;br/&gt; - 4 Starting Base cards&lt;br/&gt; - 4 Action player reference cards&lt;br/&gt; - 1 double sided rule sheet&lt;br/&gt; - 1 double sided card summary sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
