			<description>This game is distantly related to the Mill game or Nine Men's Morris, in that the object is to make alignments of three pieces: each such alignment created removes one opposing piece (miller's choice).  You win when you've reduced the opponent to two pieces or put him in such a bind that he cannot move.  If both players become immobilized, a draw occurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 5&amp;times;6 board is set up by both players by plunking down each of their 12 pieces alternately.  Strategy is crucial during this phase.  The only restriction is that alignments of three cannot be formed during this phase.  Once all pieces are set up, on your turn you move one of your pieces one space horizontally or vertically (diagonals aren't allowed or considered).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategies are alluded to but not explained in the short rules.  Shan Ruwa (&amp;quot;to drown&amp;quot;) consists of setting up so as to force the opponent to place in positions that will aid the starting player and drown the opponent.  Conversely, Turi (&amp;quot;to push&amp;quot;) prevents the starting player from forming alignments and makes his opening move bad for him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mill is called here Doki (&amp;quot;galloping horse&amp;quot;).  It is a combination of five pieces such that you form an alignment on each leg of the back-and-forth motion of the fifth piece.  The game terms are all taken from Hausa, a West-African language (presumably the first author's maternal tongue).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
