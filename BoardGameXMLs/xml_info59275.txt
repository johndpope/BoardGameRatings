							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prellus</name>
									
			<description>Prellus is a game of tactics played on a 4x7 grid of red, yellow, and blue squares.  Each player controls seven pawns (one green pawn and two each of red, yellow, and blue) which begin the game in a standard formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players alternate turns, moving a single pawn during each of their turns.  Pawns can move a single space at a time (diagonally or orthogonally), but may never be moved into a space of their color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any number of pawns may occupy a square.  Pawns are never removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has no green squares, so a player's green pawn may occupy any space; however, a green pawn may not be moved into a space already occupied by two or more pawns, or by the opponent's green pawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player loses the game if his green pawn is ever in a space occupied by ANY two or more other pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
