			<description>Shrek and Donkey crosses the country to free Princess Fiona captured by the Dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in two phases. &lt;br/&gt;In first phase players walk around the board to recover the weapons needed to face the dragon and to free the princess. &lt;br/&gt;In second phase they recover 6 objects (flowers, poems, balloons, etc..) to protect Fiona before reaching the top of the tower by Lord Farquaad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn, the active player may:&lt;br/&gt;1) move, rolling a die with six faces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) get a random event. Some of these events apply immediately, as the &amp;quot;angry farmers&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;guards&amp;quot;, others may be kept by the player and be used later as &amp;quot;My turn&amp;quot; which allows you to replay a turn or &amp;quot;The onion is good&amp;quot; which wastes a turn the player of your choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) roll a six sided figure, and advance in the number of spaces indicated. The player can move his figure in any direction and by taking any path. If it encounters an event-driven model (brigand, custody, etc..) It solves the encounter, usually on a combat die roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) if the figure reaches a square, the player can perform a search to find items still available. &lt;br/&gt;Depending on the phase in which the player is, he will seek weapons to face the dragon or gifts to seduce the beautiful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player wishes, he can go on the square with dragon to confront it. It will then launch a die which he will add his bonus weapons. If he gets at least 7, the princess is saved. Then begins the second phase. In each round, Lord Farquaad will rise a box in his lap (there are 12 laps). &lt;br/&gt;The first player who gets the 6 gift before the evil Lord marries the nice Princess is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
