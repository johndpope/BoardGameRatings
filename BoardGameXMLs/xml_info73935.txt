			<description>&amp;quot;Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon 2 is the third console installment in the popular Ghost Recon tactical shooter video game series, published by Ubisoft. It is a sequel to Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was released in North America for the Xbox video game console on November 16, 2004, for the PlayStation 2 on November 30, 2004, and reached the GameCube on March 15, 2005. A Windows version was canceled in April 2005 in favor of Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general setting for the game is the Korean Peninsula, however the PS2 and Xbox platforms feature different campaigns. The PS2 campaign occurs in 2007 (tying in with Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory), while the Xbox campaign is set in 2011. The Gamecube version also features the same campaign from the PS2 version. Ghost Recon 2 sports an updated graphics engine, the Havok 2 physics engine, new multiplayer options, voice command ability via microphone. The PS2 version generally received bad reviews, but the Xbox version was met with better reception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all games involving war or conflict between North Korea and South Korea, this game is currently banned in South Korea. The game has been criticized by the North Korean government for its storyline. However, South Korea has recently decided to allow such games to be sold in the interest of freedom of speech, so this game among other games featuring war on the Korean Peninsula may become available there soon.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tom_Clancy's_Ghost_Recon_2,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
