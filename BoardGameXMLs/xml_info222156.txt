			<description>Legends of the Four Kingdoms is a captivating strategy game. Nature, technology, power, magic! Learn how to tame the Four Kingdoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to be played with 2-8 players, you will only need one 40 card deck to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt three cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards in your hand represent the warriors you have control over. After dealing 3 cards to each player, the next card is dealt face up on the playing surface, and the remaining deck is placed face down. This card is the leading/crown Kingdom, and represents the trump suit for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play one card each going clockwise, player to the left of the dealer starts. After playing a card, draw one more card from the face down pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning a hand:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ascending order:  fewest to most soldiers (they are worth 0 points) then the following: Knight (J) with 2 points; War Princess (Q) with 3 points; King (K) with 4; Supreme Warrior (3*) with 10; and the Kingdom's secret weapon worth 11 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If any Leading/Crown Kingdom (trump) has been played, the player who played the highest valued trump wins.  If no Leading/Crown Kingdom (trumps) have been played, the player who played the highest card of the lead suit wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are not required to follow suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the winner of a round is determined, that player collects the played cards, and places them face down in a pile. Each player maintains his/her own pile. Then, each player draws a card from the remaining deck, starting with the player who won the trick, proceeding counter-clockwise. The player who won the round leads the next hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who won the most important battles and has the most points.  There are 120 points total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legends of the Four Kingdoms reimplements the traditional Italian trick-taking game Briscola, with modern artwork and new suits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
