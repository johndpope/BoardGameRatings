			<description>Some history. The vervets monkeys arrived from Africa to the Caribbean island of St. Kitts with slaves of the rum industry 300 years ago. The monkeys that escaped, acquired taste (and addiction) for alcohol eating fermented sugarcane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These funny monkeys, good observers of man, they know, like the locals, that the easiest way to get your daily dose of alcohol is by distracted tourists in the beach bars. They love cocktails, daiquiris, caipirinhas, usually rum-based drinks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In St. Kitts each player is a waiter who is held to be more cocktails (of each type) serving in a beach snack bar, trying to fill their tables of wealthy and thirsty tourists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All actions are carried away and combining results of dice. Refer to vervets monkeys, bartenders and cocktails. If you get a result of blue, red, green or yellow refers to a cocktail. They come in four types: Daikiri strawberries (red cocktail), Caipirinha (green cocktail), Banana colada (yellow cocktail) and Blue Ocean (Blue cocktail). Place a record of your color in a table that asks that cocktail to indicate that you've served you, according to rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each full table you've served more cocktails (you have most) awards (knizian) points to the end of the game. If you can add new tables to serve more tourists you will receive tips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And if that were not enough, we must be aware of groups vervets monkeys in their usual &amp;quot;raids&amp;quot; in search of alcohol miss these tips will make acquired with sweat and tears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PnP (spanish):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://labsk.net/wkr/archives/15870/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://labsk.net/wkr/archives/15870/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://labsk.net/index.php?topic=150531&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://labsk.net/index.php?topic=150531&lt;/a&gt;.0&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
