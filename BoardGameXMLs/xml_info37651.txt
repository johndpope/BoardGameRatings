			<description>You had never seen worms wriggling this way before!&lt;br/&gt;Slide your babies worms in Plasticine at the top of your trunks and watch at them reappearing into grown up worms ready for race !&lt;br/&gt;Throw the die, slip into your trunk as many babies worms as indicated by the die, and presses on the piston. Look at the strange and magnificent worm which goes out of its hole! The bigger the figure you obtain, the more your worm grows and approaches the arrival line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you obtain M.Pic the bird on the die, it is going to fly down on the worm of your opponent and to cut it in two. Good for you, as it an opportunity to take the head of the race and to cross first the finishing line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
