							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Train Station</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An impressive railway station was built in this location where two lines cross. It was built mostly from riveted together cast iron girders with a roof of many small glass panels. One line passes through the station on the ground floor while the other crosses it on the first floor supported by a framework of cast iron girders just as impressive as it is massive. Wooden stairs and walkways allow travellers to  switch platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The girders are kept well polished, just like the marble floor,  and oiled to protect them from corrosion. Only the glass panels of the roof to some degree are always slightly stained by soot from the many steam powered trains frequenting the station every day. During night time the station is illuminated by a small number of gas lamps and a few benches crafted from wood and brass provide a little comfort for travellers that have to wait for their next train.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a train arrives the station comes alive with station personnel crying out the next connections over the general hum of the crowd, passengers hurrying from one platform to another, porters following them with their baggage, food vendors trying to sell their delicacies and policemen trying, often in vain, to keep the less desirable elements of society, like pickpockets, out of the station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
