							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1862: Cedar Mountain</name>
									
			<description>The nineteenth battle in the American Civil Wargames in 3D series. The Confederate Army is countering an advance through Virginia by the newly formed Union Army of Virginia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historically Major General Thomas J &amp;ldquo;Stonewall&amp;rdquo; Jackson attacked the centre of the advancing army and caught the Corp of Major General John Pope. Initially Pope was driving the Confederates back until reserves from Major General A P Hill arrived.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cedar Mountain initially has a time limit of 10 bounds in which the Confederates must attack disperse the Union forces, the game also comes with additional play options. The games design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game within a 2-4 hour period of continuous play. The game gives a flavour of the American Civil War period and a simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit. You don&amp;rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&amp;rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally. The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- information from the Wargame Shop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
