			<description>From the website of the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Market is like Kogge a trading game without money. The game is played in rounds, each round the players produce goods which they try to exchange for goods produced by the other players. Only goods which have been exchanged this way can then be sold for victory points. The exchange value of goods depends from supply and demand and will change from round to round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game Black market has won the 3rd price at the Hippodice game designer contest 2003 as Merkantilismus. There are some small changes to this version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Market will be published during the Essen convention 2008 as a small (110 copies) handmade game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
