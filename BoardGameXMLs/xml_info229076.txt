							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Twilight Sparkle&#039;s Secret Shipfic Folder: Tales of Ponyville University</name>
									
			<description>Ponyville University is to be used with the Core Deck of TSSSF!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twilight Sparkle (Equestria's most prolific and horrific fanfic author) has embarked on a quest to create the perfect YA stories! And who better to act as guinea pi- er&amp;hellip; the stars of her tales, but the young ponies of Ponyville?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join the narrative thread woven by Twilight through ridiculousness, adorableness and maybe even a little romantic horror as she tells&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tales of Ponyville University!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to help fulfill Twilight&amp;rsquo;s dream of writing the perfect fanfics, you take turns expanding the shipping grid, joining new ponies with &amp;ldquo;ship&amp;rdquo; (short for relation&amp;rdquo;ship&amp;rdquo;) cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TSSSF uses three decks of cards: Ponies, Ships and Goals. Players use Ship cards to pair different Ponies together on an expanding grid, earning VP for completing Goal cards for different combinations formed on the grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are the first to make one of Twilight&amp;rsquo;s narrative goals a reality, you earn points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
