			<description>From the back of the box, roughly translated:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At last a game with a future we can pursue: a new world with new qualities. A world without daily work routines, traffic jams, bureaucracy, deforestation, and hunger problems. A world with more exchanges, more experiences, and more human interaction. Better improvements can not be hoped for: more money and more consumption, yet more renunciation. Improvements today which are more friendly to life will produce more cultural riches, and more exchanges between all. This is all with a minimal burden on the environment and a maximum amount of self-determination. Put an end to the monopoly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You choose a new homeland, a new Bolo. Every Bolo has a special way of life and is nearby. The organization of your chosen community needs you to bring it goods. You obtain distinct items during the course of the game. Any surplus produced in your own Bolo is trade able with other players. Every exchange offers a new experience. Also, every visit to another Bolo brings new knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which Bolo should be judged to be first? Last can quickly become first, as when someone has attained a new innovation, it can quickly be shared with the rest of the collective through visits and the cultural exchanges that result!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;bolo' bolo is game designer / Anarchist P.M.'s second foray into political board games, with his first being the cult tile laying favourite Demono. bolo' bolo is based upon the book of the same name which lays out P.M.'s ideal society based upon sub-communities, each autonomous, with an economy fueled by trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components are in both German and French, and are rather archaic with the 'cards' being coloured paper with black ink style drawings, absolutely nothing like Demono's more lush visuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic idea of the title is that each player represents one of the &amp;quot;bolos&amp;quot; on the board, each of which specialises in the production of certain things, and which needs certain others, which is accomplished via trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
