							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeon of Deadliest Evil</name>
									
			<description>The mad sorcerer Grislyk has stolen the Book of Lore from the elves and hidden it in his dungeon lair. As the elven warrior maiden Kora, you must brave three increasingly dangerous levels to recover the Book, destroy Grislyk&amp;rsquo;s magical Black Crucible, and slay the wizard himself. Magical artifacts will help you evade Grislyk&amp;rsquo;s traps and slay his army of goblins and skeletons, but you will also need your wits and a bit of luck, for knowing when to search, when to fight, and when to run is the only way to survive the DUNGEON OF DEADLIEST EVIL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon of Deadliest Evil is a solitaire adventure game that takes all the essential elements of a classic dungeon crawl, like slaying monsters, finding powerful artifacts, and exploring a multi-level dungeon, and packs them into an easy-to-learn game that sets up and plays in 20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is based on a simple dice allocation mechanic. You have three abilities, Speed, Combat, and Defense, and at the start of each turn you must assign one of three dice (a d4, a d6, and a d8) to each of them. While the game involves a good deal of luck and dice-rolling, judicious dice allocation is the key to success. Victory is achieved by destroying the Black Crucible, retrieving the Book of Lore, slaying the evil wizard Grislyk, and finally leaving the dungeon alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
