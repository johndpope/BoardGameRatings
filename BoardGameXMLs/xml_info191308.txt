			<description>Each player gets a squirrel and the objective is then to collect nuts in each of the five colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You move around the game board by dice rolls and collect nuts by landing on the squares with the colored nuts on them. When you roll your die you must move the entire roll unless you can reach a nut with less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fox is also in play and blocks the road he is on. The fox is moved freely on the board (not following paths) by a player when he rolls a one - though not to squares containing nuts or other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player also start with 2 random pine-cone cards giving advantages that can be used during the players turn (jumping over the fox, exchanging a nut of one color for another and such). You can get more cards in 2 ways - either by landing on a pine-cone square or by landing on a square that contain another squirrel. When landing on such a square each of the 2 players have to roll a die and the one with the largest roll gets the pine-cone card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
