			<description>KWIKORD is a great word game that combines the fast-pace of Boggle with the crossword-like fun of Scrabble.  There is no waiting for your turn and any number can play at once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Play:  Each player receives a score sheet with three 7&amp;times;8 grids on it.  A dealer shuffles and turns over 5 consonants and 4 vowels, then starts the 4 minute countdown timer.  All players use these letters to create words and write them on their grid in crossword fashion (across and down with all words connecting).  Try to place as many words on the grid as possible and reach the 4 corner squares for bonus points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the beeper sounds, add up your total number of words (across and down) then exchange your sheet with an opponent to get bonus points for &amp;quot;improper words-spelling etc.&amp;quot;  When you get your sheet back, multiply your total by the number of corner squares you reached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose a new dealer and repeat this 2 more times.  The WINNER is the player with the highest score after the 3 rounds.&lt;br/&gt;Received the Parents' Choice Award, the Toy Man Award and the Family Review Center Editor's Choice Award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
