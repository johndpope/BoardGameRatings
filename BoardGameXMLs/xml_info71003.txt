							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Caliban (OGL 3.5)</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mere moment before you see the creature attack you, the putrid smell of rancid humanoid flesh invades your nostrils. The stench on the humanoid&amp;rsquo;s clothes &amp;ndash; a mixture of blood, sweat, and decaying flesh &amp;ndash; is enough to make anyone retch and vomit. Those who come in contact with these creatures know who they are, even when they cannot see them. These savages call themselves the calibans. The calibans are sadistically fierce warriors who haunt the wild places of Exodus. They usually wear dark colored clothes, soiled in the blood and entrails of their latest kill. The calibans&amp;rsquo; have hairless bodies, and their chalk white skin is covered with jagged scars, physical disfigurements, and blood red tattoos. These marks describe their personal history and prowess in combat, but only other calibans can understand them. The massive and powerful build of an adult caliban has been combat tested time and time again, as this creature will challenge anyone opposing him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Statistics, abilities and rules for a Caliban (CR 1/2)&lt;br/&gt;     Statistics, abilities and rules for a Caliban Paragon (CR 3)&lt;br/&gt;     Caliban Miniature Counters&lt;br/&gt;     Monster Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
