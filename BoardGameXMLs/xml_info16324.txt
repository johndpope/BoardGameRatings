							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spots</name>
									
			<description>Spots is a card game in which two or more players will make change from a pool of cards.  Scoring is handicapped based on the difference between the total of a player's starting cards and the lowest total of the opponent's starting cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players put one card from their hand into the pool, taking cards with a total value equal to or greater into their score pile.  The player with the lowest score after all cards have been played wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spots was designed to be a card-based version of Pennywise.  It was first published in the Origins 2000 preregistration book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
