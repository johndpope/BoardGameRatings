			<description>NCAA Football was originally known as &amp;quot;Bill Walsh College Football&amp;quot; and was released on 4th generation video game consoles, such as Sega Genesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bill Walsh College Football featured the top twenty-four college football teams from 1992 and twenty-four of the all-time greatest teams since 1978. While no actual players were named and no official team logos used, colleges were listed by city and players identified by number. Play modes include Exhibition, Playoffs and All-Time Playoffs. Sixty-eight classic college plays were available, including the triple option, student body, and wishbone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other options and features include automatic or manual-pass catch mode, audibles, reverse angle replay, onside kicks, four weather conditions (fair, windy, rain and snow), three different quarter lengths (5, 10 and 15 minutes) and a hurry-up offense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bill Walsh endorsement was meant to parallel John Madden NFL Football.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bill Walsh College Football (1994),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
