							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dreams of the Deep</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dreams of the Deep is designed to be a starting Episode for a full Season of play for Dark Aeons: The Atlantean Chronicles, or it can be a standalone Episode. The Dark Aeons core book is all that is required to use this Episode; however it should be noted that the upcoming Arkham: City of Secrets setting book will expand on the Arkham setting in much greater detail than is presented here. As such, we have provided a set of pre-made Persona Sheets for this Episode in order for a Director to simply pick this Episode up and run it straight from the presented material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dreams of the Deep is a modern day retelling of the Classic Lovecraft tale, &amp;quot;Shadow Over Innsmouth&amp;quot;, as seen through the lens of the Dark Aeons Universe and game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Episode made its first showing through Cthulhu International at Origins Games Fair 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
