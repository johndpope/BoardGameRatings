							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Glory of Rome</name>
									
			<description>Technically The Glory of Rome is the title of a &amp;quot;Series of Historical-Political-Military Conflict-Simulations about the Ancient World&amp;quot; (to quote the cover), and this is volume one, The Complete Approach to the Wars between the CARTHAGE and ROME of Scipio Africanus and Hannibal, but since no other volumes were published the series title is being used for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is strategic, with a fairly small map covering the Western Mediterranean. There are 65 turns covering the entire period of the Punic Wars; players are not necessarily fighting the entire time as wars need to be declared and peace can be brokered by agreement. In between wars players can move troops around, get reinforcements, hire mercenaries, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Land units are represented by a small set of metal miniatures (included with the game); army strengths are presumably recorded on paper although this is not made very clear. Naval units are represented either by paper counters cut from a possibly-included sheet or by borrowed counters. Historical leaders with special abilities enter and leave the game on a schedule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat uses a fairly standard CRT but with die roll adjustments provided by players simultaneously choosing maneuvers which are cross-referenced on a separate table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the leaders chrome is provided in the form of special rules for various locations, e.g. Sardinia has a chance of revolting starting on turn 16 unless it has a sufficiently large garrison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much about the game is unclear since Taurus Games' rules were written in a barely coherent stream-of-consciousness style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
