							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Żercy</name>
									
			<description>'With the birth of the Kirs, shape, space, and time have been moved. The universe was determined by &amp;quot;Kir of Run&amp;quot; &amp;mdash; the direction of movement &amp;mdash; and the gods settled in their Tums on the edges of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slavic mythology is a little-known theme for games, one that can hide many secrets. Żercy is both a card game and a first attempt to create a complete representation of the Slavic gods and disclose this mythology full of mysteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who are the Żercy? They are priests of ancient gods who attempt to manipulate reality in subtle ways. They are mercenaries in the hands of tribal chieftains, who attempt to divine success or disaster in coming wars. Żercy, by making proper sacrifices, want to obtain a favor of Kir, the one they serve, while striving at the same time to change the natural balance of power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, each player impersonates a Żerca, a priest of one of four Kirs, gods who represent both the seasons and the directions of the world:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Jaruna (spring, east)&lt;br/&gt;    Rujewit (summer, south)&lt;br/&gt;    Jesz (autumn, west)&lt;br/&gt;    Kostroma (winter, north)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must read signs in the continuous changes around you. Choose a direction for your actions and for the Kir that you want to serve. All gods who appear in the game belong to one of four Tums created by Kirs; the inspiration for the graphic representation of the gods comes from images of nature, in which the attentive observer can notice much more than just a chaos of random configurations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
