			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Calling All 'Copter Pilots&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Huey. That's what they're calling the experimental UH-1XA helicopter you've been ordered to test. Not that you're complaining--this baby sports a super-strong light-weight engine and state-of-the-art control panel. From the moment you slid in to the streamlined cockpit you knew the two of you could make sweet music together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, try her out in flight school, or go after some gutsy aerial combat in arcade mode. Then maybe, just maybe, you'll be ready to test your piloting and target skills in reality mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn on the power, start the engine, engage the rotor, then go for altitude. They've finally designed a helicopter the way you always knew they should, and it's up to you to put it to the test.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you select Arcade Mode you shoot at enemy aircraft and try to avoid getting shot down. You have an unlimited number of weapons to fire, and the Huey is already airborne, so all you have to do is maneuver and shoot at targets. If you want to see a demo of Arcade Mode, wait a few moments after selecting this mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you select Flight School, you learn how to take off, navigate, and land with the assistance of the on-board computer. Flight School tests your ability to follow procedures, fly competently, and become comfortable with the Huey. You learn by experience to keep a gentle, yet firm hand on the controls so you can smooth your way from one maneuver to another. While in Flight School, you're flying in friendly territory, so you won't have to worry about enemy attacks and you don't carry weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your mission in Reality Mode is to bomb the enemy base and return to home base. You're on your own in Reality Mode. Unlike Flight School, the on-board computer screen doesn't prompt you. Remember all those skills you learned in Flight School? You'll need every one of them and maybe more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
