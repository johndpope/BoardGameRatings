			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the maelstrom of the Elemental Planes, even the tiny can thrive&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire and Water are primal planes of pulsating energies, little understood but greedily exploited by wizards and would-be rulers of the multiverses.  The hierarchies of beings there are dangerous and useful to mortals, but what of the sentient crumbs of elemental life, who slip in and out of the cracks of the walls between dimensions?  The erkunae, decadent inhabitants of the strange isle of Erkusaa, divide their chaotic society into castes by enslaving tiny elementals, and summoners of the elementals think they can prosper by bringing hordes of these crude little motes of energy/matter across the dimensional line- but they might be surprised by the power of Tiny Elementals!  A new Purple Duck Storeroom investigation of these pint-sized outsiders of air, earth, fire and water gives you the lowdown on their quirks and stats, and how they fit into the Patchwork Planet of Porphyra! Get Purple Duck Storeroom: Tiny Elementals today from the sadistic summoners at Purple Duck Games, where our games are what you want!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
