			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Way back in 2005, I got carried away working on a campaign for Savage Worlds. It started as me gazing at a cover for a Raymond Feist novel and ended up being about 70 pages worth of material. I ran a few sessions of the campaign, and then put it aside. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve probably shamelessly stolen names and concepts from my own work a dozen times, but as I was perusing my hard drive for something to work on I thought about it again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the &amp;ldquo;book&amp;rdquo; was pretty much written in its entirety to begin with, and I already had a cover (not my art) and a page background design (my own work), and I already had a character sheet (again my work) I decided to go ahead and lay it out, and add a bookmark to it. It probably took me four months to write, and it took me 3 days to lay out in my spare time. I hope you enjoy. And if anybody wants to take on the monumental task of writing up statistics for this for another game system, I&amp;rsquo;ll post any conversions that cross my desk. This is my official version, unless I create a specific spin-off. So I really don&amp;rsquo;t mind if someone else thinks the ideas warrant conversion to their own favorite system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notes about this Edition:&lt;br/&gt;This document was first drafted for my own campaign circa 2005. As it was designed for Savage Worlds Revised, the Explorer Edition weapon statistics are absent. You will have to convert them using the formulas that should be easy to find in other products produced by Pinnacle. Likewise, you may need to reference other products to obtain the full list of racial templates, as they are not included in the Explorer&amp;rsquo;s Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genre:&lt;br/&gt;Realmstorm is a Swashbuckling Pulp Science Fantasy campaign. There are elements of hyper-science, esoteric supernatural arts, weirdness, the unknown, etc. all wrapped up in a world of Renaissance or Napoleonic sensibilities with a bit of High Adventure thrown in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
