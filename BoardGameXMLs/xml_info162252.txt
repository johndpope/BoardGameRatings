							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Series Pitch: Gallows&#039; End</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the far-off forest moon of Gallows' End, enforcing Federal law is a damn sight harder than it is among the Central Planets. As a Star Marshal, you'll have to decide whether to stand with the Law right or wrong, or roll with the punches and keep the locals on your side. Either way, weaving a safe path through the tapestry of local loyalties is a hard task for anyone, especially when they have a duty to more than their kin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decide what's important to you and chart a course by it when you find yourself at Gallows' End!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written in the format of a Series Pitch for Robin D. Laws' OGL DramaSystem, this short and punchy PDF is a perfect springboard for campaigns using any number of systems. Even better, all our Series Pitches are based on adventures and campaigns played here at Morningstar HQ, so you know they work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
