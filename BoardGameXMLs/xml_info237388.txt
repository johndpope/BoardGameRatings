			<description>Yuanming Yuan, the garden of gardens was constructed throughout the 18th and the early 19th century in China. It's a summer palace for the royal family of Qing Dynasty. It was not only a masterpiece of the traditional Chinese garden but a combination of the western mansion. However, the garden was destructed during the  Second Opium War. The building architecture and numerous art and historical treasures vanish or lost from the destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, players travel back to the beginning of the constructing of the garden. Try to build the most beautiful garden as you can by collecting materials, using different tools or upgrading buildings. However, your opponents might be faster than you. So make sure you are the first one to complete the part you are in charge and earn as many fame points as you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
