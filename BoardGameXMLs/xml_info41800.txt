							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cell Management</name>
									
			<description>Cell Management is a solitaire game for a standard piecepack.  The player attempts to execute a jailbreak of sorts from an alien spaceship.  Their captors have abducted several species, and you may have to stage some escape attempts as diversions from the real jailbreak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cell Management is based on the mechanisms in gene regulatory networks, which help a biological cell respond to changes in its environment dynamically.  The board setup is in essence a circular bacterial DNA strand, the guards are RNA polymerase, the captives are transcribed RNA sequences which become promoters and repressors for other transcription sites, and escaped captives actually become proteins in the cell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
