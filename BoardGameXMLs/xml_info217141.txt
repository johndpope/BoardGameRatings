			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shaun the Sheep - A Pizza the Action is a wonderful game for the whole family.  It's a beautiful summer's day down on Mossy Bottom Farm.  The farmer is feeling hungry and decides to have pizza in the meadow.  As the pizza arrives, the delivery boy trips and pieces of pizza fly all over the farm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will Shaun be able to collect all the pizza pieces from around the farm and bring them back to the barn to share with the flock? Play this game with the whole family and see if you can beat Blitzer and the farmer to get &amp;quot;a pizza the action&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional information (not from the publisher):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player draws a card at the beginning of a turn and takes the action on the card: move forward, move backward, or stay in the place. The first player to reach the end of board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
