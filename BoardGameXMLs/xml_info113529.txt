			<description>B.L.U.E. Legend of Water is an adventure game created by Hudson Soft for Sony PlayStation and released on July 9, 1998 in Japan.&lt;br/&gt; The intro starts with Maya on a helicopter being taken to see her dad who is on some kind of ship. During the journey she falls asleep and has a strange dream. Upon arriving she expresses her excitement at wanting to go swimming with the dolphins (or just one particular dolphin).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;s divided in two parts: NPC Interaction and Exploration.&lt;br/&gt; In the interaction parts, Maya must talk to her father and other researchers from the underwater facility to get clues about the ruins.&lt;br/&gt; In the exploration parts, she explores the sea and the ruins. Maya and the dolphin must solve some puzzles together.&lt;br/&gt; Strangely enough, Maya doesn't use proper diving equipment, so in order to breathe, she must find some air spots in the ruins.&lt;br/&gt; The controls resemble those of Tomb Raider, but underwater&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;B.L.U.E.
