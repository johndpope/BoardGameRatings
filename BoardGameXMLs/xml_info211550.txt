							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Colony</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the depths of space, Fleet discovered a new class M planet, devoid of all but the simplest life forms, and brimming with sought-after manzakium ore deposits. An orbital outpost was rapidly built to support the immediate colonization of the planet, and a small mining colony was rapidly erected upon the surface. Progress was rapid for the first 8 days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...and then equipment began disappearing. A vehicle belonging to a survey team caught fire for no readily apparent reason, and a transport from the space station arrived covered in a strange grey dust. The space dock workers suffered from some strange new disease, and were immediately quarantined. Since that time, the colony has continually reported in that everything is fine, and proceeding according to expectations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We called your team because every time the colony reports in, the report is identical to its predecessor. Our analysts predict the odds of that happening at several million to one. We fear that the colony has gone dark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large but manageable space colony with a multi-level plotline awaits your expert hand as Game Master. It is written using generic statistics and language to enable compatibility with most science-fiction rpg systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not for the faint of heart, Dark Colony is designed for exploration by three or more well-equipped characters of  moderate levels of skill and experience.  It can be used as either a stand-alone adventure or as the sequel to Dark Outpost or Dark Visitor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many ways to die in space.  We just added a few more (yet again).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
