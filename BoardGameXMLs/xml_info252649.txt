							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Terre Pirates</name>
									
			<description>Terre Pirates is set between the 17th and the 18th centuries, during the golden age of piracy. This era saw the birth of the most renowned captains, famous for their incredible feats. Here are gathered the pirates that made their marks on history: some were great fighters or great adventurers, others relied on cunning to reach their goals. Choose your captain and play with your very own deck of action cards to get the advantage. Manage your hand by drawing weapons, items, movement and cannon fire cards. The seas being full of dangers and opportunities, take advantage of the fair winds but beware of storms, the Royal Navy and the Kraken. What will be your strategy? Brutal, quick, opportunistic or crafty? Get the most treasures, and bring them back to the capital!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Terre Pirates, a card-driven game, each player embodies one of six famous pirates, such as Blackbeard, Anne Bonny and Bartholomew Roberts. Each pirate has his own deck of cards, leading to different strategies: while some are better at boarding ships, others are good navigators, or focus on stealing treasures from the others. On each turn, you will be able to play cards to move, fight or get treasures, and draw up to five cards from four different decks, depending on your current needs: navigation cards to move your ship, cannons to shoot your opponents, weapons to board ships, or items to get treasures. The first player to bring four treasures to the capital wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
