			<description>A One-Round Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's been two weeks since you started your vacation, if it can be called that. You had just completed a two-year campaign and were ready to take a break. Through word of mouth, you heard of a resort town, Amore, located in the southern part of the Yoshin Desert. From what you had heard, it sounded like a terrific spot to relax. So, you stowed all your adventuring gear away, packing only your clothes and some basic weaponry, and set out for Amore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
