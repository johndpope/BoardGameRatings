			<description>A quick and dirty space combat game. &lt;br/&gt;Finished but in Alpha.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QDSCG uses basic ideas and concepts, with generalized fire power, but there is still the interplay of missiles, fighters, and direct combat. Abstraction is the key, but the system has the ability to open up to allow easy rule changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using simple rules, no tables, no off board record keeping, the games is designed to allow masses space combat of fleet scale engagements take place with in a short play time of 1-2 hours. Larger engagements between teams could easily be taught and played at a convention with a simple cheat sheet keeping track of all rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
