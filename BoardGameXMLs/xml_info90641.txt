			<description>Touchstone combines the violent chaotic action of football with the simple press your luck game-play of blackjack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of Touchstone is to score more points then your opponent. To score a point, the numerical value of a drive must total exactly 21.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;In order to play the game you will need 2 different team decks, a printout of the rules, and a play mat.Each 16 card deck represents a different football team themed after mythic characters and races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play:&lt;br/&gt;The game-play is fast and simple with each coach simultaneously playing cards into the down positions in order to either score or keep the opponent from scoring. Each card has four values associated with the four down positions. This means that the usefulness of each card varies depending on when it is played. If the coach on offense doesn't score within those four downs then the drive ends and possession switches to the other player. Some cards also have special powers that can be triggered on certain downs that help add flavor to the different teams. An example power is &amp;quot;push&amp;quot; which pushes all the cards back one down position causing all their values to change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
