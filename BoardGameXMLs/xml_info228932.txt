							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hut Alive Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Player: 2-4 Players&lt;br/&gt;Time: 10 mins (2 players) 20 mins(3-4 players)&lt;br/&gt;Card deck: 52&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETTING GAME:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shuffling and sharing cards:&lt;br/&gt;A player shuffles and shares the card. Each player would get 10 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BAITING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player selects and place 5 CARDS that would serve as BAITS for the fight. These cards are chosen based on the player's choice on elements such as high number, HUT colour etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. At their turns, players try to eliminate other player's BAIT by placing a higher number HUT (with the same colour) on the BAIT to be eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For instance, if a PLAYER has baits with number 9, 9, 8, 7, 8, an active player (player whose turn it is) who places a card with higher number of the same colour as the BAIT collects the BAIT and other cards on it if BAITS has been HEXED, DEFENDED or INVADED (see below).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HEX:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can use their turn to HEX any BAIT (either theirs or another players). They do so by placing ANOTHER HUT COLOUR with the same number as the BAIT to change the colour. This is a very important in the game strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEFEND:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can DEFEND their BAIT by placing another card with HIGHER NUMBER but MUST be the same HUT colour as their BAIT. This is a strategy for defence in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INVADE:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACTIVE PLAYER can weaken another players BAIT by INVADING. This is done when Active Player place a card with LOWER NUMBER on another player's BAIT but must be the same COLOUR. This makes the BAIT weaker and easier to eliminate at next run by any player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHEN GAME ENDS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when any player has EXHAUSTED their FIVE BAITS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO WIN???&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE PLAYER WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF BAITS AT THE END OF THE GAME WINS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In situations where there is a TIE, the players FIGHTS and the FIRST to lose a BAIT gets ELIMINATED TILL THEIR IS ONLY ONE PLAYER LEFT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
