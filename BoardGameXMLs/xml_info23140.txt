			<description>From the Publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death in the Fast Lane is a murder mystery game for 10 to 12 guests and a host.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of Formula 17 racing - fast cars, big deals and bitter rivalries. Three races are all that remain of the current racing season - and with everything left to play for, the championship is in turmoil. Jo Shooie, championship leader, has been murdered! Will the murderer be caught? Who will take the checkered flag and the Championship? Can you achieve your goals, keep your secrets hidden and survive Death in the Fast Lane? It's up to you.&lt;br/&gt; At Death in the Fast Lane you will discover the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Who is having an affair? &lt;br/&gt;    Who has renegotiated their contract? &lt;br/&gt;    Who are the Three Tenors? &lt;br/&gt;    Who will win the championship? &lt;br/&gt;    ...and, of course, who murdered Jo Shooie? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find out in Death in the Fast Lane!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Death in the Fast Lane, the last three races of the current Formula 17 season will be played out over the course of a single evening. The characters include drivers, team owners and the chairperson of the Race Committee. However, not everyone is as they seem - some have dark secrets they need to keep hidden... and someone is the murderer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death in the Fast Lane lasts for about four hours and is suited to an evening. It is often played over a meal - a finger buffet if possible to allow guests to circulate and talk in private.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The free introductory pdf file (38 KB) contains an introduction to the game, a list of all the characters, an invitation to send to your guests - plus details of how to buy the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.freeformgames.com/game_details.php?11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.freeformgames.com/game_details.php?11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
