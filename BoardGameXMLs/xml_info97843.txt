							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ruins of the Dammed</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cursed Aran county has been divided between two factions for generations. Tension is high and war between the two appears close at hand. There is a dam on a river in the north county that controls water that flows to the south's farmers. Recently the north restricted the flow south, and an unknown party attacked the dam to reverse the situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working for one side or the other (the player's choice) the party must travel to the valley holding the dam and determine who is bahind the trouble there. Then the party must decide if they will intervene for either the north or the south over the water flow issue. This is primarily an outdoor adventure but there are encounters in other terrain types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
