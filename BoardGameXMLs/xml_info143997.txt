			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Words of Power system first introduced by Paizo in Ultimate Magic is a respectable attempt at producing a modular magical system that does not divorce itself from the notion of Vancian and spontaneous casting where it is due. Its problem, like so many of the ideas in first party Pathfinder publications, is in its published content to ambition ratio. Simply put, Words of Power is a skeleton; only the heart of what the system should be is even present. The weird spells that make magic fun to begin with simply are not there. Instead, this move into the wonders of something modular rehashes only the most basic spells. This, all on its own, deals a deathblow to the system, as variety and combinatorial possibility is the selling point of every modular system ever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thankfully, the core concept of Words of Power is relatively sound, so all that is needed to make it fun is to expand upon the various words that make up the content. Words of Power Unleashed offers a selection of 3 new target words, 4 new meta words, and 10 new effect words chosen that add tactical depth and, most importantly, fun options to your wordcaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
