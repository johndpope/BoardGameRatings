							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spooks: The Haunting Mystery Game</name>
									
			<description>From their website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Moon Road Manor is a Haunted House. When you go there you will see different types of Spooks in the various Rooms. Sometimes you will only experience different sights and sounds of the Haunting. Maybe you will feel a chill or smell something unfamiliar. The Mystery of the Haunting can only be solved according to The Legend, and The Legend reveals that only one Spook is doing the Haunting in a specific Room. It will be your brave task to explore your way through the house with your friends while playing cards and asking questions until you know the 3 card Haunting Mystery sealed in the Book of Spells. Be careful, you're only allowed to look in the Book of Spells once, if your answer is correct you win, if you're wrong you might be turned into a toad!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a fascinating game that can be enjoyed by everyone including children as young as 8 years old. The game involves a special patented process of card presentation that lets all players participate on every turn and creates the excitement of a race where all players are close to solving the Haunting Mystery near the end of the game. All players will take a slightly different path through the Haunted House, and even though all players have some shared information, your path will unfold in a unique way. There are 546 different Haunting Mysteries and an unlimited number of ways to move through the house, so it is unlikely you will ever play the same game twice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
