			<description>This 1960's card game comes with 44 cards depicting family pets. There are several different types of pets and each card has a number as well as an animal on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first to get rid of your cards by playing a card with either the same animal or the same number on it as the last card played. The number of cards you start with depends on the number of players. Every turn you try to play a card. If you cannot, you must draw a card instead. Once a player goes out, a hand ends and the remaining players must add up the point values left in their hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 6 rounds, the player with the lowest score is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
