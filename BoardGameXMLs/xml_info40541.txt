			<description>Brew-HaHa - The Official Beer Nutz Comix Game by Wild Wigout Comix Game Boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wonderful handmade silk-screened board game created by underground comic artist Wayno in the mid 1990s for the now extinct Scairy Hairy Toys which was previously located in San Fransisco, Ca.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the game you need a case or three of cheap, cheap beer, shot glasses, and the song Rubber Biscuit by The Chips (easily found on the web)....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to out-drink your opponents while moving your drunken game piece around the board and staying conscious yourself. The winner of the game is the last one standing and/or resisting the urge to throw-up especially when dancing and singing along to the great hit song &amp;quot;Rubber Biscuit&amp;quot; performed by The Chips circa 1956. Yes, anytime a player lands on the Rubber Biscuit space everyone has to jump up and shout Rubber Biscuit, Rubber Biscuit!!! while dancing to the song. Any player returning their cheap beer rental via the porcelain god is immediately disqualified and is banished to pass out in the bathtub.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
