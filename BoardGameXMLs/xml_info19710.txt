			<description>From the box: Swoop - A Game of Star-To-Star Strategy.  Ages 8 and up, for 2 to 4 players.  Instructions en Francais a l'interieur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an abstract game with a light theme.  Each player has six spacemen (colored tokens) that start the game around the edge of the circular board on spots of cooresponding colors.  Players take turns moving their spacemen one at a time, a token can move one space left, right, inward but not diagonal nor outward, trying to get them into their home that is in the middle of the board and facing the opposite side as the starting position.  Checking is when a spaceman lands on an opponent's spaceman freezing it in place, and when it moves off, the checked or frozen spaceman is sent back to its starting location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also star spaces that are check-free for the spaceman that occupies it.  That spaceman cannot be frozen or sent back to the starting locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
