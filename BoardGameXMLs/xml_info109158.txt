			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Konami Wai Wai World is a Japanese only Famicom/NES game, obviously by Konami, featuring their different franchises during the NES era. The characters featured include Simon Belmont from the Castlevania series, Mickey from the Goonies, King Kong from King Kong 2: Ikari no Megaton Punch!, Fuuma from Getsu Fuuma Den, a Moai Head from Gradius, Goemon from the series bearing the same name, as well as Twinbee and the Vic Viper. The premise involves saving different the Konami characters, each with his own themed stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player initially only controls the Konami Man and Girl, both original characters. As the player progresses, additional characters saved have unique special abilities that will allow the player to progress further into the game. For instance, Mickey's small size allows the player to pass through areas with  small gaps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is free to switch between all characters as they become available, with each character having his or her own life bar and weapon. Most stages are accessible at once, though the game does require you to save certain characters like Simon Belmont first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all characters are saved, the player is able to pilot the Vic Viper or Twinbee, in a brief shoot em up portion, before being able to proceed to the final stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was also rereleased for Japanese mobile phones, and due to licensing issues, swapping out Mickey and King Kong for Upa and Pentarou from Bio Miracle Upa and Artic Adventure respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
