							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kung-Fu Kuma: Barbarian Races</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A great martial arts supplement for use with Kung Fu Kuma!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barbarian Races of Kung Fu Kuma is an expansion book for the Kung Fu Kuma campaign world and the Pathfinder Game System&amp;trade;. It expands the list of available PC races by six, and it further includes one companion race (for use as friends, allies, loyal servants, and henchman, as well as NPCs). That's seven new races available for Kung Fu Kuma campaigns, six directly for use as Player Characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One thing about all these races&amp;mdash;they are Animal Folk. That is a given in the campaign world of Kung Fu Kuma. But if you purchased this book intending it for use in a different game setting or universe, all of these races are compatible with the general Pathfinder Game System&amp;trade;, though the Gamemaster will have to come up with some reason why Animal Folk exist in that campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six New PC Races!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The various peoples of the barbarian lands around Qiu Sang are mostly Human. Not all, though. A wide variety of Animal Folk eke their lives out amongst the barbarian hordes. Some scholars even speculate that every animal out there has an Animal Folk equivalent. This isn't anything close to being a proven theory, however.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For one reason or another, a number of Animal Folk races live solely out in the barbarian lands, ignoring the safety and civilization of Qiu Sang. This Races sourcebook details seven Animal Folk races who are important amongst the barbarian tribes, six of them available as PC races. Many more races than that exist amongst the jungles and plains of the barbarian lands, but these seven are the ones most encountered when traversing barbarian lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because these are barbarian races, PCs of these races are going to be restricted from taking the 12 Clans Classes of Qiu Sang. As barbarians, and likely proud of their heritage, they will be taking levels in Barbarian Classes alone. It is a part of the price one pays for living apart from Qiu Sang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
