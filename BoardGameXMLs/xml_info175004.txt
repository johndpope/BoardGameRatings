			<description>Four Generations of EDOM&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For years, it has been a legend. Somewhere in the dusty archives of MI6 is the complete version of Bram Stoker&amp;rsquo;s novel Dracula &amp;mdash; the unredacted version. The full story revealed clear pointers to the sources and methods the Service used in Operation EDOM, an 1893 mission that sent a bold agent deep into the Balkans to awaken and then terminate a very dangerous asset indeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the termination didn&amp;rsquo;t take. In 1940, desperate to stop Hitler&amp;rsquo;s march through Europe, the Service reactivated EDOM, and reanimated their Transylvanian asset. Once more, they found they had bitten off more than they could chew, and in the chaos of wartime Romania they put him to sleep. Or so they thought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1977, MI6 discovered that they weren&amp;rsquo;t the only players in this game. Their asset had left his own sleepers behind in Moscow and Romania &amp;mdash; and in London &amp;mdash; and inside MI6. The Service had to reopen EDOM, awaken Dracula again, to find his agents in their own ranks &amp;mdash; or so they said. Perhaps that reawakening was the sleeper&amp;rsquo;s doing, too. Perhaps the Count never slept, not as the Service thought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2011, looking for a terror great enough to fight terror, MI6 once more reached for EDOM. Once more, Dracula reached back. That&amp;rsquo;s how you found the EDOM case file: the Dracula Dossier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three Generations of Intel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The edition of Dracula you found is more than complete &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s annotated. MI6 analysts and EDOM field men kept notes in the margins of their priceless copies of Stoker&amp;rsquo;s work, notes from 1940, from 1977, and from 2011. Notes collated into one master case file, a file that vanished in 2011. The file you found. This is the dossier you must decipher to find the secrets of EDOM, to reveal who betrayed the 1893 operation, to discover who in MI6 still serves Count Dracula today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And then, you must follow those clues to end the story once and for all, to close EDOM forever. You must find, hunt, and kill Dracula, the king of the vampires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Generation of Horror&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dracula Dossier follows in the fully improvisational path of the award-winning Armitage Files campaign. Players follow up leads in the margins of Dracula Unredacted, chasing down the real characters from Stoker&amp;rsquo;s novel, their descendants in the present, and the British agents caught in the backblast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combine these leads and notes with pre-prepared elements such as conspiracy nodes, eerie locations, and vampiric beasts. The dossier contains over 40 supporting characters in vampiric, heroic, or in-between versions. Different versions of the real Mina Harker, Abraham van Helsing, and the other stars of Stoker&amp;rsquo;s novel &amp;mdash; and their modern-day successors, descendants, and survivors &amp;mdash; can drive the story in any direction the players look.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose which leads to track, which scarlet trail to follow. The Director, using the clear step-by-step techniques in this book, improvises a suitably blood-soaked thriller in response to their choices. Clear advice to players and Directors on improvisation, with extensive examples and guidelines, helps you set the scene. Together, you will read and write your own unique version of the Dracula Dossier &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;if you survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
