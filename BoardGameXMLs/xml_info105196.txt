							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Nine Towers (OGL 3.5)</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nine ancient Teleportation Towers link the swamps surrounding Kith&amp;rsquo;takharos. Abandoned by the lost reptilian race of Harlass Orn, the towers remained undiscovered by outsiders&amp;hellip;until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Harlass Orn vanished over a thousand years ago. The survival of Kith&amp;rsquo;takharos depends on the fading magic and strange plants scavenged from Harlass Orn ruins. One man now threatens the tenuous prosperity wrested from the swamp by three generations of settlers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ruthless archaeologist-mage Lenar Hoyt has stolen the most holy artifact of the Bright Water Swamp Men. The tribe holds Kith&amp;rsquo;takharos responsible, and will destroy the village unless the Order of the Jade Leaf retrieves Tarshal&amp;rsquo;din&amp;rsquo;s Shining Spear. As the Swamp Man warriors gather for the assault, Hoyt activates the first Teleportation Tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nine Towers is an OGL 3.5 adventure for 4-6 characters of Fifth and Sixth Levels or a Savage Worlds adventure for 4-6 Seasoned characters, with an estimated 25 hours of playing time. Immerse the characters in an environment of sticky heat, dense fog, and sudden danger as they pursue Lenar Hoyt across the swamp in great leaps of teleportation. Hoyt desperately searches for the origins of Tarshal&amp;rsquo;din&amp;rsquo;s Shining Spear, driven by impulses he does not fully understand. Will the characters reach him and recover the Swamp Man artifact before the Bright Water carry out their threat?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nine Towers also brings the characters one step closer to learning the true fate of the Harlass Orn, which will be revealed in the next Kith&amp;rsquo;takharos adventure: The Dreamers Awaken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
