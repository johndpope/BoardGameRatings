							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">By Fire and Sword: A Solitaire Game of the Thirty Years War (1618-1648)</name>
									
			<description>BACKGROUND: By Fire and Sword is semi-historical simulation of the Thirty Years War. The game begins just after the Bohemian Revolt where the very Catholic Ferdinand II (future Holy Roman Emperor) of Austria was elected to the Thrones of Bohemia and Hungary. Many Protestants felt they would lose their religious rights and a small revolt occurred. This revolt soon spread as other Protestant leaders felt emboldened.  The Player represents the Commander of the Protestant Forces with the goal to overthrow the Holy Roman Empire. As the Commander of the Protestant Forces, you must control a significant number of Cities and Towns throughout Europe before the last Campaign Card is Played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OBJECTIVE: Player takes command of the Protestant Forces. The Player&amp;rsquo;s Objective is to attempt to control at least 16 Cities and 14 Towns before the &amp;ldquo;Peace of Westphalia&amp;rdquo; Card is Played. If the Catholics control 16 Cities and 14 Towns at the end of their Turn, the Holy Roman Empire wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Fire and Sword is a fast and fun game with lots of colorful game counters representing the various military units of the time, including Pike &amp;amp; Musket, Musketeers, Cavalry, Cuirassiers and Cannon. Major leaders of the war are represented and lead forces on the map. Battles and Sieges have, almost, a &amp;quot;miniatures&amp;quot; feel to them as they are resolved on a Battle Mat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME MECHANICS: The Player moves his Leader Counters on the Map along with their Troop Points. If a Battle occurs, Troop Points are exchanged for Tactical Units and combat is carried out in a Tactical manner on a Battle Mat. If there are any Reserve Units in the &amp;quot;Play Area&amp;quot;, he may add them to a Battle Force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
