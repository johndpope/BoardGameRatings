			<description>2091 - On the fiftieth anniversary of the official establishment of the colony, New Terra declares itself independent of Earth's rule.  Earth, her own resources exhausted, has no choice but to go to war.  The Alpha Centaurian Revolution has begun... [A] fast-paced tactical game simulating ship to ship combat in hyperspace.  Included in the rules are 5 scenarios from the Alpha Centaurian Revolution, with alternates allowing you to choose your own forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Counters represent individual ships. The following ship types are included: police, destroyer, light cruiser, heavy cruiser, space fortress, battleship, dreadnought, and freighter. Each turn equals one minute and each hex is (ahem) 11 million miles (not a typo).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
