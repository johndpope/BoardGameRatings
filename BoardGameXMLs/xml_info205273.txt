			<description>Energie-Spar-Spiel or the Energy Saving Game is a simple roll-and-move affair published in 1981 by the German subsidiary of electrical products maker GTE Sylvania.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board has a slightly spiral track of 80 spaces. There are 16 spaces along the way marked in red, each of which has a bonus or penalty linked to a good or bad energy use behaviour. Each situation and its consequences are listed in an accompanying booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is vividly illustrated by examples of the red dot situations, from drying dishes by hand and installing fluourescent bulbs to a car slamming on the brakes at a stoplight and a topless woman &amp;quot;talking to Susie on the phone for two hours&amp;quot; while her hot bath goes cold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game title is in German, but it includes an English rule book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
