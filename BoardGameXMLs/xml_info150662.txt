			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dark Heresy there are countless types of vehicles, everything from bikes, ships, spacecraft, walkers and more are available to those with the money and influence to acquire them. As with mounts, vehicles are best used as conveyances, enabling characters to move from one location to another at a rate faster than they could otherwise achieve with their feet alone. Most of the time when a character interacts with a vehicle they are a passenger and the vehicle becomes just another environment for the character to explore.&lt;br/&gt;When a character is driving or piloting a vehicle in non-stressful conditions there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to become bogged down in the minutia of what lever does what&amp;mdash;simply allow the Acolytes to reach their destination. There may, however, be times when a character is piloting or driving a vehicle in combat, or worse, they face an enemy that has the benefit of a vehicle. Such encounters and circumstances alter the dynamics of the game by injecting a new lethal dimension to combat.&lt;br/&gt;The rules presented here expand combat options by including full rules for incorporating vehicles into the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;this document is completely unofficial and in no way endorsed by games Workshop limited or Fantasy Flight Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
