			<description>You Will Never Look At Sand the Same Again. You are a Commander of a Marine Rifle Company in the 1st Marine Division, you are headed for the island of Guadalcanal, part of the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific. You are part of the first major offensive of the United States against the Japanese forces. Operation Watchtower is the code name of your mission, but some of your men are referring to it as Operation Shoestring. It is true that our Navy still does not control the seas around the island. It is also true that the Japanese bastion of Rabaul will be quick to react to our presence on the island. No one could have anticipated such a rapid deployment of the division this early in the war, but the discovery of a nearly completed Japanese airfield on Guadcancal has changed everything. The threat it imposes on the sea lanes to Australia and New Zealand cannot be tolerated. We don't know what awaits you. But as Marines you will be ready for whatever comes your way. You are to take the airfield and hold it against any Japanese counterattack. Watchtower Guadalcanal 1942 is Bill Wilder second Steel Panthers World At War Mega Campaign which now takes you to the jungles of the South Pacific in a way only Bill Wilder can. Your job is to guide your rifle company through the coming harrowing months of a harsh daily lifestyle and the constant threat of death or horrible injuries. As the situation demands, other units will be supplied to you for that particular battle. Most of the battles are historical in nature. Some are not. Steel Panthers World At War is also a role playing game and as such, you will be confronted with some very unusual situations. Ahead of you lie many months of grueling action. You will face every type of military situation imaginable ... and sometimes the unimaginable. Once and again you will have to make decisions that will not only affect the men under your command but could change the course of the war. You are in the jungle, mercilessly cruel at times in its treatment of those who live in it. The Marine tradition will stand or fall on what you and the 1st Marine Division do here on Guadalcanal. Watchtower Guadalcanal 1942 offers you more then just some scenarios. In it you will find dozens of pictures, backgrounds, historical documents and insights into the 1942 campaign, plus numerous maps to help find out where you are. As you win (or lose) battles, a map will display them for you. For exceeding valor you may receive special awards. What is a Mega Campaign you ask? Mega-Campaigns are specially designed and programmed campaign systems for Matrix Games Steel Panthers: World at War. You must have a copy of Steel Panthers World At War v7.0 to play Watchtower Guadalcanal 1942 Mega Campaign. Mega-Campaigns are non-linear; they branch into dozens of directions, depending on the victory level achieved by the player and also on his choices during play. In a Mega-Campaign, you not only face standard attack or defend types of battles, but many unusual missions and variants are also available for assignment. You may be sent to free POWs, or make an amphibious assault. You will find yourself immersed in the campaign and a stand-alone battle will never feel the same again. The fact is to truly get the feel of a Mega Campaign one must experience it. Most of the battles are historical in nature. Some are not. Steel Panthers World At War is also a role playing game and as such, you will be confronted with some very unusual situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
