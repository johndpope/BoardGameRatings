							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tenth Dragon</name>
									
			<description>When Godd created the Wurld, she saw that it was beautiful, full of green mountains, white shores, and blue seas. Godd wanted to display the Wurld to all Creation, and so she hung the Wurld in the Heavens, suspended by nine gold chains gripped by nine dragons. A great Torch was placed in the mouth of a tenth dragon, who circled the Wurl to give it warmth and light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now, something is wrong with the tenth dragon. The great torch appears to be receding from the Wurld. It is growing colder and darker. Snow is falling in the harvest month. The crops are withering and dying. Furred beasts are descending from the north, wild and ravenous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the Dragon Priestess of your village, a healer of great skill. The people under your care look to you for hope. Knowing that time is precious, you gather supplies and prepare for a journey north, to the Shrine of the Tenth Dragon. Only there do you have any hope of conversing with Godd and the Tenth Dragon. Only there can you learn what must be done to return warmth to the Wurld and save your village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tenth Dragon is a solitaire card-based push-your-luck game in which you, the player, must overcome harsh winds, blinding snow, and hungry beasts in order to reach the Shrine of the Tenth Dragon.  Each card has multiple purposes, with an event, a twist, and an item or boon to help you through your quest.  Progress through the deck three times, each time with slightly different rules.  If you survive, you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
