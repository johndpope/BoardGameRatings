			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;A tile-laying game for 2&amp;ndash;4 players. Players have their starting point in one of the corners of a thought 7x7 tile map, with the goal in the middle. Taking turns of laying down tiles with straight corridors, bends, T-crossings and so on, some of which are one-way, the player who first connects his starting point with the goal wins the game. Among the special tiles are tiles that allow you to turn, move or remove an already laid tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
