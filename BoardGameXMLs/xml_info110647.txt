			<description>In March 2010, the Tripico 3 expansion pack &amp;quot;Absolute Power&amp;quot; was announced, slated for release in Europe in 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion received an 8/10 on Game Zone, closing with &amp;quot;Absolute Power isn&amp;rsquo;t a revolution, instead taking the framework laid out by the original game and building on it with new features and a wacky new campaign. The core mechanics are still the same, and the new campaign might be a turn off to sim fans looking for something more grounded and traditional. However, if you were a fan of Tropico 3 and want another reason to step into the role of El Presidente once more, then this is your chance.&amp;quot; Absolute Power was only released on PC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion pack gives the player a wider selection of edicts such as 'Print money', 'Free housing', 'Delete a Faction' and 'Shoot Juanito' (which involves blowing up Juanito's TNT Radio). These new edicts are called 'Megalomania edicts', for each edict that the player releases they can gain a varying amount of megalomania score that counts at the end of the game. Also there is a new range of buildings, including 'Golden Statue' (in the likeness of 'El Presidente'), 'Garbage dump' and 'Balloon rides'. The Loyalist faction is also introduced; it is composed of the player's most loyal supporters. There is also a second radio DJ named Betty Boom who is head of the resistance movement against el Presidente.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tropico 3&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
