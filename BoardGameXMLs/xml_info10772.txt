			<description>A &amp;quot;question and answer&amp;quot; game (as opposed to a &amp;quot;trivia&amp;quot; game) in which players score points by correctly answering questions from a wide range of topics including history, geography, sports, etc.  A card with 10 questions (five on a side) and three answers per question is placed onto the electric board.  On their turn, a player picks one of the three answers by pushing the electric peg into one of the holes.  If the answer is correct, the white light will illuminate and the player scores 2 points.  If they answer is incorrect, the red light will illuminate.  The player then takes a second guess.  If this guess is correct, the player scores 1 point.  Otherwise, no points are scored.  The player with the highest score after a set number of rounds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Electro&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
