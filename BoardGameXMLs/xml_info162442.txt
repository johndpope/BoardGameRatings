							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sartar Clan Questionnaire</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sartar Clan Questionnaire' contains all the questions for the Clan Questionnaire from the Sartar: Kingdom of Heroes book (but without the answers) to help your players create their own clan. Players have found just filling out the questionnaire shows the depth of the cultures, history, and storytelling opportunities Glorantha contains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This questionnaire should help you understand the really deep background that underlies your character's reality. It shows what part your ancestors had in making Glorantha. Think of this as something your character knows his ancestors did, a really long time ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The material here is addressed to you, but the decisions would have been made by those ancient folks who live on in your characters, their descendents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
