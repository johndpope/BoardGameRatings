							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">PathfinderLITE Paladin</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a select, worthy few shines the power of the divine. Called paladins, these noble souls dedicate their lives to the battle against evil. Knights, crusaders, and law-bringers, paladins seek not just to spread divine justice but to embody the teachings of the virtuous deities they serve. In pursuit of their lofty goals, they adhere to ironclad laws of morality and discipline. As rewards for their righteousness, these holy champions are bestowed with sublime blessings to aid them in their quests: powers to smite evil, heal the innocent, and inspire the faithful. Although their convictions might lead them into conflict with the very souls they would save, paladins weather endless challenges of faith and dark temptations, risking their lives to do right and fighting to bring about a brighter future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
