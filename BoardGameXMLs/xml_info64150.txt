							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Postcard Dungeon Crawl</name>
									
			<description>Remember the good old times, where four lonely heroes crawled from dungeon to dungeon to face hordes of monsters in hope to face the ultimate super villain at the end?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well .. those times are back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Postcard Dungeon Crawl the fierce Northlander, the sturdy Dwarf, the devious Assassin and the mystical Elf are taking the battle back to the monsters that emerged from under the surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDC uses artscow compatible cards for the characters, their skills, their spells, the treasures, the monster references and the equipment as well as a couple of common dice for each adventurer and some dice for the dungeon master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The maps for the dungeons are completely artscow compatible as well, and fit an a common postcard, 7x5 inches - hence the name. Players can create their own maps with the gimp and the templates that come with the PNP version of this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simple PNP version comes with chits to represent heroes and monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
