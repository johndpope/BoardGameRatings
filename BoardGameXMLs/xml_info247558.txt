			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of this game is to finish your drawing of a bug before the computer finishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and the computer roll a die alternately with each number standing for a part of the bug.  You must add the parts in the right order; in other words, you cannot have a neck until you have a body, you cannot have a head until you have a neck, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;Brian Leibowitz wrote this program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is published as type-in source code in Basic Computer Games (Microcomputer Edition), ed.
