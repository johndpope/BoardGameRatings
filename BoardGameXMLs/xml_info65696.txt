							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Labyrinth</name>
									
			<description>A young adventurer is seeking his fortune in the Labyrinth. He seeks the 3 great treasures which will allow him to live out his life in luxury. The Labyrinth is the hunting ground for 3 horrible beasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board consist of 4 rings that freely rotate around each other. Roughly once per game round, the board will shift. The way the board shifts is determined by the active player. The power to control the shift is passed after the player shifts the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player must play as the adventurer, the remaining players may choose from an assortment of characters to play. The player playing the adventurer is trying to get 3 treasure chest and get out (gaining a new ability with each chest), while the other players are all trying to capture the adventurer and bring him/her back to their layer. They are not working together and will likely end up fighting over the adventurer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Character has its own special ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
