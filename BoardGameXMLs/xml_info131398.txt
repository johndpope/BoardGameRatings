			<description>Author's description: &lt;br/&gt;ViewScream is a role-playing game designed for Google+ Hangout. It&amp;rsquo;s a low-prep game, and requires 2 ten-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Premise: Four officers (Medical, Bridge, Weapons, and Engineering) find themselves aboard a damaged starship, in great peril. They&amp;rsquo;re cut off from each other, and can only communicate via viewscreens throughout the ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you turn on your shipmates? Will you work with them, even though some of them may be guilty of horrific crimes? What happened to the rest of the crew? How many minutes do you have before it happens to you, too? Can you escape? Can you trust your shipmates? Will someone find your mangled corpse floating in the void?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a drama-heavy game, lots of scenery-chewing, and players stay in character the whole time (about 90 minutes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
