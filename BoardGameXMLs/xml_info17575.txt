			<description>The object of this children's game is to be the last player with his house standing after the wolf has destroyed the other houses. Based loosely on the Big Bad Wolf children's story, each player has a pig inside either the straw, wood, or brick house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, each player secretly drops a metal pin into one of the 12 holes belonging to the player to his left. Players use a spinner, taking turns to determine which player will be forced to place a plastic pin into one of the holes belonging to his house. If he is lucky, nothing happens and the pin remains in the hole. If he hits the hole in which his opponent has placed the secret metal pin, it will activate the wolf. The wolf will crash down into his house (which he assembled at the beginning of the game) destroying the house and exposing the pig inside. That player is then eliminated from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
