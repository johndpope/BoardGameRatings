			<description>The Ginger Wars is a game of battling gingerbread people. Each player has 5 character pieces in which they protect and battle others for their pieces. The first person to complete a brand new gingerbread person wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's fast paced where you're constantly attacking and defending with your battle cards. You have to be smart and pick your opponents wisely, manage your revolving deck of cards and keep track of what others have played. You need to get your bluffing game going. Get people to waste their strength and attack them when their momentarily weak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ginger Wars aims to appeal to the casual and more experienced gamers. It doesn't take long to learn the rules, but playing your opponents like a fiddle will take time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
