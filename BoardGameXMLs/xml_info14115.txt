			<description>Each player has a man and a woman and starts on 16 fields a large common wood plan, which consists of the square wooden tiles. The goal of the game is it to fulfill as the first three different from five different victory conditions : be the first on level 3 OR 1 win one fight OR deliver 4 equal Nuggets OR deliver 3 Nuggets in 2 colors OR deliver 1 Nugget in 5 different colors . If one wants to fulfill a victory condition, which already a fellow player fulfilled, one must exceed this, therefore, for example be the first on  level 4 or win 2 fights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who&amp;acute;s turn it is, can always do 2 actions:&lt;br/&gt;1) move a figure one space, or bring it back into the game or move and fight or exchange partners. &lt;br/&gt;2) Implement an action with the man or the woman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Action of the man exists in collecting Nuggets. He draws a Nugget from the Nugget bag and compares the color with the wood tiles around himself. According to the same color it may indicate then Nuggets on its play board. Subsequently, he puts the harvested fields into the wood bag. Sometimes it could happen that you sink your own figures.&lt;br/&gt;The action of the woman exists in the structure of the country. To do this 2 wood panels are drawn from the wood bag and lied down adjacent to the tile of the woman. So you can build higher levels&lt;br/&gt;So remember: The man collects the Nuggets and destroys the land, the woman develops the land!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you like abstracts especially TRIAS or TORRES this one is worth a try.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
