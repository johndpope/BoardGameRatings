			<description>A trick-taking game for 3 players for the Decktet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three chefs in one kitchen, that can&amp;rsquo;t be good. They all want to make soup, even though there&amp;rsquo;s only one kettle available. Stubborn as they are they all start to work on the same soup. To make things worse, all chefs have a very personal taste. During the process each chef tries to squeeze in as much of their own preferences as they possibly can. After the soup is done, the personal taste of each chef is revealed and it is evaluated which chef has managed to add his own flair and ingredients the most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Bisque every player secretly selects a goal card from his hand to declare which suits he wants to end up in the soup pot. With the rest of the cards tricks are played and the winner of each tricks decides which card will end up in the soup pot. After all the tricks the suits in the soup pot are scored. The goal cards are revealed and the winner of the round is declared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
