			<description>Lebensraum, The Campaign in the East 1941 - 1945.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lebensraum! is a grand strategic, moderate complexity game of the war between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia, starting with the German invasion in late June of 1941 through to the final battles to Berlin in 1945. The game focuses on the Army Group level, with players controlling subordinate armies as the main combat formations. Leadership is a major component of the game, with each player having a pool of named and rated leaders available. Airpower, naval support partisans, production centers, and transportation networks are all covered. There are four scenarios, ranging from three to 13 turns, as well as a 16 turn campaign game covering the entire war. Turns are quarterly, with a map scale of 50 miles per hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can be combined with SimCan's West Front to cover the entire war in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
