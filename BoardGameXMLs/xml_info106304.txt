							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wally Bear and the NO! Gang</name>
									
			<description>Wally Bear and the NO! Gang is an educational Nintendo Entertainment System game that teaches children to say no to potentially harmful drugs like tobacco, alcohol and marijuana. It is notable for being one of the many NES games that were not licensed by Nintendo, most likely because the game's content did not comply with Nintendo's Content Guidelines that were in effect at the time of the game's release. The game was designed in cooperation with the American Medical Association and the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information. Like in most early platform games, even getting hit once meant losing a &amp;quot;chance&amp;quot; to beat the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Wally Bear and the NO! Gang,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
