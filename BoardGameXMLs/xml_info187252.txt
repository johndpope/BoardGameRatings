			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the system have standard demographic information and twenty-six Attributes:  Agility, Balance, Chance, Death, Emotion, Focus, Guile, Health, Instinct, Judgment, Knowledge, Language, Movement, Nourishment, Observation, Persuasion, Quickness, Recovery, Strength, Timing, Unconsciousness, Vitality, Work, Xperience, Yearning, and Zeal.  Each Attribute has two numeric ratings - a Maximum Percentage Value (does not change during play) and a Current Percentage Value (changes during play).  These values range from 0 to 99%; new characters generally start with 1% in all categories though some may vary.  Characters also have addition data points, including: Real Age, Human Age, Age, Sex, Height &amp;amp; Weight, Total Body Fat%, Total Fat Weight, Movement % Bonus, and Weight Encumbrance % (some are derived, some are generated).  Characters gain Achievements during play (about 2000 Achievements per typical adventure), and every 1,000 Achievements yields a single Level.  Levels can be assigned to any Attribute, each Level raising an Attribute's Maximum Percentage Value by 1%.  The rules suggest characters play through Levels 1-1000 (thus, through 1,000,000 Achievements).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters also learn new Skills called Capabilities.  These are vaguely defined and (apparently) keep secret by the Game Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is equally cumbersome and involves numerous lengthy calculations to determine initiative and hits.  For example, weapons have four qualities:  length, bluntness, damage force, and penetration.  These combine in various ways under various special circumstances to influence hit chance and damage potential.  Melee attacks use a different resolution mechanism than ranged attacks.  Characters will typically start with 3-25 Damage Status Points (Hit Points).  As simple weapon hits may do upwards of 500 Damage Points on critical strikes it is obvious that characters probably will not survive through 1,000,000 Achievements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
