			<description>45 cards, in four suits - Diamonds, Stars, Circles and Squares. The game is inspired by the playing card game of Hearts or Black Maria. This is a trick taking game where you lose points if you 'collect' a trick containg Stars or the 3 Witch Cards. When one player has a score of 200 points against him, the game ends, and the player with the lowest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was the first card game published by Castell. Belisha, Progress, and Speed were all part of this new range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1951, the game was reissued with slightly different rules and new card illustrations, and a new name:&lt;br/&gt;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
