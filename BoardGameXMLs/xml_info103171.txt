			<description>One of the truly great sporting events in the world is the Highland Games of Scotland. Played outdoors for centuries, now transported to your living room. &lt;br/&gt;Take part in such modern classics as Tossing the 2HB, Jockionary, Vegetarian Sword Dancing and How High is my Sporran.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;24 cards with activities on them&lt;br/&gt;5 tiddlywinks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn a player draws one of the cards from the deck. This card explains what the mini game will be for this round. It could be a physical activity or a quiz on Scottish things.&lt;br/&gt;The card explains the rules of the game and how to play it. &lt;br/&gt;Players compete over several rounds to try to amass the most points through competing in these mini, modified 'indoor highland games'.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the person or team with the most points at the end of 5 rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
