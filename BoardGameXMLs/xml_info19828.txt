			<description>The wolves eat the goats. The goats eat the cabbage. So far so good. The only problem is that wolves don't like to share, and nor do the goats. Will the cabbage manage to turn things in its favor?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During every round, each player simultaneously plays a character card (cabbage, goat or wolf), and in order, every player can try to eliminate certain character cards that are preventing them from winning. In addition, each character possesses a secret power that he can set off at any moment.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;When a round is over, players find out which of the surviving cabbage, goats or wolves has won. After all the characters have eaten, the lowest one on the food chain still alive wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
