			<description>1994 anti-nationalized healthcare game in response to the early, failed attempts by the Clinton administration to introduce a system like Obamacare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to outlive the other players and benefit the most, financially, from a nationalized healthcare system.  The instruction book is filled with right-wing sarcasm -- the playing pieces represent various tropes like &amp;quot;pork barrel&amp;quot; etc. -- and the cards punish or benefit players (ala Community Chest and Chase) using hypothetical examples of pro-liberal or anti-conservative bias in the Federal government's bureaucracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Around the board, players get appointed to various positions in the healthcare bureaucracy and suffer various illnesses.  Each &amp;quot;position&amp;quot; has two spaces to win appointments to (rather than purchasing like in Monopoly), and unlucky players who land on your department have to pay their healthcare fees to you.  Beware of getting caught in the inner circle of healthcare waiting periods!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is similar in tone to Public Assistance or Capital Punishment, in both its conservative/Republican anger and its cringe-worthy cards and spaces.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
