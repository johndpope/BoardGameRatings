							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Specimens in Centralia (5E)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The operators are already on their way to Centralia, PA, where a coal mine that caught fire over a century and a half ago has finally died down. Forsyte Technologies&amp;copy; recently lost an incredibly important research subject from one of their labs on the outskirts of the metropolis&amp;mdash;a hyper-drake named Skrygrard&amp;mdash;and its tracking signature goes dark near one of the entrances into the subterranean network of passages. Coming back with the specimen alive means a lucrative 10,000 bytecoins, but reduced compensation beats dying in a soot-choked tunnel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specimens in Centralia is a 5th Edition-compatible adventure in the world of Hypercorps 2099. The module begins with the operators (the PCs) en route to Centralia's coal mines, the sight of a fire raging since 1962. Within is their quarry, but how they take it down and bring it back to Pittsburgh plays a large role with how much they'll get paid! While this adventure is ideal for a party of four operators of 3rd-4th level (hyper score 3), it is also suitable for regular PCs of 7th-8th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside Specimens in Centralia you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    An exciting roadside battle with the Giganot biker gang, the flaming deathtrap of the Centralia Mines, and a dramatic negotiation with the Ms. Gray that hired the operators in the first place&lt;br/&gt;    Hydraulic springheels, a new cybernetic enhancement for players to put a spring in their step&lt;br/&gt;    Two new vehicles: an armored van and motorcycle&lt;br/&gt;    Bill &amp;ldquo;Wheelz&amp;rdquo; Dryvar, an NPC to help get the party where they need to be&lt;br/&gt;    The giganot biker, giganot tough, flame drake, Skrygrard the hyper-drake, and a lethal Ms. Grey&lt;br/&gt;    The autofire, bleeder, and bullet spray ranged weapon qualities&lt;br/&gt;    Two maps: a wooded roadside and the Mines of Centralia, each with both player and GM versions&lt;br/&gt;    Pre-generated character: Sam &amp;ldquo;Cripple Beast&amp;rdquo; Jones, a meganaut barbarian with a penchant for breaking his foes&lt;br/&gt;    Pre-generated character: Jasmine Madrius, &amp;ldquo;Improv&amp;rdquo;, a vengeful savant monk deadly with her molecular whip&lt;br/&gt;    Pre-generated character: Harvey Lovecraft, &amp;ldquo;Nightmare Fist&amp;rdquo;, an abbernaut barbarian as lethal as he is freakish&lt;br/&gt;    Pre-generated character: Adrienne Cobol, &amp;ldquo;Warp&amp;rdquo;, an elusive parallel sorcerer and lawyer extraordinaire&lt;br/&gt;    A brief primer on the finished rules for using Hero Points and Cinematic Crescendoes in Hypercorps 2099&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
