							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City of Telndar</name>
									
			<description>from the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first supplement for the World of Esaene, BaDGe Publications' new role-playing game of high fantasy, is here! Far from the pirate raiders infesting the north end of the Castle Isles, the City of Telndar is slowly coming back into its own as a grand city of the Kingdom of Daggoth. Cut off for years during the invasions of Daggoth, the City of Telndar was fortunate to have been spared the worst of the wars. Noww, under the guidance of Baron Dandosen, the city is returning to prominence with its fine woodworking, and the King is chartering expeditions to explore the island. The voluminous stacks of the Library of St. Crux await scholars seeking enlightenment. And the political intrigue of the city is boiling over as the traditional families of the city want the Baron to return to the old isolationist ways before the reopening of trade to City of Telndar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
