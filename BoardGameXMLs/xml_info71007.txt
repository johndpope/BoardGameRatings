			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tall, ebon-skinned humanoid stands before you; his loose trousers and heavy cloak do not conceal a leanly muscular body, elf-like pointed ears, nor the ritual scars marking it. His eyes, black pits of night, watch you warily. Exodites are the most common of the races who once ruled Exodus, collectively called the First Ones. They may be Exodus&amp;rsquo;s first inhabitants; certainly they believe they will be its last. A hard, cruel people, exodites devote to perfecting their bodies and minds and consider anyone who does not share this passion little better than an animal. The religious among them believe they have the potential to reach a state of perfection rivaling that of their bloody god, Khayne. Outside of the hidden enclaves where the surviving First Ones dwell, exodites act as spies, assassins and bodyguards, moving through the shadows of Exodus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Statistics, abilities and rules for a Exodite (CR 1)&lt;br/&gt;     Statistics, abilities and rules for a Exodite Paragon (CR 4)&lt;br/&gt;     New Feat: Cloak of Shadows&lt;br/&gt;     Kobura Miniature Counters&lt;br/&gt;     Monster Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
