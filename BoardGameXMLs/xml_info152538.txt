							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Imperium Chronicles: Heroes of the Imperium Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Note: This game is no longer available. It was superseded by In Harm's Way Tactics which incorporates many of the mechanics of HofI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes of the Imperium is a cooperative card/board game set in a science fantasy universe called the Imperium Chronicles. Up to five players work together as heroes on missions against the enemies of the Imperium (Solo play is also supported).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each new game begins with players choosing from one of six hero archetypes: Assassin, Duelist, Grunt, Medic, Officer, and Psi Mage. Each hero is represented by a Stat card listing his attributes and default abilities/attacks. Each hero also has a deck of Ability cards from which the player can choose up to five. Some Ability cards are marked as &amp;quot;Advanced&amp;quot; and count as two cards. This allows players to choose fewer, but more powerful cards if they wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once player have chosen their heroes and Ability cards, they select a mission to be played. Each mission description includes which enemies will be encountered and what goals the player must meet to win. An Encounter deck can also be used (especially for solo players) to randomize which enemies will be fought during the mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each mission also includes a map of the game board. The board consists of several tiles that players assemble prior to the beginning of play. Paper miniatures, representing both heroes and enemies, are placed on the board and moved on a turn-by-turn basis. Each turn allows players to carry out several actions including attacking, movement, and using items. Control of the enemy side is either done by a single player who chose not to have a hero, or by hero players on a rotating basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemies in the game are grouped into three main factions: the primitive Ferans, slave-trading Ougluks, and the technologically advanced Warlock Industries. Each enemy, like the heroes, has a Stat card listing its attributes and default abilities/attacks. They do not, however, get additional Ability cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
