			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Good Neighbors, the Fair Folk have lived in peace with the humans of Still Hollow for centuries. But now, outsiders are coming into Still Hollow in search of gas deep beneath the earth.The Industry does not respect the old ways. Their machines disturb the dwellings of the Fair Folk, and the filth that seeps into the ground around their wells is deadly.&lt;br/&gt;In Good Neighbors, players take on two roles: a human who must deal with the politics of this new industry, and a fairy who feels the full spiritual damage of the Industry. Can your humans enact change to make Still Hollow safe again, or will your fairies need to enact their own justice? Find out in this Fate World of Adventure by Paul Stefko.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good Neighbors requires Fate Core to play.
