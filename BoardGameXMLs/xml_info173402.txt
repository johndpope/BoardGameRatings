			<description>One player rolls two dice and choose two cards (from the deck of nine cards). First card along with one die determines first part of the ball flight. First card is always revealed so your opponent can see it. In the first part of the ball flight, only important thing is that the ball cross over the net on the opponent's side of court. On that point your opponent can try to intercept your shot with volley, it is part of his judgement. The second card that, in combination with second die, determines second part of the shot is concealed from your opponent. That card tells which kind of shot did you choose (long shot, dropshot ....). In this part, most important thing for defending player, is to &amp;quot;read opponent mind&amp;quot; to anticipate wich shot  will he/she choose to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
