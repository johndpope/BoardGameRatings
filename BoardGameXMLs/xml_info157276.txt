			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drivin on a bus, running people over, shooting tanks and helicopters, just drivin on my bus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Bridge Bomber Bus you try to do as much destruction as you can. You can drive over people or shoot them with rockets. Bigger enemies like tanks and helicopters you won't be able to destroy by driving them over, you will have to shot them with your rockets. But be careful, tanks can shoot you back and take two rockets to destroy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
