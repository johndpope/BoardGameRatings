			<description>Publisher's Description:&lt;br/&gt;Defeat Sabretooth! One evening, while Jubilee thinks she is alone in the X-Mansion, she hears strange noises coming from the surrounding woods. She sets out alone to investigate, even though she knows it might be dangerous. Fortunately for here, Wolverine is secretly keeping an eye on her. Sabretooth's scent is in the air. . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wolverine was published as part of the Marvel Comics Super Heroes Game Book, and the board is a double-page spread of the book which is laid flat to play. It is a roll-and-move game where players use two tokens, representing Wolverine and Jubilee, along a track.  Each player in turn &amp;quot;rolls&amp;quot; the electronic die and moves one or the other token along the track, following any instructions on the space where they land.  Spaces may move players forward or back or cause them to lose or gain a turn. Since players have two tokens, a small element of strategy is introduced in deciding which token is more advantageous to move with each roll. First player to reach the finish with both tokens wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
