							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pod Station: Evacuate</name>
									
			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pod station has suffered a catastrophic system failure. The crew is almost entirely missing, but those who survived the destruction made it to the main hub. There's only enough power left to launch one evacuation pod. You must begin to reconstruct the pod station. Move from pod to pod as the station takes on a new shape. Search through laboratories to find an evacuation key and other survival necessities. Access computers to find evacuation codes and detect problems within the station. Then, get to your evacuation pod to escape before it's too late!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this modular board game, players must gain access to laboratories and computers in order to collect the cards necessary to evacuate. But, collecting isn't the only goal, as you must safely navigate your way to the correct Evacuation Pod to achieve the win. Fires, hull breaches, and power failures may need to be dealt with along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played solo as a survival game or with friends as a cooperative or competitive game. There are also several alternate game &amp;quot;scenarios&amp;quot; that alter rules, remove cards, and add more challenging limitations to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
