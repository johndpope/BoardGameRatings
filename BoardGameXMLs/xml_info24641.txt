							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lincoln&#039;s War</name>
									
			<description>Lincoln's War uses the same grid based system as the &amp;quot;Square Bashing&amp;quot; World War One rules, where the play surface is subdivided into 1 foot (30 cm) squares.  Units advance from square to square coming into conflict when they wish to advance into one of the opponent's square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed for a 6' x 4' table.  Terrain is abstracted; the individual squares are rated as open (little or no terrain) and closed (terrain that encumbers movement such as woods or towns).  Because figures are simply moved from one large square to another, basing standards are very relaxed; units can be based in almost any fashion and both sides need not be identical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game system includes rules for off-table effects such as cavalry scouting, supply and shortening/lengthening the scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scale is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infantry regiments are 3-5 bases.&lt;br/&gt;Artillery batteries are 1 base.&lt;br/&gt;Cavalry regiments are 3-4 bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual squares can hold up to 10 units of infantry or cavalry or 5 units of artillery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
