			<description>This game covers the last battle around Meiji-Ishin.&lt;br/&gt;One of the important Bakumatsu people, Takamori Saigoh decided to make a revolt in his home area, Satsuma (Kagoshima) in 1877 against his old friends and partners inside Meiji government.&lt;br/&gt;The map covers the whole Kyushu island and uses point to point system.&lt;br/&gt;The game has only 48 counters.  This is a small second game, but players can focus the important strategic decisions.&lt;br/&gt;The victory is basically determined by Saigoh's end.&lt;br/&gt;Historically he killed himself in the middle of his losing battle.&lt;br/&gt;But, in this game, if Saigoh player cleverly play the game, there's a chance of bloody stalemate which means that he can propose some of his desire to the government for this revolt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
