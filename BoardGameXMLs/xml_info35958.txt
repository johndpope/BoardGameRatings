							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Airship Adventures</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Players control fanciful Victorian Airships used to complete various Missions around the Globe. Background: The year is 1850 and Airships rule the Skies! Victory: The first player to accumulate 20 Victory Points is the winner.&amp;rdquo; Victory Points are lost or gained based on how successfully Missions are completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls an Airship which has six basic traits: Military, Exploration, Diplomacy, Transportation, Rescue, and Speed. Attachment and Crew cards help improve various traits. Each airship starts with five randomly drawn Crew cards and Attachment cards. The Crew cards represent exceptional people aboard the Airship. The Attachment cards represent Weapons, Tools, Rooms, and Equipment built into the Airship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: Three decks of cards (Mission Deck, Crew Deck, and Attachment Deck) and two ten-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
