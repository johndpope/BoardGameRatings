							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: Radical Rescue</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: Radical Rescue is a Game Boy game by Konami, released in November 1993. It is the third Game Boy game based on the Ninja Turtles franchise, following Fall of the Foot Clan and Back from the Sewers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story&lt;br/&gt;The player begins the game by taking control of Michelangelo, who must rescue the other turtles, along with Splinter and April O'Neil. Unlike other games based on the franchise, this is a scrolling action-adventure game reminiscent of the Metroid and the later Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Each turtle has a different ability which is necessary to finish the game. Michelangelo can hover using his nunchakus as a helicopter, Leonardo can drill the floor by spinning with his katana, Raphael can hide himself inside his shell to enter passages that are otherwise too small to enter, and Donatello can stick to and climb walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bosses are Scratch, Dirtbag, a Triceraton, Scale Tale, and Shredder (in this game known as Cyber-Shredder).&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_III:_Radical_Rescue,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
