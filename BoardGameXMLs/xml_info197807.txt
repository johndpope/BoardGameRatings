							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goody White&#039;s Book of Folk Magic</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Words from a Witch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goodwife Elizabeth White was a non nonsense witch born in the 17th century. Over the years she learned many spells, hexes, and rituals to deal with common concerns such as&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Hair Loss&lt;br/&gt;     Hunting&lt;br/&gt;     Impotence&lt;br/&gt;     Infertility&lt;br/&gt;     Love&lt;br/&gt;     Pregnancy&lt;br/&gt;     Sickness&lt;br/&gt;     Warts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;lacking an heir for her knowledge, she wrote it all down, creating Goody White's Book of Folk Magic. Now her legacy has been &amp;quot;translated&amp;quot; into game terms -- each of these 45 folk remedies is written in our own words, then presented as a spell and witch hex, as well as a ritual that any character can learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These spells are things that a hedge mage might learn, or a local wise woman, midwife, or superstitious farmer might use to make life a little easier. They add flavor to a campaign and some are things that even a famous adventurer would want to learn. Whether you allow your player characters to find an actual copy of Goody White's Book of Folk Magic or if you just use it as a source of new low-powered magic fro your campaign, these add flavor to a campaign and show that there is magic in the world beyond what happens in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
