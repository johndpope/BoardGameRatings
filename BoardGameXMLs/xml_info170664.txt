			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Colonial Lies is a story roleplaying game about secrecy and distrust set in the years before the American revolution. Wealthy &amp;ldquo;traders&amp;rdquo; of Jamestown cannot trust the Tidewater elite and the homogenous Puritans of the New England see new Amsterdam as a threat to their way of life. As such, the colonies have placed agents everywhere. Players take on the roles of spies, in service to the developing nation, in an attempt to undermine the clashing virtues of the colonies. Will the burgeoning America survive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Colonial Lies, the enemy is not the British, or even Mad King George III, but the other &amp;lsquo;nations&amp;rsquo; of pre-America, who are trying to maintain their wealth and independence at any cost. Everyone is a potential traitor against the might of the burgeoning nation &amp;mdash; now faced with new threats at every corner. Can the colonies survive in spite of themselves?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
