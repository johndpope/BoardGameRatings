			<description>The BIG Match in a Tiny Tin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 2-player card and dice game recreating the ﬂow and pace of a football/soccer match between two teams (Red and Blue), and is easily playable within 15-20 mins. It was originally designed to fit inside a standard Alto Mint Tin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using two standard ten-sided dice (2d10), this cracking little game helps to recreate all the ﬂow and jargon of a real football match, with substitutions, injuries, free kicks, corners, penalties, last-ditch saves, formation changes, players getting sent oﬀ and own goals too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compare team strengths in three outfield areas (Defence, Midfield, and Attack) to determine a basic modifier to the Target/Progress Roll and then roll the dice to try and move the ball between their outfield areas in an eﬀort to score goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are playable Bonus Action Cards for each team, Event Cards that are drawn every time a Progress Roll fails (allowing formation changes, introducing injuries, providing second chances, adding injury time and tactical changes, etc), and an Xtreme Event deck that allows for those extra special moments when things go amazingly good, or disastrously bad!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you download and play this game, please do leave any comments/feedback about your experiences &amp;mdash; several players have asked if I'm planning a larger, full-card version, with more options and events, varied time segments and tighter controls, and this is certainly something I might be taking a look at over the next few months... Others have asked if I'm planning any expansions with real football player and team names, and to be honest I'd encourage anyone who wants to do this to freely supply replacement team/player ratings if they prefer. Better yet, upload and share them here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks in advance for taking the time to download and try it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you get to play it, please do rate it and add a comment -- all feedback is appreciated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
