			<description>In this reaction the game, players take on the role of small piglets and mimic the big pig in the barn. They are grunting, smacking and even scratching their backs: But only the fastest piglet gets a corncob.&lt;br/&gt;Game play: One player roles the seven dice. Depending on the result the players have to do a certain action: for example, they have to grunt or they have to smack. The fastest one with the right action (the dice indicate the right action) wins the round and gets a corncob. The first player with seven corncobs wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
