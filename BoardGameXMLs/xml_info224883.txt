			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Top of the Tower&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this Near-Future, Nuclear Fusion Opera with a Noir twist, the Reactor controls the power, and the one who controls the power controls the building. If you control enough buildings, you control the sector, and then the whole city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two people are about ready to fight it out, Akiko and Castillo. Akiko already ascended to the upper floors of the building, but Castillo sees his opportunity to make a quick power grab, but he needs help and muscle. Akiko isn't blind to this, and she could use a little extra beef as well. But, with both of them at odds, maybe there's just enough room for you to force her out, keep him down, and ascend above the 200th floor yourself....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
