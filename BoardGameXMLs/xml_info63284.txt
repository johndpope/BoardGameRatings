			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;God exists.  Satan exists.  In the beginning, one of the two created the Heavens and the Earth.  But which one?  The vast majority of Christendom asserts that God is the Creator.  Since the birth of Catholicism, this has been the view of the Catholic church.  But, not all Christians view the world this way.  One group of early Christians, known as the Gnostics, believed the world to be a prison created by Satan to ensnare and bewilder countless souls, who would otherwise be deities themselves.  Thus, Christ came to teach us how to escape our delusional worldly bonds and assume our rightful place among the divine.  Needless to say, the Gnostic view of the world is at odds with the Catholic viewpoint.  So, in the fourth century A.D., the early Catholic Church systematically slaughtered the Gnostics.  The Church proved highly efficient in the art of genocide, but a few Gnostics managed to slip away.  Gnosticism survived, but only in secret. &lt;br/&gt; Gnostigmata is about faith.  How can a person believe in a divine Creator who has our best interests in mind without any hard facts supporting that assertion?  Is it reasonable to do so?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
