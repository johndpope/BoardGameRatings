			<description>&amp;quot;Tzuris is an avoidance game with bidding, an elaborate trump suit and a gimmick. The gimmick being that when you play a card, you don't play it in front of yourself but in front of one of your fellow players. This is done in such a way that by the end of each trick, each player will have a card face down in front of them. These cards are then turned face up and the winner of the trick is determined. So the idea is to use your own good cards to force opponents to take tricks which will, you hope, contain cards which will count as penalties against them.&amp;quot; Stuart Dagger, Counter, November 1999&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
