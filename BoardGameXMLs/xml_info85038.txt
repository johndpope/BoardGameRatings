							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ratz Fatz in den Kindergarten</name>
									
			<description>Kindergarten themed game in Ratz Fatz format. The game consists of picture tiles and three wooden figurines (boy, girl, teacher), a color die and a booklet with several game ideas for kids of various ages. &lt;br/&gt;The basic game idea is that an adult reads or tells a story or a poem, and the children have to grab tiles when they hear the names of the items on those tiles. The player with most tiles is the winner, but it is also playable with just one kid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other ideas presented in the booklet include memory games, grouping activities for the very young, and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
