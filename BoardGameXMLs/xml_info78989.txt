			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I've seen them! They're black demons with glowing eyes riding red dragons that spit death! Vendrest is lost. I'm getting out of here!&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt;-Tholiaz the Brewer to the House of the Mad in Velene&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vendrest is getting ready for war. Mercenaries and adventurers from all over the Archipelagos flock there to enter the service of rich merchants of the island. For a few months, ships have been disappearing, fields have been burning and nobody knows who's to blame. The land is prepared for all-out battle against whatever depredations the enemy should unleash. Now, if only the enemy would show up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The War of Shadows is the first in the Trilogy of Shadows campaign adventure series. Set on the islands of the Archipelagos, this storyline can be integrated in any d20 system fantasy world, or played as a setting all its own. More than just an adventure, The War of Shadows lays the foundations of an epic campaign. Are you ready for the tempest of terror soon to wash over the Archipelagos!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A different kind of d20 product-translated from Oriflam's French language La Guerre des Ombres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ideal for 1st- and 2nd-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
