			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A BROKEN WORLD!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Underpinning the fantastic reality of Ardeyn are the mechanics of a complex video game intended for a mass audience.  The codebase that formed Ardeyn&amp;rsquo;s recursive history still functions, altering the recursion in ways only known to its creators&amp;hellip; including the Betrayer himself.  But there are those who are born or translated with a special connection to this world, recognized as potential players or game designers.  For them Ardeyn can be a hyper-realistic version of what it was intended to be - a place of monsters and adventures guided by the rules of a game that was never played.  A recursion that can be shaped and molded as a game can by those who know its cheat codes and command line interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broken Immersion is a look at the underlying workings of a fantasy world built on modern game tropes and mechanics.  It tears back the veil of this mysterious land and exposes the very earthly roots that make it unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
