							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rupert&#039;s School-Time Game</name>
									
			<description>Game featured in the 1976 Rupert Annual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a simple roll and move game. Each player chooses a colour and will need 6 counters of that colour. Only one counter for each player will be in play at any time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players throw a die to move their way along a 50-space track. If a player lands on one of the six illustrated spaces, they must put their counter on the correct spot for that character. These spots are marked around the illustration in the centre of the board. That player then takes another counter of her colour and starts at square 1 again. Only one of her counters can be on any spot. The first player to have her 6 counters on the spots in the centre, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
