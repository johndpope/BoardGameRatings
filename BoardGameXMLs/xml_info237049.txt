							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The 12 Powers</name>
									
			<description>Powers can affect the board, players and the game mechanics. Players can tailor the game to suit their needs. Anything is possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a board, three power dice (with 6 different powers each, the third one is customization). In this game, you have tokens on the board (or default blue numbers) when you land, you roll a power die and use the power to use it for yourself, target your opponent or even the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first person/ team to reach 100 wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
