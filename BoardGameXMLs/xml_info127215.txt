							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bach&#039;s Seats</name>
									
			<description>You are a boxer.  You don't punch anybody; you work in a box making boxes for Bach's Boxes. The Bach family has made big bucks in the box business. They live in luxury based on the hard work of all their employees.  It's a dreary job with no advancement, but the job has one perk: The Bach's love entertainment. They buy the best tickets for every ball game, every play, every movie, every concert, every opera, and absolutely every show in town. They buy so many tickets that they always have tickets they can't use, which they give to the workers. Your objective is to schmooze the other employees to score tickets so you can party with your friends. The bigger the party, the more your friends will think of you. That's important, because right now your friends think of you as someone who makes minimum wage sitting in a box making boxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have employee cards and office cards.  First everyone simultaneously chooses and reveals an employee, then everyone simultaneously selects and reveals an office.  The employees go to the office where they were assigned.  Employees beat employees via a rock-paper-scissor mechanism.  The winning employee scores tickets for the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
