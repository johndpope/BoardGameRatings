							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brainy Quiz Contest</name>
									
			<description>Brainy Quiz Contest is a trivia game for children, published in India.  Each player has a token which they move along a track.  On each space, they spin a spinner to choose a trivia question category.  Then the quiz master chooses a card and asks them a multiple-choice question in the category chosen.  If the answer is wrong, the player must choose a &amp;quot;punishment&amp;quot; card requiring them to do some sort of stunt.  If the answer is correct, the player moves forward and answers another question, continuing until a wrong answer is given.  The first player to reach the end of the track wins, gaining the winner's crown and prize check.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
