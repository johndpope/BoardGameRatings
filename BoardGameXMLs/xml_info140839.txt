			<description>Expresso is a collect-and-serve card game for 2-6 people that plays in 30-60 minutes and can be learned quickly. Players take the role of a barista and use their salary and actions to buy and trade ingredients, to complete orders, and to earn tips. Each player is in charge of a section of the coffee shop and must fulfill a customer's orders &amp;ndash; or the orders of customers at nearby tables to steal tips! &amp;ndash; before the customer becomes impatient and leaves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expresso is a game of card gathering, trading and swindling to make the most money; you must walk the line between competition and cooperation with the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
