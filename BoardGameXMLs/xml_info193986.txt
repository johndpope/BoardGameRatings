							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Carnival of the Damned</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A band of villagers are trapped in a mist-shrouded carnival in the dead of night, facing death at every turn. Can they survive twisted oddities like the corpse-filled Tunnel of Love and the dreaded Bone Coaster?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Filled with fantastic art, the Carnival of the Damned unleashes nightmares into any campaign, with encounters refined and polished by the anguished screams of hundreds of players at conventions like Dragon Con and Gary Con!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For judges, the adventure fills many needs: author David Baity has crafted over 30 encounters and dozens of random threats. There is enough content for days of tournament play, or judges can select a smaller collection of favorite dangers for a quick DCC funnel session. For sandbox-style play, judges can extract individual encounters whenever a twisted challenge is needed in any old school system. There's even a haunting backstory for those looking to integrate the adventure into an extended campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And there&amp;rsquo;s clowns. Lots and lots of clowns.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(In addition to the 143 page digest-sized main book, game aids include a separate letter-sized printable appendix containing all the images from the adventure (making it easy to create handouts for your players), patron spell printouts, and a selection of cool paper miniatures.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
