							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation Apocalypse</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here, in one package, are four separate operational-level computer games that simulate major World War II land operations - from the Allied invasion of Europe to the large Allied airborne drops which became popular late in the war - all displayed in glorious High-Resolution color.  Every game poses a challenge to your ability to devise an effective battle plan and to carry it out by the judicious deployment of your forces in response to variable terrain (rough, forest, towns, and open), enemy units, and victory conditions.  OPERATION APOCALYPSE, like all SSI games, takes full advantage of your Apple so it serves as more than just the perfect administrator, bookkeeper, and referee.  It is also your ever-ready opponent, playing the German side in the solitaire scenarios.  With four levels of difficulty to choose from, you can make the computer as fierce of a warrior as you want it to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four games / scenarios are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Advance to Contact&lt;br/&gt;     Bridgehead&lt;br/&gt;     Invasion&lt;br/&gt;     Highway&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Roger Keating&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
