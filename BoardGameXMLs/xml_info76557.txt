							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hellcats and Hockeysticks</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;St Erisian's school for girls has stood for over a hundred years and survived war, plague, famine, demonic attack, strange explosions in the science block and countless attempts to get it closed by the government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, to be fair, not all of these disasters were the fault of the girls who study there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hellcats and Hockeysticks is a Role-playing game in which your characters are among the most feared and disreputable creatures of all - Schoolgirls!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At St Erisian's the girls are taught to be curious, forthright, inventive and above all, what they want to be, and to give hell to anyone who tries to stop them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed to be fast paced and fun, with plenty of oppotunities for chaos and destruction. Characters come from one of 9 'cliques' each with their own special ability and selection of skills. The system uses only 6 sided dice and is both simple and innnovative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hellcats and Hockeysticks is a stand alone RPG of chaos, anarchy and decidedly unladylike behaviour. It includes rules for all kinds of mayhem, from falling out with your friends, to creating weird science devices to using magic and summoning demons and zombies. Are you ready for school adventures on the bad side of the tracks?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
