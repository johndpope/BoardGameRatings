			<description>The giant vibrating board is the same as in Electric Football, except the only real section that's used is the diamond. The diamond is a track in which a plastic base runner can move around the bases. The batter turns on the board to have his batters run, and turns it off to have them stop at a base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attached to one end of the field is a large metal &amp;quot;fence&amp;quot;, which includes the scoreboard and an area above which home runs can be hit. The other end of the field has a smaller metal shield, containing a replica of the strike zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pitcher must use a plastic arm to flick a small magnetic chit (the &amp;quot;ball&amp;quot;) onto this shield. Behind the shield, the batter must try to figure out where the ball landed on the shield -- and can either take the pitch (for a strike or a ball) or whack the back of the shield with a different plastic &amp;quot;bat&amp;quot;. If the bat is struck near the ball, the ball will generally fly further -- sometimes even hitting your opponent in the face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rest of the board is the ball field, with clearly marked sections for &amp;quot;outs&amp;quot; where the fielders are. If the ball is smacked anywhere else, the fielder must flick the ball into the base areas with the pitching flicker, before the runner gets there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
