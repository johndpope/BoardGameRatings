							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lighthouse</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Longer than any of the inhabitants of the nearby fishing villages can remember has the Shallows Lighthouse stood in its place and the light of its giant glow orb kept fishermen and traders alike from running aground in the shallow coastal waters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lighthouse was built slightly off shore, quite an undertaking as solid foundations had to be sunk in the soft silt common around here. An undertaking, which could only be accomplished during low tide. On these foundations the tower of the lighthouse was built from massive blocks of red and white stone that have weathered decades or possibly even centuries quite well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On top of the tower a giant glow orb shines with a light, too bright to be directly looked upon from anywhere close bye, under a sturdy and well polished brass cupola. Only a pair of narrow and dangerously rusty iron ladders leads up here. Not that anyone had any reason to come up here for the longest time. Similarly the lighthouse is connected to the shore only through a narrow path of stones sunk into the silt, which breaks through the water level only at ebb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything was well with the lighthouse until recently. A few weeks ago it's light went out for the briefest of moments. Once its flickered to live again its color had changed to a malevolent yellowish green. And instead of warning away ships it has started drawing them to their doom like moths to the flame. Not even the land bound inhabitants of the nearby villages dare look in its direction anymore fearing to be drawn to it and their doom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one knows what has happened for sure. Maybe something terrible has taken up residence in the hollow interior of the tower? Or possibly something is lurking under the water that has taken on a suspicious oily sheen? Of course there is talk of ghosts haunting it as well, sailors lured to their doom by coastal pirates before the lighthouse was built or possibly said coastal pirates that were hanged for their crimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
