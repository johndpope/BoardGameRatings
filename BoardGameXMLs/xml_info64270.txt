							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rescue Roscoe</name>
									
			<description>Educational game where the instructional objective is to help learners understand the needs of and the issues surrounding companion animals. It will also encourage discussion of animal welfare topics such as pet overpopulation, animal abuse, responsible guardianship, and the human/animal bond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two levels of play. As the players travel around the board, they must answer questions posed on &amp;quot;Knowledge Cards.&amp;quot; Each card has a fact-based question. For a simpler level of play, the cards offer multiple choice responses which may be read as part of the question. For a more advanced level of play, players can be required to answer the questions without benefit of the multiple choice format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first to identify Roscoe, a lost family pet, so that he may be rescued from the local animal shelter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Game board&lt;br/&gt;     4 markers&lt;br/&gt;     Stack of 80 Knowledge Cards&lt;br/&gt;     Stack of 40 Compassion Cards&lt;br/&gt;     Dice&lt;br/&gt;     12 ID tag discs&lt;br/&gt;     Pre-printed ID sheets to write down information collected&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
