							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monsters as Player Characters</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement to the Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game rule system allows players to play characters of races which are normally monsters. If you do not already have a copy of the Basic Fantasy RPG rules, please visit the website and download a copy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is intended to be used to give players a chance to play characters of races not typically used for BFRPG, as they are usually known as &amp;ldquo;monsters&amp;rdquo; in the campaign world. But perhaps a Resurrection spell was cast, a Polymorph spell became permanent, or a player simply wanted to make a monstrous character. This is their chance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
