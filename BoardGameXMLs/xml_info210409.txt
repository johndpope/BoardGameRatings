			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally a gambling card game minigame that appeared in Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor and Might and Magic VIII: Day of the Destroyer, due to its popularity, 3DO released this as a stand-alone game. Players compete to build their tower to a certain size, gain a certain number of various resources, or destroy their opponent before they can build up. This can be played as a single-player game or two-player game via LAN or TCP/IP connection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
