			<description>HEREDIUM - Grundregelwerk (&amp;quot;Ground Rules Work&amp;quot; = Basic Rules Book)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A German post-apocalypse RPG with a positive outlook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher: &amp;quot;After five years of work, the German RPG forge has spawned new work: Heredium. Catchy modular rules support the exciting background. Cutting edge meets one of the most important issues currently. That which all fear now happens - with a dose of fantasy - in Heredium: Nature take revenge for her exploitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other RPGs, that play out after disaster, this act of chance gives humanity a new beginning. The innovative roleplaying system starts in October 2008 with this positive perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is on the brink. In the year 2190 AD an explosion rips the lunar surface. The force of the impact catapulted a chunk of the Moon towards blue planet - the piece flies by just above the Earth's atmosphere and throws the world's oceans into torment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the surface states and cultures are shaken by natural disasters shaken for a millemia. Finally, old foundations collapse, and the world community as such no longer exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten years pass, until the Earth regains its inner balance again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, only five civilizations exist, each dominated by the bulk of their continent, uniting technology and philosophy in a new foundation. A largely peaceful coexistence, but it is not be long until the nature of Humans drives them to new conquests and wars. And to exploit the natural world once more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Gaia awakes, and in her lap germinates poisonous seeds, willing to crawl to the surface to bloom and finally destroy the parasites on her back.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
