			<description>Back of the box: This game of humorous, fascinating, quirky and insightful tidbits offers knowledge on everything from sports and fashion to literature and architecture and everything in between. Packed with an enormous array of factoids, minutiae and random bits of wisdom, Vital Statistics is perfect for both knowledge hounds and pop culture fiends alike. From the cost of the first pair of jeans to the name and release date of the first color movie,rest assured, Vital Statistics has the answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When it is your turn you roll the die to determine what category the question will be from. The options are &amp;quot;Multiple Choice&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;High/Low&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Closest to&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you read the question, ALL players include you will write down your answer on your dry-erase board (6 boards and 6 dry-erase markers are included with the game) and once everyone has their answer written, all players reveal their answer and correct answers get a check on everyone board. Everyone knows everyone's score at all times (like golf).&lt;br/&gt;First player to 10 correct answers WINS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very laid back game and extremely well written questions. Unlike any other trivia game. Questions are unique and really fun. You definitely learn a thing or two while playing but because of the way the questions are done, you have a chance at getting any question correct (sometimes with a pure guess).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
