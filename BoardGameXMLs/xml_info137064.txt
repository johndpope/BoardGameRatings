GMs may use this adventure as they see fit, incorporating it into the overall adventure of The Razor Coast, or simply use it as a way to help characters build experience points and collect loot that will help them achieve success against the intrigues of The Razor Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Call of the Frog God is estimated at 36 pages for the Pathfinder version, and 28 pages for the Swords and Wizardry version, with full color art, and 3 maps of the environs and scuttled ships. Plus, part of the adventure takes place IN A WHALE! This adventure module will NOT be for sale after the Kickstarter, nor available via PDF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
