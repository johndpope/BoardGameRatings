			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GUTZ is a maze action game for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. The player controls a warrior who has entered a gigantic alien's innards, and who must defeat the internal organs before the alien destroys earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a flick-screen environment, where each room is populated with antibodies and blood cells that attack the player. The player can find different weapons that will work against different defence systems. The internal organs that the player must defeat requires several parts of a special weapon, and the goal of the game is to walk from room to room, and finding the different parts, and then finding the organ and destroy it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
