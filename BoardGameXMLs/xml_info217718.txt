							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Signature: The Handwriting Analysis Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a small box that contains several tear-off pads of sheets of several types, as well as 48 numbered cards with samples of famous people's handwriting on one side, and three choices as to whom the handwriting is on the opposite side. Also included is a booklet that goes into some detail about how handwriting analysis works, what can (and cannot) be deducted from it, as well as rules  for three variants of games that can be played, two of which use the cards included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FROM THE INSTRUCTIONS: &lt;br/&gt;Handwriting Analysis Games&lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing insights into your own personality, the forgoing tests may also be given to your friends, with you acting as amateur graphologist and analyzing their handwriting, signature, and doodles.&lt;br/&gt;The tests may also be used as a basis for a game of handwriting analysis. This can be done as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Players choose one of the four tests and analyze themselves according to the instructions for that test. They check off the results on the appropriate pad sheet.&lt;br/&gt;2. Players initial their pad sheets and pass them to one player who has been selected as reader.&lt;br/&gt;3. Reader shuffles the sheets and reads off, one by one, each player's personality traits. As each sheet is read, ALL players (except the reader) must attempt to guess whose personality traits are being read off.&lt;br/&gt;4. Each correct guess scores one point, and at the end, the player with the highest point count wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction to Famous People Games&lt;br/&gt;(Skip some info on separating the cards initially)&lt;br/&gt;On the face of each card are some lines of writing by a famous person. Underneath these lines, in the lower right hand corner, is a series of numbers. These numbers refer to t he personality traits on YOUR PERSONALITY PROFILE pad. They give you an instant analysis of t he writer of the line.&lt;br/&gt;For instance, in the example above, the writing shows traits 9, 17 and 21. Looking at the YOUR RESPONSIBILITY PROFILE pad, you can see that the writer has his head and heart in balance, possesses a dramatic flair, exaggerates and likes to be noticed.&lt;br/&gt;These personality traits are clues to the identity of the person in question. On t he back of each card you will find three famous names. One of them is the writer of the line on the face of the card. Using the personality clues mentioned above - and your intuition - Try to match the lines with their real writer. Answers will be found on page 24.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Famous People Game #1&lt;br/&gt;IN this game, any number of players may compete in identifying the writers of the lines on the front of the Famous People Cards. The Game is played as follows:&lt;br/&gt;1. The deck is shuffled and each player cuts. The player with the highest card (number in the upper left hand corner) deals.&lt;br/&gt;2. Dealer deals one card at a time to center of the table - handwritten lines up.&lt;br/&gt;3. Players have a maximum of one minute to look at the writing and compare the numbers beneath it to the numbered personality traits on their YOUR RESPONSIBILITY PROFILE pad sheets. This gives them some idea of the writer's personality.&lt;br/&gt;4. After one minute, the dealer turns the card over. On the back are the names of three possible writers of the lines on the other side. Players must pick the name of the real writer, using their knowledge of the of the people involved or simple intuition.&lt;br/&gt;5. Players record their answers on a sheet from the FAMOUS PEOPLE GAME pad. As each card is turned over, they write the LETTER (a, b, or c) of the famous person chosen in the box next to the NUMBER of that card.&lt;br/&gt;6. After all 48 cards have been dealt, The dealer reads the answers.&lt;br/&gt;7. Players check off correct answers in appropriate boxes on their FAMOUS PEOPLE GAME pads. Each check scores one point. Highest point total wins.&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: Game may be played as a form of solitaire, with one player turning over cards and attempting to guess as many of the famous writers as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Famous People Game #2&lt;br/&gt;This is a handwriting game for from two to six people.&lt;br/&gt;Players analyze the writing of other players and compare their own handwriting with samples written by famous people. The game is played in the following manner:&lt;br/&gt;1. Players take a sheet from the YOUR RESPONSIBILITY PROFILE pad. They fill in samples of their handwriting, following the instructions on the sheet. Each player then passes his sheet to the player on his left for analysis.&lt;br/&gt;2. Players analyze the handwriting samples, using the instructions. The sheets are then passed back to their writers - with check marks next to the personality traits revealed in their handwriting. &lt;br/&gt;3. One player is appointed dealer. He shuffles the deck and deals one card at a time to center of the table - handwritten lines face up.&lt;br/&gt;4. Players compare the numbers in the lower right hand corner of the card with the numbered personality traits checked off on their YOUR RESPONSIBILITY PROFILE pad sheets. The player with the largest number of matching traits claims the card and places it in the table in front of him.&lt;br/&gt;5. In the case of unmatched cards or ties, the card is considered dead and remains unclaimed in the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;6. After all 48 cards have been dealt, the player who has been able to claim the most cards is the winner. All players then have an opportunity to see which famous people they most resemble.&lt;br/&gt;7. Players turn over their cards revealing three possible famous writers for each card. The dealer then turns to the answer section below and, taking the cards of each player in turn, announces the names of the famous people whose personalities match his.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
