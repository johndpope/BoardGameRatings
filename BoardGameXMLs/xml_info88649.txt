			<description>Kō shōgi is a large-board variant of shogi, or Japanese chess. The game dates back to the turn of the 18th century and is based on xiangqi and go as well as shogi. Credit for its invention has been given to Confucian scholar Ogyū Sorai. Unlike standard shogi, pieces may not be dropped back into play after being captured. Promotion rules are complex, and the fates of several pieces are interdependent. The objective is to capture the opponent's commanding pieces: The general, plus the governor if present, or either the banner or middle army if not. Two players, Black and White, play on a go board ruled into a grid of 19 ranks (rows) by 19 files (columns) with a total of 361 intersections. Each player has a set of 90 pieces of 34 different types. The pieces are round and flattened like go stones. In all, the players must remember 65 different moves. The pieces are generally of the same size, though black pieces may be slightly larger than white pieces. Each piece has its name in the form of one or two Japanese characters marked on its face, in white on black stones and in black on white stones. On the reverse side of most pieces are other characters in red; this side is turned up to indicate that the piece has been promoted during play. - Wiki (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko_shogi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko_shogi&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
