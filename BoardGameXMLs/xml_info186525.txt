							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Surrender Unto Caesar: The Siege of Alesia, 52 BCE</name>
									
			<description>Surrender Unto Caesar is the 17th game in the Pocket Battles series of games from LPS, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surrender Unto Caesar is a complete mini-game with map and rules (on the back of the postcard) and counters which need to be cut out. Also needed for play is a standard deck of playing cards and 1D6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game goes for 4 turns, divided into multiple rounds. Players each draw a card to determine who goes first that round. A turn ends when both Jokers have been drawn from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map is divided into Siege Wall Areas (SWA), and each player takes one action (sometimes two actions, occasionally none) in any one SWA. Actions cause combat losses or reduce Roman/Gallic Resistance Levels (RRL/GRL). A player loses once their RL reaches 0. The Gallic player also wins if at the end of any turn Vercingetorix is in a SWA free of Roman infantry units. If the Gallic player hasn't won by the end of turn 4, the Roman player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
