			<description>The End is Near bills itself as &amp;quot;the hilarious game of doom-and-gloom cults.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take the role of somewhat outlandish prophets who have received a vision of the end of the world sometime between 1991 and 2000.  In order to &amp;quot;win,&amp;quot; you must have the most converts in your cult when the world ends (or, if the world somehow makes it past 2000, at the end of the game).&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Players perform various (dice-determined) actions to raise cash and/or gain converts each turn, as well as reacting to signs and using event cards to hamper other cults' progress -- all the while keeping one eye on the calendar...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
