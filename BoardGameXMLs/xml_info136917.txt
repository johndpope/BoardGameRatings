			<description>Only flying the real aircraft is more realistic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the most realistic aircraft handling ever achieved on a PC based flight simulation with the totally rewritten flight models of MD-83, MD-88 and B747-400. Three years of research result in highly sophisticated flight equations based on true inertia system, true airflow calculations, detailed calculations of forces even down to tyre deformations, that warrant an astonishingly realistic behaviour of the airplane, both in ground and airborne handling. Revised atmosphere and grossly enhanced weather effects like wind turbulence, rain, snow as well as runway surface calculation allow realistic ground handling in steady or gusty crosswind, taking into account dry, wet, snowy or icy runways. Explore the edges of the airplane envelope ... Want to see, whether you can loop or roll your favourite airliner? Good luck! Stress calculations will give you an idea when your aircraft disintegrates in the air - however, aircraft will maintain flyable, but you will need to deal with asymmetric lift, asymmetric drag, flamed out engines and much more, if you overstress the airframe, as you may loose parts of your wings, slats, flaps, tailplane or cause engine failures. Touch down hard, and experience the skidding experience with a partly collapsed gear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aircraft Abstraction layer, short AAL, the technology behind the new flight model, makes flying easy, as airplanes are designed to be flown by average pilots, and teaches the right, real world handling techniques used by real world pilots. Be ahead of your airplane, that's the key to success in flying your aircraft - the inertia of the plane now forces you to think ahead of your airplane, just as real aircraft do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And of course, who wants to fly the famous Dumbo will be able to do so, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AS2 features all systems, that the handling pilot will have to deal with, including fully featured Autopilot and Main Control Panel (MCP), Flight Management Computer (FMS), Thrust Computer, Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS), Traffic and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) and many more systems. The handling Pilot will be relieved from handling other systems by the virtual first officer, who therefore takes care your workload as flying pilot will not become critical - as in the real plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aural Alarms (e.g. GPWS, TCAS, configuration alarms), voice communication with the first officer and improved sounds for touch down, stall warning and other aircraft related sounds have been implemented using real world sounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AS2 comes with a 300 pages manual in printed form (150 pages thereof being reproductions of Aerad Airport and ILS charts), teaching all relevant methods of handling an airplane, not only in windless situations, but crosswind, gusty winds, windshear and all levels of turbulences, that make an ILS approach in clouds really demanding. In addition three reproductions of Aerad enroute charts covering Europe and North Atlantic come with AS2, as well as laminated checklists for the MD-83, MD-88 and B744.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AS2 comes as a stand alone package with an easy installation under DOS and Win95/98/ME.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
