			<description>&amp;quot;Mario Golf: World Tour (マリオゴルフ ワールドツアー?) is an upcoming golf video game for the Nintendo 3DS. As with majority of the games in the Mario Golf series, it is being developed by Camelot Software Planning and published by Nintendo. The game was first announced on February 14, 2013, in a Nintendo Direct presentation. It is the sixth game in the series, and will be the first one in almost a decade, since 2004's Mario Golf: Advance Tour for the Game Boy Advance. The game is scheduled for release sometime during Q2/Q3 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mario Golf: World Tour is a golf simulation video game. The basic premise mirrors the basis of golf, the player aims to hit a golf ball with a golf club across a golf course in order to hit it into the target hole in the lowest number of strokes. The game in particular employs an arcade-like approach to golf, emphasizing simple, straight-forward controls and faster paced gameplay over realism. Despite this, some courses will be modeled to look like real-life courses, while others will be Super Mario themed environments. The game will continue to employ the gameplay mechanic of &amp;quot;Super Shots&amp;quot;; when chosen by the player, they allow for extra distance when hitting the ball, although only a limited number of them are allocated per course, creating a strategic aspect to their use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls characters from the Mario franchise. Confirmed playable characters include Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong, Wario, Waluigi, and Bowser.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mario Golf: World Tour&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
