			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the beginning of the Third Cycle of the endless Abyssal War, the First Kingdom fell before the onslaught of the demons. Despite this defeat, the gods dispensed rewards to the heroes of the war. The cat heroes were granted a gift of magical golden cows that provided an endless supply of delicious milk that could be claimed by any righteous cat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the centuries, cows were lost to chance, murder, or negligence until but one remained. The last golden cow was taken to the greatest Temple of the Cats. Tragically, the priests eventually succumbed to greed and kept all the milk to themselves. Because of this selfishness, the gods cursed the priests with endless thirst (and gigantic hairballs) and took the cow from them. However, they ruled that if a cat were cunning enough to learn the location of the golden cow, brave enough to recover it and generous enough to share the milk, then the magic milk would flow again for all cats. To ensure that the cats would have a tough time of it, the gods turned over the creation of the dungeon to Yote, a god of trickery. Unfortunately, he allowed his nephew Scradoo to help design the dungeon. After it was completed, the dungeon was given appropriate canine and milk based guardians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since that time many a cunning cat has set out on the search for the golden cow. However, all have failed. While the very cunning were sometimes able to find it, they either perished in the dungeon or failed the final test. It is now time for new heroes to search for the golden cow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon of Leche: Search for the Golden Cow is a Pathfinder Role Playing Game compatible adventure. It is a humorous adventure intended for a party of 10th-12th level. it is followed by Temple of the Rats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are some of the features of the adventure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A canine and dairy themed dungeon crawl with two scoops of monsters and traps on top.&lt;br/&gt;     A humorous adventure that still provides serious play.&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed maps for the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;     New monsters (Golden Cow, Butter Golem, Cheese Golem, Cheese Hungering Mouse Swarm, Ice Cream Golem, and Yogurt Ooze).&lt;br/&gt;     New spell (Create Milk).&lt;br/&gt;     Full statistics are included for all encounters&amp;mdash;no need to look up monsters.&lt;br/&gt;     Robust opportunities for puns, jokes and combat.&lt;br/&gt;     Not fat free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
