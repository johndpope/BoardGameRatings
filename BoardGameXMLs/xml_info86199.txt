			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greetings and Well Met, Friends!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Calrith's Catalog of Curious Conjury, the realm's only inclusive guide to simple sorcery and amateur arcane artistry. Perhaps you are merely a dabbler looking to expand your powers in bold and creative ways. You may be a mighty master of magic who seeks knowledge on how to get the most of the least of your abilities. Or you may lie somewhere in-between. Whatever your situation, whatever your profession, the spells thusly contained will be of a surprising aid in your day-to-day life, be you mage or minstrel, druid or diviner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Calrith Cazaaar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Fifty New Cantrips. 0-level spells for every spellcasting class and every situation. Everything from utilitarian sorcery to specialized magic. Low-level magic has always been boring and basic, but these new spells can give any caster a much needed boost at low levels.&lt;br/&gt;     Three new low-level spells. Calrith&amp;rsquo;s cantrip cannon unleashes multiple cantrip effects simultaneously. Calrith&amp;rsquo;s cantrip cascade gives you the long-running magical demonstrations you&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted and props and scenery is a must have for any bard. &lt;br/&gt;     Seven New Feats open up low level casting to any class and enhance the cantrip and orison-wielding power of devoted casters.&lt;br/&gt;     Two new creatures. The origami animal and the cantrimp. Origami animals are animated pieces of paper that do tricks and can fulfill simple tasks while cantrimps are the inevitable result of carelessness with magic. As always these creatures feature full variant rules support and alternate genre information for easy adaptation.&lt;br/&gt;     Hedge Mage: A new NPC class, the hedge mage is a self-taught caster who can copy scrolls and make magic items but cannot cast on the fly. Part con-man, part snake-oil salesman and part junk-merchant, these self-taught dabblers can undercut the standard market price for magical equipment so long as reliability isn&amp;rsquo;t a big sticking point. &lt;br/&gt;     Calrith Cazaaar: A new NPC and a living example of the Hedge Mage class. Calrith has a deal for you, even if it is too good to be true.&lt;br/&gt;     Gameplay Variants for Low-Level Casting: Skill-based cantrips, bonus cantrips based on ability scores, 0-level casting for Paladins, Blackguards, Assassins and Rangers, 0-level domain spells for Clerics and variant spell-mishap charts let you customize your campaign to suit the&lt;br/&gt;     Variant Rules Support: Like all Octavirate products, Octavirate Presents: Simple Tricks and Nonsense provides quick-reference variant rules support for each creature and NPC. In addition to the standard rules for wounds/vitality, defense bonus, armor as damage reduction, modern/3.0 damage reduction, sanity loss, taint, magic rating, spell points, honor and reputation this volume presents spell lists for Mages and Adepts for modern d20 gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
