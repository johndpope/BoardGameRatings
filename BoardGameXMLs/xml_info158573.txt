							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mummy</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Normally when people die their souls are claimed by Death and dragged across the bleak threshold of the Black Gate. What awaits them, who can say: maybe it transcends into some heavenly realm, maybe it gets reincarnated...or maybe there is only a cold oblivion. It is this unknown that instills mortals with fear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through status, sacrifice, or knowledge Death no longer holds any dominion over your fate. When you die your soul will be unconstrained by its cold hands, free to travel between the land of the living and dead as you wish. For you death is not an end, but merely a new beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the skeleton the mummy is a change to play something out of the ordinary, or perhaps give a character another chance at (un)life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the skeleton the mummy is unkillable: your enemies can rip you apart or smash you to dust, but in time you will return to plague them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unleash terrible curses, suffocate them with sand or scarabs, bury them alive; woe to any who disturb the mummy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This playbook comes in two parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first is a 17-page, pdf that features the mummy playbook as you would find in the Dungeon World book, as well as a &amp;quot;director's cut&amp;quot; section that explains some of the fiction, and some extra features like new dungeon gear, magic items, and moves that did not make the initial cut.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second part is an actual letter-sized character sheet with some custom graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
