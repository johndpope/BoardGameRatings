			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2052 and Mars has been colonized for 32 years, you are a Primus Ranger, the only law on this god-forsaken rock. It truly is a forgotten place, most of the corporations that funded the colony pulled out after the Great War of 2041 leaving behind struggle and decay. Being a Ranger is a dirty job, only tough men and tougher women would accept the badge. Crime is a way of life for the people on the Red Plant, they struggle to feed their families and fight for what resources are left. But life goes on and the machines keep on turning, the great platinum mines located in the great scar, Valles Marineris, continue to spew out riches that are not seen by the people working them. With so few Rangers crime is a large part of everyday life on colonies. Robbery, aggravated assault, burglary and homicide are but a few of the sins committed daily among the colonies. Red Coma, a drug made from chemicals used in the mining process is everywhere, destroying lives and tearing apart families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every day you strap on your gun and badge might be your last, every shift feels like a lifetime. Are you are a beacon of light surrounded by darkness or will you succumb to the corruption? Will you rise above it all and become legend?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
