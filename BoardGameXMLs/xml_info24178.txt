							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Siege of Draman Del</name>
									
			<description>Draman Del is an ancient fortress city in a mountain pass, the only pass between the west and east lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The west is represented by a confederation of kingdoms (Nath, Drakand, Draman, Randrom, Svariji, Land people) formerly known as &amp;quot;Draman&amp;quot;. Draman Del is the only fortification against the east people, the barbarians called Zenith; if it should fall, the barbarians may swarm over the west kingdoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Seven Black Generals all host a shard of the soul of the evil god Zadrak and have been asleep for thousands of years but now, unknown to all, they are awakening. One of them, Xishayah, under the name of Kan Zenith, has gathered the nomadic Zenith tribes and is leading them to attack the west. To do this the legendary fortress of Draman Del must fall before General Adran arrives with reinforcements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The beautiful map shows a top-down view of the Draman Del fortress. The entire city was built using a 3D modeling program and rendered it with textures and shades. On one side are placed some useful charts.The map is 22x17 inches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside The Siege Of Draman Del you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-A set of rules,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Four mapsheet (game board)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-One countersheet with a total of 287 counters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Tables and charts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-PDF Version only&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
