			<description>Vulpes is the classical logical game created by Marek Łukaszewicz in 2013. This strategic game for two players is played on the board 8x9 squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game each player has nine pawns (hunters)  and one king (fox). The white chessmen go first. The first move is made by the white king, then a white pawn (two moves), then the black chessmen can make two similar moves.&lt;br/&gt;                                                               &lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to eliminate the opponent's king (fox) from the chessboard, or to block it so that it cannot move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General rules of the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not possible to jump over the opponent's chessmen. &lt;br/&gt;                                                               &lt;br/&gt;King (fox) moves vertically, horizontally and diagonally at least two squares at a time. The opponent's king is captured when two kings are on the same line without a single pawn between them. When two kings are on adjoining squares capture is not possible (the king moves at least two squares at a time) and the king is blocked as if by a pawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pawns (hunters)&lt;br/&gt;The pawns (hunters) can move one square at a time in all directions. It is not possible to eliminate the pawns, so the initial number of 9 pawns for each player remains the same for the duration of the game. Pawns may only move onto an empty square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who eliminates the opponent's king or who blocks it so that it cannot move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
