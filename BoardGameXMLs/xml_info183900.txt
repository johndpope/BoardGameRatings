							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crabs in a Crate</name>
									
			<description>Crabs are the perfect example of what a team should never be. When one is placed in an open crate, it quickly scuttles out. But when multiples are placed in a crate all the other crabs will never let the one escape in their own attempt to climb free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crabs in a Crate enjoys the fun hearted frustration of exactly that situation. Trying to be the ONE to escape when there is more than just you in the crate. Players will do their best to help their crab escape by playing cards that let them push, pull, piggyback and climb their way out of the crate. &amp;quot;Why not play nice and just race to the top?&amp;quot; one might ask. Escaping isn't the only way to win, if you are the crab to gain the most points by pulling down their opponents you can win!&lt;br/&gt;Game can handle 3-6 players in a thirty-ish minute game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
