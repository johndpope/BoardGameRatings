			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The garrulous old bargeman waited until his listeners were gathered on the deck, then he began to recount the ancient legend: &amp;quot;Once, before the canals were built, this was a great nation, a coastal nation, whose sea-ships fared far and wide across the world. It was ruled by mighty and wise leaders. The greatest of these Coast Lords was Noldes Bartarigan, called the &amp;lsquo;Emperor Who Turned His Face Skyward&amp;rsquo;, and the &amp;lsquo;Lord Whose Voice Becomes the Sun&amp;rsquo;. He was entombed up there, on the plateau, in an ageless tomb, provisioned for all Eternity.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Face of Mars is a Savage Worlds adventure for three to five characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
