			<description>Connect five... with a twist!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rotex is a new two-player board game where you try to connect five in a row on a rotating board. Each turn consists of placing a tile of your color, and choosing a region of the board to rotate one notch clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Your objective is to be the first player to get five tiles in a row in any direction.&lt;br/&gt;    On each turn, you must place a tile of your color on an empty space on the board. You must also select one of the seven Rotators to rotate a region of the board one notch clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;    The game ends when a player gets five in a row, or when there are no more spaces left on which to place a tile.&lt;br/&gt;    If neither player gets five in a row, or both get five in a row at the same time, the game is a draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Online Multiplayer &amp;ndash; Invite a friend, or let Game Center find you a match.
