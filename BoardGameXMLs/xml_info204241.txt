							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Red X: Facility 342</name>
									
			<description>Red X: Facility 342 is a hidden role playing game where team loyalty is constantly changing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are either part of an alien race that reproduces by taking over the mind and body of a living host, or part of the research team that is attempting to assemble a purification device that will cure the infected players, ultimately saving the entire human race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red X: Facility 342 requires multiple playing areas that allow players to go on missions in order to collect parts, but BEWARE, when left alone with an alien you are in danger of being infected yourself. Two players start off already infected. The rest of the players are human researchers, by the second round you don't know who you can trust anymore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roles are assigned by passing out DNA Verification Cards at the start of the game. Players choose a Head Researcher and then get sent on a mission with one other player. Mission Rooms are isolated areas located in other parts of the house. Decided by a dice roll researchers may be infected by the alien they were unknowingly paired up with or the researchers could possibly return with a part to the machine needed to kill off the aliens. The aliens win if they can infect the entire research team; the researchers win if they can collect all the parts needed to build the purification device. Either way this exciting hidden role playing game will keep you guessing the entire time.&lt;br/&gt;________________________________________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;There's a lot of social deduction games out there. What makes yours different? What makes your game special? Why do you enjoy it?&amp;quot; - Aaron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great question Aaron,&lt;br/&gt;What makes Facility 342 different from what is out there?&lt;br/&gt;I created my game for a couple reasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First was because of the number of players current social deduction games can have. We found ourselves with 10-15 players (5-7 couple) quite often. The Resistance cannot be played with that many people. We could play Werewolf but I do not like how you eliminate players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second I wanted to add a new element to the social deduction game. Players loyalty can change during game play in Facility 342. What better scenario than body snatchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lastly I wanted a social deduction game that had a role playing feel to it. In my game you have to physically leave the game table to go on a mission with another player. This allows things to happen in private that can affect the whole game. This also allows players to talk in private about their plans and they can use this time to figure out what is going on, or trick players without the interruptions of other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
