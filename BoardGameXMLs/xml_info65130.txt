							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dwellers in the Darkness</name>
									
			<description>Pusblisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Darkness&amp;quot; is an area of perpetual night found many hundreds of feet beneath the surface of the Karboskian Marches. Connected with series of cracks, fissures, tunnels, and underground rivers the cavern system stretches for hundreds of miles and is filled with enclaves of dangerous denizens. Few who dwell upon the surface world know more than legends of the beasts and villains that dwell within the alien world below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dwellers in the Darkness describes a unique new area of game play for adventurers to explore in the Haunted Highlands setting in the form of the fabled Undercity of Ulgakur. Brief statistics and treasures of important persons the players may encounter are also included. Of course there are the obligatory tables for generating random encounters and events as well as lists of adventure options and story seeds are sprinkled throughout the product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike a traditional setting product, Dwellers in the Darkness offers a broad amount of statistics for fiends, friends, and foes. Most of these characters that the players may encounter have a story seed, or some desirous item which could lead to a fantastic adventure. Unlike a true adventure product, there is no &amp;quot;exact ending&amp;quot; or goal that the PCs are expected to accomplish. Instead Dwellers in the Darkness is intended to be player driven. Players should feel the freedom to explore. There are no rails or steel wheels attached to their actions here. Any of the underworld locations detailed here could serve as a base of operations for further exploration of the Darkness, or even deeper delving into the famed Crater of Umeshti.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dwellers in the Darkness is an adventure setting for the Castles and Crusades Fantasy Role Playing Game system printed under the Open Gaming License (OGL). With the detailes provided herein, a Castle Keeper (CK) should find more than enough information to begin an adventure campaign set amongst the subterranean civilizations detailed herein. Dwellers in the Darkness is compatible with DB 1: Haunted Highlands, and is an expansion of that setting, detailing a variety of settlements found in the subterranean places bordering  DB 2: The Crater of Umeshti and DB 3: The Deeper Darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The campaign material found herein is suitable for all levels of play and is designed to be scaled to best suit the Keepers adventure needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
