			<description>This Milton Bradley game #4037 featured an unusual way of determining how many spaces to move during a turn. You determined your move by snapping wooden disks from red circular spaces on the four corners of the board into the numbered sections on the right and left margins. If your button landed between two movement squares then you moved the total of the two squares. The object of the game was to obtain the most pieces of eight by moving a man over the various colored circular spaces, from the starting space to the finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
