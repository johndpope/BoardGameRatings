			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How can you add more conflict and characterization to your love story?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story Design Volume 14 - A romance plot features the protagonist falling in love with a supporting character or even a co-protagonist. The antagonist doesn&amp;rsquo;t want this to happen, and conspires to keep the lover apart. There is often some misunderstanding or miscommunication that creates a rift in the relationship. Throughout the story the protagonist must overcome obstacles to finally be together with their one true love and live happily ever after.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Examples of the romance plot include Cyrano de Bergerac, Pride and Prejudice, The Time Traveler&amp;rsquo;s Wife, Tristan and Isolde, and Wuthering Heights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story Design: The Romance covers all of the elements you need to prepare in order to tell a love story. It's based on concepts explored in Story Structure for Writers and Roleplayers, also published by Dancing Light Press. It's a big book that goes into greater detail on how to get the most out of the three-act structure, as well as developing a three-phase series (campaign, if you prefer) with a clear beginning, middle, and end. If you want to use your favorite roleplaying game system to tell stories with more depth than kill monster, get treasure, repeat (not that there's anything wrong with that), it is worth looking into.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
