			<description>Subtitle: An expansion for Broken: The Memory of Solaris&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Void survivors who make it to the moon are always surprised during their last moments. They are surprised the moon is here. This led me to thinking about the dust storms. They must not be a natural phenomenon. The darkness that sweeps over the land for long periods of time must be magical. It would mean the beautiful shining pearl in the night sky which sang in siren&amp;rsquo;s notes to my ancestors is no longer there. It is not seen by anyone, not even the void survivors struggling above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The void survivors are surprised by the denizens of the lunar surface. That is a darker and more grisly tail but we keep it short. Visitors are not welcome. They haven&amp;rsquo;t the means or the strength to survive. Their meat is sweet and few resist their hunger.&lt;br/&gt;- Navage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
