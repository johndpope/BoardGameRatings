			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;$10,000.00 cash for you....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 31-ounce solid sterling silver dragon is hidden in the United States.  Information needed to find the silver dragon is in this programmed fantasy adventure.  The person who actually finds the silver dragon gets to keep it and claim a $10,000.00 cash prize from Metagaming.  If it has not been found by September 1, 1985, a drawing will be held from cards in this adventure that have been mailed to Metagaming.  Any of you might win. &lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;Metagaming brings you a real live treasure hunt!  This isn't just reading and playing about treasures.  Perhaps you will be the first to decipher the clues and go get the silver dragon and win $10,000.00.  It's all up to you.  You may be the one to hold that dragon in your hands knowing you beat thousands to it.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
