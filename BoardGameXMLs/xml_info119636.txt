							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">All Fall Down</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;All Fall Down is a group storytelling game in which the objective is to be the last player to fall victim to the plague or depression. In All Fall Down each player takes the role of a child living in a small village during a horrible outbreak - there is no gamemaster in this game. Throughout the course of the game the players' characters will choose to either remain inside, alone, or go outside where they may play but where they also have a greater chance of contracting whatever foul disease has befallen their community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For four to ten players. This game involves storytelling and does not involve combat mechanics of any type. Intended for mature audiences only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
