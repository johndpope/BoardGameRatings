							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ironborn of Questhaven</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ironborn: a race of artificial creatures usable as player characters, with customizable ability packages that provide unprecedented flexibility at character creation. These ability packages give you an optimal choice for each class you wish to play. However, ironborn are not superior to existing races and are still playable as 1st-level characters. Included with this is a plug-and-play 1st-person point-of-view descriptive text that allows for an easy introduction of this new race into your existing campaign as though the race only came in the campaign world recently. In addition, each ironborn has a burden, or an inherent urge to perform the duty for which it was constructed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Updated from 3.5 to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, this product also includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    New descriptive text told from an ironborn perspective&lt;br/&gt;    22 ability packages&lt;br/&gt;    10 feats&lt;br/&gt;    The ability to create your own Ironborn Cohort&lt;br/&gt;    The Constructed Sorcerous bloodline&lt;br/&gt;    Clockwork Familiar template&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the same designer who crafted the hugely successful Evocative City Sites and the best-selling Feats 101 comes the first book in the extraordinary Questhaven Campaign Setting. This new line brings you the best of the 3.0 and 3.5 Open Gaming Content updated for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Each element is customized yet kept modular, providing game components beyond the core products helping to create an evocative campaign experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
