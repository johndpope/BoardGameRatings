							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jogo Mulan</name>
									
			<description>Jogo Mulan is a roll-and-move race-to-the-finish board game based on the cartoon, Mulan. The board depicts fifty-seven spaces that players have to move through to get to the finish. If players land on specially-coloured spaces, they refer to the instruction sheet (which comes in both Portuguese and Spanish) to see what happens to them (e.g. miss a turn, move to another space).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published by Trisan Editores, a Portuguese entertainment media company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
