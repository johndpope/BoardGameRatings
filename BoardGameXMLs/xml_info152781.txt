			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teamwork traits are a subset of social traits that reflect your working relationship with your comrades; how you encourage them, lead them, follow them, or your bond and friendship with them. Sometimes they benefit, sometimes you benefit, and sometimes you both benefit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enclosed herein, are 11 teamwork traits for your PFRPG compatible game world. Traits such as &amp;quot;Bait and Tactics&amp;quot;, let you feint an enemy, allowing your other allies with this trait to also consider that enemy flat footed. While &amp;quot;Follow My Lead&amp;quot; allows one ally to follow directly behind you over difficult terrain without penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Working Together makes the Work go Faster&amp;quot; nets you and an ally a bit more gold per week on your Profession Skill checks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be &amp;quot;Jealous of Your Rival&amp;quot; or have a &amp;quot;Competitive Friendship&amp;quot;. It's your team, and everyone has different traits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher update 8/27/13:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 bonus teamwork traits added Entourage, Forgotten Face, Hype Man, and On Your Feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have a teamwork trait idea?
