			<description>Although the legal moves in this game are defined by a list of 88 words, Word Chess is more like a battle than a word game. Players have contrasting sets of tiles, and each turn they place tiles on the board or move existing tiles, four at a time, on squares of their own color.  Each set includes one X and five each of N (which can be rotated to form a Z), E (which can also be used as M or W), and O.  The object is to get an X to the last rank, or to capture the opponent's X by surrounding it.  Moves can only be made adjacent to previously placed tiles, and all of a player's tiles must form words diagonally at the end of each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Description from Nov. 1984 GAMES Magazine, p. 33)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
