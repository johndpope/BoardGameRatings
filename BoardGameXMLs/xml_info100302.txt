			<description>Shuffle deck. Deal out to each player one card at a time until all cards are dealt out. Each player checks their cards and discards all pairs. The player to the left of dealer offers their hand to the player on their left hiding cards from their view. That player then takes one card from the hand. Again, any pairs are discarded. Playing continues. &amp;quot;The Boss&amp;quot; card can be passed around several times. The object is to be left with &amp;quot;The Boss&amp;quot; card. Finally, when all pairs are laid down, there will be one person left with &amp;quot;The Boss&amp;quot; card. That person is &amp;quot;Boss of &amp;lsquo;The Family&amp;rsquo;&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
