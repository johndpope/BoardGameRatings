							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">String &#039;Em In</name>
									
			<description>String letters together to form words and watch the grid shift and shrink with every correct one in this slick and addictive word game. You have a set time (from 30 minutes to 30seconds) to make as many words as you can from a grid of letters. Score points for every word made according to the value of the letters and the length of the word. Clear the grid to earn bonus points. Features include 'Swap Letters': three opportunities to swap letter tiles; 'Hot Word': find the special word to score double and 'Power Plays': every word scores double or three times the points for a limited time. String 'em In is a strategy filled word game with a ticking clock. You'll need to think strategically to win more points and the clock is always ticking!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
