			<description>This tiny two-player board game consists of two cardboard pigs mounted on wooden stands, and a long unfolding paper strip (13&amp;quot; x 3&amp;quot;) with horizontal lines representing 28 steps from Home to Market. A teetotum is used to advance each pig in turn, with every step including an event that cause the pig to either gain or lose additional steps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there is neither publisher nor date marked on the box, board or rules, the game is identified as an upcoming release by Milton Bradley in American Stationer on May 29, 1890.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
