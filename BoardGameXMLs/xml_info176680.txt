							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Trip &amp; Trap</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located beside the old stone bridge, The Trip &amp;amp; Trap Inn is a popular stop for travellers. A large tap room on the ground floor of this tavern, with lodgings and beds upstairs and a cellar for storage below.&lt;br/&gt; The Trip and Trap is a printable dungeon floorplan compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl game. It can be used as a standalone gameboard, or combined with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trip and Trap is a multiple level set, comprising 3 battlemaps (each depicting a different floor)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Ground Floor - Set near a river and stone bridge, the ground floor of the tavern surrounds a small courtyard, and features a bar, tables, kitchen, stables and reception area.&lt;br/&gt;    1st Floor - The upstairs of the Trip &amp;amp; Trap can be reached via internal stairs, or a set of stairs that lead to a gallery balcony. There are a variety of rooms - fine, expensive rooms; cheap rooms and dormitory rooms. There is also a room for the innkeeper.&lt;br/&gt;    Cellar - The basement of the tavern is full of barrels, chests and boxes. &lt;br/&gt;    Secret rooms - Also included is a set of 3 small stand-alone rooms that can be used as secret rooms in the cellar. The Innkeeper is probably honest - but there's a chance that he's running a smuggling scheme, and has an office in the cellar. Perhaps he has a prison where he incarcerates his guests, or maybe he's a secret zealot in a cult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is a set of 300dpi full size jpgs, for poster printing or VTT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
