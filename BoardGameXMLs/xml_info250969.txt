			<description>Roll-and-move board game with a large cartoon-illustrated poster-sized board, probably produced by the crew of HMAS Warrego (U73), a Grimsby class sloop of the Royal Australian Navy, built in Sydney in 1939 and commissioned in August 1940. In October 1940 Warrego assumed duty as Senior Officer, 20th Minesweeping Flotilla and in July 1944 she was transferred to the US Seventh Fleet Survey Group (TG 70.5) for survey duties in New Guinea waters. The game depicts numerous incidents and events that the Warrego and crew experienced during 1941-1945, events that are well-documented at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-warrego-ii&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-warrego-ii&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
