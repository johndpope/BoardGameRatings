The jumping piece at the end of a jump must either land on an empty space just after the jumped piece(s) or end a jump by landing on top of an enemy piece already on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     If a player can capture on a turn he must.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Once a stack of three or more pieces is created, it is off limits, no further pieces may be stacked on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A stack cannot be split or moved. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The top piece on a stack designates who has control of that stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player manages to stack all of his pieces or is reduced to a single piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object&lt;br/&gt;A winner is determined by adding the face values of all the pieces within all the stacks controlled by each of the players. The player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
