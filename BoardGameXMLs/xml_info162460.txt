			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fantasy based, upgrade heavy, single screen beat 'em up. You fight enemies in battles along a map toward an enemy castle. Enemies get more numerous and difficult as you get farther. You also unlock AI controlled party member characters that assist you in battle. As you earn money you can spend it to unlock permanent upgrades for your player character or AI characters. There are also runes that give a single battle bonus to your characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each map position has in addition to the campaign/story mode battle two special battles with limitations that you can open up for additional challenge. These often limit how many upgrades will be active and what runes you can purchase for the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
