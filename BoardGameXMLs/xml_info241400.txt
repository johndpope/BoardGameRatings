							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elizabethan Adventures: Players&#039; Book</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complete, simple role-playing system in a finely detailed setting where the supernatural can exist, a dark realm where corruption is rife and evil takes many forms. None can be trusted and the concept of hidden characters creates a hidden side to every campaign. Adventurers have the potential to have many secret aspects so that on the surface they travel together innocently, but their motives are their own. Voyage to fabled lands or try to win your fortune in a harsh realm ruled by fear where outlandish and unsettling ideas may be taken as truth. Elizabethan Adventures is set in a richly depicted society that differs so much from that of today that the difference is an adventure in itself. A unique, fast combat system simulates the many fighting styles of the age. Countless professions and skills are described to help mold fascinating characters and adventures. The Players' book comprehensively details Character Creation, Professions (of which there are over a hundred), Skills (similarly voluminous), Combat (with descriptive crit tables), and Injury (including a detailed section on healing and a pharmacopoeia of useful items). 168 pages. Fully illustrated in colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
