			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;All the luck in the world can't change the past.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many dreams are nightmares, and most fairy tales are gruesome tales of blood and betrayal, when you get right down to it. One little boy's ill-fated wish took him away to a land of make-believe and wonder... and, in a realm of madness and lies, that lost boy grew up. Lucky him. Now a tricksy old man in funny clothes walks the treacherous streets of Dream with a dagger in his hands, a haunting tune upon his lips, and shadow that curdles probability itself. Many wish he would've stayed lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product provides Game Masters with details on a long-lost luckbringer found amongst the Faces of the Tarnished Souk, ready for immediate use in any campaign - but especially for use within the Coliseum Morpheuon.  Each entry features ingenious stat-blocks from multiple OGL sources, history, motivation, secrets, and insight into the NPC&amp;rsquo;s most carefully guarded dreams, along with complete game statistics for low, middle, and high levels of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Po'Kesteros, a fey-faced fortune fiend who doesn't care about the &amp;ldquo;odds&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    CR 20 Male fey trickster half-elf alchemist (vivisectionist) 1/luckbringer 14/ninja 2&lt;br/&gt;    CR 15 Male fey trickster half-elf alchemist (vivisectionist) 1/luckbringer 10/ninja 1&lt;br/&gt;    CR 7 Male fey half-elf alchemist (vivisectionist) 1/luckbringer 5&lt;br/&gt;    Including a host of variants using the adaptable, fey, preternatural, and trickster templates&lt;br/&gt;    Feats for luckbringers and sneak-attackers&lt;br/&gt;    The dream-shattering weapon enhancement, when killing a man just isn't enough&lt;br/&gt;    New magic items &amp;ndash; blades and blood and beast-wear, oh my!&lt;br/&gt;    Featuring the reality-bending luckbringer class&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
