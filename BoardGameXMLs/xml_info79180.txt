			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...without knowing how or why, Brian, a student on the verge of graduating from college, is attacked by mafia gangsters. During his desperate getaway, in the company of a mysterious striptease dancer, he ends up meeting a wide range of unusual characters. But which ones are planning to blow his head off?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will have to be very ingenious to figure it out, without forgetting that nobody is who they seem in this explosive mixture of murder, money, ambition, santeria rituals and deception...a whole lot of deception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Over 100 settings that are visually rich, containing almost 30 interactive characters.&lt;br/&gt;- Characters with soft edges, real-time lighting and shading effects, camera changes, panoramic shots and more.&lt;br/&gt;- High-quality stereo sound, an original soundtrack with over 24 songs.&lt;br/&gt;- 3D characters with a cartoon look and high-impact visual features that include 2D and 3D in an unmatchable style.&lt;br/&gt;- The highest graphic resolution ever used in an adventure game (1024x768 with 16-bit color).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
