			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Khorvaire is a disparate land. In the wake of the devastating Last War, what was once the largest single kingdom has been broken into smaller ravaged nations, struggling to rebuild while nursing long-held grudges and rivalries. While exhausted from the brutality of conflict, these nations stockpile weapons, dispatch spies and commit acts of sabotage against one another in a prelude to yet another bitter war. Yet beyond these conflicts, forces work to bring about the evolution of the inscrutable Draconic Prophecy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This campaign map details Khorvaire, the primary setting for DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS campaigns in the world of EBERRON. Packed with details, this map is a great way to chart your adventures in the aftermath of the Last War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gale Force Nine&amp;rsquo;s Official DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS Campaign Maps are high-quality single-sided vinyl surfaces that are ideal for tracking the progress of your adventures during their campaigns! These maps lay flat for ease of play. The maps may be marked with WET-ERASE markers to temporarily record the paths your heroes travel, make notes about encounters and locations or the modify landscape to suit your own campaign. They also look great on the wall of your game room! The Campaign Maps measure 30&amp;rdquo; x 42&amp;quot;. All of GF9's Campaign Maps are based on artwork provided by Wizards of the Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
