							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Moorhuhn: Sockenschuss</name>
									
			<description>A press-your-luck and bluffing game with a Moorhuhn (German &amp;quot;Crazy Chicken&amp;quot; computer game franchise) theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: 58 number chips, 14 Moorhuhn chips, one sock&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number chips show values from 1 to 4 and come in 5 different colours. The Moorhuhn chips are the same size but show the chicken. All the chips are put into the sock, from which the players draw them, trying to collect as many victory points as possible.&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns drawing a chip from the sock. If it is a number chip, the player chooses if he/she wants to continue or keep all the chips he/she has drawn this round. The active player continues drawing chips until he/she either decides to stop, or he/she draws a Moorhuhn chip.&lt;br/&gt;When a player decides to stop, he/she gets to keep the chips drawn this round, sorts them into colours and puts them into rows so that the other players can see them. Black is a joker and the player has to decide which colour he/she wants to use the black chip for at the end of the round.&lt;br/&gt;If a Moorhuhn is drawn, the player's turn ends and he/she doesn't get any chips that round - they go to the next player instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the last Moorhuhn turns up. Each player counts the point in their row with the smallest number of chips. The player with the most points in that row wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a variant players get to keep the chips if a Moorhuhn turns up, but they have to give their row of chips of the same colour as the Moorhuhn to the next player. Scoring is also different: The player with the highest number of points in any of their rows wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
