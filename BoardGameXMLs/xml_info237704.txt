			<description>Go for it all and try to convince the other players that your crazy answer is the best. Hot and sticky? Frozen and explosive? Let your imagination fly! With Big and Hairy you will test your creativity and your power of persuasion.&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you draw three cards and choose two of them. Each card has words, and the players must chose something that is relating to the two cards. The player who is the judge for that turn must decide which player chose the best relating word. That player gains one card. The player with more cards in the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
