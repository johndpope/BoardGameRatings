			<description>Description of the game from Spielbox:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Used Car Dealer - Trash or Treasure is a card game by Jorg Miethe. Buy the best used cars from the other players and create the best car collection of all. But each used car has its secrets. Perhaps there's a treasure chest in the trunk or possibly hidden accident damage. Unfortunately, you can't trust anyone in this game. In the next round, it's your chance to sell and you can then try and foist the cursed cars on someone else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on the &amp;quot;Lemon Game&amp;quot; from business theory. The lemon game is often used to explain credit notes in the banking industry. There are two important things that a lemon game needs. One player has more information than the other and there is a greater supply than demand. The theory says that in such situations, if a player does everything right, he's making the wrong choice! BTW, the name of the game comes from 'Lemon' being slang for a car you'd rather not buy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
