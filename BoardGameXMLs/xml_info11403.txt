			<description>The game consists of 32 identical playing pieces that can be placed at random onto any square on the playing board. Each piece has two sides. One side consists of two curves and is used for making turns. The other side is cross-shaped and is used for going straight - no right-angle turns are allowed at the center of the cross!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play begins! The opponents choose for either Offensive or Defensive play. The Offense goes first, and puts his playing piece either side up, curved or crossed, on any square on the board. His objective is to construct an unbroken pathway with the crosses and curves from any one side of the playing board to its opposite side. The Defense goes second, with the single objective of diverting the Offense, thus stopping it from completing a path between two opposite sides. The players alternate turns and once a player has placed a piece on the board and removed his hand that play is final. Remember, players are free to place pieces on any square on the board without being required to touch a previously played piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pathways will turn and wind and even cross over themselves as the two players attempt to out-maneuver each other. If one path comes to a dead end, the Offense simply begins another until one is completed and he becomes the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If he fails to do so before all 32 pieces have been played, the Defense wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
