			<description>Ranged Fun is a simple game of vehicular urban shootyness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core of the game is based around the four statistics which each unit has. These are reduced as the unit is damaged, so they gradually loose effectiveness before being destroyed. This means there is some bookkeeping involved, but it means the rules a great for quick skirmish games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The statistics themselves are generalized: each is the combination of many factors the unit may have. For example, all the guns, ammo, rate of fire, targeting efficiency and range are represented by a single number. As the number is reduced through damage, it can represent individual guns being disabled, hampered aiming, ammo destroyed etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This may not be that realistic but it speeds gameplay and reduces bookkeeping. This is after all a game of fun - at different ranges&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
