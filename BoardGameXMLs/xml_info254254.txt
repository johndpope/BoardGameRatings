							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Coral Bleaching: Making Our Oceans Whiter</name>
									
			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This lesson plan deals with coral reefs and the recent increase in coral bleaching. The students will be learning about the ecology of reefs, the habitats they create, the algal symbiosis that ends with bleaching, and the role of human impact. The plan also outlines a role-playing debate for the students and an in-character written assignment to come up with a compromise to protect the reefs and the economies that depend on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This activity includes several components, one of which is a concise role-playing activity in which students are assigned the roles of various scientists and individuals concerned with coral bleaching and commercial exploitation of the oceans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
