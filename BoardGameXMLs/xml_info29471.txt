			<description>Who killed Gloria Don? The game and the story begins with  the discovery of the body and ends with the question: Who was the murderer? Each player acts as Chief of the Homicide Squad and as each new fact is unearthed he/she must choose the next step to take in his/her investigation. In doing so he may win money from his fellow investigators or he may lose to them, sometimes Heavily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with paper money, some of which is distributed to the players,  and a sheet which tells the background of the crime. The background is either read to ones self or read out loud to the entire group. Then the first page of the crime case is read. On the reverse of each case players will find 10 possible courses of action that he/she as investigator may take. After carefully considering all the given facts and without consulting any other player each investigator checks the two courses of action that he/she feels should now be taken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all players have decided on their particular course of actions a blue sheet is read which gives both benefits and penalties to each player depending on what decisions they have made.  If both of the choices that an investigator makes are good the player will collect money from the kitty, if both are bad ones the player will pay into the kitty, if one is good and one is bad there will be a net plus/minus total which will create a small gain or loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the next page of the crime is read and the another set of 10 possible actions will be given from which each player can choose two courses of action. This continues until final evidence is presented and each player will be asked &amp;quot;Who Killed Gloria Don? Being correct pays off, being wrong costs you money. At the end of the game all players who have more money than what they started with sort of win with the player with the most money being the overall winner of the game. Many cases were available !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
