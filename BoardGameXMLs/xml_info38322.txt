			<description>Suit Yourself was published in A Gamut of Games. It is based in the family of games played with matches know as Nim games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nim games are know to be easily mathematically studied and a player who has done it will always win one who does not have. Suit Yourself, using a deck of cards instead of matches, lead to a different starting position of the game in each play, so that this advantage disappears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck of cards is distributted in five collumns, two with eleven cards and three with ten cards each. In each turn, a player can take as many cards are on top of the collums as he wishes, but all must be from the same suit. When all cards are taken, the player with most cards in his hands is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
