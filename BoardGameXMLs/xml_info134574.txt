			<description>To bomb or not to bomb. That is the question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this little odd bluffing game, players need to avoid the bomb detonating. At the start of round, the start player chooses right or left and hands a face-down bomb to that player and announces the number on the card. But, the player can bluff as to what number is on the card. As the bomb proceeds around the table, players have to choose between adding to the bomb and passing it on or stopping and checking the bomb pile. If the sum of numbers on the cards is over 10, then the bomb goes off, and the player who try hand bomb cards over to next player takes all bomb cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of game, a player who have most many bomb cards loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
