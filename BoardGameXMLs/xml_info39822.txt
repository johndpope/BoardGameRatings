			<description>Croation kids game for 4 kids.  Called &amp;quot;Oluja 1995&amp;quot; in Croation, this game is sure to be controversial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Josip Brnic explains to Croatian media:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I came up with this idea around 3 years ago, listening to all negative stories about the Operation Storm. I didn't want that people forget about this very important moment for Croatia. The game is meant for 4 players, and each one has it's figure and throws the dice. Depending on the dice result, player takes over the fields on the board, and the start position is in the area of Croatian Kostajnica (pron. as &amp;quot;Ko-staay-nee-tza&amp;quot;). All along the line where Croatian army passed are drawn tanks, Serbian soldier and Croatian soldiers, that are shown as bigger and stronger. The winner is the first one that reaches Knin&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
