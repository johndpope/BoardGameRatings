			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My life is a humouristic arcade action game where the player must go through a regular work day, avoiding any dangers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;Take control of Eugene, a hapless chappie, who has to work his way through a stressful week in order to earn a well-earned sleep-in at the weekend.  Avoid all manner of meanies including vicious vacuum cleaners, rampaging roadsweepers, terrible toddlers, scary security guards and more as you stomp your way through each screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits&lt;br/&gt;Trevor Storey: design, graphics&lt;br/&gt;Achim Volkers: code&lt;br/&gt;Saul Cross: Music, sfx&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
