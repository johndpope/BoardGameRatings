			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ready for action!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a compilation of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth entries into the Ships of Clement Sector series. The vessels featured within these pages cover an escort vessel, a cargo ship, and two support ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Strikemaster-class Brig: A small warship used for escort and special duties. As the end of the twenty-third century approached, the United States authorized construction of a small warship to reduce the need for the USSN to use larger vessels for escort and patrol duties. In 2293 Congress authorized the construction of the Strikemaster-class brig to defend US colonies in Earth Sector and Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Boyne-class Replenishment Ship: A successful support vessel with a long service history, the Boyne-class was designed for use by the Royal Navy but was a very successful export even before the ship entered service, eventually serving in national navies, system navies, and defense forces across Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Aranui-class Medium Cargo Vessel: The Aranui is a civilian variant of the Boyne squarely aimed at small merchant shipping companies and wealthier owner/captains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Milligan-class Hospital Ship: The Milligan is an efficient vessel designed to be able to provide medical support both to the battle wounded and those affected by planetside disasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While each of these ships has been specifically designed to fit into the Clement Sector setting, they could easily be used in other settings or within other science fiction RPGs if needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get on board! Adventure awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
