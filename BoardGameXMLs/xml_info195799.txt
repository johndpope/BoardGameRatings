			<description>Silantra: the game, is a 1-4 player cooperative trick taking card game inspired by the restaurant Silantra. In Silantra, you play as chefs in a kitchen serving customers their favorite entrees. As customers are fed, they reveal their special powers scoring you more points and abilities! &lt;br/&gt;To feed customers, you and the other chefs take turns playing ingredient cards from your hand to match what your customers want to eat, which is displayed on the front of the card. After feeding the customers, you flip the card over and activate their special power and continue drawing more cards and feeding more customers! Good luck on your first wave of customers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
