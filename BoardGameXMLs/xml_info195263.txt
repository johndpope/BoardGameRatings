							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">10 Elf Character Backgrounds</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Backgrounds grant you the ability to customize your character even further by suggesting ideas for your character&amp;rsquo;s history. Likewise, the DM can use backgrounds to make NPCs more memorable with personality traits &amp;amp; their own odd, little habits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the 10 backgrounds we present here are specially tailored for Elves, backgrounds are virtually rules agnostic. Feel free to use them with any game, any race, any character!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We present 10 new backgrounds tailored for Elves &amp;amp; their kin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What sights have you seen as one of the itinerate Gentry? &lt;br/&gt;What displays have you created with your magical art? &lt;br/&gt;What beguiling tricks does the FeyWild Court get up to, &amp;amp; what power can you seize?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's up to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
