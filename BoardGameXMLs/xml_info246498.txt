			<description>Sumtastic is a math based board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single play&lt;br/&gt;Solo players will play against a timer, trying to beat their own score with each play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multi-player&lt;br/&gt;The players write their names on the score card and write a total number that the game is to be won once it is reached (example 500)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll two dice, the score is then the total number which the player must move to on the playing board. A sum square is placed onto the board with the number in the center of it, around the frame are +,-,x,?. The player picks a tile randomly from the bag which must be used to complete the sum. The total is then added to the score card. The winner is the first person to reach the total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If doubles are rolled, the players have an additional turn. If three doubles in a row are thrown the player misses a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player removes a ? from the tile bag they may choose there own sum (substitute the ? For either a x, + or - )&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modified play &lt;br/&gt;Play is available with the addition or subtraction of tiles which will effect the maths sum options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a wooden made playing board, sum frame and tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
