							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Souls of the Machines</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some believe that in some way, once they were all connected together, the machines took on a life of their own, that they have spirits or souls just like us. There are some that also believe that they can communicate with these souls of the machines. They are the cybermages. They are the Techmaturge, Tekxorcists, and Data Rogues. Each in their own way communing with the beings of cyberspace. They help quell the ghosts made up of data packets, defeat the constructs of power, and are the defenders when the creatures of cyberspace want to cross over into our world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cybermages area rare breed. They exist in the underground under a guise of myth. Their lives are in constant danger. You want to assume the mantle of a cybermage? Are you ready to face the unknown?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the Cyber.net.ica Universe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyber.net.ica is a series of micro cyberpunk role playing games that all share the same universe. They can be played by themselves or can be combined to create a bigger world. Small in stature, big in imagination!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
