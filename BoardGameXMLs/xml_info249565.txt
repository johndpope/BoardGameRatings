			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map-making can be time-consuming and sometimes frustrating for GMs, especially GMs with limited time to begin with. In our new 'GM's Maps' range, we will be providing a range of pre-made maps for you to use in your games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stately homes are usually huge, grand buildings often referred to as 'Castles' even when not built as a defensive structure or when built after the medieval period. They tend to have a long history, dating back at least to the 18th century and often further. Many of the buildings have been added to or expanded over the years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the 20th century, the upkeep of these buildings became so prohibitive that most either opened to the public, became owned by English Heritage or were sold to be converted to other uses (usually as hotels or exclusive golf clubs). Many more either fell to ruin or they began to operate as businesses hosting hunting and shooting weekends and other exclusive and expensive pastimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some famous examples are Alnwick Castle in Northumberland which began life as an 11th-century castle. The building is still the home of the incumbent duke and Duchess of Northumberland and is partly open the public as a sort of living museum, it's gardens, including the famous poison gardens (in which every plant is toxic to humans) are a great draw. The estate also appears in a great many TV and Movie productions, part of it having been used as Hogwarts in the Harry Potter Movies among its many other starring roles dating back to 1954. Castle Howard in Yorkshire is considered one of the finest examples of Baroque architecture in England while Hatfield House in Hertfordshire dates back to 1611 and was built by the influential Cecil family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due in part to their great age and the imposing visage they present every Stately Home in the British Isles seems to have at least one Ghost story attached to it, and many have far more than one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stately homes make a great setting for Gothic horror or mystery games, indeed their very appearance conjures up the archetypical settings for such genres. They are also ideal for hiest games since they are usually filled with antiques of great value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't be limited by those genres though, such magnificent houses can be the setting for almost any type of game you can conceive of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's Licence&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publishers, you are granted a licence to use the map in this product in your own adventures or supplement providing that you add your own content and do not re-sell this product as or as part of a product that is intended exclusively as a map or collection of maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you do use this map in your product you must include in the credits 'Some maps by B F Irving,&amp;copy; Gethsemane Games 2017 using Campaign Cartographer 2'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
