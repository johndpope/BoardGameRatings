			<description>Trivia card game about wine. The game consists of 55 cards with three questions. For each question, four answers are provided. At the start of the game, the players agree which question from each card is used (i.e. the first from each card - there are no categories). Players take turns reading out the questions. The first player to answer correctly gets the card. When all cards are used, the player with most cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
