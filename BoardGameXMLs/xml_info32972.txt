			<description>Approved by Air Marshal W. A. Bishop V.C. D.S.O. M.C. D.F.C., better known as Billy Bishop, Canada's highest-scoring fighter ace of WWI. Bishop was officially credited with 72 kills, despite having started the war in the infantry and flying in combat only between March and August 1917, and April to June 1918. He was the first Canadian promoted to Air Marshal in 1939 and was in charge of air force recruitment and training at the time this game was published in 1941. For more details on his life, see &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bishop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bishop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules:  Starting at the Recruiting Depot, players move through the Manning Depot to the Initial Training School, where they are classified as Pilots, Observers or Airgunners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player then follows his course through its various stages till completed --- goes overseas --- serves with the Fighting force and finally returns home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is driven by exact die rolls (getting to key spots and ending the game requires an exact roll) as the player moves through the contiguous points on the board.   The cover is excellent and one of quite a few Canadian wargames created during WWII.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
