							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fighter</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like The Bard and The Druid, this class is designed to fix the issues we have with the default Dungeon World fighter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than being largely defined by a single piece of equipment, you&amp;rsquo;re defined by your skills. At the start of the game, you choose what sort of weapons you&amp;rsquo;ve trained the most with: one-handed weapons and a shield, big-ass, two-handed weapons, a ranged weapons, or two weapons at once. You&amp;rsquo;re also good at sizing up your opponents, and creating makeshift weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you level up, you choose if you further specialize in your weapon(s) of choice, improve your skills with other weapon types, learn to create better weapons and armor on the fly, become tougher, learn other tricks, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains three files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One is a letter-sized character sheet that uses our new character sheet layout: it was the only way to cram in the 29 advanced moves! The print book has guidelines on swapping out your weapons and armor beyond the defaults, so we opted against a character sheet with the gear tacked on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other two are digest-sized books, one in color, the other in black and white (to make it easier to print off at home if you want). They both contain:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The fighter class (again, with 29 advanced moves).&lt;br/&gt;    New weapons and armor.&lt;br/&gt;    Three extra moves for if you want to make an &amp;quot;agile&amp;quot;, DEX-primary fighter (good for the ranged and two-weapon fighting specializations).&lt;br/&gt;    A director's cut with questions to ask yourself, explanations and suggestions for some of the moves, guidelines on modding your gear loadout, and some extra moves that literally couldn't fit on the sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
