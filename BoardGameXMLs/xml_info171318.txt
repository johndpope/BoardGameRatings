			<description>Bounty Hunter is a game where players assume the roles of Bounty Hunters in the Wild West. Your Bounty Hunter must track down and defeat Wanted and desperate Outlaws and turn them in for reward money. The more Outlaws your Hunter turns in, the greater his or her Fame or Stature will be, which, may make it more difficult to apprehend Outlaws. There will be plenty of obstacles and hazards to hinder your Hunters progress including hostile Indians, bandits, highwaymen, harsh climates, hazardous terrain and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Objective: The objective in Bounty Hunter is to be the Player with the highest Stature Rating at the end of the Game.

The game includes a large, 6 sheet map with large hexes, representing various terrain of the Western Territories of the United States. There is a nice variety of weapons and items to equip your Bounty Hunter with in order for him or her to bring justice to Wild West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat can be played out on the Game Map or on the Combat Mat provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BOUNTY HUNTER can be found at the following URL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.berserkergames.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.berserkergames.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
