			<description>A Burger King kid's meal giveaway, this game shares a name and a dexterity component with the original Sorry! Sliders, but not much else.  In this game, a line of six stand-up paper markers numbered 1-3 (twice) are laid out in a line on a table.  Each player in turn slides a colored disc along the line (from opposite sides).  The second player has the advantage of being able to knock the first player's disc out of position.  Discs are scored based on which marker they end up next to.  Players play as many rounds as they agree, and the player with the highest total score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
