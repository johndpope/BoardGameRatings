			<description>ENLACE is a competitive, tile-placement abstract game which emphasizes its educational aspects, mainly, the stimulation of the observation &amp;amp; association skills in players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;140 printed tiles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All 140 tiles are shuffled, put face down and divided between 3 stacks of tiles of any given size. Each player is given 10 tiles that should be put in front of them facing up, so other players can clearly see them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player that begins the game takes one of his tiles, puts it at the center, then takes another tile from any of the three stacks and puts it next to his tiles; the next player chooses a tile among the ones he has whose 'printed pattern shape &amp;amp; color' properly links/connects and puts it next to the first one placed at the center, then takes another tile from any of the three stacks and puts it next to his tiles; and so forth...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has no tile to properly link the ones at the center, he'll take one from any of the stacks, if this one also doesn't match, he loses his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object / Winning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the stacks are gone, the first player who runs out their tiles wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the case that no player can properly link/connect their tiles, the one with less tiles wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
