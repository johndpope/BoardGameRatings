							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Triple Flips 7: Great Adventures</name>
									
			<description>Triple Flips 7 includes Jungle Explorer, Dangers of the Deep, and Abominable Snowman Hunt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Jungle Explorer is a roll-and-move game for 2-4 players, whose path becomes increasingly perilous as the pawns progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Dangers of the Deep is a 1-player game of risks, in which you attempt to take your bathyscaphe to as great a depth as possible.  Each roll of the die has a 50% chance of increasing your risk.  A 4 increases the undersea current, a 5 increases the water pressure (nicely depicted by drawings of a progressively crushed bathyscaphe), and a 6 reduces your remaining oxygen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Abominable Snowman Hunt sets 2-4 players tracking the Abominable Snowman in an attempt to capture it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
