			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;A 2-player assymetrical card game, where one player is a band of thieves trying to steal treasures, and the other player is the police force trying to protect them. The Thief has a deck of cards numbered 1&amp;ndash;6 of different colours, and the Police has a couple of trap cards, and a large number of duds (incompetent police officers).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seven treasures are lined up in a row, and the players take turns placing one card each. The thief plays his cards face up, and the Police face down. If the thief plays cards that apply to one of the traps the police has played, the trap is played face up and the polices trap and all of the thief's cards for that treasure are discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Thief managed to steal 4 treasures, he wins. If the Police manages to protect 4 treasure, he wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The art is of several famous master thieves from Japanese TV animations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
