			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cold War is over. Communism has been replaced by democracy throughout Eastern Europe and the threat of nuclear holocaust is nothing but a bad memory. Arms reduction treaties have been signed and the major powers are destroying their stockpiles of nuclear war heads. But... what if these weapons fall into the wrong hands? We can only guess at the carnage that could follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast and furious action as you come under deadly fire from planes, helicopters, tanks and missiles in your mission to destroy a multi-national terrorist organisation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
