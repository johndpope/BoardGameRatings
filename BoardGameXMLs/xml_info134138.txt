			<description>User Summmary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tomb Raider: The Lost Artefact follows Core Design's tradition of releasing a &amp;quot;Gold&amp;quot; expansion to each successive Tomb Raider game, often just before or (in this case) just after releasing the newest game in the Tomb Raider franchise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Lost Artefact, Lara Croft, fresh from foiling Dr. Willard's plans for world domination at his antarctic base, follows up a new lead: is there a fifth piece of the meteorite? Her quest takes her from first to Scotland, then to Dover, and finally to Paris, where she must confront a rival she had written off as dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
