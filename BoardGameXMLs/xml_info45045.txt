			<description>The Blueprints product line offers you old-fashioned blue printed maps for using in your adventures and campaigns. For each map you get a blueprint version and a standard black and white version. The maps are all vector-based so you will get maximum print resolution. Despite their old fashioned appearance each map offers you a degree of customization, using the pdf technology at its best. A button (which will not be printed) on each map allows you to turn on and off the grid, eliminate the room numbers, get the walls filled, don&amp;rsquo;t show doors and furniture and many other options, depending on the kind of map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each product features a classic fantasy adventure location: a dungeon, a keep, a temple complex, a thieves guild and so on. You can use these map as reference to build your own adventures or simply take them at hand in case your players go in an unexpected direction during the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In the breakwaters just beyond the jetty south of The Points (beacons), anchored against the drifting tide floats a hodgepodge structure of moored docks, shanty houseboats and derelict barges crudely lashed together with free floating gangways and protected by large nets strung between buoys filled with seaweed and flotsam. The floating tenements are inhabited entirely by halfling fishermen from the southern coast that emigrated to Azindralea to fish the rich shoals dancing with scuttlebacks, silver hake, and herring. Locals call the settlement the Saltshacks. Its sea-weathered residents cling to their simple traditions, content to live isolated from large folk except in matters of conducting business.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set of maps contains an Overview of the Saltshacks are plus details of four areas.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The Lair of the Drunken Halfling (tavern)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The Houseboat&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The Fish-Processing Barge&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The Mall&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
