							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of Bannockburn</name>
									
			<description>Battle of Bannockburn tries to simulate the battle that faced the English against the Scottish armies in the beginning of the 14th century (1314 A.C.). In this game you have to choose between english army or scottish army. The two players play face to face and both players have the same number of troops: 7 soldiers of infantry, 2 archers, 2 horse knight riders and the King. There are also, reserve forces. Each army has their own characteristics. In this case, the English have more soldiers (as in the real battle) but the Scottish infantry is stronger, so there is a balance. Careful, try not to lose the King. If your King dies you don't lose automatically the match,but you will lose some soldiers of infantry.&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to destroy the enemy army and win the battle for freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
