			<description>Anti-Social: The Anti-Pawn Placement Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Anti-Social, pro social game about playing with your friends, more then they play with you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a world of games where it&amp;rsquo;s easy to win, and victory is all about claiming as much space on a board as possible, In Anti-Social, the point is to do just the opposite. Occupy as little space on the board as you can. Develop negative personality disorders, or force others to play against themselves, but keep yourself off the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you do not want to place, or have your pawns placed on the board. Each turn players may play up to two cards (Anti-Social Behavior), and must place one pawns on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the board is filled, the game is over. Player with the least amount of pawns on the board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
