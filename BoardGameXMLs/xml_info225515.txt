			<description>Help Dory find her family and friends!  Dory and her friends are playing Hide and Seek.  Where are they hiding?  Be the first to find three, and you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a large board printed 19&amp;quot; x 28&amp;quot; board printed with a pattern of dots designed to obscure pictures of the movie characters.  Each player has a diving-mask-shaped viewer designed to reveal the character's picture.  Players take turns turning over a card depicting a movie character.  Players then race to use their viewers to find that character on the board.  The player who finds the character claims the card.  First player to three cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
