			<description>A space-themed mathematics trivia game for ages 11 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game:&lt;br/&gt;Collecting 16 galaxy tiles (4 each in yellow, red, green and blue) to put them on the corresponding player board. (The resulting picture shows a supernova.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play:&lt;br/&gt;Each player rolls the die once. The player with the highest roll starts and moves his/her pawn according to the die roll. When passing the orange start space, players get a galaxy tile of their choice and put it on their player board. Players then take turns, trying to collect galaxy tiles by answering the mathematical questions from the blue and black question cards. Which colour tile you get depends on which space your pawn lands. Galaxy tiles can also be collected by answering questions about space on the &amp;quot;black card&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;joker card&amp;quot; spaces.&lt;br/&gt;The player who first manages to collect a complete set of galaxy tiles wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
