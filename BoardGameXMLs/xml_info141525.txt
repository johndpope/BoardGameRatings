							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Million Dollar Idea</name>
									
			<description>Million Dollar Idea is a roll-and-move game where players try to become the most successful (and thereby wealthiest) businessmen through entrepreneurship. The game board has three concentric circles around which the players must move their pawns (by rolling dice) to progress through the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outer circle represents &amp;quot;starting up your business&amp;quot;. By landing on the various spaces of this circle, players must complete certain tasks through negotiation and by drawing cards before moving on to the second circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second circle (referred to as the &amp;quot;inner circle&amp;quot;) represents &amp;quot;operating your business&amp;quot;. Players move their pawns through this circle in a similar manner to the outer circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has accumulated sufficient wealth and experience from game spaces, cards, and negotiations, he may move to the &amp;quot;inner path and winner's circle&amp;quot;. If a player has completed the requirements for wealth and experience ahead of his opponents, he moves to the winner's circle and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Million Dollar Idea is an exciting new board game in which players escape the corporate rut and exercise their entrepreneurial spirit. In Million Dollar Idea you market your own 'great idea' by forming a company, obtaining financing and making money through the sales of your invention. Unfortunately while you strive for success, dilemmas such as competitors who steal your ideas, union problems, lawsuits, and the ever-present threat of a hostile take-over test your business acumen while doubling your blood pressure.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
