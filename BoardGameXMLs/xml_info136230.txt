			<description>As noted by NSKN Games in March 2015, Warriors &amp;amp; Traders: Middle Ages will not be released as described below, but instead transformed into a standalone game, possibly for release in 2016 or 2017. The description below shows what was originally intended for the expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;&amp;bull;&amp;bull;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warriors &amp;amp; Traders: Middle Ages enhances the Warriors &amp;amp; Traders base game by offering more interaction between players in the form of trade negotiations, military campaigns, and peace resolutions. The new features include variable turn order and variable player powers. The existing features, area control, action selection and trading are also improved. The deterministic combat system is replaced by a more attractive tactical combat system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting of the game is the Middle Ages of Europe. The players take the role of kings ruling over expanding nations fighting for dominance. Each player will develop his country's technologies, engage in trade, build forts, and raise armies to conquer his neighbors in his attempt to forge an empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warriors &amp;amp; Traders: Middle Ages can be combined with the Warriors &amp;amp; Traders: Italia expansion and with any other map expansion that has been or will be released. Specific rules may apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
