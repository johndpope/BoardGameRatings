			<description>Bear in the Big Blue House, Who's In My Room?, is a child's puzzle building game for ages 3 and up.&lt;br/&gt;This game helps children to learn game rules and complete their puzzle with four pieces that specifically match one of four puzzle outlines.  To play the game, each player takes turns by pressing a lever on the front of the house resulting in a puzzle piece popping out.  The puzzle piece is kept if it matches the player's puzzle outline.  If the puzzle piece does not match the player's puzzle outline, it is either passed to the player with the matching puzzle outline (Easy Game) or inserted into a slot in the roof of the house (Advanced Game).  The turn passes to the next player, and the game progresses until a player completes their puzzle.  The Advanced Game contains two Bear/Luna pieces that allow a player who popped it out on their turn to keep it until another player ejects a piece that matches the player's puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;The puzzles are colorful and include Bear's missing friends, Tutter, Treelo, Ojo, Pip, and Pop.  Using the lever to 'pop' out the puzzle pieces adds a fun element for young children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
