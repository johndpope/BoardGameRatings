			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Archon is a new core class designed for use with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. It is a hybrid combat class, designed to blend arcane power (including spellcasting) with martial skill. While an archon lacks the ongoing high damage output of most other fighting classes, and has neither the heavy armor of a fighter (at least initially) or the enhanced hit points of the barbarian, the ability to blend arcane and martial skills together makes up for this reduced durability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An archon is a warrior-wizard, trained to master both magic and mundane fighting techniques. Most are members of powerful aristocracies, for only nobles can normally take the time required in youth to train for the rigors of both the mystic and martial worlds. In many lands archons are the only ruling class, with all other spellcasters and fighters relegated to secondary roles. In other lands only a few noble lines have archons, with each generation learning the rare art from their forefathers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The style of magic practiced by archons is unique and, in its own way, limiting. An archon studies and masters spells through training and intellect, as does a wizard. However, archons cannot call upon the vast range of fighting talents pure fighters learn, nor do they have the breadth of spells of other pure casters. An archon can&amp;rsquo;t match a wizard in terms of spell level, spell slots per day, or spells known. Archons do learn to mix their arcane learning with martial skills, including ways to access their magic in a more raw and primal form, making them very versatile combatants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
