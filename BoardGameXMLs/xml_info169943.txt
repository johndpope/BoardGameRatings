							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cloak &amp; Dagger: Spies and Espionage in The Strange</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World Is Not Enough!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth, and the shoals around it, holds thousands of factions, all with different interests. From the major powers with field teams across the Chaosphere, to the lone recursion miner in his own recursion, everyone is trying to gain the upper hand. Those who proceed with violent and direct methods quickly expose themselves to attacks from others; to survive is to remain hidden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Strange, secrecy is the most potent defense, and information the best weapon. A good agent is not one who is rash or bold, but rather calculating, knowing and uses the license to kill only when needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cloak and Dagger includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Descriptions of how the factions of the Chaosphere deploy espionage and covert operations to increase their strength and weaken their enemies.&lt;br/&gt;    Three recursions which are particularly embroiled in covert activity. The Cold War inspired Divided City, a recursion for the typical movie agent called Agentopia, and Conspiranoia where all conspiracy theories are true.&lt;br/&gt;    New foci and artifacts to be used with the three recursions.&lt;br/&gt;    An espionage scenario, where the player characters must use all their covert skills to foil a secret plan which could spell doom for millions of people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
