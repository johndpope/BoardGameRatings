							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Little Folks Picture Cards</name>
									
			<description>This is rummy type card game for children. The deck consist of 48 picture cards with a letter at the top and bottom of each card. Four cards of the same letter form a complete picture (such as Alice in Wonderland or the Three little Pigs). Each player is dealt eight cards. On your turn, you may either draw from the draw pile or discard pile, and then discard a card from your hand. If you can form a complete picture, you lay it down and may then pick up the discard stack and use it to form as many additional pictures as you can. When any player has taken the discard pile for a second time, the game ends. The player who has made the greatest number of pictures is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
