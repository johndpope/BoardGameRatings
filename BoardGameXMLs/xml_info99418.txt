							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Invisible Eyes Rules</name>
									
			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Similarly minded individuals working together in a group may be a band of explorers, a gang of thieves or team of researchers, perhaps a combination of all three or even something completely different. For any number of reasons their lives aren't as straightforward as others and they find themselves pushing away the darkness of abandoned or guarded sites and risking their lives in forgotten caves and moonlit rooftops. After all, these are the places the best secrets are kept.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example Operations&lt;br/&gt;Invisible Eyes: This guerrilla journalist group promote  themselves as the necessary eyes of the public, exposing secrets and corruption wherever they find it. Whether the general public believe their paranoia-filled newsletters is another matter. They have recently begun work on EyeWiki, a collaborative online encyclopedia of their &amp;quot;discoveries&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;City University Paranormal Society: Students of a variety of subjects gather to discuss supernatural activity. Their expeditions are most commonly led to the woods and caves outside the city, following the frequent UFO and ghost reports.&lt;br/&gt;The Wet-necks: Adventurous people of all sorts meet on this online community dedicated to exploring the storm sewers beneath the city, also expanding into other underground networks.&lt;br/&gt;Debunkers: This popular TV show involves its three presenters heading into areas rumoured to be haunted or contain cryptids to disprove their existence live on air.&lt;br/&gt;Archae-Mythic Investigations: Retired Cambridge archeology professor Irving Brown has near unparalleled knowledge of historic and mythological artifacts. He and his small team now dedicate their lives to ensuring those that have found their way into the wrong hands end up safely on display in a museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;The core rules for Invisible Eyes have these headings: Groups, Expeditions, Characters, Tasks, and Running the Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
