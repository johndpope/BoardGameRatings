							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ever After More: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Ever After More is a mixture of Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic and Munchkin. If you're a fan of any of those games, then you'll like EAM. The way to win is two-fold. Either retain the most Life Points or have the most card points at the end of the game. Oh, this game is also rigged so that anyone can win or one person could win every time. (Believe me, it's happened to me...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The way to play is really simple. Draw your cards; lay them down; and attack! You choose your opponent, but be careful. Your opponent could have a card to counter your attack. It's all up in the air when you start playing. Anyone could win, at any time too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
