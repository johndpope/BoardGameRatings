			<description>See-Know-Buzz is a trick-taking game in which players use ninja to stalk one another, trying to catch opponents off-guard in order to trip them up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card deck consists of fifteen cards in three colors, with each color having cards valued 5, 4, 2, 1 and -3. Each player gets a hand of three cards. The start player places a card face down &amp;mdash; either in front of himself or in front of another player &amp;mdash; and states its color. Each other player must play a card of this color if possible, either in front of himself or in front of another player; if you already have a card in front of you, then you must play it elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a card is placed in front of you (except for the start player placing in front of himself), you can decide to fight by leaving your card in a vertical orientation or flee by turning it horizontal. Once each player has a card, those who fight reveal them, with the high value card winning the fight and leading to the next round. Those with the lowest-valued cards lose the round and gain one point. (Off-suit 2s and 4s reverse the trick to make the low card win, with multiple reverses being possible.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the trick had a single loser, that player can charge someone who fled. The fleeing person can take points equal to the number of cards in front of him or reveal his card and fight, with the winner losing one point and the loser gaining one point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If players still have cards in hand, they play another round. Those who fled in the previous round will now have two cards in front of them, and the values of those cards are summed in a fight. Should a player's cards sum to three, then those who fled must fight in the round. When players have no cards in hand, players pick up cards in front of them, then deal out the discards until everyone has three cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has five points. Whoever has the lowest score at this point wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
