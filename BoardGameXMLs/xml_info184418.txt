							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Creative Conclave</name>
									
			<description>The Creative Conclave is an original campaign world and setting which largely is system agnostic.  The setting has a fairly heavy fantasy/mythology feel to it and incorporates several elements of traditional Chinese culture.  However, the setting is quite unique and in many respects defies traditional classification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The publisher has heavily supported Pathfinder and some of the most-recent setting additions present material in a format that is influenced by, and compatible with, Pathfinder and d20.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World of Conclave has been in continuous development since 1999 and has input from hundreds of individuals.  No single person is credited, however, and the project is viewed as a living community effort by The Creative Conclave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting is published on the internet and is freely available.  It is presented in nine major sections, including:  Overview, Races and Cultures, People and Places, Tales and Legends, Creatures and Objects, Glossary, Stories from Conclave (fiction), Rules and Comments, and Downloads.  The site also is supported by an active and large discussion forum which generates most of the original material.  The downloads section does not allow for a full setting download, but does feature numerous supporting PDFs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
