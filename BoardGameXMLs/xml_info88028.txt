			<description>Assault Rigs is an Action game by Psygnosis, released in 1995 for PC, PlayStation and Sega Saturn. The game is based in the future, where real sport has been overtaken in favour of virtual sport. And everyone's favourite is Assault Rigs. The game runs through like a tank simulator, set inside a 3D virtual environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the single player game is to collect all of the gems in a level, while destroying or avoiding enemies, ultimately reaching the end exit. There are 42 Levels (Plus 15 levels for Playstation two player) featuring jump ramps, elevators, sky ways, trenches, movable blocks and push rods. There are also 20 weapon power-ups, viruses and Dolby Surround sound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assault Rigs also has the capability to utilize the Playstation Link Cable, enabling two players with two playstations to play head-to-head with full screens. A unique feature of the Serial link cable usage is that there are 15 additional levels that are only available for play using the cable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Assault Rigs&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
