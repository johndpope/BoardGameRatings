			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role Playing Games covers Role Playing Game Basics, Choose Your Game, Hooking Up With Like Minded Players, What about the Game Master, Choose Characters and Options, Know the Rules, Make Sure To Have Fun, Getting In the Player Mindset, The Best Role Playing Games and Learning To Separate These Games from Reality. As a person just like you who has struggled with gaming, I have searched high and low to find the best strategies to fix this problem and I am fully qualified and equipped to help you put an end to your frustration with trying to wade through all the info you need to know to get role playing games under control! Role Playing Games ask adults to reminisce the past years they spent on their old-school playground when they have pretended to be attacking forts, heroes, saving damsels in distress or ensuring that their house is running smoothly at mealtime and that their unicorns did not escape from their pasture. This only means that Role Playing Games lets people play and enjoy being at the wonderful places that a normal person can only visit in his dreams. This what makes playing a RPG even more uniquely interesting and exciting. And all of this up till now is just the beginning! Are you ready?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
