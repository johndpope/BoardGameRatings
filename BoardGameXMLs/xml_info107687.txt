			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;The Apprentice&amp;quot;, the player controls Marvin, the apprentice of the wizard Gandorf S. Wandburner, as he is sent out on quests across the kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Apprentice is unique to other platform style games in that the game scrolls vertically rather than horizontally. There are six levels with three stages each. Each level also has unique situations. For instance, in level two has Marvin turned into a frog and swimming through the level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also has a sort of save feature that remembers (this data is saved to the CD-I) how far you have made it in the game and allows you to restart from that point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
