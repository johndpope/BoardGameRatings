							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Raven Airship</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map product is a full-color, 48 x 30 inch, Airship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes a sky pier, two upper airship decks, and two lower airship decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sky pier can be attached as an add on to a mountain or a tower depending upon where the airship&amp;rsquo;s base is located at.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two above deck versions are one with 4 cannons and one ballista and another one with three ballistae.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two lower airship decks have passenger/crew bedrooms with space for cargo and passenger/crew bedrooms with the cargo space changed to a slave pen area. This allows the Game Master to print out the two upper decks and lower decks. You can then mix and match the pieces to make The Raven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the standard airship-to-airship skirmish battle, there are a ton of other adventure possibilities. One is that the group is hired to protect The Raven carrying cargo between two sky docks. Perhaps pirates, air elementals, flying creatures, or even dragons attack them in the air as they travel. Or maybe the pirates wait till they land at the sky dock to make their move and attack them while they are moving cargo from the ship to the dock. You could also have the Player Characters hired to infiltrate a sky dock and sneak on board The Raven and &amp;ldquo;liberate&amp;rdquo; the cargo. Maybe the Player Characters are even shocked to find out that their &amp;ldquo;cargo&amp;rdquo; was actually slaves. Of course, there could always be a twist. Perhaps these aren&amp;rsquo;t slaves, but are instead criminals, criminals that the Player Characters have just released, and now need to recapture in order to clear their names and their consciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module makes a great addition to any high magic fantasy setting where airships are in use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can either print it out with our easy to print instructions or use in any VTT software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map product is a full-color, 48 x 30 inch, Airship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ZIP file includes VTT images for your online gaming needs. All the section are in .png format for individual placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
