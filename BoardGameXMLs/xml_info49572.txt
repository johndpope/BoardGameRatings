							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Saga of the Dragon Cult</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Before there was &amp;Aacute;ereth, the Known Realms, or the gazetteer that hints to the myriad of adventures set therein, there was Tsathzar Rho, the Witch Queen, Nockmort the Mad Treant, and Pyraxus the Red Dragon. Fearsome villains all, the four reigned with terror and violence across the Known Realms, and a many a troupe of aspiring heroes fell before their evil machinations. Now all four classic villains can be found together in this single, epic adventure path. Saga of the Dragon Cult is a collection of four classic DCC adventures that takes PCs from 1st level all the way to 10th level and beyond. Beginning play as mere apprentices, woodsmen, petty thieves, and sellswords, the PCs grow to become mighty legends, of whom tales of heroism are recounted across the North. By the final chapter, the fate of civilization rests in the hands of the PCs, as they chase a fearsome red dragon back to its lair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This boxed set includes the adventure modules DCC #2: Lost Vault of Tsathzar Rho, DCC #6: Temple of the Dragon Cult, DCC #10: The Sunless Garden, and DCC #17: Legacy of the Savage Kings. It also includes a 32-page adventure path guide that ties these four modules into one cohesive adventure path with plot adjustments, new interludes, and more details on the world of &amp;Aacute;ereth, for a total of 168 pages of adventure!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
