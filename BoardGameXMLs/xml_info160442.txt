							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Momonga Jump</name>
									
			<description>The momonga (Japanese for flying squirl) siblings are leaving the nest, jumping from tree to tree and collecting food. Who will be the first to establish their own nest and win the game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turn swooping the velt momonga from the tree branch to the landing tree in the center. Your momonga lands successfully if it sticks to the landing tree, which is divided into 3 parts by 2 lines. Depending on where your momonga lands, you either move 1, 2 or 3 spaces on the circle tile surrounding the landing tree. If you land on a tile with a paw print, you collect a food by taking one of the outer circle tokens. If you land on a tile where there is another momonga already, you can steal a food from that player.&lt;br/&gt;There are 5 different kinds of foods and the aim is to collect 4 different types. The place where you gathered the last of the required food tokens will be your nest. Next you have to go around the forest one more time to inform your friends of your new home. The first player to complete the circle and land exactly on their own nest, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes leaf tokens. You can exchange a food token for a leaf token. A leaf token can be played for one of the following two actions:&lt;br/&gt;1) You momonga is allowed to try one more jump.&lt;br/&gt;2) When another player's momonga is making it's jump, you can blow from behind the landing tree to hinder them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook contains a few optional rules to change the base game and some other game variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
