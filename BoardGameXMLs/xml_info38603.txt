			<description>&amp;ldquo;The War of the Roses (1455 - 1487) was an English civil war fought between the House of York and the House of Lancaster.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Yorkists won a major victory at the Battle of Towton.  Fought on Palm Sunday, 29th April 1461, this battle confirmed the newly crowned Edward IV, son of Richard Duke of York, as king. Many of the important Lancastrian nobles either died in the battle, or were executed afterwards. The battle was the bloodiest fought on British soil and was fought in a snowstorm.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This miniatures wargame is designed to be played using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures mounted two per stand. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules. Units portrayed in the game include Longbowmen, Billmen, and dismounted Men-at-Arms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 5x5 foot table is required for play, but an alternate setup is provided to permit a larger version of the battle to be played on an 8x8 table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
