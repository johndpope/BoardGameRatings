			<description>Based on the hit Discovery Channel TV series - official license.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twist, mold and modify a standard vehicle into the monster machine of your dreams! With only $3,000 and seven days, you'll be workin' overtime in the Monster Garage to get the job done in time and on budget! Based on the hit Discovery Channel TV series, you will have to plan your monster machine carefully, order parts or create / construct the parts needed and start wrenching away, just like Jesse James and his monster team of experts. Turn a limo into a fire truck or an SUV into a rock crawler!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you have completed your mission - test it against its real-world equivalent. Do you have the skills to take a run-of-the-mill street ride and turn it into an awesome miracle of modern engineering and ingenuity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
