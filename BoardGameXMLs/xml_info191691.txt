			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;The Azon&amp;eacute; are a tribe of fantastic hunters and warriors, and they have lived at the edge of the jungle since the time of the first reckoning. Each season, as their young men and women approach adulthood, they prepare for the ceremony of St&amp;aacute;la, in which the youths demonstrate both their worthiness as defenders and providers for the tribe, and their attractiveness to prospective mates. The Azon&amp;eacute; value equally skill in deadly combat, and the ability to construct and wear battle garb of exquisite beauty. It is the balance of these two traits that make the Azon&amp;eacute; &amp;quot;butterfly warriors&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;Tyri&amp;aacute;&amp;quot;) truly great.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each player creates three beasts, each with a rating from 1 to 9, for a total of 13 points distributed between them. Then each round, for three rounds, the players choose to split 10 points between the beauty of their battle gear and its effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;If the effectiveness is not high enough, then the beast could wound the character (with a second wound killing them). But after facing three attacks, it is the surviving player with the highest beauty that wins. However if the total combat effectiveness is too low, then the village will be overrun by beasts in the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
