			<description>VampiRing was a board game created exclusively for online play on YouPlay.it in 2004. Taken from the homepage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Give yourself up the dark world of vampires and try an exciting adventure of monstrous metamorphosis and bloody fights! This original game, created and designed specially for our website, allows 2/4 players to lead a family of three thirsty vampires. They&amp;rsquo;ll move round among ancestral castles, obscure forests, gloomy caves, ruined towers and fearful graveyards hunting for each others. Who will be able to presage enemies&amp;rsquo; transfigurations? Who will succeed in anticipate their moves? Who will ambush the opponent vampires to suck them the last drop of blood?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two versions of the game to assure different strategy levels: in the &amp;quot;Castle&amp;quot; way players can ensure their vampires into their own Homes; in the &amp;quot;Mansion&amp;quot; one vampires are safe only in the shade of the great Cross.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
