			<description>A simple British game from the 1920's. Any number of players can play. In your turn you spin the spinner and when it stops an arrow will be pointing at one colour. Each colour is worth different numbers of points. You score the points and then it is the next player's turn. I said it was simple!&lt;br/&gt;It would be a little more interesting if players bet beforehand on the colour that would be arrowed. At least then all players would be interested in the result of the spin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
