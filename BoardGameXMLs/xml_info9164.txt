			<description>The players have to find the robot/computer Microlino, who hides in one of 20 local fields. At the beginning the 20 &amp;quot;Mox-cards&amp;quot; with the fields' names are shuffled, then one is taken and put aside for Microlino. This is his whereabouts. The remaining field tiles are distributed and the players are allowed to look at them before placing them in front of them in a row. They are not to be moved or looked at afterwards. On the game board there are 20 local fields, which resemble the Mox-cards, and four fields with a star. The players must get to know as much information as possible about the Mox panels of the fellow players to find out where Microlino is. One receives information by means of the Mox panels, which each player has, as well as the so-called Rho and Kyra panels. The player can use the Rho panels to extend the points of the dice, Kyra panels bring knowledge questions, which, if they are answered correctly, teleport the figure on any field. The Mox panels let&amp;rsquo;s the player look at Mox-cards of other players.&lt;br/&gt;The player wins, who knows where Microlino is, is located on that field and gets an 11 or higher or the same two numbers after throwing his dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
