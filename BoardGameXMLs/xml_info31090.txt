			<description>THE GAME OF THE GAMUT a Musical Gift for the Young - By John Betts, 115 Strand, London (his address 1845 - 1874) - The game consists of a wooden box with sliding lid containing thirty-six playing cards each showing a music book with chord on it and trumpet with number to top. One player calls out a number and the person holding the card - replies with the word spelled out by bass and treble notes - A good way of teaching children to read music - counters are won or lost depending on the outcome. The game is dated by the Jigsaws advertised inside the lid which seem to have been produced c1845 (ref Linda Hannas) as Betts himself dated very few items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
