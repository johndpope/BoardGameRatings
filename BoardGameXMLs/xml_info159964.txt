							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Raider Camp</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raiders!  What post apocalyptic game isn't complete without raiders?  They scour the wastelands in search of drugs, weapons, money, and even people to enslave and sell.  If it doesn't belong to them...it soon will.  Or they'll die trying to make it so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And where do the raiders take their booty after a successful day pillaging the wastelands?  Back to their base, of course!  Which is what this map offers.  A place to track raiders back to their home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in a pre-war bank (complete with vault and safe deposit boxes), the raiders have decided to make this their home.  It is well fortified, with old cars forming a wall around the bank, and sandbags placed and concertina wire strung to add that extra level of protection.  If that's not enough, the roof of the bank has been fortified as well, giving any defenders on the roof an added height advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, this could be nullified by smart players.  Any PC that examines the map will notice an old standing billboard just off a ways from the bank.  A great place to climb up and snipe those pesky guards on the roof!  In addition, there are other places to take cover, including old cars the raiders never got around to moving, as well as natural objects, like trees and bushes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map comes with a roof section that can be interchanged with the ground level as needed.  Before your players breach the interior of the bank, lay out the roof section and deal with the guards up there.  When your players are ready to go in, remove the roof section and lay down the interior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to any loot your players might recover from the bandits themselves, you have the option of making the bank vaults and safe deposit boxes still sealed.  If your players didn't come here hunting raiders, perhaps they're here to recover a pre-war artifact or weapon that might have been stored in one of these rooms.  The raiders aren't smart enough to open the vaults...but maybe your players are!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
