Players need several abilities - e.g. luck, knowledge, teamplay - to win this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the first obtaining a (coloured) card of each area (totally 5);&lt;br/&gt;roll the die and move your token (you may roll again once, if you are not pleased with the result);&lt;br/&gt;depending on the space you landed on you must perform an action:&lt;br/&gt;1. Green: Active player draws a card and reading the green question - all other players make short notices/remarks about it (hidden);&lt;br/&gt;active player has to assign answers to players - successful? If yes get a green pyramid.&lt;br/&gt;2. Grey: Use your sawy! Find correct answer to a question within a minute - you may ask for assistance (one person only).&lt;br/&gt;Example: Find the correspondent city in Europe with the letters R_I_M_D_D_A; successful (correct answers on the back of the card)? You and your partner will collect a grey pyramid.&lt;br/&gt;3. Blue: find within 30 s (with or without a partner) correct answer; example: How many wings does a dragonfly have? &lt;br/&gt;4. Red: Describe within 60 s together with a player of your choice - word after word - searched term, e.g. opera; successful... get a red pyramid.&lt;br/&gt;5. Golden: All players form their own 'five-digit' number. Push your luck - shuffle 10 numbered cards (0 - 9), draw 5 out of them and turn them over step by step. After each step players have to make up their decisions placing this digit. Highest number wins a golden pyramid.&lt;br/&gt;6. Coloured: your choice&lt;br/&gt;7. White: steal a pyramid of your choice from another player &lt;br/&gt;8. Ending a full circuit: get a pyramid of your choice&lt;br/&gt;TRADING RATE: 2 pyramids (same colour) = 1 card (same colour)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
