							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Final Haven Core Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Description:&lt;br/&gt;Final Haven is a flourishing open source LARP which was developed, tested, and currently operates out of the Midwestern United States. The Final Haven world is a post-apocalyptic medieval fantasy realm which blends the intrigue, ingenuity, and diverse backgrounds of its players to solve physical and mental challenges. We believe that teamwork, combat, puzzle solving, and of course a sense of humor, blend to form an exciting and dynamic environment for players and GMs alike. Character Creation is easy and the rules system has been simplified greatly from many other LARP experiences to help new players integrate quickly. Additionally, many of our players find that the rapid early advancement system in our game helps them become quickly involved in the long-term story arcs, and in the political aspects of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
