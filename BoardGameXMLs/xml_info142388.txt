			<description>It's one player representing the 1% versus three players representing the 99%. Players take turns rolling dice and moving around a board that contains spaces called Wall Street, Media, Pentagon, Banking, and the like. The 99%ers work together to occupy spaces that will improve their influence in the media, Congress, and other institutions. The 1%er tries to drive the other players out of those spaces and into his or her holdings.&lt;br/&gt;The 1%er wins if all the other players are broke, in jail, or in the hospital. The 99%ers win if they control seven spaces at once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
