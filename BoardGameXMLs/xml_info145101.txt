			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clash of the Constructs Adventure Path&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each adventure in this collection may be played either as a standalone or as part of the series!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder/3.5 Compatible Adventure for 4-5 PCs of levels 14-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Order! Order! Court in session. All rise for the judges!&amp;rdquo; When the Law speaks, everyone listens closely in Mohkba.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you become more well-known, you often find that you are called upon to help out in strange situations. And the case of Kosto Hakija versus House Loihtia is definitely strange.The mage Hakija&amp;rsquo;s Protection Golem definitely injured the young daughter of Arvoitus Loihtia as she waved her parasol, but after careful research, Hakija is saying it was self defense. Now he has a chance to prove his case under the grounds of &amp;ldquo;sufficient suspicion&amp;rdquo; and the PCs find themselves involved in an assault on a heavily-guarded merchant family&amp;rsquo;s mansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there is magic involved, and lots of it. Hakija is a vastly experienced wizard with a love of golems, Arvoitus Loihtia a sorcerer of outstanding beauty and unfathomable methods; both have reputations for being staggeringly effective in their use of arcane power. The PCs have the opportunity to act as supporters of one side or the other &amp;ndash; and the players can choose &amp;ndash; and face the force of their opponents. One thing, a small matter really; no-one is allowed to kill anyone else, or you&amp;rsquo;ll find yourself in service at the front lines of Klavek&amp;rsquo;s war against the Vikmordere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Rule of Law&amp;rdquo; is a complex series of encounters to discover evidence and clear Kosto Hakija&amp;rsquo;s name, -OR- prevent that same evidence being found within a government-sanctioned timescale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players must either face gruesome traps, powerful and experienced creatures, and devious puzzles -OR- can place the same things out of harm&amp;rsquo;s way but in plain sight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which will they choose, or will they split themselves and play both sides?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for 4-5 characters of levels 14-16 featuring enhanced creatures, trap combinations, new spells and magic items, and carefully structured solutions which encourage players to use the whole adventure, whether they support Hakija or House Loihtia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
