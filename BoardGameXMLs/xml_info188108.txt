							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Denizens of the Known Realms</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behold! For there are beasts wild and majestic in the wilderness. Intrepid wanderers venture to catalog them all within these lowly tomes so that you might know them well. These creatures, these denizens of the realms, are known well to us all through legends and folklore. But now thou might know them also and make with them what you will. Or something like that...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following are statistics using the Sundered Epoch: Generations species rules. Each species is organized by their parent species. Thus an elf is an elf, even if it is a sea elf instead of a land elf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
