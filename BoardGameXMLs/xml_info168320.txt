							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dark Festival</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You arrived in this dusty city simply to attend a festival. You had no idea you'd be pulled into a conspiracy to assassinate the Chief Praetor himself, sent on a crazy quest into the maw of the desert, and thrust into the center of the Praetor's dangerous politics. This is the life of an adventurer under the Dark Sun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dark Festival is a 7- to 10-encounter 'D&amp;amp;D 4th Edition Heroic Tier Dark Sun adventure that's been designed so it can be scaled for 1st through 10th level adventurers. It's designed to be easy to run and easy to drop in to an existing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each monster is presented in three variations, one for 1st level adventurers, one for 5th level, and one for 10th level.  As a result, it's easy to tweak the monsters for any party from 1st to 10th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, each piece of dialogue is presented in two columns: a carefully-written piece of dialogue that you can read as &amp;quot;boxed text,&amp;quot; and a detailed summary that you can customize according to your preferred speech patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full-color artwork and maps have been carefully color-corrected to print perfectly on color and black-and-white printers. The module includes maps that will print in standard one-inch squares on a normal piece of paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
