			<description>This children's game from Corey Games is a very simple roll and move race. Players each get two tokens and must move them along a path that includes four circles and rectangle. They must spin the exact number needed to reach the exit (red dot) square of each of these.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only element of judgment is over which token to move with a given spin so as to make it through the exit points. Movement is eased by a &amp;quot;move ahead seven&amp;quot; space in each circle that just happens to put a token on the exit dot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
