							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War Games Rules 1000 BC to 500 AD</name>
									
			<description>Description from the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;These rules are the result of some six months discussion and testing, embodying research and experiment covering over two years.  We regard them as a step forward in realism and interest, and are confident that the can cover Ancient Wargaming needs in the period, approximately 1,000 B.C. to 500 A.D.  We do not regard them as the last word by any means, and will always be glad to receive criticism and suggestions based on a reasonable amount of playing experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules have been adopted by the Worthing Group for the 1969 Wargamers Championship, and references to the particular requirements of the Championship will be found in the text.  We recommend that the basic points values system be adopted for choosing forces, without course keeping to the 800 points maximum which is the limit for the Championship armies only.&lt;br/&gt; - From the Rules Intro&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary (for the second edition):&lt;br/&gt;The Second Edition was published immediately after the first edition, titled War Games Rules 1000 B.C to 500 A.D (1st Edition) and were updated during the Worthing Group for the 1969 Wargamers Championship to expand the applicable eras and associated armies for use in the 1970 and 1971 National Wargames Championships.  &lt;br/&gt;Most of the changes are minor rules changes and clarifications for army unit types in the expanded eras (notably the Egyptian and Assyrian).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
