			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The character sheet is the cornerstone of your Player Character in any roleplaying game. As campaigns go on, your sheet can get overloaded with abilities, magic items, powers, and notes. It is way more than one measly sheet can hold, but that's all the rulebook gives you to work with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2001 Green Ronin changed all that with the d20 System Character Record Folio, which went on to win an Origins Award and provide yeoman's service to tens of thousands of gamers. Now the original and best Character Record Folio is back for 4E, updated and ready for the latest edition of the world's most popular RPG. Now you can track your character for a whole campaign and then some. Inside its 16 beautifully designed pages you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Forms for all your powers, including those gained from magic items.&lt;br/&gt;    * A character Advancement Tracker that lets you see and plan your development.&lt;br/&gt;    * A special page for your rituals.&lt;br/&gt;    * A Campaign Log where you can record the details of your adventures.&lt;br/&gt;    * A page for your companions and another for henchmen, animals, and hirelings.&lt;br/&gt;    * Stats of legend, a record of your mightiest deeds.&lt;br/&gt;    * Interior pockets that give you a place to store handouts, index cards, and other papers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And of course all the essentials you'd expect from a great character sheet. Doesn't your character deserve the very best?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
