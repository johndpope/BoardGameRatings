							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Technical Readout: Fighters! (White Star)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many Science Fiction franchises have their ownsignature starfighters whose names are famous the Viper, the XWing, and the Starfury among others. In Role-Playing Games based on these licensed properties, such storied craft are perfect. Nonetheless, players and GMs would sometimes prefer fighters that are less well known, more affordable or available, or more easily made to fit the unique vision every game group brings to the table. In the pages of this book are a half-dozen new starfighters for use in any White Star compatible game.  These are blank slates their stories haven't been written, and they are waiting for Players to roll the dice and make them famous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So strap in and get ready. You are cleared for takeoff!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
