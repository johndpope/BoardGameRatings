			<description>This game is a re-theming of Snakes and Ladders to the web comic Looking for Group: the snakes are replaced with the warlock Tiny Dick's fwooshes, and the ladders with the kraken Scooter's tentacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is also an extension of Snakes and Ladders in two ways: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Characters: Each pawn stands for a different LFG character, with its own unique ability, such as rolling twice and choosing the higher number, or reversing the direction of the fwooshes and tentacles. &lt;br/&gt;     Hit Points: Each character has hit points, which can be lost by going down a fwoosh, or losing in a combat when one pawn passes another. They are gradually healed by skipping turns. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
