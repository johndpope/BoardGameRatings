							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Insider Dealing</name>
									
			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Insider Dealing is a fun boardgame which recreates all the excitement of dealing - legal and illegal! - in the Stock Exchange.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to make it back to the start square with &amp;pound;1 million. As you would expect, players hope to make profits by buying and selling shares in one or more of six companies whose prices can rise or fall dramatically during the course of the game. Share prices are affected by several means.&lt;br/&gt;1 - Market Information cards. These have immediate effect on one (or more rarely all) companies once a player lands on a particular square&lt;br/&gt;2 - The Stock Exchange. Players select a company in which they have a minimum holding and roll dice to determine the extent and direction of the share price of that company.&lt;br/&gt;3 - Inside Information cards. The most fun, these cards can be kept by players and played at the most advantageous moment. For example, by raising a share price immediately before you sell, or dropping it as you want to buy (or your opponents sell!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This UK game was released at the height of the yuppie, 'greed is good' period in the late 80's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
