							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kirby Mass Attack</name>
									
			<description>An evil wizard named Necrodius casts a curse on Kirby that splits him into ten pieces. Kirby and his many pieces must venture forth to defeat Necrodius and pull himself together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by using the stylus to command up to ten Kirbys on the screen. Tapping the screen creates a star that the Kirbys can follow or cling onto. By tapping enemies or obstacles on the screen, players can send multiple Kirbys to attack them, with the player also able to flick individual Kirbys as projectiles. In order to defeat most enemies and progress through each level, the player must collect multiple Kirbys by collecting pieces of fruit. When 100 points of Kirbys are obtained, a new Kirby appears, with a maximum of ten controllable at any time. If a Kirby is hit by an enemy or obstacle, it will turn blue until the player reaches a checkpoint. If a blue Kirby is hit, it will turn grey and float away unless the player can drag him down and turn him blue again, with the game ending if the player runs out of Kirbys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Kirby Mass Attack&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
