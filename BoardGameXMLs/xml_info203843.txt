			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I, the archaeologist Mistroom Everglance, have explored many ancient sites to bring to you the knowledge amassed in the Compendium you now hold before you. Accompanied by only the best adventurers I have entered ruined keeps and the long abandoned towers of famous sorcerers. Here I found the spells of old masters of magic like Dreamweaver and Ingmar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By far most spells however I have found in safer places. The Master Transmuter of the gnomic University of Magic of Oredig has granted me to search through the tomes he made as a young adult, and the vast library of the elves of Faruel proved a rich source of spells from the famous half-elven transmutress known as the Green Orion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this tome I present you not only these ancient spells, but also the much newer findings of that famous gnomic illusionist Onno Trickthought, whom I met at the University of Rockhome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from these wizard's spells, I have endeavoured to bring together a large amount of priestly prayers. These I found in the annals of the orders of Solonor Thelandria, Corellon Larethian, Dugmaren Brightmantle and Gaia. I hereby thank these priesthoods for their invaluable contributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of safety precautions, this tome only presents spells from the first to the fifth level. Higher level spells will be included in a future edition of this tome, which will only be accessible by members of the gnomic universities and faithful priests of the above mentioned orders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still, be careful in the examination of the spells contained in this book, and refrain from inappropriate use of their powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes wizard and cleric spells from 1st through 5th level.  The spells are organized by class, level, and then alphabetically.  The document went through several revisions.  The final revision was translated into Dutch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
