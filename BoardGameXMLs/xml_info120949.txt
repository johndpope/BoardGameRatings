							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Antipode</name>
									
			<description>Antipode is played on a 5-hexagon, with elements of Hex, Othello, Yinsh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn a player places a token of his color, flipping any adjacent tokens (ala Othello).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the second step of your turn is to move your pawn. You may move your pawn any number of spaces in a straight line, making no turns in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your pawn must come to rest on a token of your own color. You may not land on an empty space, or one of your opponent&amp;rsquo;s tokens. While you are allowed to pass over as many tokens and empty spaces as you wish, you may not, under any circumstances, pass over your opponent&amp;rsquo;s pawn. Passing over tokens causes them to be flip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player successfully makes a connection from any one corner to that corner&amp;rsquo;s exact opposite (Hex-like). The connection will cover a minimum of nine spaces, but the connection does not need to form a straight line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
