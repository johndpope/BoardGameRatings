			<description>Object of the game&lt;br/&gt;Superpion is a kind of checkers that can play up to four players. Besides the number of players, with the notable difference is that the ladies are orthogonal movement while catches are diagonal. The goal is to capture the most of his opponents pieces without getting caught hers: at the end of the game, each captured pawn is worth 1 point, 2 points each pin retained. Each player can also try one or more Superpions reaching the bottom line of the opposing camps. The Superpions allow increased catches by scanning the plate with a larger amplitude (equivalent of a Lady).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there are only pawns in a single player on the board, or when taken have become impossible.&lt;br/&gt;Each player add up points: 1 point per captured pieces, 2 points per his own pieces on the board.&lt;br/&gt;The player who has scored the most points is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
