			<description>The Last Days of the Golden Dawn is a semi-cooperative survival horror game for 3-5 players. In it, players take on the roles of individual members of a mystical secret society that have emerged from hiding after an earth-shattering supernatural cataclysm. Players will be at odds with a post-apocalyptic wasteland, the creatures that inhabit it, and even each other as they struggle to survive. As characters inevitably perish due to the scarcity of resources and abundance of threats, they will be twisted into dark wraiths that then work against their former comrades but can fight to bring themselves back to life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During their turns, players will explore different tiles, foraging for food, and surviving encounters during the day.  As night falls, the players become hunted by the various supernatural predators who have claimed the world for their own. Each round of play represents a single 24-hour period with day and night phases, and players will be pushed to their limits to make it complete the ancient ritual that will banish the Lovecraftian forces of darkness in a harrowing 2-week window. Players will have to watch their health as the days pass as they fight off both injury and starvation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Food is the most valuable resource of all, and the more players you have, the faster it is consumed. If the food supply is ever depleted at the end of the round and health counters tick down, players will be forced to make some very difficult choices ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
