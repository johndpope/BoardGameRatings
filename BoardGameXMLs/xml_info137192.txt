			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Your job is to give new players a fast 20 minute experience that feels like it could have been torn from the best James Bond, Jason Bourne or Mission Impossible movies. This requires a cinematic demo that stays rules-light, even as it explores some of the game&amp;rsquo;s major mechanics and themes. A quick game like this gives the player the cinematic feel of &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;re badass spies!&amp;rdquo; lets them save the day against high stakes, and lets them see how general and investigative skills work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs chase a terrorist through the streets of Krakow Poland. The car they are chasing contains Nikolai Limrovich, a sleazy Russian arms dealer. The car is driven by his bodyguard. The players believe that Nikolai stole a suitcase-sized nuclear device from a secret Polish military facility. The PCs have to stop him before he and his bodyguard escapes with the goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
