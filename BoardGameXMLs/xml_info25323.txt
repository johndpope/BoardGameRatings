							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Casey Jones Game Box</name>
									
			<description>The Casey Jones Game Box contains three games: Blow the Whistle, Capital Run, and Freight Train.  All games are played with a single die, and (at most) 20 train cars.  Blow the Whistle is a simple race game for two players, playable by children as young as three-years-old. Players roll and move, with the requirement that they make horn sounds at certain points in the game.  The first player to reach the finish line wins.  Capital Run is a game for older children, with up to four players.  This game also has a roll-and-move mechanic, and players must successfully name state capitals in order to earn a turn, with the object to cross the country on a preset path.  Freight train is light but nontrivial game for two players, requiring players to assemble a set of different types of trains.  These trains (coal tender, box car, flat car, cattle car) begin the game on preset spaces, and players must roll around the board and assemble their set.  There are several opportunities for decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
