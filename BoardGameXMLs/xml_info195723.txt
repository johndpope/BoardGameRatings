			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2119 on Earth. The United Nations Intergalactic Treaty Enforcement (U.N.I.T.E.) branch of the Terran Government has for years now declared Tarrath (the beautiful and mystical planet on the &amp;quot;other side&amp;quot; of the black hole Cygnus x-1) off limits to Space Dogs Tarrithium Miners and High Tech Corporations. The original plan was to keep the technology level on the New World similar to that of the Gren who were transplanted to the innocent world from their own doomed planet. Their civilization was much like that of Earth's &amp;quot;Old West&amp;quot;. It was during the Black Hole Rush of 2079 that the Terrans learned once again that things do not always go as planned. Despite the Space Troopers, U.N.I.T.E. Cavalry, and Tech Rangers efforts to keep technology off the planet. There are Company Men, Serials and a host of other Tech Offenders making their job difficult. That is not to say that life is any easier for the other alien races on Tarrath like the Chireet Kireen, H'sharr, Purrians and Worvits who are all trying to survive this time of expansion and politics. It is definitely a wilder west on some very Strange Frontiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strange Frontiers is a complete role-playing game for two or more players. The game features a new and unique combat and magic system that allows 5 different wound effects for every attack and 11 different effects for each spell cast. There are 11 races, 13 professions, 183 skills, and 144 spells to choose from. So saddle up and grab the reins, it's gonna' be a great adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
