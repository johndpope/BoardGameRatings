With their time machine pieces, the players will be able to perform actions like move time, move the agents between continents, sell technologies to the Time Museum, clean Paradoxes, acquire new missions o gather future technologies. Moving time will affect all players simultaneously, as their time machines are time-locked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can end in either of these conditions: all players have completed 12 missions overall, which will trigger final scoring to declare a winner, or if three continents get permanently blocked due to an excess in paradoxes, in which case all players will lose and the Earth will be erased from hist...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
