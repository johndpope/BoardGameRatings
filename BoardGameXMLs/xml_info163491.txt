							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">American War of Independence Rules</name>
									
			<description>These rules have been written to give an easily playable game which reflects the style of battles fought during the American War of Independence, and the French and Indian Wars. To simplify the game a standard size of unit is employed and only a few major formations are permitted. Figures are not removed but a simple record needs to be kept of the status of each unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules assume that 25mm figures will be used, but they can be used for 15mm by using 2/3 the distances specified. The scales are flexible and can be adjusted to reflect the size of battle being fought provided the ratios are maintained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
