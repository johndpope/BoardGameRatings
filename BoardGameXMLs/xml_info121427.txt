			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;A fantasy golf themed card game. Players choose different characters and a stage consisting of a series of cards is created. All players start at the first card, and try to pass them in order by playing cards from their hand, by exceeding the stage card level with the card they play. All cards have a specific effect and can be played to hinder other players from advancing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points after 3 stages wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
