							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Butt-Ugly Martians: The Race to Rescue Dog</name>
									
			<description>The famous martian hunter, Stoat Muldoon, has captured Dog and is holding him captive deep within his secret silo.  Without Dog, the Butt Ugly Martians can't transmit their phony battle report to the old swagtar, Emperor Bog.  If Bog doesn't receive his update in time, he'll take matters into his own hands, and conquer earth.  It's up to you to help the hyperkinetic Butt Ugly Martians get into butt kickin' mode and rescue Dog.  It's easy to get lost in Muldoon's maze, so follow the arrows and try to stay on track.  The first person to race through the silo and reach Dog wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the player roll the blue die and moves his/her pawn in the direction of the arrows. If the space where you land is a Butt-Ugly Martian space or aStoat Muldoon space, draw a corresponding card and immediately do what is says. Keep going. Landing on a room spaces ends your turn.&lt;br/&gt;When you land on a Emperor Bog Dr Damage space, roll the black Emperor Bog die. If Emperor Bog Dr Damaged is rolled, move him one space closer towards earth.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach Dog wins the game. When Emperor Bog reaches the earth, before Dog is rescued, the game is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
