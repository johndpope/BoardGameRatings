			<description>His stomach is growling, so the hungry genie in the lamp is demanding that you serve him a crazy volume of dishes! You and your teammates play a hand of cards to try to satisfy his unreasonable orders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genie's Banquet is a cooperative card game, and to win all players must work together to clear four rounds, with four orders being placed in each round &amp;mdash; and the later the round, the more difficult the combinations of order cards that appear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each order card features a few requirements, such as &amp;quot;kind of food&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;number of dishes&amp;quot;, while each dish card in the hand of players shows one kind (hamburger, pasta, curry, chicken) and one number (1-8). Each turn, you play a hand to satisfy the genie's order card requirement, and when all of the requirements are satisfied, it can be cleared. However, you can't tell your teammates which cards you have; you can say only things like, &amp;quot;I want to use a hand for this order!&amp;quot; You and your team can play only limited hands (eight cards at first) in each round, so you must play them efficiently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To overcome these difficulties, you can cooperate with your teammates to clear order cards &amp;quot;in a row&amp;quot;; doing so gets you a magical jewel that can grant various useful magic to support you during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With your wisdom and this magical power, let's satisfy the genie's crazy stomach, after which you might finally hear him say the magic words: &amp;quot;You have three wishes...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
