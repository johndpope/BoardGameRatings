			<description>The Blueprints product line offers you old-fashioned blue printed maps for using in your adventures and campaigns. For each map you get a blueprint version and a standard black and white version. The maps are all vector-based so you will get maximum print resolution. Despite their old fashioned appearance each map offers you a degree of customization, using the pdf technology at its best. A button (which will not be printed) on each map allows you to turn on and off the grid, eliminate the room numbers, get the walls filled, don&amp;rsquo;t show doors and furniture and many other options, depending on the kind of map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each product features a classic fantasy adventure location: a dungeon, a keep, a temple complex, a thieves guild and so on. You can use these map as reference to build your own adventures or simply take them at hand in case your players go in an unexpected direction during the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Under the Ruins of Castle Blackcrow lies the famed Dungeon of Thirteen Undead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The legend tells that the warlord Graunth Obadai wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to conquer Castle Blackcrow, inhabited by a human clan of fierce warriors. It is said that the warlord killed 13 of his bravest warriors and his shaman turned them into frightening undead. The undead eventually conquered the castle but were forced to rest under its ground, in the ancient catacombs under the castle&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graunth Obadai, surprised by the might of his newly created undead army, wanted them forever at his service, but when the shaman told him it wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible and that the undead were bound to the ground they were created, the warlord killed brutally his loyal shaman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually the warlord left the place, but the ghost of the shaman is still said to haunt the Dungeon of Thirteen Undead, as well as the 13 lieutenants undead, of course&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product expands a location found in &amp;Oslash;one's Blueprints: The Ruined Town&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
