			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;600 years from now, Man uncovers the key to swift interstellar travel, unlocking countless possibilities. As he explores, catalogs, and colonizes, he discovers he is alone, a single beacon of sentience in the vast galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;800 years from now, Man dominates the galaxy. Thousands of tamed or terraformed planets contribute to the unstoppable machines of civilization. Automation and artificial intelligence enable humanity to pursue art, leisure, and recreation with unprecedented fervor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;900 years from now: Unprepared, poorly defended, and off-guard, the very technology that promoted progress contributes to humanity's downfall: From outside our galaxy, an alien fleet invades, not to conquer or exploit, but to exterminate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Billions are slaughtered, and the great galactic cataclysm begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1100 years from now, Man rebuilds. he rises from the wreckage of his past, rediscovers his colonial brothers. Artificial intelligence is outlawed. Governments are fully supplanted by corporate interests, securities, and limitless capitalism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1700 years from now, a single corporation rules our galaxy. It is producer, government, and even religion. Work is done by genetically modified humans and their offspring. Everything and everyone exists to serve and better the faceless corporation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there are malcontents, both within and outside the system. They are few, but their number grows... And perhaps now is the time to strike. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the era of change. This is the era of revolution. This is the era of Reforger. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reforger uses a combination movement point and dice pool system to give players a wide variety of tactical options while retaining a fast-paced feel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notable features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A Tactical Point system that allows you to conserve actions for later use out-of-turn, providing &amp;quot;take that&amp;quot; interruptive attacks or other combat feats.&lt;br/&gt;     Lucky and Unlucky Breaks, which provide customization options for your character on a per-session basis. Take control of the story and deepen your character's personality by playing single-use instances of heroic action or dramatic misfortune.&lt;br/&gt;     Wide variety of character building options for all manner of sci-fi archtype or style, including implants and genetic alterations, with an easy-to-grasp point-buy system that allows players and GMs to easily create as many system customizations that they like.&lt;br/&gt;     Lightly-detailed, but compelling sci-fi universe which explains just enough to spark your imagination without choking you on over-indulgent details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
