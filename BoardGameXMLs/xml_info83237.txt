							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Host of the Clutter</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mallory couldn&amp;rsquo;t recall how she&amp;rsquo;d ended up in the middle of the woods, but she was becoming used to finding herself in strange locations with no memory of how she&amp;rsquo;d arrived. She was a little more annoyed than usual about it, though. She had been in the shelter, looking for the tape. It was important. If they found it, they would learn about the Clutter, and then they would come after her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undoubtedly, it was the Clutter that had brought her here. They were always with her, comforting Mallory through her sickness. Mallory hadn&amp;rsquo;t felt quite right for months now, and every day she felt increasingly drained from her illness. She was lucky to have them. One of the Clutter, a burly, ginger tomcat she had loving named Britches, weaved in and out of Mallory&amp;rsquo;s bony, arthritic legs as she shuffled stiffly forward. Weak sunlight filtered through the leaves, dappling the corpse sprawled on the forest floor. The body was covered in hundreds of scratches, and chunks of flesh had been playfully ripped away by dozens of small feline jaws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not again!&amp;rdquo; Mallory exclaimed with the same bemused exasperation of a cat owner discovering a dead mouse carcass gift on the stoop. &amp;ldquo;Whatever shall I do with all of you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All around her, the Clutter moved through the trees: cats of every color, long haired and short, purring so loudly that Mallory could feel it reverberate through her tired bones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Collection of Horrors is an anthology of Storyteller tools inspired by the Horror Recognition Guide that you can either use in conjunction with the Guide or as part of your existing Hunter: The Vigil chronicle. You can get a free introduction here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each story kit in the Collection of Horrors (which you can buy individually, as a bundle or as a subscription) contains variety of appropriate tools; usually an SAS scene, a character with a character sheet, and props ranging from maps and reports to print out and hand to your players, to short imbedded audio files that you can play at your gaming table. These kits represent a collection of evocative story tools that you can write a story around, drop into an existing SAS or even string together. They aren&amp;rsquo;t stories in their own right, but rather pieces that you can snap together into whatever shape you want. Using the Guide can add even more props and ideas to this anthology, but it&amp;rsquo;s not required to use the various story kits in the Collection of Horrors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
