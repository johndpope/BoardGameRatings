			<description>Over 6,000 Possibilities!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a table of 120 generic events, including everything from weather to quests to enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rolling twice against the table allows for a distinct narrative to be created, with the combinations creating over 6000 possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, if we roll 1, 7, that gives us Environmental Challenges &amp;ndash; Drought. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rolling again, we get 6, 12, which gives us Mission Offered &amp;ndash; Find Missing Person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you tell the players something like this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A terrible drought has befallen the land. It&amp;rsquo;s been weeks since the last rainfall and not a cloud in the sky. Mayor Mainott is at his wit&amp;rsquo;s end. However, he believes that the legendary shaman, Misty Waters, may hold the key to solving this crisis. The only issue is that Misty went missing several months ago and no one knows where she went.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
