							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wyne Tasting Game</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in a cloth bag and includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) A game board, silk screened on heavy fabric &lt;br/&gt;  2) 4 packets each with fifteen game tokens&lt;br/&gt;  3) Instructions and rules of the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to capture five squares in a row, horizontal, vertical or diagonal!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play with more than four people by having people play in teams sharing a marker set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, the player (or team) marks a square. Then, he drinks a sample of wine (as indicated on the square) or eats a sample of food (as indicated on the square). Each player starts by placing a marker on a white wine space, and from then on, he has to alternate wine and food space. You can either stay with white wine or change to blush/rose and after that to red. At a minimum, it is recommended to bring at least 3 kinds of wine, with at least one white, one blush/rose, and one red. Think of this as similar to a Pente' wine party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several different wines listed on the game board:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     White, Blush, and Red Wine&lt;br/&gt;     Riesling, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, White Zinfandel, Merlot, and &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Port&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Sweet, Dry, Fruit, and Dessert Wine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take as little or as much wine as you want to drink on each turn.&lt;br/&gt;Drink responsibly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
