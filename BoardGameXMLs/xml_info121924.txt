			<description>Easy to assemble into a host of different shapes and sizes, the Building Accessory Pack will have you fighting in an urban warzone in no time. Strike down your foes from the rooftops. Blast away at troops hiding behind protective brick walls. Lead risky hand-to-hand assaults in the dilapidated hallways of once great buildings. The Building Accessory Pack allows you to do all of this and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion contains two more structure levels that can be used to build an urban battlefield for Dust Tactics. Get into cover and clash with your opponents at point blank range with this new expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion includes a 2 story building similar to the one included in the Operation &amp;quot;Cerberus&amp;quot; expansion. This will allow for building to building combat or as expanding the size and dimensions of the building included in Operation &amp;quot;Cerberus&amp;quot; if available to you. The rules for movement and combat in buildings is outlined in the Operation &amp;quot;Cerberus&amp;quot; rules available on the Fantasy Flight Games website, however this expansion does not require Operation &amp;quot;Cerberus&amp;quot; to be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
