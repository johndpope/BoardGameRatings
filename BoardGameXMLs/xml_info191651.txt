			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He is on a mission to end all superhumans&amp;hellip; Metacide!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 9 Rogue, Metacide (who calls himself &amp;ldquo;The Purifier&amp;rdquo;) is a fanatic on a mission of death. He is an iconic character in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metacide's file is designated &amp;quot;Orange&amp;quot; to indicate his lack of metahuman super-powers, his mission bolstered by anti-metahuman weaponry and training. He&amp;rsquo;s bigoted and violent, driven to hunt down and destroy anyone with super-normal abilities, regardless of whether they pose any actual threat to humanity. He is often employed by masterminds or organizations which share his zeal for destruction, or simply want to use him as a hindrance for heroes getting in their way. He may also simply target a hero for using powers in public, or for supporting the &amp;ldquo;Metahuman Agenda.&amp;rdquo; A hero who is struggling with a sense of identity in a world that is torn apart by the existence of metahumans will certainly come into conflict with Metacide sooner or later, as he represents a very punch-able incarnation of bigotry. Metacide is ready to deploy against such heroes at a moment&amp;rsquo;s notice with his P.A.S.S. system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
