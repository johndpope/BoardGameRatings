							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Silver Dart-Class Light Freighter</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Silver Dart-class light freighter is a spaceship in the classic mould of sci-fi trading. It is small and fast, but it packs a punch. It is no military design, however, and the design has significant weaknesses in combat. It is best suited to tramp trading, and rules for tramp trading are included, which can easily be bolted onto any sci-fi role-playing game. There are also new rules for &amp;lsquo;glancing&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;penetrating&amp;rsquo; critical hits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a section looking at the life of a tramp freighter's crew, including their pay and conditions, there is a section on passengers (especially those wishing to avoid any imperial entanglements) and there are the usual deck plans, artwork showing operators' colour schemes, and pictures of the spaceship in operation, on the ground and in deep space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
