							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Synthicide Beta 2.0</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in a galaxy on the verge of collapse, where bullets are more common than food and equally essential for survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An evil mutant force called the Prodigravus attempted to absorb all of humanity. A millennium-long war ensued, destroying every civilized planet. The Milky Way has descended into a dark age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tech cult called the Tharnaxist Church retained scraps of scientific knowledge. They used it to gain power over the surviving humans and mutants, but these cybernetic Priests aren&amp;rsquo;t interested in the lives of organics. They only care about discovering more technology and building Synthetic beings to run their society. Under Tharnaxist rule, the murdering of a robot &amp;ndash; also known as Synthicide &amp;ndash; is regarded as the highest crime on any planet. If one commits Synthicide and is caught, they earn the ire of the Church.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With human life devalued, remaining social structures have descended into barbarism, extortion, and gang-rule. Anyone with the means has become a Sharper: an independent agent that drifts from world to world, scraping by on dirty work. For a Sharper, floating through space is preferable to settling down on any Tharnaxist-ruled hellhole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
