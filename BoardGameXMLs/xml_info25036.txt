							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Amazing Africa: A Cultural Adventure</name>
									
			<description>A part of the Fast Track Learning game series, the card game is designed to help children learn important facts about the history, culture, people and geography of Africa.  Each card features a question and an answer to another question found on a matching card; players take turns asking other players for cards that answer their questions (similar to Go Fish).  The player with the most matches at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
