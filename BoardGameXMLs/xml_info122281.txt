			<description>This game is not like the normal Rummy family of card games.  A standard deck of cards is included along with a betting layout (like Craps or Roulette)and chips.  Play begins by having players make bets in an ante style on the layout. Followed by dealing out all the cards in hands to each player including a dummy hand and the dealer.  Play proceeds in a sequencing style with each player in turn playing a card from low to high in suit. When players cannot follow suit because of the missing cards from the dummy hand, a new suit is played. When a player runs out of cards he wins the chips in the Kitty section of the layout.  The other betting areas are for specific cards and card sequences being played (6-7-8, etc.) with the card(s) player winning the chips in that specific layout spot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
