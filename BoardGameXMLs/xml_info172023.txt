			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you want to play a rascally rabbit...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animal Races: Clan of the Rabbit introduces a new player character race of humanoid rabbits. Play Rabbits, Pikas, and Hares whose fast-paced culture is an ideal breeding ground for adventurers. Learn acrobatic feats that let you leap about the battlefield; race to reap the rewards of an adventuring life while evading the monsters that traditionally prey upon your people; or take a quiet moment to sit still and study the heavens, as some Hares are wont to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included: an overview of the Zodiac Council, its clerics, and the animal races that control each of its thirteen seats. Founded by ancient Rabbit stargazers anxious to preserve the astrological lore of their ancestors, the Zodiac Council is a church of astrologer-priests devoted to the preservation of knowledge and to the rule of law. It is also a cultural melting pot rife with political intrigue, so take care when participating in its internal affairs...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
