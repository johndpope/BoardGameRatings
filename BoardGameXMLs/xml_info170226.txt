							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood of Dragons</name>
									
			<description>Blood of Dragons is a MUSH based upon George R.R. Martin's best-selling fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fully approved by the author, Blood of Dragons MUSH is set some 140 years prior to the books (and some 50 years prior to the novellas The Hedge Knight and The Sworn Sword), in the days and years following the Conquest of Dorne and in the time of such legends as Daeron I, the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy and his brother Aemon the Dragonknight. The focus of the game is on the nobility of the Seven Kingdoms, with the open areas being the royal capital of King's Landing and Sunspear in Dorne, and the aim is to provide high-quality role-playing in a fascinating medieval-inspired setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
