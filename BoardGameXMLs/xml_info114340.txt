							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ghost Pirates: Kickstarter Exclusive Cards</name>
									
			<description>This is a set of additional promotional cards for Ghost Pirates that was made available exclusively to those who supported the Kickstarter project at a certain level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sea Wolf (captain) - When your captain would be forced to walk the plank, return him to the poop deck under control of your opponent (treat as an additional mate who returns to opponent&amp;rsquo;s Poop Deck, not your own). Your Mate now runs the ship, and must behave as the captain if he is on your ship (or once he returns to your ship).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rats (treasure) - Play on a cargo hold. This cargo hold enters play with 0 crew and may not be replaced. Any fights taking place here score one additional automatic hit per side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;East India Trading Co. Representative (captain) - On your turn, when EITC rep is in a fight, kill one opposing crew before normal fight dice are rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
