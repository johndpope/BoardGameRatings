			<description>Commander is the most awesome real-time strategy / tower defense on planet Earth with innovative game mechanics, a gorgeous art direction and a memorable &amp;quot;easy to learn, hard to master&amp;quot; gameplay experience. You are the rising leader of the resistance against a mysterious alien lifeform that is trying to anihilate the humanity (!) You can bend the path taken by the asteroids in the game with a special gravitational turret!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Commander&amp;rdquo; is a fast-paced tower defense set in a distant future where evil aliens are throwing asteroids at humans&amp;rsquo; colonies! As the &amp;ldquo;Commander&amp;rdquo;, you must strategically place mercenaries (the turrets) in planets&amp;rsquo; and space stations&amp;rsquo; slots to protect the capital of each colony. You will buy, upgrade and sell mercenaries as in any other tower defense game but you will also be able to drive spaceships, blow up planets and call The Resistance (a 3 spaceship army) to help you save the world. There are 6 different mercenaries and one of them is atypical: the gravitational mercenary. In a nutshell, this mercenary defines the path followed by the enemies. The rule is simple: the path will go through all the planets where this mercenary is installed. This is a feature never seen in others tower defense games! &amp;ldquo;Commander&amp;rdquo; don&amp;rsquo;t focus on high scores, stats, diluted content, etc. Every level is unique, really challenging, and will take more than one try to complete. The player must understand the optimal strategy for each one and concentrate on what matters when there is so much things going on the screen (i.e.: always keep an eye on the planet to protect and do whatever it takes to kill those asteroids!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
