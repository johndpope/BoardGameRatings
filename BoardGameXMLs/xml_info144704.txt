			<description>Duudsonit Lautapeli is a Finnish board game were you are one of the Dudesons' and try to gather as much publicity as you can. Duudsonit (The Dudesons) are Finnish Ostrobotnian equivalent to Jackass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically this is a card game with the point scoring board. The player who gets through the board first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game you play several episodes, which consist of player turns. In your turn you have four choices: Play A card, change a card, heal one body part or pass. When you pass, you are out until the end of the current episode. At the end of the episode player/players with the most publicity gets to go forward two spaces in the board. The player/players with second most publicity gets to go forward one space. The episode ends when every player passes or is unable to play cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three types of cards in the deck: prank, stunt and hassle cards. Hassle cards cause some kind of events to happen. You get publicity either by making pranks or stunts. Making pranks causes injuries to chosen player and gives you publicity. Making Stunts gives you both the publicity and the injury.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is three types of injuries (two each): Leg, hand and bodily injuries. Getting injuries might unable you from playing certain cards. Injuries are taken randomly from the bag and positioned in the players personal player board. If you have all six injuries, you are sent to hospital and you are out until the end of the episode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
