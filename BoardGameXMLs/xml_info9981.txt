							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grid Iron</name>
									
			<description>Grid Iron is the new, fast paced, action packed football game played with eight dice. With Grid Iron, you will not only be transformed into the Quarterback barking out the plays, but also the Coach, the Receiver and the Fullback barreling ahead for that First Down. You'll also get to make great defensive plays, like flying in as the Safety to make a leaping stab at the ball, or as the Linebacker coming in to make a crushing stop on the ball carrier. Grid Iron is an easy game to learn. Yet the combination of strategy, skill and luck makes every game played a pressure cooker. So if you can stand the pain, get ready to knock heads with the best of them for hours of fun and competition. Game includes eight dice, playing field, five game markers, score pad and instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
