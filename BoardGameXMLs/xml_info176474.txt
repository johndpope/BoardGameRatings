			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stakes For Tabletop Roleplaying gives a listing for a variety of actions that characters might undertake in a game, a complex of possible interesting outcomes for those actions, and sample 'perks' for the specialist. It is intended mainly for the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    For Tenocha, Shamblington, and other games from Levi Kornelsen, these are ready-made expansions to the action available.  For Infected, where this action list originated, the included perks can easily be added to character advancement.&lt;br/&gt;    For game hacking, such stakes can be quickle adapted to add more depth to areas where some games are light, and to create new custom 'moves' for games that already use complex stakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For design, these stakes can be used as a placeholder or as a base to work off.  The contents are copyright-free so that you can cut and paste any portions you wish.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to being a general-use set of tools, Stakes is part of a larger gaming platform.
