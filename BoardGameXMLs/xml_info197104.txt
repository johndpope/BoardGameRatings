This deck adds a new push your luck mechanic:  Stomping Grounds!  This is an ability that Apex cards have on them.  When these Apex cards are played, the player may choose to invade the Hoard of another player instead of hunting.  This is played out by comparing Hunt Value totals between the attacker and defender.  The defender will reveal cards from their Ambush Point and/or their hand, to generate Hunt points.  If the attacker wins they invade their targets territory and steal any card from their Hoard.  If the defender wins, they are chased off and gain an Affliction card to their discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
