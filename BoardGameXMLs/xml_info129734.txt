			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Serial killers aren&amp;rsquo;t extraordinarily smart. They aren&amp;rsquo;t privy to special insight into human nature or the realities of life. They don&amp;rsquo;t see through things, and they don&amp;rsquo;t do things because they&amp;rsquo;re above us. Serial killers kill because they are evil. They kill because they enjoy it, they kill because it thrills them, and they kill because they want to. Some of them might have reasons; some reasons might stem from a childhood of horrific abuse. But the fact remains they kill because some part of their mind wants to kill. Some of them are smart. Some of them are unbelievably intricate. Some of them weave complex plots around what they are doing. Serial killers might evade police for years, or, as in the case of The Green River Killer in Seattle, forever. Sometimes they kill themselves, and sometimes they turn themselves in. The latter occurred in the case of Edmund Kemper, who called the police after killing his mother. This book is not attempting to glorify anything, and it is not attempting to make the lives of serial killers seem neat or interesting or exciting. This book is here because serial killers are a reality and would exist in a place like Haven. There are no rules in this book for playing serial killers. This book is designed for a responsible, adult audience. While all of this material can be ported over to any modern d20 campaign, it has been designed with Haven: City of Violence D20 Modern in mind, and as such it might be too gritty or lethal for more general d20 games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
