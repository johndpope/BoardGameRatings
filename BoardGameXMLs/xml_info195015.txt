			<description>Mother Truckers is a CB jaw-jackin', blacktop fast-trackin', madcap dash across 1970s America for 2-4 players.  The goal of the game is for your female trucker to make a name for herself by being the first to gain 12 Fame Points and show the boys you can outhaul, outdrive, and outwit every other gearjammer on the road.  Put the hammer down as you pick up Commodities and deliver them to cities that demand them for Fame.  Earn Action cards for your accomplishments and use them to dominate the highway as you become a truck driving legend!  Just be sure to steer clear of old smokey...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, a player rolls the Movement Die and optionally the Speeding Die if they wish to attempt speeding.  Speeding can allow for an extra Movement point per turn, but can cause wasted fuel trying to avoid the cops if they catch you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player may then split their Movement between physically moving road spaces on the map, refueling, and picking up or dropping off loads in cities.  Each road space costs 10% fuel and players are towed to the connected city of another player's choice if they run out of fuel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contracts offer incentives to deliver certain types of goods or travel to specific regions for bonus Fame.  Action cards spice up the game by creating risky scenarios for extra Fame such as Bar Brawls and Street Chicken.  Or, play devious deeds against your opponents such as shooting out their gas tanks and stealing their loads.  Naturally, all cards are flavored with classic 1970s CB jargon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
