							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zulu Spears</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Card game. Simulates a battle between Zulu &amp;amp; British Troops.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player represents the Zulu forces and the other player is the British. Each side has its own custom deck of 52 cards. Through card play the British may build fortifications, Zulu snipers can attack, and British sharpshooters can fire back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Zulu player also gets to decide whether or not there is a melee attack each turn. When the players do battle, the Zulu player tries to inflict casualties by playing cards having a higher total Force Value than those played by the British player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Zulu Victory: If all 100 of the British troops are killed than the Zulu win.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;British Victory: If the Zulu player goes to draw a card and there are no cards left in his deck and the British player still has troops remaining, than the Zulu give up and go home, and the British win.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
