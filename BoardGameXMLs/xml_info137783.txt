							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Globetrotters&#039; Guide to the Old World</name>
									
			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;European colonialism stretches back to the days of the Roman Republic, though its modern history begins with the voyages of the great 15th century Portuguese and Spanish navigators. Today, many of the European powers have colonies across the globe. Some, like France, Germany, and Great Britain, are on the ascent, while the superpowers of old, Portugal and Spain, are waning. Aside from occasional clashes with the Ottoman Empire, which still holds parts of southeastern Europe in its ailing grip, the continent appears to be at peace. Beneath the surface of political calm, though, the twin currents of colonial ambition and avarice are swirling and gaining strength. It may not be known to the common man, but those in positions of power sense war is coming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains two new Leagues, information and adventure seeds on countries the length and breadth of Europe, three sample characters, and eight sample henchmen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
