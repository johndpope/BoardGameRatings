							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Escape from the MindMaster</name>
									
			<description>Escape from the MindMaster was a video game for the Starpath Supercharger addon for the Atari 2600 published in 1982 by Starpath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escape from the MindMaster utilizes a tape cassette through the Starpath Supercharger. This is used to bypass the 2K limitation of available memory in the Atari 2600. Each game has 6 levels, 2 levels per load, giving an effective total of 6K for each game, which allows for better graphics and more complicated gameplay than the average 2K cartridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player's goal in the game is to solve the maze consisting of a series of hallways and rooms. The rooms either were empty, contained puzzle pegs, or has a bonus game that allowed the user to collect more points. Each level had its own individual bonus game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The solve the maze, players had to collect keys called &amp;quot;puzzle pegs&amp;quot; that are designed as shapes to find their corresponding sockets. Only one peg can be held on to one at a time. After placing all the pegs correctly, the player is able to go on to the next level through a now unlocked door. As the levels advanced, the pegs begin to appear more similar to confuse the player. The pegs are placed randomly each time the game is re-booted. There is a time limit in which to finish the maze by, although you are not penalized for exceeding the time, you do get bonus points for each second under the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This must be done all the while avoiding the Alien stalker which would be roaming the maze. If it gets too close to you, you would have to start again. There are two parts to each maze, a safe part, and the part where the creature is, separated by doors. Regardless of which room the player is in, you can tell how close the creature is by the beeping he makes. The louder and faster, the closer it is. In the more advances mazes, there are also large squares that slide out of a wall into the adjacent wall which must be avoided in order for the player to progress. The third maze introduces one way doors, which disappear once you go through them, making you continue some other route.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Escape From the Mindmaster&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Situation You've been abducted. Kidnapped. Snatched in your sleep, right out of your bed. Right in your own home town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nobody could stop him. His proton beam made you glow like a Christmas tree. A few seconds later you disappeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You never even woke up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You slowly awaken. Surrounding you are giant walls, smooth as glass. Endless corridors, with no apparent escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you explore your strange prison, you encounter various games. You realize that these games are tests--of your intelligence, memory, coordination, and reflexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It slowly dawns on you that you're the subject of an incredible experiment. Then you realize that you're not alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MindMaster looms above you, watching your every move. You must use all the brainpower you possess. Not only to be able to solve the maze-- but to preserve the honor of the human race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
