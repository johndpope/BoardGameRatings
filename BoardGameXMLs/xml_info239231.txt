			<description>The summoner has brought forth factions from distant worlds to use as pawns in our game. Take your choice of Dragons, Robots, Wild West or Zombies as you take on your opponents. Use the creatures of these lands to build and maintain a shared Defense Wall, while also strategically capturing as many Heroes as you can. Knock out your opponents&amp;rsquo; attackers before the Blitz, or leave them with nothing but Shadows and you&amp;rsquo;ll win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New factions are coming soon for expanded gameplay up to 8 players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most basic ruleset of the game works mainly like a matching game that can be played by anyone with the ability to add to 10.  Advanced rules turn this basic game into a battle of wits with chess-like decision making and strategy in nearly every card pull.  Rules are available for head-to-head 2 player games, free-for-all games of 3 and up and team games. Optional rules can also be applied that change up game play and strategies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
