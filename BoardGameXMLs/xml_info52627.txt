			<description>From the Back:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the Great Clans are the Emerald Empire&amp;rsquo;s most obvious movers of great events, they are not the only ones. Since the Dawn of the Empire, the Emperor has retained the right to create Minor Clans as reward to those who have served with great distinction. The Imperial Families - the Seppun, the Otomo, and the Miya - have devoted their lives to serving the Imperial Throne directly, and although they are small compared to the Great Clan families, the pride they take in their role as the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s own retained servants makes up for their lack of numbers. And ronin, though despised as 'wave-men' are always useful to their betters as freelance soldiers and are on occasion important parts of the social order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fealty and Freedom examines all of these Rokugani factions and gives them their due. Fealty and Freedom features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Detailed histories of the Minor Clans, the Imperial Families, and the role of Ronin in the Emerald Empire including profiles of notable characters.&lt;br/&gt;    * Advice and insight for playing characters from all of these factions and how their unique perspectives fit into the Emerald Empire.&lt;br/&gt;    * New and updated character creation and development mechanics for all existing Minor Clans, the Imperial Families, and Ronin characters.&lt;br/&gt;    * Historical summary describing some of the factions who have come and gone from the Emerald Empire, including the Hantei and Toturi Dynasties, as well as Minor Clans which have been absorbed into the Great Clans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
