			<description>In this quick and light card game, players try to be the best barista by playing sets of Ingredient Cards to match the Order Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, 4 order cards are laid out. Each player starts with a hand of 7 ingredient cards. On his/her turn, the player can either (a) play (=lay down) ingredient card(s) below the order card(s) accordingly and draw from the deck to replenish into 7 cards in hand; OR (b) discard as many ingredient cards as he/she wants and draw from the deck to replenish into 7 cards in hand. The player who plays the last ingredient card for an order card receives the order card as the reward. Then, a new order card is turned up so that there is always 4 order cards on display. Game continues until there is no more order card available. Each order card has face-value point, and there is bonus for 2 or 3 order cards of the same kind. Whoever has the most points at the end is declared as the best barista.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
