			<description>Imaginary Range is a full&amp;ndash;color comic that includes a selection of mini&amp;ndash;games inserted within the flow of the plot, immersing gamers alongside the cast as they proceed through the story. The project was overseen by Motomu Toriyama, director of FINAL FANTASY&amp;reg; XIII, with Souki Tsukishima, author of the novel Emeth: Ningyo&amp;ndash;tsukai no Shima, who wrote the story. The art was handled by Toshiyuki Itahana, character designer for the FINAL FANTASY CRYSTAL CHRONICLES&amp;reg; series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in France as it is attacked by an enigmatic menace, the comic features a cast that can freely jump between reality and the world of dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imaginary Range is a free app available now for iPhone, iPod touch and iPad. A version for Android&amp;ndash;compatible devices is slated for release in May 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nation of France remains in a state of complete chaos after a sudden attack by a giant creature known only as Omega. Cid, a technician and psychotherapy specialist, travels into France and works alongside his friend Ciela to put a stop to the menace. What is Omega after? Why are Cid and Ciela talking about the end of the world as they fight? At the end of a battle that transcends dreams and reality, the world will come closer and closer to the truth...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
