							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Clifford the Big Red Dog: Be A Good Friend Game</name>
									
			<description>Be a Good Friend brings the endearing tales of Clifford and friends to life! Children use the colorful canine characters to trot around the board, and whirl the Clifford &amp;amp; Emily Elizabeth spinner to see where they will sit and stay next! Draw a card to see if you&amp;rsquo;ll be helping out a friend by scoring them a bone, or if you&amp;rsquo;ll be giving one of yours back to Clifford. Children will love the bone-collecting adventure, trying to collect the most to be top dog!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to collect bones. When it's a players turn, he spins the wheel, and moves his pawn to the next space of the color spun. If it is his own color, he also collects a bone.&lt;br/&gt;When the spinner points to a picture of Clifford, the player takes a clifford card. This card can either show one of the players or Clifford. If it shows one of the other players, that player gets a bone, and the player whose turn it is gets one as well. If the card shows Clifford, the player has to return one bone to the bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there are no more bones left in the bank; the player with the most bones wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
