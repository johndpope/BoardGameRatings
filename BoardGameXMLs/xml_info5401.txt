			<description>According to the instruction booklet, this game was developed while the designer was on a 6-month hike on the Appalachian Trail.  He wanted to come up with a game to pass the time during rainy days that wouldn't take up much space and wouldn't add weight to his backpack. The game comes in a small rip stop bag with a drawstring closure.  The bag contains 6 dice (a pair each of red, blue, and green), a small pencil, and a small instruction booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to control the dice and accumulate points towards a goal score (agreed upon in advance). The playing mechanism involves matching pairs of dice, either by number or color or both.  At various stages in rolling the dice the player has the option to stop and keep their accumulated points or continue rolling and risk losing everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
