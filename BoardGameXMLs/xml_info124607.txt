							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">RMS Titanic: The Millionaire&#039;s Special</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;First Class on the Titanic is exciting in itself but when you are invited to a private viewing of one of the world&amp;rsquo;s great curiosities, you jump at the chance. The mummy of Hettunaway, Priestess of Amun-Ra, the Unlucky Mummy is being shipped to New York and donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by its owner, Jefferson Shaw. Legend has it that those who look upon her face are doomed. Jefferson Shaw&amp;rsquo;s intentions are not as philanthropic as they seem. Strange rituals, a device to contact spirits and the awakening of something he cannot control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Titanic is on a collision course with an iceberg but will it be the icy water that kills you or the ancient force, finally unleashed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Millionaire&amp;rsquo;s Special is a short adventure for Trail of Cthulhu by Adam Gauntlett (Not So Quiet, Hell Fire, Flying Coffins). This is to celebrate the centenary year of the Titanic&amp;rsquo;s tragic sinking.&lt;br/&gt; All proceeds from the sale of this adventure will go to the Heroes in the Dark charity. This adventure is available to buy for $2.50/&amp;pound;1.50 from the Pelgrane Shop and other outlets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
