							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dying Star: Oblivion</name>
									
			<description>A skirmish miniature wargame set in the Dying Star universe created by Samsun Lobe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game promises access initially to six factions based on Lobe's literary works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game creators have noted Dying Star will offer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Quick and easy army construction. You choose your forces and upgrades and you're good to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Low setup requirements. You can play a game with just 2d10 if your memory is good enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Fast paced, brutal, decisive gameplay. Non-interactive victories are completely against our philosophy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Based on a pre-existing world. Samsun Lobe has crafted a fantastic world for us to use in his Dying Star trilogy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
