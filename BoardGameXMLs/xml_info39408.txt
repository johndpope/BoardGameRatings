							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kurt Halbritter&#039;s Halbwelt Spiel</name>
									
			<description>This game (the name means &amp;quot;demimonde&amp;quot;) was designed by the German writer and cartoonist Kurt Halbritter and was published 3 years after his death by his widow. 120 image tiles, drawn in his typical style, and 10 text tiles can be used by the players to lay &amp;quot;tableaux&amp;quot; or play a dominoes variant if following one of the three variants that come with the game. The images and texts range from the funny through slightly erotic to absurd. However, the author himself makes it clear that this is not meant to be a game in the first place but rather a flight of fantasy for the players: &amp;quot;Whoever did not have to suppress his play instinct from earliest youth will know immediately what to do with the tiles, and will have a foreboding of the sinful diversity of variations.&amp;quot; But, since &amp;quot;the Germans always want to win something&amp;quot; (Kurt Halbritter, but also Arno Schmidt), he provided some rules nevertheless: Demimonde Dominoes, Basic Demimonde and Demimonde Tableau. The aim is, in all variations, to get rid of one's tiles first (or not to be caught to be the last with tiles left). The tiles have a varying number of points on their backs which can be used for some kind of scoring system.&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in a flat, long box with a cardboard sleeve.&lt;br/&gt;More samples from the cover text: &amp;quot;...tile-laying fun from the erotic flora, ... designed and drawn in colour for pan flautists, Faun girls and creation engineers&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
