			<description>平安 (Heian) is a short two-player game set in Heian era Japan (9th to 12th centuries). Some of the characteristics of that era that are somehow worked into the design of the game are the hunger for wood that had to be brought in from farther and farther to the new capital; the struggles with the Emishi in the north-east; and the troubles of financing both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, player build cities, parts of the capital Heian, and fight with the Emishi who occupy the north-east. Cities need wood to be built and that wood needs to be brought in from previously built cities. Cities also produce wood, and in some cases also metals. Forests can be cut to produce building timber only once, however. In fact, some areas that were known for their good timber before the Heian era, only produced firewood and charcoal at the end of the period. Hence, during the game, Japan slowly gets deforested and urbanized and resources are getting increasingly scarce. The player that managed to build and transport most efficiently and that built the most cities and the most (and best) buildings in the capital wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
