			<description>From the designer's website (used with permission):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aatheuo (pronounced like &amp;quot;off-uh-you&amp;quot;) is a tabletop game that was inspired from my love of Uno, Scrabble, and Rummy. 2 to 4 players take turns placing tiles from their hand onto the board, creating sequences and sets or three or more tiles. You win if you are the first player to have no tiles remaining. With more than 2 players, continue playing to determine runner-ups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique beauty of Aatheuo comes from the spatial-reasoning involved in re-arranging the board in any way, as long as all of the basic properties of the sequences and sets are maintained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aatheuo was chosen as an Official Selection in IndieCade 2012, in addition to being featured as a night game at IndieCade. There are no concrete plans for bulk physical manufacturing of Aatheuo sets, but a digital version is in pre-production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
