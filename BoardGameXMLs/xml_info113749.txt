			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An in-world document with information about the Nymian Beastlands campaign setting for Pathfinder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While you may find the following information distressful, you may find most distressful the fact that this information was not wished to be disseminated through the Vati Chronicler, as I had hoped. This article was submitted by the author late last week, and while it was admittedly important, I was also told it would be &amp;quot;too upsetting&amp;quot; to the Faunarian commonwealth of our nation, and it was dismissed from the potential roster. I can only hope that by spreading it in this unorthodox way, that it might be seen by those who can understand the scope of what this could mean to our already-fragile culture. These separatists cannot be allowed to disturb the peace and sanctity of our esteemed social order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
