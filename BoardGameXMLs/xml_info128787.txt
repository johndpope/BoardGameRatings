			<description>Originally titled &amp;quot;The Champions Project&amp;quot; and intended to be a set of cards based on the varied champions of the game, it was &amp;quot;re-branded&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;Saints and Sinners&amp;quot; in 2013 to reflect that not only were champions being honored, but also events and the community. For the first time in a decade HEG added new content to Deadlands: Doomtown allowing for, new play styles, new decks, and new strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By creating new cards for use in decks, Saints and Sinners expands the vast Doomtown card base, and will continue to, creating new content to keep the game evolving and growing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a continuing project, the card base will continue to grow and evolve as new champions are crowned with a new Tournament system allowing for new champions, and special events each year!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the Weird Western themes of both Deadlands and Doowtown, Saints and Sinners is doing it's best to stay true to the original game and to honor the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Saints and Sinners&amp;quot; is a continuing project by fan group &amp;quot;Harrowed Entertainment Group&amp;quot; that is dedicated to providing cards for the Champions who won after AEG stopped printing the game, and honoring the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are not produced or sanctioned by Alderac Entertainment Group, Although permission was obtained from John Zinser to release them as fan cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards have been playtested and reviewed. All art is owned by the original artist and was produced for use by HEG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For casual play, it is up to you and your opponent if you can use these cards or not. For Tournament play, it is up to the Tournament Organizer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
