							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pyst</name>
									
			<description>Pyst is a parody of the highly successful adventure game, Myst. The parody features full motion video of actor John Goodman as &amp;quot;King Mattruss&amp;quot;, the ruler of &amp;quot;Pyst Island&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic concept of Pyst was to show what Myst Island (from the best-selling game) would look like after four million people (players) had visited and &amp;quot;explored&amp;quot;. Pyst Island is full of litter, most of the buildings are ruined, and graffiti reveals secret doors and solutions to puzzles that challenged players in Myst. Pyst utilizes three-dimensional graphics, animated drawings, and pre-recorded video and audio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pyst,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
