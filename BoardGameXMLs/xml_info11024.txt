			<description>Don't Drop Anything, Little Raven!  How much can the little raven carry?  The small raven is moving house. There are many things from the old nest that must be brought to the new nest. And because the small raven wants to carry everything all at once, the children try to attach as many different objects as possible on the raven's figure. The screen over the wing, the pocket to the tail, the cake on the head... Pay attention so that nothing falls off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
