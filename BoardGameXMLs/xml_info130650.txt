			<description>Game loosely based on a game within a TV show. Players on the television show get to walk across the studio floor by identifying patterns. This game recreates that with player boards. Each player gets one and must place a chip in a circle that matches the pattern on the turn of a card. There are 40 cards so each game should be quite different. The aim is to form a path of chips from any colour to the opposite same colour. The first to do so, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be played by individuals or as teams (if four are playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
