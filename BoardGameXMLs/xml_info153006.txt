			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's you, as raw as they come, and your first introduction to army life is a set of six challenging events that will decide whether you are suitable material for a crack commando regiment. Failure to qualify for any one event will result in you not being selected for the squad. But there's one consolation: even if you don't qualify, a good performance may win you a place among the highest scorers. And, who knows, the regiment may offer you a second chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a military-themed mini-game compilation in the Combat School mould.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six events are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rifle Range&lt;br/&gt;Cross Country&lt;br/&gt;Fitness Course&lt;br/&gt;Assault Course&lt;br/&gt;Pistol Range&lt;br/&gt;Tug O' War&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two shooting events involve moving a cross-hair around the screen to shoot targets which appear across a target range. The other events are joystick-wagglers where the aim is to complete the activity in the fastest time possible, but while keeping an eye on the available energy reserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
