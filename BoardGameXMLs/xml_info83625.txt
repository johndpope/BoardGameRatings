			<description>Turn-based business sim. You take control of a software company and must allocate resources to various areas in order to ensure the total dominance of your company's products. Departments requiring resources include research and development, human resources, admin., marketing and legal. Also, you're not restricted to staying within the law you can resort to industrial sabotage or even extortion and violence. A good tutorial is incorporated in order to help you get the hang of the game. The game is played on a simple grided screen populated with colored squares that stand for various buildings and secured markets. You can chose from a set of six scenarios or an open-ended game. It is also possible to participate in multi-player games on-line. There are multiple difficulty settings adding some replayability value to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
