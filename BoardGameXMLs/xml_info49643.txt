			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Assaults on the City of Greyhawk by a vengeful cleric of Iuz have terrified citizens and caused an exodus of residents. If this cleric is allowed to continue her evil plans, Greyhawk will become little more than a ghost town, ripe for the picking by the evil cleric's followers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volunteers are needed to hunt down the cleric and her cult before she unleashes her undead minions into the streets of Greyhawk - and it is only a matter of time before she claims the city as her own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flames of the Falcon is the third of a three-part series of adventures for the ADVANCED DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS 2nd Edition role-playing game. The trilogy began with Falcon's Revenge and Falconmaster - now the thrilling adventure concludes in this module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure can also be played as a stand-alone module. Set in the famed City of Greyhawk, Flames of the Falcon is designed for five to seven characters of levels 5 to 7.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
