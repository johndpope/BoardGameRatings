			<description>The Princess and the Dragon Game is an educational game for children teaching reading and matching skills.  There are six different games, each of which involves collecting cards to fill the spaces on a board.  They involve combinations of matching pictures to words or words to pictures.  Some allow players to pick any card, others require them to pick off the top of a stack.  One game involves miming words, and another requires players to come up with synonyms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
