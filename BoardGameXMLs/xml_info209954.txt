			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game about social isolation and how technology can help us connect in spite of physical and emotional barriers.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;There are two players in this game. One player is locked in a dark room, alone. This is a person with fear of public spaces that has ended in a comfortable and sad seclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other player, the free player, is in a public space during the day. This is a person with the ability and intent to help the locked player to get out of their personal prison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players speak to each other at distance by an electronic means of their choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is the Spanish-language winner of Game Chef 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
