							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">9Apr40:  Norge angrepet!</name>
									
			<description>Basically regiment to brigade level fast, simple game of the April-June 1940 campaign in Norway.  7 10-day turns.  Area movement.  Has Norway Unprepared and Nazi Treachery/Surprise rules, as well as variants cancelling one or both of those, to show the difference (unhistorical) preparedness and alertness could have made. (My 7 yr old Norwegian-American daughter took a look at all the historically initially upside-down/Disrupted/un-mobilized Norwegian units and opined that they were &amp;quot;sleeping.&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic game - naval warships/units abstracted - is chess-like.  The Advanced game - including naval units, although non-Norwegian naval forces are still somewhat abstracted - is still relatively simple, but takes about twice as long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am very proud of my pixel-by-pixel ship, aircraft, and tank unit icons, especially the little Norwegian Army Air Service Gloster Gladiator with insignia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was designed with the research assistance of a librarian in the excellent Defence Museum in Akershus Festing/Fortress, Norway's Pentagon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lots of possible event outcomes make the game enjoyable for solitaire play as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very simple combat mechanics, including an innovative ground combat system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Has map also divided into 3 sections to enable magnum-sized copy of game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
