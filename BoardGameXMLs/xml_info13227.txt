			<description>Each player takes the role of a motorcycle cop. The object of the game is to capture the four criminal cars of one's own color. A pair of six-sided dice have a drawing of a car instead of a six.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player's turn begins with a roll of the dice. Whenever one of the dice shows a car, the player may move the criminal car of any opponent. If both dice show numbers, a player moves one's own motorcycle. However, the motorcycle must follow the rules of the road. The criminal cars are not bound by the rules of the road! Whenever both dice show cars, a criminal car of the rolling player has flipped and is immobilized for the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is named after the popular television series of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The newer version that features the 2 main actors from the TV show on the front cover (Image below) has a Publishing Year of 1981.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
