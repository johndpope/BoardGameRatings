							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">G.I. World War II Tactical Combat</name>
									
			<description>Rules for skirmish combat during the Second World War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;1 turn = 1 minute in terms of movement&lt;br/&gt;1 figure = 1 vehicle or soldier (in general)&lt;br/&gt;1 inch = 15 meters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opposing forces are divided into two to four tactical groups (units) either by the players or based on scenario rules. Units are activated one at a time during the random activation process. Units are composed of one or more formations (squads, weapons sections or vehicles) and formations are composed of one or more figures.  Recommendation is no more than four units per side to control the size and pace of the game. Each unit will be represented by a marker (a playing card, marked poker chip, or specially prepared index card) during the activation process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A turn is comprised of 4 phases:&lt;br/&gt;1. Artillery&lt;br/&gt;2. Mark figures conducting supressive fire&lt;br/&gt;3. Activation phase&lt;br/&gt;4. Remove markers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
