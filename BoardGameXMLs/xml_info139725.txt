			<description>Educational game for kids to learn the clock, based on the popular Maya the bee theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player plays Maya the bee who wants to visit her friend Willy (a picture in the center of the spiral board). The board is also a large clock, with fingers starting at 10 o'clock. &lt;br/&gt;Players start on the outside of the board, moving in a spiral towards the middle, using a simple roll and move system. There are fields in different colors, some having special effects: &lt;br/&gt;On a Philip field, players receive a protective card that they might need when someone gets on a clock field. On a clock field, players draw a clock card and have to set the new time. The clock fingers push the Maya pieces back on the spiral, unless countered by a Philip card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach Willy is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
