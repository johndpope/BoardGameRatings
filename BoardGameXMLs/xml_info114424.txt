			<description>WWE '12 is a professional wrestling video game developed by Yuke's and published by THQ for the PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 systems. It is the first game in the WWE series and the fourteenth overall in the combined series. It is the sequel to WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011. It is also the first game in the series developed exclusively for current generation home consoles. It was released on November 22, 2011 in North America and on November 25 in the United Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The weak/strong grapple system from the past games has been removed. Characters now perform different moves based on their opponent's current physical state. Players now have a window of opportunity to attack while still in a downed state and can also interrupt moves and Royal Rumble eliminations with attacks. Similarly, the pinning meter from the past games has been reworked to make it more difficult to kick out as a wrestler takes more damage. The game's artificial intelligence has also been adjusted to prevent players from overusing the same move. In addition, the ability to store finishing moves has returned. A new feature called &amp;quot;Dynamic Comebacks&amp;quot; gives players on the verge of losing the opportunity to successfully hit a combination of moves to gain two finishing moves. New &amp;quot;wake up taunts&amp;quot; bring a downed opponent to their feet for a finishing move (such as Randy Orton pounding on the ground before his RKO finishing maneuver). Players also have the ability to target specific limbs during matches and perform submissions through a new &amp;quot;Breaking Point&amp;quot; submission minigame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;WWE '12&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
