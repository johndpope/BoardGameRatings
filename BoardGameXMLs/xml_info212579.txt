			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mickey's Poppin' Magic is a children's pop-o-matic action game with a Disney theme. Players move pegged stand-up tokens (Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Pluto, and Goofy) around the edge of a 3-D plastic popcorn bowl. The playing surface is a series of holes (designed to fit the pegs, of course) with a hidden trigger mechanism underneath. If the pop-o-matic die roller indicates a &amp;quot;popcorn&amp;quot; result the trigger is activated randomly, possibly knocking somebody off the pathway. Players also trigger a random poppin' event when they land on a popcorn space. First player to complete the circle is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for 2, 3, or 4 players ages 4 to 8 years old. No reading is required to play. Spanish rules are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
