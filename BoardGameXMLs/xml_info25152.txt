							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Gong Show Game</name>
									
			<description>Players move around the gameboard with the goal being to land on the Stage space. One there, a player draws a card and performs the task on it. The other players give score cards to the performer based on how the other players judge the performance. If one player gives the performer a &amp;quot;Gong&amp;quot; Card, both players have a roll-off to see which of those two players will be penalized. If two Gong Cards are awarded, the performer gets no points. The first player to accumulate 30 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based, rather loosely, on the popular television series which originally ran from 1976-80.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
