			<description>The Age of Rifles system is a fast, low to moderate complexity, brigade-level game of mid-19th century battles, combining a grand tactical perspective (battle strategy, not micromanagement) with a focus on a historically sound use of your units. It is a descendant of the Last Battles of Napoleon system, incorporating a modern, fire-based combat system, an interactive chitpull sequence of play, and an orders system. It is intended to provide the feeling that order-based systems of much greater complexity and playing time provide, by omitting tactical detail such as formations and facing. Seen from the other side, it is intended to be Blue &amp; Gray but with a historical feel in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently there are refits for Gettysburg: Lee's Greatest Gamble, Seven Days Battles, and The Atlanta Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
