			<description>During a perfectly ordinary journey, something very strange happened to a young man named Alvin, who was headed through a rainforest on the way to the hometown of his late mother. He suddenly hears singing from out of nowhere. He struggles on to the decayed ruins of a temple, and there he meets a young lady named Sefina, who is praying for something. Sephina is waiting for a natural Zilphixy (a small dragon-like being) to appear to her. In the past, a natural Zilphixy was created to fit a person on his or her birth, but now a mechanical Zilphixy is used as a substitute. Sefina's wish is heard, and a Zilphixy appears in a flash of light. From there, Alvin and Sephina's story begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Mobile,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Mobile,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
