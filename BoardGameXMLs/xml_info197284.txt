							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Corked: The party game for the entertaining connoisseur</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A crazy twist on classic charades. Two players must work together to act out separate clues that the crowd must combine to get the correct guess. Every player plays on every turn and no one ever performs alone. 2-person teams change constantly.&lt;br/&gt;This game requires quick thinking and spontaneous creativity. The scoring is every man/woman for himself/herself in the end, but the crowd can influence both the score and the pace of the game. There is constant hilarious action and interaction. It's super easy to learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in a wine tote bag because the makers of the game think wine makes game nights better, and you may want a spot to put your bottle. It also makes for a great gift. This is not a &amp;quot;drinking game&amp;quot;, nor does it have &amp;quot;adult content.&amp;quot; It just comes in a different type of package than most party games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
