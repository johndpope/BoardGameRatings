			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hey, listen up! If you like trivia games and you like detective games, then Trivial Detective is for you. The questions in this game are harder than the questions in most trivia games, but in this game you can travel around the board picking up clues to help you figure out the answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the clues are also in the form of trivia questions, so the more trivia you know, the easier it will be for you to interpret the clues and win the game. You'll find clues at twelve locations around the board including the library, city hall, movie theater, sports arena, radio &amp;amp; TV station, art museum, museum of natural science, and the geographical &amp;amp; historical society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes: 6 sided die, 6 pawns, game board, game cards, quiz booklet, checklist pad, and clue and answer booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
