			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wanna play king of the mountain? Your chances don't look good against Birthright. Mastermind, peerless combatant, and all around best there is at everything. Just ask him and he'll explain at length why he should rule the world. Pay attention, because his lecturing you on his qualifications is just as much part of his plan as it is an expression of his towering ego.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birthright is a PL 12 character to add to your Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
