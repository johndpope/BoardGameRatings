			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As we passed through the ten by ten corridor we heard a rumbling sound like bone scraping upon stone. Suddenly the walls to our right and left exploded dislodging chunks of masonry into the hall and momentarily blinding us in dust. Out from the fissures a series of flesh tendrils uncoiled like so many bloated serpents. Each was as thick around as pony. Attached to the end of their slimecovered trunks was a nest of barbed spines. At the center of the peril, there lay a pink, bilestinking orifice lined with rows of inward tilted fangs. Before we could act one of them caught Suezarian by the leg and pulled the young apprentice screaming back down the tunnel it had sprung from. The lad&amp;rsquo;s tortured calls echoed back up to us even as his lantern&amp;rsquo;s light tumbled into the darkness. As we backed away the worms hissed and tumbled into the corridor after us, coiling and uncoiling, slithering like desert sidewinders over the debris; their heads and tiny, baleful eyes canted toward us &amp;ndash; their would-be feast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Three New Monsters with their Paragon versions: including the Bilecrawler,  Bilecrawler  Paragon, Cthonnon, Cthonnon Paragon, Tempestwyrm, Tempestwyrm Paragon&lt;br/&gt;     Cthonnon Characters&lt;br/&gt;     Backgreound and history of the Wyrms of Wrath&lt;br/&gt;     Wyrms of Wrath Counters&lt;br/&gt;     Initiative and Monster Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
