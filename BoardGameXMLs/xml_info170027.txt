			<description>Last Knight is a unique genre mix that combines platforming, action-packed riding and ragdoll physics driven jousting! It is fast-paced action in a never ending randomly generated Unreal Engine powered fantasy world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story mode put it's player in control of a squire on its way of becoming a knight. But before he can prove himself, events of epic proportions make him the last hope for the kingdom! On his heroic adventure he will have to fight the horned bucket heads and oversized hungry creatures. He will have to get through a wide range of dangerous environments as well as his own Knightmares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But beside the story there is much more. Various game modes let you adventure through always different never ending generated worlds filled with riches and dangers. On your journeys you will also find quests that will take each of the characters on different missions in the hunt for fame and glory as well as gold and chivalry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gold can be spent on fancy power ups, while chivalry can unlock world bending mutators and different view modes like the intense first person view. Cutting-edge features like a fully dynamic randomized weather system and a collision system that can alter basically everything of the world geometry make this game even more over the top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A full-fledged adventure in the story mode&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Randomly generated world in the different infinity modes&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Wide range of different fantasy environments&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Quests and rewards system&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Cutting edge graphics archived with the Unreal Engine&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Unique Power ups and other special unlock-ables&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Customization with different characters&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Dynamic weather system&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Ragdoll physics feedback&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Impacts alter and deform the world&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 3rd Person, First Person and Bird's Eye view modes&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; World Mutators and Body Mutators&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
