			<description>Enter the Passage is a party game based on The Passage trilogy by Justin Cronin. In this game, players are assigned the role of Humans, Virals or Amy, with the Humans trying to destroy the Virals, the Virals conspiring to attack the Humans, and Amy using her unique powers to help the humans determine who among them is a Viral and who is safe. Gameplay is based on the award-winning Ultimate Werewolf series of games by Ted Alspach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, one person is designated the moderator. That person creates a deck with one card per person in it, with at least one Viral and Amy. The cards are dealt face down, and each player secretly views her role. From that point forward, there are two teams: Virals and humans, with Amy on the Human team. The Virals are trying to attack the humans, and the humans are trying to destroy the Virals. The game continues until one of the two teams has been eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
