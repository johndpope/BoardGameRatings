							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Salazar Tsakalotos</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deadly aces can be dangerous wildcards on the modern battlefield. Whether they fight for money or for a cause, these lone warriors can often sway the tide of battle by simply choosing a side and joining the fray. Surviving the Jihad by his wits and his will, Salazar Tsakalotos has become one such warrior, a lone wolf who sells his services to the highest bidder. His latest contract could send him into battle against Devlin Stone&amp;rsquo;s newly forged Republic of the Sphere, but will it be his greatest triumph, or the end of a legend?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salazar Tsakalotos is one of many warriors who have emerged from the fires of war to join the ranks of the notable elite, forging his reputation and his destiny with the aid of his custom Thunderbolt. This dossier file provides players with the background and description of one of the BattleTech universe&amp;rsquo;s upcoming elite, complete with character and BattleMech record sheets suitable for play with Total Warfare and A Time of War: The BattleTech Role-Playing Game. Bring Salazar into the battles of Lamenkov&amp;rsquo;s Liability (CAT# 35LP01A) for an even more legendary performance, or simply employ him in your own games as a valued ally&amp;mdash;or a deadly foe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
