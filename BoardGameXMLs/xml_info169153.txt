			<description>A unique strategy/board game hybrid where you become the leader of a rising resistance in a world gripped in crime and anarchy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recruit randomly generated members of your posse with 7 different stats forming their skills, equip them with weapons and armor and send them on missions of various types, hire lawyers, bribe judges, and more, all in a totally randomly generated world. Features full original music, an attractive and intuitive interface and tons of strategic options and paths to victory. Take over a randomly generated city using your gang, deal with vicious HQ attacks, make side deals with rival gang members, and more! No two games are ever the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
