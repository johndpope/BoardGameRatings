			<description>From the Editors Notes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the fifth issue of The Shadowrun Supplemental. Once again, I feel this is an issue of growth for the magazine, adding several &amp;ldquo;full-time&amp;rdquo; staff members and also getting a good distribution increase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It would be remiss not to give great thanks to Paolo Marcucci for the very generous donation of web page space on his server (Which also houses The Shadowrun Archive). The old URL still works, along with the new URL. Without him, there would have been much hassle trying to get this issue distributed properly. The web page has also been reorganized and now contains more information, and should be updated more frequently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In other news: With a little bit of weaseling, I managed to claim my work on TSS as &amp;lsquo;Special Projects 10&amp;rsquo;, an Alberta High School course. This means I get credits towards graduation for working on the magazine, as well as use of the schools computer resources without having to lie/cheat/steal or bribe. And yet more news: The redistribution policy has changed. Please take a moment to read it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
