			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artist is a game about stardom, fame, and recognition. But more importantly it&amp;rsquo;s a game about likeable, but somewhat awful people and their petty struggles to be more successful, more famous, or just more something than their peers. And of course it&amp;rsquo;s also a game where winning can only happen at the expense of someone else. The players are artists (painters, playwrights, authors, etc.) that struggle to gain fame from the rabble and recognition from their peers. And rather than having a game master, all players are in control. All players must contribute to frame and create a story. While the game helps you, you are very much required to set scenes, create plot, and to help each other move the story along.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
