			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 48 x 30 inch Battlemap of the ground floor of a Submerged Highway, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Please you must help us. The frogmen bandits use a metal ship that breathes wind to traverse the swamp. They have nets and spears that they can shoot like bows to capture and kill. They capture members of our family to force us to pay ransoms for their safe return. This land will never be safe for man as long as the frogmen mutants live.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; Human Survivor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submerged Highway is a single level exterior map of a buried highway with vegetation growing on high ground and swampy water forming earthen islands in the center of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submerged Highway is intended for use in modern post-apocalyptic games. It could also be of use in a primordial or fantasy game set well after the apocalypse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
