			<description>The round PADS are attached to a white dome which is balanced on the center of a tall stand.  The players place cars on the pads one at a time according to to the color spun on the dial, causing the pad to tilt back and forth.  If the cars are not placed correctly, the cars will slip off the pads.  The object of the game is to try to place all the cars on the pads without letting any fall off.  If all the cars are placed on the pads without any falling off, players must remove them one at a time until the pads are empty again.  Any player causing cars to fall off are out of the game.  The last remaining player is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
