			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanical Tower is a tower defense game, in which the player sets up the defenses inside the tower.  Various murderous robots work their way through the corridors and traps you set up on the tower floor, seeking the stairs to the next floor.  Flaunting the truly 3D nature of the game, you can install trap doors that can drop the robots back down to the previous floor.  With clever design of your tower, you theoretically can drop a robot all the way to the bottom of the tower from any floor.  The problem is that the trap doors' mechanisms rust quickly, and must be lubricated to keep them working as optimally as they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
