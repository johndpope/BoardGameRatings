			<description>A game for three to four (five?) players and a Pinochle deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Make 200 or more points in bid. You do this by taking enough tricks to make your bid.&lt;br/&gt;    * Alternately, you can force the Gnome to make 350 or more points (thereby ending the game) and you'll win if you have more points than any other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically this is a trick-tacking, bidding game played with a Pinochle deck. It has a few twists -- the maximum points you can win in a round is what you bid, the Trump is determined randomly, jokers are included as semi-wild cards, and the lowest cards plus the jokers are distributed each round to all the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/84/trumplestiltskin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/84/trumplestiltskin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
