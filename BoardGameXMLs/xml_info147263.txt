			<description>Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toypocalypse Falls is an introductory campaign and adventure setting for Toypocalypse. This PDF is intended to not only provide a campaign to play with your group but also to provide you an outline that you can use to create your own campaign settings. The PDF is a small 20-25 page PDF much in the same vein as the base game Toypocalypse. Toypocalypse Falls was written collaboratively between Trevor Christensen and Josh Wheeler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This campaign setting is a framework for you to create a chapter in a greater campaign for your players where this town and its factions continue their goals and your players become a major force in pioneering the freedom of the toys of The Falls. Contained within this book are the factions, motivations, locations, and plot hooks that should get you started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
