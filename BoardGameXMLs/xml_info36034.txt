			<description>&amp;ldquo;VOW OF THE GLADIATOR: I submit to being burned, chained, beaten, and killed with an iron weapon.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Supplemental meta-game for Gladius. Players are masters of their own gladiator schools. Buy them, train them, and send them to the arena.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players start with 50 gold and one gladiator. Slaves come up for auction and are bid on by the players. The players then match up gladiators to be fought using the Gladius card game rules. Each player involved in the fight receives an award of gold, the amount of which varies based on whether the match was won or lost, and for each of their gladiators that fought animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players must pay a regular upkeep cost for every gladiator owned. Gold may also be spent to enhance the training of gladiators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fame Points are awarded to players at the end of each turn based on factors such as owning the most gladiators, having the most gold, and winning matches. The player with the most Fame Points after twenty turns wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
