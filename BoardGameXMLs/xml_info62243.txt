							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Interlopers from the Blasted Realm</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the fifth volume in the E.N. Critters series of Open Gaming Content Sourcebooks &amp;ndash; Interlopers from the Blasted Realm. If you are seeking an inexpensive monster compendium focused on demons and outsiders, this is the book for you. If having a detailed enviroment to tie all of the monsters together would be useful, even better. Need a reason for extraplanar creatures to be on the Material Plane? The detail on the Blasted Realm provides this as well as an overarching storyline should you wish to use it. This volume not only includes 24 new and unique creatures, but also includes a detailed account of the plane they are from. As an added bonus, counters that can be printed one or two-sided have been provided for almost every creature. The monsters presented here have all either evolved on or been trapped in a pocket plane of chaos and evil known as the Blasted Realm. This realm draws its name from the hellstorms that frequent many of its floating landmasses. A pervasive evil power extends throughout, considerably mutating all who come from other planes as they spend time seeking a way to escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
