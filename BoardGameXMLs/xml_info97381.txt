			<description>Hoksotin is a game where you spin a Twister-type spinner, that tells you what you'll need to find from the board, for example you'll have to find &amp;quot;Something round&amp;quot;. In limited time you'll try and find as many round things as possible, marking the ones you already found with sticky little chips in you color. When the time runs out the chips are removed and correct ones are scored on your personal scoreboard. The one that gets most points in the limited number of rounds is the winner. There are 3 different two-sided boards with the art that is very appealing to the children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hoksotin was one of the finalists in the &amp;quot;Vuoden perhepeli 2010&amp;quot; -competion. (The Best Family Game of 2010).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
