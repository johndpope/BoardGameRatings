			<description>From the Web Page&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equinox is a short adventure for four 7th-level characters. The party may consist of any mix of classes. The adventure should prove a reasonable challenge for characters from 6th to 8th level and can be set in any campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Background&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are fleeting places in this world, places that are no more lasting than a shadow. Legend holds that the most fleeting among those eldritch places is a building that exists for only 12 hours on two days of the year: the spring and fall equinoxes. Reports about what the building contains vary greatly: Some say it&amp;rsquo;s a monastery; others, a library; still others are convinced it&amp;rsquo;s a temple. But all these different reports agree on one item: On the equinox, the building appears on a high hill when the first rays of dawn strike the tip of a tall white tower (twin to a black tower opposite it), and it disappears the same day at sunset when the last light leaves the twin black tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
