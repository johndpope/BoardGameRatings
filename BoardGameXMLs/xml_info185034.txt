							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sicarius: Base Role Playing System</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sicarius - Base Role Playing System is a complex, generic, universal system that provides a fusion of class and skill based gaming.  The game is played with d10s but has an alternate mechanism using a pack of playing cards.  When percentile dice are rolled they can &amp;quot;explode&amp;quot; into &amp;quot;Infinite Dice&amp;quot; on particularly good rolls.  The GM is called the Arbiter; the other players run Characters.  Characters have a selected Class and then use a point pool to purchase Skills (Skill costs vary by Class/Skill combination).  Characters also have nine Primary Stats (Might, Endurance, Agility, Dexterity, Intelligence, Resolve, Spirit, Personality, and Luck) and several other possible Stats such as Tech Level.  Characters have additional statistics that vary during game play such as Life, Power, Quickness, and Fatigue.  A variety of other performance abilities are mathematically derived from, generally, Primary Stats (for example, Social, Occult, Control, and Sensitivity).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skill attempts are resolved by rolling under a Difficulty Factor established by the GM.  Other types of rolls made in the game include Primary Stat rolls, Luck rolls, and so forth.  Skill levels increase through use and training; increases are more likely for characters with high intelligence.  Because most game actions are based on Skills, characters with low intelligence rapidly will stall out in ability relative to characters with high intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system uses a quite complex combat methodology with Combat Turns broken into Combat Pulses.  Characters use a variety of inputs to determine their Action Pulse value which is referenced on a chart to determine which Combat Pulse(s) they may act upon.  This is modified by a variety of situational values called Quickness Modifiers.  Combat supports a variety of special actions such as parry or natural (non-weapon) attacks.  Weapons supported range from clubs to heavy artillery to pulse cannon.  Armors appear in several types--some decrease hit chance, others absorb damage, and still others do both.  A Fatigue system is used which influences Skill performance and Combat performance.  Damage sustained also influences various performance metrics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
