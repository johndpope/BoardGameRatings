							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Apotheosis Blues (Version 2)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apotheosis Blues is role-playing game set on a post-holocaust Earth. Civilization has collapsed. High technology is rare where it isn't nonexistent. Petty warlords reign where once there was the rule of law. Creatures out of nightmares roam the world seeking to devour the unwary. All of these genre cliches are familiar to anyone who has ever played a post-apocalypse RPG or watched any of the dozens of post-holocaust movies. But Apotheosis Blues differs from its predecessors in one critical respect. The disaster that ruined the World of Man wasn't nuclear or biological or even environmental. The world of Apotheosis Blues came about because of a spiritual holocaust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Version 2 of the game adds many refinements and additional content to the original version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
