							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Necromancer&#039;s Fortress</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still proudly wearing his tattered grave clothes, Karsis, Mummy Caliph of the Necromancers is returned from the grave. Having successfully sought out and conquered death, he has taken as his fortress a lighthouse that stands amongst brutal seas on a skinny finger of land. From there he abducts apprentices and breaks the ones he can. Like the Captain of the Ship of Bones &amp;ndash; she was always a keeper - never broken, still human and so jubilantly cruel she sloughs off compassion like a tarantula its skin. Her craft of bones speaks volumes about her, so watch her skeletons swarm and don&amp;rsquo;t aggravate her. Also be warned about the necromancer&amp;rsquo;s staff. It wants a new owner and thinks you&amp;rsquo;re it. It will control you, not empower you, so don&amp;rsquo;t mess with it. Plenty ways to be a hero here, so be your own person and avoid the Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s bossy staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
