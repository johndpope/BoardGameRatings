							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mysterious Vista: Gargoyle Stalk</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mysterious Vista - Interesting locales with maps and adventure ideas that can be plugged in as a side quest to any campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gargoyle Stalk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In days long past this temple was dedicated to the rite of passage of a tribe of savages. Their powerful shamans bound a gargoyle to do their bidding. It was instructed to test the mettle of the young man entering the temple, until they got to the final room. It was then instructed to kill the young man. If the young man defeated the gargoyle he was considered a warrior and a man from that point onward. Over the years the ritual was repeated many times. One day the ritual was set up and the tribe was attacked. They were defeated and forgotten. Many decades passed. Anyone who wandered into the temple was quickly dispatched by the gargoyle when they reached the final room. The gargoyle adapted and became stronger and faster than a normal gargoyle. Without the proper nourishment the gargoyle went mad, but is still compelled to follow its instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
