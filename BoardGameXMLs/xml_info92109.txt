			<description>User Translation from the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neotech Ultra is a module filled with material for N2. It has mainly been created to make it easier for the game master to create adventures and campaigns, but also to help with improvisation during an adventure. Obviously the player can also get a lot out of using Neotech Ultra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you'll find 20 pages of maps over interesting places for use in adventures. 32 archetypes, from lawyer to yakuza, are included with full descriptions, equipment and skills. There's also information about how to use enemies and contacts. Rules and advice for cinematic roleplaying where realistic firefights are replaced by action, villains with German accents and a double whisky to use as painkiller. The history of the world is gone through from 2004 up to 2059 and explains how it is that the world ended up the way it did. All the countries of the world are described with the most important data. A number of new religions (and all the old ones) are described together with occult societies and apocalyptic sects. Additionally you'll find name lists, random generator, useful tables, corporations and assorted dictionaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neotech Ultra also includes expanded player character generation for the player. Among other things a group table, rules for how to play young characters and information on how to create your family background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Neotech Ultra there's three new classes. Messenger for those who want to work with important items and data. Elite athlete is the character that works with extreme sports as a porfession in 2059. Prostitute is a tough job where you have to fight to survive the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
