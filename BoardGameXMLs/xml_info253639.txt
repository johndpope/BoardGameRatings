							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeon ADVENTURE! Fantasy Role-Playing Game Guide</name>
									
			<description>Dungeon Adventure has been revised and rewritten countless times over the past two decades, and each time its author has learned a little bit more about game theory and game design. This version, which has been a long time coming, features an easy, intuitive, flexible rules system that will allow players to quickly create fantasy characters for one or more afternoons of dungeon delving or evil vanquishing. Comes with just about everything you need to play, including a fully-statted out introductory adventure! You provide: d20s, d6s, pencils, paper, friends, imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
