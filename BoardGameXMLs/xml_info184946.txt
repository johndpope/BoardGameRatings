			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another stealth game from the two devs at Zonitron sees the convict who had escaped from prison evading detection to get back in and rescue his brother.   The same TV cameras and motion detectors and lasers are present as in the first game.  As with the first game, this game was criticized for being too difficult, not so much from strategy, as from controls that were imprecise, using a mouse click to move your character around unforgiving traps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
