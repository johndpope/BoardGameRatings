							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Powers Companion (Second Edition) Changes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the unique and comprehensive nature of the changes in the Super Powers Companion (Second Edition), we are going to do something special for the folks who have supported the book since the first edition. We're providing a basic text PDF with all of the rules from character creation through headquarters, including the stuff that didn't end up changing. This document does cut some of the &amp;quot;fluff,&amp;quot; but we decided to put all the actual rules in one place, so you don't have to flip back and forth between two places for all the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not something we've ever done before and likely won't again, but we wanted to say thanks for all the support in the past, present, and in the future as well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
