							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Nomad</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nomad is a wandering warrior from a far off culture (like a barbarian generally is) who is as skilled at ingratiating himself into said culture as he is at slaying his enemies. He has a unique &amp;ldquo;cultural adaptation&amp;rdquo; mechanic that is somewhat reminiscent of the ranger&amp;rsquo;s favored enemy. This draws from a variety of literary and historical sources such as Othello, Lawrence of Arabia (T.E Lawrence), and William Adams (AKA: Anjin Miura).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanically, the class is a Wisdom-based martial character with a suite of unique mechanics that rely on cultural groups. Unlike the ranger&amp;rsquo;s favored enemy, he can store a large number of them and can even shift them as needed (to a point). He also has the ability to supernaturally ingratiate himself with members of such societies, a bonus on a number of key Charisma-based skills, and some fun class features that give him unique combat options due to his exotic/foreign style of combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
