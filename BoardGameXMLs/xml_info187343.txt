			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out in the Dark&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Space was background noise to most people these days. No one really thought about the vast spaces in between, other than as time stuck inside a metal can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marcus could never get over it. The vastness of the void presented infinite possibilities. Some of those possibilities were inspiring. Some, as he knew, were terrifying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He stared out the porthole, drinking in the black nothing. He watched for stars that seemed to blink out for an instant &amp;ndash; a sign that the thing had returned. This odd ritual had become habit, though deep inside Marcus knew that it was forever gone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vessels of the Void: Spaceships:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Provides details on operating spacecraft, including drive systems, life on-board, travel times, and communications delays.&lt;br/&gt;    Introduces rules to help you purchase and customize your own spaceship, and keep it repaired and resupplied.&lt;br/&gt;    Provides game statistics for eleven different spaceships, from simple orbital transfer vehicles to military ships to giant mining vessels.&lt;br/&gt;    Provides new rules for Modules and Sub-Modules, which customize and specialize your ship.&lt;br/&gt;    Introduces both narrative and tactical space combat systems, for both small and large altercations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
