			<description>You have to stay on your toes to win the Mashin&amp;rsquo; Max Game! You have to hurry and scurry around the board as fast as you can and gather as many berries as you can while you&amp;rsquo;re doing it. But you&amp;rsquo;ve got to protect your critters from Mashin&amp;rsquo; Max, because he thinks mashing critters is silly fun &amp;ndash; and you lose all your berries if he mashes one of yours! He spins and slams and you can only win by dodging his big fists!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you will make sure Max's arm is raised, then pull back a snail lever on side of the board that makes him spin about and then slam his fist down. If it lands on a space with a creature, that player's creature is removed from play and their collected berries are returned to the berry pile. Each space on the board also has a number and pictures of berries. The number is for movement and depending on the number of berries pictured determines how many you take from the berry pile. So, if the fist landed on a 2 when you sent Max spinning, you would move any of your characters that many spaces. After you have finished moving count the number of berries on that space and put them into your stump and play passes to the next player. The game ends when the berry pile is empty or all of a player's critters have been mashed by Max and the player with the most berries wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
