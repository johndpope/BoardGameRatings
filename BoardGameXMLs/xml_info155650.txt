							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Universal Adventures The Lost Halls</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For centuries, monks dedicated to the Goddess of Knowledge maintained a temple in a secluded valley.  Pilgrims journeyed to the valley, as did those seeking the monks&amp;rsquo; wisdom, obscure knowledge and ancient lore.  Then all contact with the monks suddenly ended.  Travelers passing near the valley reported that the buildings which housed the monks had collapsed into ruin and the valley appeared deserted.  What became of the temple is not known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Universal Adventures The Lost Halls is a complete adventure site for use with any fantasy roleplaying game.  The Lost Halls includes a map of the halls and descriptions of each of the 18 areas that comprise the adventure site.  As a Game Master, all you need to do is assign the monsters and treasures to each of the areas and you are ready to play.  Highly reusable, easily customizable, and fun to play, The Lost Halls is perfect for an evening&amp;rsquo;s adventure or as part of an ongoing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Portions of The Lost Halls were part of DM1 The Secret of Eberonâ€™s Manor and have been modified and included in this product as part of an adventure suitable for any FRPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
