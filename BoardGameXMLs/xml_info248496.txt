							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Medvěd WRR: Karetní hra</name>
									
			<description>A family card game based on the original Czech book for kids &amp;ldquo;Medvěd WRR: Po přečten&amp;iacute; zavř&amp;iacute;t&amp;rdquo;. In the book, the plushy bear WRR is lost in the old factory with the mysterious printing machine. Unfortunately, a few pirates escaped from the adventure book which wasn&amp;rsquo;t closed after reading. The inventor of the printing machine, old turtle Edward, decided to hide four parts of the machine to other books because he&amp;rsquo;s afraid that pirates want to print some horrible stories. Of course, he&amp;rsquo;s old, so he forgets where are these missing parts. And here&amp;rsquo;s the quest for our bear. Find these parts for Edward sooner than pirates will do it. The object of the card game is similar. Players are collecting sets of cards with the bear in different costumes and searching for parts of the printing machine in books = decks of cards with parts and pirates. There are nine different characters from the book in the game, each with the unique ability. You can collect cards, play them for their abilities or try to find missing parts in books. The goal of the game is to collect four different parts of the printing machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
