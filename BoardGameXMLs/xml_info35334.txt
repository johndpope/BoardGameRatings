			<description>Originally published in Panzerfaust Magazine Volume 5 #5 in September 1970 (Very Rare!!!!),Poltawa a game covering the 18th Century battle between the Swedes and the Russians on June 28, 1709 designed by Chris Johnson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These early issues of Panzerfaust were mimeographed and all the components were printed in the magazine, more of a game kit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You could not actually use the original components without destroying parts of the magazine that were on the other side of the page, in some cases components of the the game - ie maps and counters printed on the reverse side of the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following components are all high quality color photocopies from the original magazine, note that there is some yellowing that printed through. The 2.5-pages of rules are in excellent condition (relies heavily on AH classic rules such as Waterloo) and include the historical orders of battle. The map is in three colors - red, green &amp;amp; purple - on four 8.5&amp;quot; X 11&amp;quot; sheets copied onto buff color paper. The counters are on one unmounted sheet printed in two colors, red and the all to familiar purple. The time record track is with the counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hard-to-find piece of wargame history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
