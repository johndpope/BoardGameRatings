			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this adventure is to introduce players and Game Masters alike to the world of Relistan, and the Realms of Twilight campaign&lt;br/&gt;setting. This adventure takes place on the continent of Kesuril, one of the most civilized continents in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was designed for a party of 4-6 characters of 5th-7th level. For convenience six pregenerated characters have been included in the back of the adventure. Should you and your players choose to create your own characters for this adventure, you must keep in mind the manner in which the PCs are contacted for the job and the general plot line when approving characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to effectively play through this adventure Game Masters must have the Pathfinder Core Rulebook and a copy of the Pathfinder Bestiary. To maximize the effectiveness of the pre-generated&lt;br/&gt;characters, a copy of the Advanced Player&amp;rsquo;s Guide would also be helpful. Players need only the Pathfinder Core Rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
