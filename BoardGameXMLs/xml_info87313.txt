			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LOGOS is a collectible card game based in the Second Life universe. The LOGOS is an organization that uses a neurographic interface to animate competing manifestations in order to find truth. Players each take a deck of LOGOS cards and use them in an attempt to reduce their opponent&amp;rsquo;s hit points to 0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins with 100,000 hit points, and the cards are broken into three categories &amp;ndash; Matter, Energy, and Information. The cards follow a basic rock-paper-scissors mechanism, with the dominant card type attacking the weaker one. Each card has an Attack and Defense stat, and the difference in combat values determines the damage done to the defender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LOGOS is a premium service in Second Life, and cards can be purchased both in-game or from the Second Life web marketplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
