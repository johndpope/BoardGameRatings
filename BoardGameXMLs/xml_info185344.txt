							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon Keeper: The Dungeon</name>
									
			<description>In those primitive times when men and dragons were enemies, former adventurers left their original guilds to serve a dragon. They protect him from the repeated assaults of adventurers attracted by his fabulous treasure, buried in the basement of the castle. What if there were more than gold to protect?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the tile-collection game Dragon Keeper: The Dungeon, you embody these keepers and must capture the adventurers who invade the rooms of the dungeon &amp;mdash; yet you must remain faithful to your guild by avoiding capturing its members. Once you have repelled the assaults, you give to the dragon as a tribute a part of the adventurers you caught&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the game contains tiles in five different colors and different values. These tiles represent the adventurers who want steal the plunder of the dragon. You are responsible for removing these adventurers from the dungeon. Each turn, you take a tile for yourself and give another tile to another player. The choice of tiles depends on the position of the dragon (as the tile must be in its line or in its column). Then the dragon is moved to the location of the tile that has just been removed. Thus, each tile decision limits the choice of the next tile to take.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game each player receives a color that they keep secret, with this color corresponding to their original guild. Every tile of this color brings them negative points. Players stack their collected tiles by color, and at the end of the game, the tallest stack is removed. If this stack is the player's guild color, then the player must discard the next tallest stack instead. Players then sum the values of their tiles, and whoever has the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
