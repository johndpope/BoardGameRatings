			<description>This is a basic wargame that uses bits of wood as units. Each group is marked with a group tag. The game uses a point system based on gold pieces -- each unit is worth a certain number of gold pieces and are purchased at the beginning of the game. The players alternate placing terrain, structures, and siege engines. Once this is completed, the players fight it out to see who is victorious! Players can also come up with scenarios if they wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available from &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://gnomegaming.com/ourgames&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://gnomegaming.com/ourgames&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
