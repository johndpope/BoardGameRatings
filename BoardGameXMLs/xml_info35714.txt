			<description>This game for very young players introduces the basics of boardgames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are ladybugs flitting from vegetable to vegetable in the garden.  On each turn, the active player will roll a die and move to the appropriate vegetable as long as it isn't occupied by a fellow player.  Some vegetables are occupied by spiders, causing the player to lose a turn, while others are occupied by friendly ladybugs that allow the player to take another free turn immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach the final vegetable cart -- by rolling a tomato or carrot -- wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
