							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SMART Microgrid Card Game</name>
									
			<description>In an effort to explain what the Smart Microgrid Applied Research Team (SMART group) does at the British Columbia Institute of Technology, Alan Stewart designed the SMART Microgrid Card Game.  It's a fast, easy-to-play &amp;quot;competition&amp;quot; to see who can manage their RESEARCH in order to be the first to build their Microgrid technologies in all three categories: GRID, ENERGY, and PEOPLE, all while trying to deal with DELAYs played by their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In gamer terms, it's an anti-deck-building fighting game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
