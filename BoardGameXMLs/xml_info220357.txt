							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Little War</name>
									
			<description>The Little War is a wargame for two players exploring the short but spirited border conflict between Slovakia and Hungary in March, 1939. The action begins on March 23, 1939. The time covered by an entire game may represent 8-12 days, depending on events within the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lasts 7 turns. In general terms, both players will draw a number of cards from a deck of ordinary playing cards, then will play them alternately one by one to conduct different activities with their counters on the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game comes with 30 counters, an area-movement map of a portion of eastern Slovakia, and short rules. Players will also need a deck of ordinary playing cards (with 2 Jokers) and several six-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published by Hollandspiele in 2017 as part of a two-game package, together with Ukrainian Crisis: Ukrainian Crisis &amp; The Little War. The games within the box use separate components, and only share a rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
