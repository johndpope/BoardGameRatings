			<description>The object of the game is to find the gold mine located in the center of the town.  This is accomplished when a player has made his way through Wagon Trail, Prospectors Circles and Town Path and when all of the buildings in town have had claims filed on them.  At this point, the car that has been randomly selected at the beginning of the game as the only entrance to the gold mine is revealed from the bottom of the pile of mine shaft cards.  The player who holds the claim to the building under which this mine shaft is located is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
