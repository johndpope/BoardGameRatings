							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Royal Assassin</name>
									
			<description>Your father, the king, united four small fiefdoms into a mighty kingdom. Now that he is dead, the former royal families of those fiefdoms are plotting to take over the throne that is rightfully yours. You are outnumbered, but in your struggle to defeat them you have a powerful ally: your court jester, the Joker, who as your father's friend and advisor was always much more than he appeared to be. He is highly skilled at court intrigue, and can help set them all against one another so that you can retain your throne. He is your secret weapon - your Royal Assassin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This solitaire card game is played with a standard 52 card deck with 1 (or optionally 2) Joker cards.  The goal is to eliminate all royalty cards before the stockpile runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
