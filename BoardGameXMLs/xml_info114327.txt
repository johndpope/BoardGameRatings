			<description>Fungibility is a strategic, Euro-style, economic engine, resource management card game for 2-4 players, which uses 108 cards, and no other components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fungibility is also a financial term, referring to commodities which are functionally indistinguishable from one another, such as currency, graded crude oil, and pure gold. In keeping with this concept, the cards in Fungibility (the card game) are all identical copies of the same card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To create some degree of randomness, the deck is shuffled, first with half the cards rotated, then a second time with half the cards flipped face-up. The facing, position, and even rotational orientation of cards relative to each player's seating position has a logically distinct meaning within the game, meaning that the same card in the supply may have completely different meanings to each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic game is free to print and play. It is the author's intent that, should the game be published and sold at retail, the retail cards would include art elements unreferenced by the core rules. As of writing, the author has three expansions designed, each of which would merely describe rules for the unreferenced art elements, and which would be made available free of charge, post release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
