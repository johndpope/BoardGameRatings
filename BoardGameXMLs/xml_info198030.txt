			<description>Or, the Moby Dick Roleplaying Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is a Nantucket Sleighride? It is the term for a whaling boat being dragged across the waves at 25 mph by an enraged sperm whale.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;You and your fellow whalers will undergo a four-act play; each act comprising of three scenes. And then wrap up the story with a final epilogue. All of the instructions are printed on the game cards you will be using. You will also need a regular deck of 52 playing cards; some pens and perhaps some paper for notes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a stripped pack of French playing cards and also a custom pack of cards that are provided in the document as print-and-play components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
