							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strawberry Shortcake in Big Apple City</name>
									
			<description>You are trying to be the first player to go to the bake-off and make it back to the Strawberry House.  Each turn you spin the spinner and move to the next space of the color indicated.  But watch out for the Peculiar Purple Pieman from Porcupine Peak!  If you land on one of his spaces, you will have to pick a pie or two and hope it is not his -- or you have to go back to a purple space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
