							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mattel Football II</name>
									
			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on the huge success of Mattel Football, Mattel quickly brought to market the enhanced product Football II.  Physically similar to its predecessor, the game retained most of the play experience of the original while adding several notable features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;quarterback&amp;quot; could now move forward and backward, as well as up and down.  Too, the &amp;quot;quarterback&amp;quot; could pass the ball forward to a receiver.  On a successful reception, control immediately passed from the &amp;quot;quarterback&amp;quot; to the &amp;quot;receiver&amp;quot;, who could continue to run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although offering a more comprehensive play experience with more variety, Football II never approached the commercial success or market penetration of the original Football.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
