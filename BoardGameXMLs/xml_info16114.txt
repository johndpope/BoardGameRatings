			<description>[From the manual]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elan is designed for Wargames representing Divisional and Corps sized combat on the European continent from 1805 to 1815 in 25mm or 15mm. It provides gamers with a system focused on the tactical employment of units from Brigade down to company level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elan aims to capture the feel of combat during the period, and will satisfy players who approach their games with an appreciation for the actual tactics used by the Generals of the period. Use of combined arms, effective command and keeping a reserve up your sleeve are the keys to success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are also perfect for tournament games allowing for objectives, quick results and good reflection of a player's ability as opposed to just sheer luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For play purposes a Tactical Turn represents about 20 minutes, and with the Grand Tactical aspects included, a Turn represents about 1 hour. All measurements are in millimeters representing 1 meter per millimeter. The rules are written with measurements for 25mm scale figures, but 15mm is equally suitable by modifying distances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes reference charts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
