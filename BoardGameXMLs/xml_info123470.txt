							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Secret of Grisly Manor</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Grandpa always was a little eccentric. A fantastic engineer, he was always buried in his work, always coming up with new ideas and inventions that as a child held you wide-eyed in awe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, after many years, you return to the house that holds so many fond memories for you, with a promise from Grandpa to show you something truly amazing. You can't even begin to imagine what it could be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a dark and stormy night as you arrive at Grisly Manor. The rain beats down hard, lightning flashes in the sky as the sound of thunder fills your ears. You already feel a little creeped out, but when you make your way inside, the house is curiously empty. Grandpa is nowhere to be found!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But his presence is everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Familiar objects have been re-engineered to create puzzles for you. Clues abound, and as each puzzle is solved, the solution to others present themselves. As well as new puzzles, of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grandpa obviously spent a lot of time making sure that nobody could solve the myriad of puzzles strewn about the house. Nobody but you, his favorite grandchild...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What would make Grandpa go to such extremes? What could be so important? Can you discover 'the secret of Grisly Manor'?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
