							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sky Castles</name>
									
			<description>Sky Castles is a tile and worker placement game where the players collect gemstones from castles in the clouds.  The theme is aimed at children, but the game claims to provide scope for strategic play at all levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tiles depict a cloudscape dotted with gemstones.  Each turn the player selects one of four face-up tiles and places it into the cloudscape so that the borders match adjacent tiles, and can optionally place a sprite token to claim a cloud or section of sky.  There are three scoring rounds where the players score points for the gemstones that their sprites have claimed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is similar to other tile placement games (e.g. Carcassonne) but Sky Castles has less complexity and claims to be suitable for a younger audience while retaining similar strategic options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
