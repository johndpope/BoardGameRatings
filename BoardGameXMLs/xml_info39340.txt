			<description>Durch Th&amp;uuml;ringen! (Through Thuringia!) is a family game of the 1930s, one of the large number of roll-and-and move educational games where the players, in the course of the game, learn something about the region they travel in. As usual in such games, special field give advantages or penalties if players land on them.&lt;br/&gt;The game was published by the Hausser Verlag who published a long line of family games, books and the famous Elastolin miniatures from 1904 until they folded up in the 1983.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
