			<description>The Atari 5200 SuperSystem, or simply the Atari 5200, is a video game console that was introduced in 1982 by Atari Inc. as a replacement for the popular Atari 2600. The 5200 was created to compete with the Intellivision, but wound up more directly competing with the ColecoVision shortly after its release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 5200 was based on Atari Inc.'s existing 400/800 computers and the internal hardware was almost identical, although software was not directly compatible between the two systems. A number of design flaws had a serious impact on usability, and the system is generally considered to have performed poorly on the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Atari_5200&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
