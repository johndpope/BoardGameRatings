							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rebellious Archetypes Volume II</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be a Rebel with a Cause!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not every evil lurks in deep, dark dungeons far away from innocent townsfolk, waiting patiently for adventurers to kick down their doors and start fighting. Some monsters don't just prey on society from without, but have burrowed and wormed their way into the very heart of the civilized world, and twist and corrupt the very laws that are supposed to protect the innocent, using them to oppress and exploit them, instead. These evils are no less a threat than the ones that most adventurers face, but many PCs are ill-equipped to deal with them. This is a job for rebels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents five new rebellious archetypes for five different classes. Included are the freedom fighter, a fighter archetype specializing in hit-and-run tactics, the rebel operative, an investigator archetype that specializes in working undercover, the serene objector, a monk archetype devoted to peaceful resistance and converting one's foes to one's own way of thinking, the liberator, a paladin archetype that grants paladins some limited freedom for deception and subterfuge in dealing with tyrants and oppressors with overwhelming power, and the arcane insurgent, a witch archetype that resists all forms of control, and is a master of escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're about to embark on a politically-themed campaign (such as the official Paizo adventure path focusing on revolution), or you just want a selection of exciting new abilities for passionate and freedom-loving PCs, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer. Even GMs can get in on the fun, as several of the archetypes here are perfect for rebellious villains as well, and can make for exciting and memorable encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
