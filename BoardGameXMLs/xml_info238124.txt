							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">vs. Stranger Stuff: Season 2</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adolescent Supernatural Mischief In The 1980's!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the vs. M Engine created by Phillip Reed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;vs. Stranger Stuff is a rules-light tabletop roleplaying game of 1980&amp;rsquo;s inspired adventure, horror, and science fiction, where you play as &amp;ldquo;Kids&amp;rdquo; in their teens. But it&amp;rsquo;s not just homework and asking someone to the dance that are the terrors they need to face. Clearly influenced by the hit Netflix series, but also the great films that inspired that show, vs. Stranger Stuff &amp;mdash; Season 2takes the original mini-game released by Fat Goblin Games and offers revised rules with some optional changes like playing the game in Easy, Normal, or Hard Mode, and clarifications that help to keep the game compatible with existing adventures, but also prepare the Kids for totally different dangers still to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book also includes an all-new adventure by Kiel Howell &amp;mdash; The Mask Behind the Makeup&amp;mdash; that can be used as either a starting place for brand-new characters, or as a chance for veteran players to regroup and rearm their Kids for a brand new round of mystery, terror, and excitement!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book also has new rules and suggestions for designing your own hometown for the Kids as well as giving a detailed backdrop in the form of Crestview Hills, a sleepy bedroom community just an hour away from the city, but that acts as an odd focal point for &amp;lsquo;Strange Stuff&amp;rsquo; indeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;vs. Stranger Stuff is a complete roleplaying game using the vs. M Engine in a slimmed-down and quick to use format. Even novice gamers will have no problem creating interesting characters, learning the rules, and starting a game. All you need is paper, pencils, a deck of playing cards, and a few friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
