			<description>Escape from Prince Charming&lt;br/&gt;An Appetizer RPG, Fairy Tale, and&lt;br/&gt;an Iron Game Chef Entry for 2006&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RPG is the first in the Full Course of Love and Death. As an appetizer it prepares the players for the main courses to come. As such it need not be played with any special constraints for enjoyment of the full course. Instead just pick characters and begin playing. When you are done, any character, human or otherwise who died can be played in Someone to Love, the first of the main courses. Like all games in this Full Course, Escape from Prince Charming is intended for five players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a game designed for Iron Game Chef 2006, it is necessary to discuss the allotments made for that contest. Indeed, for the theme of time, Escape from Prince Charming fulfills the three sessions of 3 hours each requirement. And it uses the following contest terms: Glass, Committee, and Ancient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
