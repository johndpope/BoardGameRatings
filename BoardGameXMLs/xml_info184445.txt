							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Criminal Gang Warfare: Delta</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Criminal Gang Warfare: Delta is a science fiction roleplaying game set on a post apocalyptic earth called &amp;quot;Wurld&amp;quot;.  Only twelve large settlements remain, and Ireland is a powerful kingdom named &amp;quot;Cervantes&amp;quot;.  Most of the world's seacoast is highly polluted.  Little data beyond this is offered in the core rules though the name would suggest the intent involves syndicate warfare.  The game's name appears to have little relation to the game itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters belong to one of four Types, namely:  Cyborg (tech-enhanced human), Feral (lycanthropic shapeshifter), Voodoo Priest (magic using zombie master), or Warrior (tough, skilled human).  Characters have eight Attributes (Life Points, Skill, Toughness, Intelligence, Psyche, Cool, and Speed) which are randomly generated--each Type uses a separate randomization process.  Characters then purchase Abilities (e.g., Skills) from a character-specific list, buying them with points which are randomly generated by Type.  Eleven NPC builds are included in the rules and can be used as samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters will then equip themselves with Weapons and Vehicles or Hard Suits.  Vehicles and Hard Suits are high configurable with numerous options and various methods of weaponization.  Vehicles and Hard Suits have Hit Points, Armor, and Speed values.  The rules offer eight standard Vehicles and seven standard Hard Suits, and worksheets to generate both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skill use is not well defined, and combat is particularly poorly defined.  In general, gamers are left to their own devices to handle these typically critical aspects of gaming.  The statistics as offered strongly infer methods that would be appropriate, but beyond handling exceptional types of damage the rules do not have much to say about resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
