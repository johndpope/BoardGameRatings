			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spin-a-roo is a fun, fast-paced sorting and counting game with two ways to play! Early learners will enjoy the sorting game - a race to match the most numbers and colors on their card! Advanced learners will love the counting game- a race to collect the most tokens by counting up and down from one to ten! With a device that makes colorful tokens appear like magic, Spin-a-roo keeps young learners excited about practicing their sorting and counting skills. There are two ways to play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Sorting Game (Green Side)*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to collect the most Tokens by making color and number matches on your card. A player is chosen to turn the Spinner Handle and fill all seven slots in the Spinner Tray. The chosen player should crank the handle around in a circle until it is back on the starting position. When any player sees a token that matches any color or number on his/her card, he/she calls out the number, takes the token, and places it on the matching space on his/her card. When no player can make a match, or the seven slots in the tray are empty, the next player (moving clockwise) cranks the handle a full turn to reload the slots. When there are no tokens left in the spinner handle and no more matches can be made by any player, players stack all the tokens they have collected. If you are the player with the tallest stack--YOU WIN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Counting Game (Purple Side)*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to collect the most tokens by counting up and down from one to ten! A player is chosen to turn the handle and fill all seven slots in the spinner tray. They should crank the handle around in a circle one full turn until it is back on the starting position. When any player sees a token that comes before or after any number on his/her card, he/she calls out the number, takes the token, and places it on the correct space on his/her card. Any number may be placed on the &amp;quot;WILD&amp;quot; space to start. When no player can make a match, or the seven slots in the Tray are empty, the next player (moving clockwise) cranks the handle a full turn to reload the slots. If your stack reaches 10, clear that stack and start over. The tokens that you have cleared will be counted toward your total points at the end of the round. When there are no Tokens left in the Spinner Handle and no more matches can be made by any player, players stack all the Tokens they have collected. If you are the player with the tallest stack--YOU WIN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
