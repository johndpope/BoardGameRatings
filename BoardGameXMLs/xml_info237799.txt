			<description>Theme&lt;br/&gt;The players have 5 minutes in order to win (there is a timer). Players are divers who try to defeat a giant monster: Barbaou.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal.&lt;br/&gt;During the game, you will have to collect a maximum of cards. Be carefull, Barbaou will keep an eye on you. At the end of the game, all the cards collected by the players will give them points (set collection) and all the cards remaining on the board will give points to Barbaou. If you want to win, you must have more points than Barbaou.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play&lt;br/&gt;All the players are divers from the same team (cooperative game). During his turn, a player has to move (2 action points) and collect a card (animal or garbage). The board (35 cards : animals, waste, gyres, etc.) is quickly disappearing. All your actions will have consequences: if you collect an animal, Barbaou will get away from you. If you take some waste, Barbaou will get closer to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End of the game&lt;br/&gt;The game will stop if the timer is finished, if one of the divers can't move or if Barbaou captures one of the divers. If you have more points than Barbaou, you win the game !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
