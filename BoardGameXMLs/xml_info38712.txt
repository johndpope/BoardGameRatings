							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anomalies of Love</name>
									
			<description>Anomalies of Love is a game about love and relationships. The game starts when players meet their special someone. As they get to know each other better they can focus on the 8 things that their relationship can rely on, the things that hold the couple together &amp;ndash; matching sense of humour, mutual outdoor hobbies, mutual intellectual hobbies, similar values, mutual dreams for the future, memories the couple have together, matching music taste and of course sex. The more they find in common in each other the more points they get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game proceeds by players placing tiles on the board. Both the tiles and game board have symbols for these 8 things that relationships can consist of and players try to match the symbols on tiles to those in game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However every tile also holds an evil promise. A chance for mistrust, a black heart that represents all the bad things in relationships. As player's tiles approach one another these black hearts become both something that jepardise your own relationship, but those of others too. If two black hearts are placed next to one another, then the one that was there first gets turned 45 degrees. If it can't do that or gets disconnected from the structure the tile is removed and relationship just lost some of its charm. In other words the way you place those black hearts at the beginning of the game can matter a lot. You need to build your relationship to withstand the bad times &amp;ndash; make it into something so strong that even when shaked, it won't break.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also Agenda -cards that can alter the strategy each players has. In the end the player who has the most perfect love life will win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
