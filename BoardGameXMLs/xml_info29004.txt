			<description>This unpublished prototype board game was originally in Sid Sackson's game collection before it came into my possession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game shows some similarities to Parker Brothers' Six Million Dollar Man game and may be a very early version of the game.  The mechanics are more complex than the average children's roll-and-move game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt a hand of four cards at the start of the game and draw one card at the start of each turn.  There are several different types of cards in the deck:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Bionics Cards (Cards for Steve Austin's Bionic Eye, Bionic Arm, and Bionic Leg abilities)&lt;br/&gt;- &amp;quot;Wild&amp;quot; Bionics Cards (May be used as any type of Bionics)&lt;br/&gt;- Move Opponent&lt;br/&gt;- Set Obstacle&lt;br/&gt;- Remove Obstacle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the spaces on the board are marked with one or more bionics symbols that represent cards the player must use to get past that particular challenge.  For example, you may need to use a Bionic Eye card to spot an enemy airplane or use one Bionic Arm and two Bionic Leg cards in order to swim across a treacherous river.  A player landing on one of these spaces must discard the needed cards before being able to move again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The obstacles are balanced by the paths that the player can take across the board.  The shortest path from start to finish is densely populated with some heavy challenge spaces (requiring up to four cards to get past).  By contrast, the longer routes have a smaller density of challenge spaces, usually with one to two card challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interestingly, the players move by the difference of a roll of two dice.  Roll two dice and subtract the lower number from the higher to determine how far you move.  This means that rolling doubles means you get zero; you don't move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules I have are incomplete.  They do not explain how to use the Move Opponent, Set Obstacle, or Remove Obstacle cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
