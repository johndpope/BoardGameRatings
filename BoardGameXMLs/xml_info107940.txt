							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Solar Circuit Racing</name>
									
			<description>In the abandoned and uncharted spaces of the solar system a small group of daredevil pilots fly their spacecraft through dangerous race courses known as Circuits. Set up in advance by a shadowy group of scouts and bookies, each Circuit is unique. Some wind through planetary canyons, others through old mining tunnels bored through asteroids or through the swirling rocks of planetary rings. Racers must dodge obstacles as well as the weapons fire of their opponents to cross the finish line first to win fame and fortune!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solar Circuit Racing is a sci-fi racing game for 2-6 players. The game is played on a modular, customizable course made out of map tiles. Moving into a tile with an obstacle requires a piloting roll. Failing the piloting roll results in something bad happening, like smashing into an asteroid or scraping a wing along a canyon wall. Damage reduces the capabilities of your ship. Once you pass the roll, you can advance into the space and move on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, you will have to manage your limited engine power, and make decisions about how to spend it. Engine power can be used to advance through the course, to evade enemy weapons, and to make maneuvering through obstacles easier. Spend too much power on maneuvering and your opponents will jump into the lead, too much on advancing and you'll splatter against the obstacles. The first player to complete the decided on number of laps wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
