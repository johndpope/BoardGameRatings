							<name  sortindex="1">Hex Checkers</name>
									
			<description>Checkers played with 2 or 3 players on a six-sided hex board, with 61 black hexagons touching only at their points, not their sides, leaving small red spaces between, and forming a larger overall hexagon.  Each player picks a side separate from other players.  Complexity comes not as much from the board itself but from the addition of an extra player's pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other 3 player Checkers variants have instead stretched a Checkers board's squares into a &amp;quot;Y&amp;quot; or triangular shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The publisher's name suggests there may have been a Chess variant published with a similarly styled board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
