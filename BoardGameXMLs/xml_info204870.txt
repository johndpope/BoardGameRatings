							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Picture Puzzles and Pennies: Series 1</name>
									
			<description>This undated party game was H.P. Gibson's first entry in the field of picture-puzzle party games. Unlike similar games produced by Universal and Party Games Publishers, which usually used decks of 18 cards with single images, the Gibson Series 1 puts 2-3 drawings on each of its 12 cards, for a total of 33 images.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assuming 4, 8 or 12 players, the cards are then dealt out evenly to players, who get 1.5 minutes to guess the answers on their card(s). When time is up, they pass their cards to the players next to them. Once the cards have made the rounds, the player with the most correct answers wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, this title uses the backs of the puzzle cards to offer a second game, Pennies. Each card has 12 clues starting &amp;quot;This PENNY...&amp;quot; and providing a blank where the answer is a word starting with the letters P-E-N. For example, the answer to &amp;quot;This PENNY gets in&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;PENetrate&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
