							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wiry Dan&#039;s Electric Football Game</name>
									
			<description>This is another in a series of battery-powered outguess-your-opponent games published by Harett-Gilmar in the early 1950s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The football game is even simpler than its 1953 baseball brother. Each player can touch a wire to one of 5 metallic circles at the ends of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are labelled for 5 offensive plays: Pass, End Run, Lateral, Line Plunge and Trick Play. The offensive player pushes a metal arrow down onto one of his circles. The defensive player does the same, simply numbering them 1-5. The results are shown on a table on the board. There is a second table for kicks and runbacks. The usual football rules apply and high score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself is undated, but it is very similar to Wiry Dan's Electric Baseball. Alex G. Malloy (American Games) dates that to 1953, but the football game simply as c.1950s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
