			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon​ (チョコボの不思議なダンジョン Chokobo no Fushigina Danjon, lit. &amp;quot;Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon&amp;quot;) is a console role-playing game made for the Sony PlayStation and Bandai WonderSwan and released only in Japan. The game is vaguely linked to the Final Fantasy series of adventures with the series' trademark mascot, the chocobo. The game is a roguelike dungeon crawl and part of the Fushigi no Dungeon series. The game consists of a chocobo wandering through randomly generated dungeons, picking up items and battling enemies. The PlayStation version is almost all sprite-based, with some polygon-based objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The title character in Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon is a yellow chocobo named Poulet (プーレ Pūre, a pun on the Japanese &amp;quot;pureiyā&amp;quot; meaning &amp;quot;player&amp;quot; and the French word &amp;quot;poulet&amp;quot; meaning &amp;quot;chicken&amp;quot;), but the player can rename him. The layout of the game consists of three dungeons: A ten-level dungeon, a 30-level dungeon, and an infinite dungeon which recycles enemy types every 100 levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game received a large fanbase due to its tie-in to the Final Fantasy franchise as well as some animation and effects such as summoning the mainstay creatures of the series, including Ifrit and Bahamut in super deformed style. This game marks the solo composing debut of Masashi Hamauzu, who prepared both the soundtrack and an arrangement album named Coi Vanni Gialli.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
