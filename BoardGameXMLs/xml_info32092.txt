			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saga City. This town has stories to tell, and you're about to write one of them. Two teams of super-heroes call Saga City their home. Both teams want the honor of defending the city, but this town isn't big enough for both of them. So a battle has been decreed. You must build a super-team with the powers and abilities you think will bring victory, then fight it out against the other team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 2-player game with the emphasis on simple rules and fast play. Dozens of different powers and interactions will keep the game from growing stale. Record-keeping is simplified by the use of track sheets and sliders. The game set includes counters and markers, and uses my M8 maps. All you need to provide is a few six-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
