			<description>This old Parker brothers game comes with a pack of 52 cards each depicting a work by a famous artist. The deck is otherwise a standard deck of cards except that the suits are lettered A, B, C, D, and numbered 1-13. There are rules for playing 6 different games, most of which are similar to standard card games - Whist, Hearts, Old Maid, Slap Jack, etc. A few of the games use the paintings on the cards. For example, in the Old Maid variation a player must ask for a painting by title and name of artist, and therefore players eventually become familiar with 52 masterpieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
