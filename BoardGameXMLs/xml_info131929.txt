			<description>Tactical scale tabletop miniatures game. A diceless mechanic means A always beats B always beats C... but B can get advantages to beat A, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For instance, &lt;br/&gt;Double ranked pikes can not be defeated in frontal attacks&lt;br/&gt;but&lt;br/&gt;Blades defeat Pikes in frontal attacks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, you CAN defeat double ranked pikes in a frontal attack if the attacking unit is Blades. Similarly, you read down a list of conditions until you get to the first applicable one &amp;amp; use the result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Figure scale &amp;amp; numbers, &amp;amp; base sizes, are left up to the player. The intended standard game size is 10 stands. Rules allow for play of historical battles, but also include rules on monster types &amp;amp; abilities, magic effects, etc. A number of army lists and a point-build system are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
