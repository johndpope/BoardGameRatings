			<description>From the web page:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot; Cool Factors:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy to carry.&lt;br/&gt;    Quick to learn and play.&lt;br/&gt;    Fun for word-lovers and strategy gamers alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the custom deck and deal each player ten cards. Select a card from your hand to keep and pass the rest to your neighbor. Keep cherry-picking a single card from each hand until they're depleted. Each player then tries to make a single word from his cards. Letters you use in your word score points--cards you take but don't use count against you! Be the first to score 100 points, and you've won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has a deck of 60 cards, which have a letter and number, in different colors.  Rarer letters like J and Q have multipliers on them, and there are wild cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
