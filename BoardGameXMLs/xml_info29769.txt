			<description>This Swedish table soccer game claims to be the only soccer simulating game in the world where players are freely moving. The secret is a Swedish patent that allows a player and the metallic stick, that is used to move the figure under the &amp;quot;grass&amp;quot;, to have a magnetic connection that is not disturbed by other sticks or figures. Open/closed 106 x 49,5cm x 6,1cm / 54,5 x 49,5 x 12,2cm, weighs 3,9 kg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five players per side, one goalkeeper, two defenders and two attackers. The goalkeeper and the two defenders can only move on one half of the gaming surface and the attackers on the other half.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is similar to Real Hockey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
