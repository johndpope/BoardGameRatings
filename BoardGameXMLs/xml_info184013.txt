							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alice in Wonderland (fan expansion to Ticket to Ride)</name>
									
			<description>This map is an unofficial Fan made expansion. Symbols &amp;amp; Graphics Copyright &amp;copy; 2004-2015 Days of Wonder, Inc. Produced with permission of Days of Wonder, for non-commercial use only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two variants on the traditional game on one board - a race through the stories and a traditional game based on scenes instead of cities. &lt;br/&gt;The race uses Ticket to Ride pieces and principles but the game is to move from the initial falling asleep as far as possible through the stories to the second awakening at the end of the looking glass epic. The winner has the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ticket to Ride &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; fan expansion follows the principles of the basic Ticket to Ride game with an Alice theme (scenes from the stories take tje place of cities). The object of the game is to gain the most points by travelling various routes and outwitting other players. You will need the train pieces and the train cards from either the US or Europe base games (or you can buy them from the Days of Wonder shop). You can use stations if you wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an extra set of cards for the scenes, each with a value to be earned by visiting that scene. These cards are dealt/picked up alongwith tickets in the same quantity and with the same 'keep/dispose' rules. Some of the cards give you extra facilities to complete your tickets. There are also up to 9 bonuses for the end-of-game scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main new rule is the option to discard 5 cards and pick up 5 new ones, as your turn. This is very useful if you are desperate for engines or a particular colour card. You can also call time when your wagon stock reaches 3, if you want, giving you the advantage of stopping other players completing tickets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
