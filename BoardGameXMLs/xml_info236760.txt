							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Glimpse the Beyond Second Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Glimpse the Beyond Second Edition is very much like the real world on the surface. Countries, politics, major religions and popular culture are virtually indistinguishable from the world outside your window. Beneath the normal facade of daily life, lurking in the shadows and hiding under the cover of night, dark forces reach into the world trying desperately to get a foothold. Most humans never encounter these dark forces. Of those few that do, the majority are driven mad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glimpse the Beyond Second Edition is a Role-Playing Game in which players assume the roles of Magi, rare individuals who study the arcane arts in an attempt to understand and possibly control that which Should Not Be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glimpse the Beyond Second Edition is an expansion and refinement of the concepts and systems put forth in the Electrum Best-Selling first edition ruleset. With Glimpse the Beyond Second Edition we clarify and expand various elements of the setting, delving further into the secrets of the Magi, examining past, present, and possible future encounters between humanity and the Things that Should Not Be, and present a new, more flexible system to help you tell stories of Cosmic Horror and Urban Legend. With setting material written by CJ Hurtt, art by Mary Madewell, and an updated system by CJ Hurtt &amp;amp; Travis Legge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glimpse the Beyond Second Edition contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A new and refined rules engine&lt;br/&gt;    A Flexible Magick system allowing for fluid and customizable effects&lt;br/&gt;    A ready to run scenario for new or veteran gaming groups&lt;br/&gt;    Everything you need to run a Glimpse the Beyond Second Edition campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
