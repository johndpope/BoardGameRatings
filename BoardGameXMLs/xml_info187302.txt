			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This role-playing science-fiction/fantasy game is not a simulation, but is intended to be realistic and firmly rooted in the known physical universe. Each player can have as his or her goal anything they desire.  The Game Master (GM) is impartial and fair in all matters related to game play.  As a realistic game, magic and psionics are left out of play.  This manual is designed to be a complete game system in and of itself.  Optional rules are provided for more realistic play at the expense of smooth game flow.  It is generally desirable to create new characters rather than transfer some from another role-playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DOC, RTF, and HTML versions have identical content and vary only in minor formatting issues and file format.  The DOC version was released as a self-extracting archive (EXE).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
