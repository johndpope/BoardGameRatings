							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Die drei ??? und die Masken der DÃ¤monen</name>
									
			<description>The players move through a forest, trying to find the demons' masks in different hideouts. On some of the fields there are chips which a player can turn around when he or she reaches that field. Some force the player to draw an event card and follow the instructions on it; others give hints about a certain hideout. If a player has four hints for one hideout, he or she can move there and pick up a mask card which has a point value. The player with the highest valued mask cards at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
