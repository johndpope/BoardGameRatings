							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Garden Blacksun Base</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two sections to the base, the outer cavern section and the inner constructed area. The outer area is a maze of huge caverns and tunnels that have been formed by the huge boulders that make up the planet of garden. The walls are very rocky and roots of Yggdrissal wind their way along the walls. The caverns are so large that a spelljamming vessel is required to traverse them. The tunnels are very irregular and it is incredibly difficult to navigate of foot and impossible on horseback. A flying creature can navigate the caverns with ease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For mid-level characters.  Distributed as an RTF adventure and a BMP file (map).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
