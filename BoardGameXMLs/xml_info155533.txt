			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An animated adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your grandfather's ancient, turreted mansion, halfway up a rusting, spiral staircase, you discover a hidden passage leading into a covert room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A weathered journal tells of your grandfather's journey to the Alterworld, a land of magic and myths, where Good and Evil once fought to the ultimate finish. And Good won!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;... Or did it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's only one entrance from Earth to Alterworld, the solitary Cheval mirror which now stands before you. After reading of your grandfather's adventures, you decide to venture through the looking-glass door to Alterworld. There you will challenge the monstrous Nequam, a jackal-hearted Warlord whose enchanted amulet makes him nearly invincible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But be wary. Not only is Nequam hard to kill, he also has a nasty habit of not staying dead! You must search for the ancient, lead-lined skull, the one weapon that can defeat Nequam's power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features: &lt;br/&gt; Interactive gameplay. &lt;br/&gt; Animated graphics. &lt;br/&gt; Original music. &lt;br/&gt; Mini-adventure tutorial. &lt;br/&gt; Self-running demo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
