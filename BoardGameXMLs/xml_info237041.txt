			<description>A One-Round Tournament for Six Gargoyles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the gardeners, there are guests arriving daily to visit with Wylden Delgreau. The ailing sorcerer has been adamant that they not be allowed to traipse around his garden, however, damaging any of the plants or dirtying the walkway around the fountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That has made your job easy. Protecting the garden is next to no work if strangers aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed in the walls. Of course, two nights ago there were four boys who climbed over the wall, fishing poles in hand. They were intent of relieving Wylden Delgreau of some of his prized koi. It was a simple matter to frighten the boys away. You suspect it will be a very long time before they&amp;rsquo;ve the courage to stick their noses over the top of the wall again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then yesterday there was the matter of the little kitten climbing over the wall and landing on the walkway bench. Nephrite made a comment about the creature looking delicious. However, Feldspar was able to toss it back over the wall before it was devoured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Years past you contended with vandals, thieves looking for Wylden Delgreau&amp;rsquo;s magical treasure, and homeless people looking for a place to stay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only visitors to the garden today have been a few servants, who picked some green beans and radishes. This afternoon, a gardener weeded the walkway around the benches and the fountain. Things have been quiet since then. The sun is starting to set, and you expect a quiet evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
