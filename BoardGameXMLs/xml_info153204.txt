			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the classic Realms game, rewritten to be compatible with Swords and Wizardry. The Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry game &amp;ldquo;clones&amp;rdquo; the original rules of the fantasy role-playing game that started it all back in 1974, when it was published by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. The game rules have been rewritten and reorganized to be easier to learn and play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, because this system is a &amp;lsquo;clone&amp;rsquo; of the classic fantasy RPG from 1974, there is a wealth of accessories available to enhance the game, such as pre-designed adventures and alternate character classes. Sword Realms is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game. The only items required to play the game are this rulebook, a character sheet for each player and some dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting included is a fantasy continent, divided into a number of different realms. These realms include human city states, elven forest kingdoms, halfling mounds and dwarven halls. There are lots of classic monsters roaming the dungeons and wildernesses of the setting, and there is magic and treasure too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF has everything you need to do some classic dungeon adventuring within the Realms setting, including character creation rules, monsters, maps, religions, gear, adventures and character advancement rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So enter and explore the Realms now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
