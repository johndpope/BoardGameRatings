							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SUM Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUM is a Maths based card game where your goal is to make equations using the cards in. Solve the most equations or get rid of all the cards in your hand to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUM is a great game as well as a fun tool to help people improve their Math skills. The distribution of 1 to 9 numbers well as +, -, x and &amp;divide; cards allow younger players to make simple equations while still staying competitive against those with a broader knowledge of Mathematics. While older players can try their hand at making more complex equations to get rid of more cards in their hand at one go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And for those who want a stimulating party game to play with their friends, the Wild cards add an extra level of strategy to each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
