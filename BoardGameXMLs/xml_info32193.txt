			<description>Extraordinary equipped game from the sixties, even in German player circles scarce and obscure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game consists among others of: 3 grey factories, 10 red advertisement pillars with ads from the time produced, 10 brown laundry company headquarters, 15 orange franchise houses, 15 white drop-by stations, 150 ! chimneys in 6 player colours and much more! &lt;br/&gt;All these are made of wood, the small houses have all holes drilled into where the chimneys can be fixed to mark the owner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game is to build a laundry imperium (the R&amp;Ouml;VER company for which this game was made as promo was once the largest one in Germany) in order to attract the most customers of all players.&lt;br/&gt;Extremly tricky is the fact that there are only 3 factories for 6 players, so first come, first serve...&lt;br/&gt;But if you don't succeed, all is not lost!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Must be one of the most beautiful and playable roll-and-move games, still much decision making involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
