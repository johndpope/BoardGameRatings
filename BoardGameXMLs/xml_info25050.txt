			<description>This is a fantasy mass battle game, cousin to the skirmish game Mayhem: Warrior Heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a set of rules for recreating the battles and campaigns of the mythical land of Talomir. Peopled by both heroes and monsters, Talomir is a world where battle magic thrives, but the fate of nations can be decided by the strength of one right arm. As such, it is a real departure from what you may be used to. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a rigid, traditional turn sequence where players alternate moving and firing with perhaps a melee or two at the end. It is much more fluid than that with both players moving figures, firing, and fighting as a result of various reaction tests. Forget perfect plans for few prearranged plans will survive past first contact! Opportunities arise as fortune smiles on one side then the other. The victory will go to the player who learns to exploit these situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the game is an innovative campaign system for the nation states of Talomir.  Both the mass battle system and campaign system are unusually solitaire friendly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
