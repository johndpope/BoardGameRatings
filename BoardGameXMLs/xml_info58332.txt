			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subtitle: Twilight of the Dogs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunded&amp;auml;mmerung is something different in the world of role-playing games. Most games allow players to portray beings of greater than human power wielding forces that ordinary people barely understand. This game allows you to play... a dog. Not just any dog, but a dog that has been lifted to human levels of intelligence, albeit the lower end of the scale, and endowed with minor telepathic powers that serve as speech.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you will fight for the survival of your pack or the safety of &amp;quot;your&amp;quot; humans. And always, in the background, there looms the specter of a cat that is many cats - the undead, the undying, the (probably) evil Ozymandias.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Hunded&amp;auml;mmerung you have no spells, you wield no magical or high-tech weapons and your psionic abilities aren&amp;rsquo;t much good for combat. What you have are your wits backed by natural canine ability. Use them right and evil will be your chew toy. Mess up and Ozymandias will use you as a scratching post. Welcome to the doghouse, sucker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
