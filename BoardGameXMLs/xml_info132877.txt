			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hope Preparatory School is a privately funded institution dedicated to preparing tomorrow's metahumans for whatever paths might lie ahead. With a tradition that stretches back over 60 years,  a world-renowned faculty, and affiliations with all of the best universities, HPS is the place to send your child to prepare him or her for life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The HPS Aliens Character Pack includes six fully statted members of the Alien clique for the Hope Preparatory School setting. The pack includes two Sophomores, two Juniors, and two Seniors. The characters may be used as PCs in scenarios, NPC class rivals, or a field trip group for a more traditional supers campaign. These characters are all for use with the ICONS Superpowered Roleplaying rules. Printable character standups are also included as a substitute for tabletop gaming miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
