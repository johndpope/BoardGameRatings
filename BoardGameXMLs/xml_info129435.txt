							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sound Domino</name>
									
			<description>Children's picture dominoes game but with a real twist - with sound! Besides the 28 domino cards, you have Marvin the Electronic Mouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are seven types of images, Ship, Bicycle, Motorbike, Tractor, Car, Train and Aeroplane. Marvin has sound effects to go with each image.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a number of dominoes depending on the number of players. These are laid out in front of you picture-side up. One domino is also placed in the centre of the table. Marvin must be in easy reach of all the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your turn you must press Marvin's button and he will play a sound (example - ring-a-ding). Now, everyone looks at their dominoes at the same time, looking for a bicycle domino that will fit to the array of dominoes in the centre (of course, normal domino rules apply). If you have a domino that will fit at either end of the array, you must quickly press the blue button on Marvin. Play continues until someone uses all their dominoes and that person is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
