			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awesome Powers is a supplement for the BASH! Ultimate Edition RPG. Inside, you will find new Powers, new Enhancements, new Limitations, and new ideas to incorporate into your BASH! campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chiefly, this product is designed to allow you to create characters with themes, making use of pre-designed powers.  You can use these powers for inspiration, or you can even create your character by rolling for powers at random. As the Awesome Powers library grows, so will the list of available powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume 5 of Awesome Powers deals with powers of a dealing with the mind, Psionics and Telekinesis. There are dozens of powers for the Psionic and Telekinetic Suites here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new rules concept of &amp;quot;Secondary Limitations&amp;quot; is introduced here as well, allowing players and Narrators to more greatly customize a set of powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll also find all new Limitations and Enhancements (like Very Fine Manipulation and Side Effect), entirely new Advantages (like Mental Link) and Disadvantages (like Mental Hook), how to create your own Powers, and Random Character Creation!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the powers presented here explains how to replicate the power described as closely as possible using the existing BASH! Ultimate Edition rules.  In this fifth volume of Awesome Powers, we present to your two themes, or Power Suites, each based on different tropes. The Psionics Power Suite allows you to probe the minds of others, use the force of your own mind to dominate or deceive, or simply bring pain.  The Telekinetic Suite allows you to move objects simply with the power of thought to a dizzying array of effects, from turning pocket change into bullets to &amp;quot;swinging&amp;quot; around on invisible &amp;quot;wires&amp;quot; of telekinetic force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
