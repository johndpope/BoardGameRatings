							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido (1st Edition)</name>
									
			<description>This was the very first version of the Bushido system that went on to be published by Phoenix and F.G.U.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Bushido, the Players take roles as members of various professions and wander through Nippon. The overall campaign is organized by a Game Master whose imagination is only the starting point for many hours of intriguing and entertaining enjoyment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Heroes of Nippon is the player's guide and contains the rules for creating characters, combat, and magic. It features an Attribute system which allows a character to be tailored to a player's specifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Land of Nippon is the referee's guide and contains rules of Encounters, Battles, and other things necessary lo the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bushido uses pencil and paper, six and twenty-sided dice, a Game Master, and as many players as will brave the perils of Nippon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
