			<description>This mid-1930s title was probably the last American football game published in which the drop kick and place kick were shown as different ways to attempt a field goal or extra point - with the drop kick being more likely to succeed. The standard football was made more pointed at the ends in 1934 to make it easier to pass, but the new shape made drop kicks much less reliable, and almost all scoring attempts since have been place kicks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses the sum of 2D6 to resolve each play. The offensive player has 10 play options (Left End, Left Tackle, Left Guard, Center, Right Guard, Right Tackle, Right End, Spinner Play, Trick Play and Pass). Each of these plays, along with Drop Kick, Place Kick, Punt, Punt Return, Kickoff and Kickoff Return) has its own results column showing yards gained  or lost along with possible fumbles and interceptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has an unusual mechanism for recording the game's progress. It comes with just two pawns, one for recording downs, the other the number of plays. The field has four groups of lines stretching from one end of the field to the other to mark the downs (single, double, triple and quadruple lines), and the ball marker is moved from one to the next to mark downs as well as back and forth to show line of scrimmage. The second peg marks off plays at the end of the board, with a quarter ending after 25 plays and the game after 100. Usual football scoring applies, with most points after 100 plays winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
