							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Barney First Fishing Game</name>
									
			<description>This Barney the Dinosaur game is similar to &amp;quot;Hungry Hungry Hippos&amp;quot;. The game features a plastic &amp;quot;pond&amp;quot; with paddle triggers for each player. Cardboard dividers of the same color as the player paddles separate the playing areas. Six plastic fish of each color and a boot are placed on the pond surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When everyone is ready, players begin hitting their paddles making the fish wiggle and flop in the air, trying to get their color fish to land in their area. When all fish are off the board, players return fish that are not their own color. The player with the boot returns the boot and also one of his own color fish as a penalty. Play then continues and the first player to collect all his fish wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
