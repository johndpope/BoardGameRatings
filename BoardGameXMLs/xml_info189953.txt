			<description>Do you have what it takes to accomplish the impossible?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2120 and the world&amp;rsquo;s population is still trying to overcome the devastation of the worldwide market crash of 2117. After a number of studies, it was revealed that corruption in government and the lack of unity among the government leaders caused the crash. As a result, a group of world leaders are now pushing for a single, worldwide government. Monolith Global Inc, an expert in cybernetics, has suggested that the government be run by robots, claiming that &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not possible for a robot to become corrupt, and as a result, they will always make the best decisions for the fate of mankind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, a small number of people see this for what it really is &amp;ndash; an attempt to enslave mankind. Known as the Hackers Guild, these rag tag freedom fighters are branded as criminals, and are living as fugitives from the law. All reasonable attempts to convince the powers that be that they are making a huge mistake have failed. The only option remaining appears to be the destruction of the program from the inside out. There is only one problem: hacking the company&amp;rsquo;s network is said to be impossible. Despite this, more and more of the common people are joining in the cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time is running out for the guild as they strive to perform the impossible: hacking Monolith Global Inc and saving humanity from slavery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hackers Guild is a cooperative game for 2-4 players ages 14 and up that plays in about 90 minutes. In the game, players take on the role of members of The Hackers Guild, and are trying to work together to complete the final hack against Monolith Global`s data center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the way, players will be able to add additional dice to their dice pool and purchase hacking tools that will make the hacks easier to accomplish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opposing the hackers is the Network Administrator AI whose sole objective is to track down the guild's hideout and send in the authorities to arrest the hackers, allowing Monolith Global to install their machines and enslave humankind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
