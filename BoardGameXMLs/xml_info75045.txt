			<description>McKee Foods, owners of Little Debbie Snack Foods, has a fiercely loyal family of dedicated employees, a valuable asset that is readily recognized by the owners of the Company. There is also a strong recognition of, and respect for, the Company&amp;rsquo;s long and storied history. To complete the connection to all of these elements, SNACKOPOLY was created. SNACKOPOLY was only made available to Company employees, and the games quickly became a prized possession. SNACKOPOLY was so popular, it was reprinted to satisfy the overwhelming demand of employees to have two one as a keepsake and one to play! Today, it remains a well-loved employee memento.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
