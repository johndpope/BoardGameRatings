			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small enough to go anywhere, Television trivia travels well, whether on a trip, in the car for long drives, or over to a friend's house for hours of trivia fun. There are no complex rules or pieces to keep track of - just open and enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Categories test your knowledge of five great TV decades from the 1950's to the 1990's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no board or any such pieces,  There are 5 questions per card (a question about a show from the 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's, and 90's)&lt;br/&gt;You decide how many points you want to play to before starting the game. A correct answer is worth 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
