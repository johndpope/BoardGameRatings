							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Book 9: Traveller Plus</name>
									
			<description>This is an expanded set of core rules to the Classic Traveller setting. It contains new character options, new tasks and skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Traveller Plus character design system allows you to design and build a Traveller character by selecting, rather than rolling, his characteristics, skills and benefits. The referee will guide the players in making these design decisions, based on the assumptions of the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
