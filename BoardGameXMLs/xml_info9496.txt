Chart/Special Movement Summary/Stacking Point Value table/&amp;amp; Unit-Size &amp;amp; Color-Code tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sequence of Play is as follows: The Japanese Player goes first-1.Supply Determination Phase; 2.Reinforcement Phase; 3.Land &amp;amp; Naval Movement Phase; 4.Combat Phase; then the Allied Player performs these same phases with the addition of another-4.Airpower Phase; then 5.Combat Phase.
