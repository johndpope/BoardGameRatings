			<description>Okoshki is based on a popular Japanese card game Koi-Koi for two players. The game consists of 6 rounds, each player tries to win a round by scoring points for different card combinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, he chooses any one card in his hand and places it face up on the playing area trying to match it by suit (curtain colour) with one on the table and take both into his point pile. If he cannot match a card from his hand, he must discard a card face up to the table. After matching or discarding a card, he then draws one card from the deck and places it face up on the playing area. If this card matches any card now on the table, he must match that card and take both for his point pile; otherwise, it becomes part of the table. In the event that the drawn card matches more than one card on the table, the player gets to choose which card to match and keep in addition to the drawn card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
