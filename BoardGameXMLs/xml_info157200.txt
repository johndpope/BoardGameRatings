			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upgrade heavy shooting game. Start with one vehicle and upgrade it's weapons system defense and special ability. You can also purchase up to two additional vehicles for your group. The farther you get the more money you earn so you can continue to increase the power of your vehicles and purchase even more powerful vehicles. Some vehicles not only must be purchased but unlocked by reaching a certain distance. The extent of the gameplay is operating the weapon systems and some of the special abilities, you do not control the vehicles at all. This is an upgrade heavy game. Playing well means you earn more money to buy better vehicles. Playing poorly means it will take longer to buy the better vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
