			<description>&amp;quot;The Ultimate Number Game&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number Quest plays sort of like Boggle crossed with Othello/Reversi; this game is essentially a number version of its cousin, Overturn.  The playing board is a plastic tray into which nine tiles (from a set of eighteen) are placed in a random order.  Each tile has four raised pegs on it, each with a different digit (from 0-9) printed on it.  On their turn, each player must construct an equation by selecting at least three adjacent digits (digits may be adjacent both orthogonally and diagonally) that form a valid equation when the proper operational symbols are added (i.e. 347 becomes 3+4=7, 9752149 becomes 97+52=149, 678234444 becomes 678-234=444, etc.)  Only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are allowed.  No fractions or decimals are permitted.  Equations must follow normal sequence (i.e. 97+52=149 is valid; 149=97+52 isn't)and may not contain more than one operation (i.e. 4-1-2=2 is not valid.)  A given digit may not be used more than once in the same equation, and equations must make use of the digits on at least two separate tiles.  0 may never appear by itself in an equation (i.e. 4+0=4 and 5-5=0 are invalid.)  The equation is claimed by placing plastic rings of the player's chosen color (either green or gold) around the pegs of the digits forming the equation.  After the first player's first turn, all subsequent turns must use at least one previously used number.  If necessary, the player forming the equation flips over the ring so used (rings are gold on one side and green on the other), a la Othello/Reversi.  The game ends when all 36 rings have been used, or when no more equations are possible.  Players then score one point for each ring of their color.  Player with the most points is the winner.  Although Number Quest is essentially a two player game, more can be accommodated by forming teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
