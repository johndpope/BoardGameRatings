			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Power is designed for children between the age ranges of 4 to 9. This game is similar in concept and design to Follow the Clues... A Game of Destiny but it simplifies the process and allows the younger child to become acquainted with positive words and thoughts through fun and entertaining action and interplay. This game introduces the child to the 24 angel-like characters, Lit'l Messengers, and in a playful way, teaches the child about the qualities of each angel and their messages. &amp;quot;Star Power&amp;quot; also encourages the child to feel free to act out and participate in exploring &amp;quot;noble sense,&amp;quot; values in a fun and joyful way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:  Game board with 4 plastic baskets, Spinner with plastic arrow, 4 pawns and plastic stands and 25 cards:(24 angel cards and 1 sun card), 4 washable markers, A bag of plastic stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
