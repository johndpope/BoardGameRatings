			<description>This game is concerned with the acquiring of Assets. The Assets are acquired by making bids using cards. Every player has 56 Bid Cards, that range from 1 to 50 + 6 blank cards. When a player bids for an Asset, he selects one card from his holding. All bids are simultaneous. You don't have to bid if you do not want to. Bids are revealed and the highest acquires the Asset and all Bid Cards used go out of the game. Selling Assets is done in the same way but now the owner definitely won't bid but will collect the winning bid in cash. Again, all Bids made go out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement across the board requires no dice, you just move one Asset space to another each turn. You must follow the 'flight paths' of the planes printed on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to collect Assets in the same group (Example: Group: Energy; Assets needed Nuclear, Gas and Coal). When you have a set of three Assets, you may declare it and claim a Blue Chip for that set. A Blue Chip holding doubles the value of a set. When 10 Blue Chips have been declared, the game ends. Players announce the value of their Assets, add in their cash, and thge highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
