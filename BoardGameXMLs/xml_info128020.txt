			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A free to play MMO developed by HanbitSoft, Granado Espada is best known for its beautiful graphics and art style, as well as its unique gameplay where players control up to 3 characters at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unique to Granado Espada is the game's AFK feature, where players can leave their characters to fight monsters despite being away. Players are also free to switch between teams of 3, and level different characters and classes. Also featured in the game is the ability to recruit NPC characters, dubbed as Unique Player Characters or UPCs. Such UPCs pack exclusive skills, specialized stats and even unique fighting styles or stances. Granado Espada's initial released featured timed spawns and world bosses but subsequent releases finally introduced timer instances in order to reduce player monopoly and camping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Granado Espada was released by Reloaded Games through their Gamersfirst label in the United States under the title Sword of the New World, but was later renamed to Sword 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
