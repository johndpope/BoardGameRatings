			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Secret Submarine Bases (SSB), a Global War 1936-1945 (2nd Edition) expansion set.  During the Second World War many nations operated hidden submarine bases in remote locations around the world.  These bases were nestled in isolated coasts and sometimes even in Neutral counties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you set out to do in secrecy doesn&amp;rsquo;t always happen the way you plan it.  Thus, what base an Alliance obtains is governed by a bit of randomness....as you will soon discover!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion allows players to build secret submarine bases around the world. Because of their ability to hide, these bases can't be bombed while allowing you to extend the reach of your submarines around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
