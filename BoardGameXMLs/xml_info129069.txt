			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the white-hot sands and sweltering intensity of WWII North Africa as commander of the British and American tank units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the uninitiated, the desert is featureless and without cover - to the experienced combat leader, the slightest swells and mounds of rubble become landmarks for navigation by map and compass. You've studied the terrain, you know your opponent, you're armed and ready to test your courage and endurance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You feel the anticipation of battle as if it were your first. Your heartbeat fills your ears, your senses are magnified. As the blackness of night lifts, you hear the distant drone of the German tanks as they approach the ambush you've carefully staged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;German Panzers creep into sight. Through clenched teeth you command, &amp;quot;Fire!&amp;quot; The vehicles race into action through black smoke and flying metal. You hear a high-pitched hysterical hiss as a burning white blur zips towards your unit. One shot, a direct hit on the turret, turns one of the Shermans in your formation into a blazing coffin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You send a hail of steel and high explosives down on your German foe. Panzers shudder to a stop everywhere, shattered tracks unfurl behind them and thick, black smoke pours from their ruptured engines. The few surviving Panzers turn and scuttle away in fear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success was yours this time. Keep your cool. Protect your tank and the others you command from obliteration by fire on the sands of North Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thoroughly documented with accurate historical data, Sands of Fire realistically recreates actual battle scenarios of tank warfare in World War II. Choose your ammunition and battle formations wisely - you alone can influence the outcome of up to 48 different battle engagements from Tobruk and El Alamein, to the Kasserine pass, Tunis and Bizerte.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
