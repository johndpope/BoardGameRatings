			<description>Following on the heels of his extremely popular Treasure Quest, Steve Lefort brings you Xombies Attack!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xombies Attack!!! is a whole new zombie experience, finally bringing you the look and feel of a classic Romero film that fits on your dining room table!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrain Note The terrain shown in these photos is from WorldWorksGames &amp;quot;Urban Mayhem&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;product line. (Please note that ANY terrain will suffice for this game and this is NOT an endorsement of the WorldWorksGames Products)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this grid based miniatures game, Xombies have overrun the city, lusting for flesh.  Four very different squads must work their way through the city, fighting off hordes of Xombies while trying to reach their individual objectives. Search buildings, rescue panicked civilians, find weapons and items while avoiding nuclear obliteration. Quick paced tactics will award you victory! Recklessness will infect you with the bloodlust of the undead...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Xombies Attack!!!&amp;quot; is currently under development and is slated for a 4th Quarter 2007 release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
