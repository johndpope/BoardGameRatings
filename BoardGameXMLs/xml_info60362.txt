			<description>In this fun game the players throw the dice and move accordingly. On the board there are different fields and the fields are named certain categories such as art, countries or literature, etc. When a player moves on a certain spot he immediately has to name something in that field. The spots are marked by letters. When a player finished a letter group he draws a fortune wheel and acts according to what the wheel says.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
