			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;Gee! It's even more neat stuff for TWERPS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's the book you've been looking for!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is, if you have been looking for new skills, professions and races for your TWERPS gaming sessions. Also included in this book, you'll find a more complete Equipment List, as well as new spells for your TWERPS MAGIC Spellbook, new magical items, new Robo-equipment, and more SUPERDUDES powers. This book is designed to expand your WERPS adventures and add even more fun, with adventure ideas, combat techniques, and more! (Heck, we even have errata!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an expansion set for the TWERPS Game System. TWERPS Basic Rules (GS 10455) are also required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And look for these other TWERPS titles, too:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KUNG FU DRAGONS (GS 10456)  ROBO-PUNKS (GS 10464)&lt;br/&gt;TWERPS MAGIC (GS 10457)     SUPERDUDES (GS 10465)&lt;br/&gt;FLY-BY KNIGHTS (GS 10458)   ROCKET RANGERS (GS 10466)&lt;br/&gt;SPACE CADETS (GS 10459)     TWERPS-TWEK (GS 10469)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Send us at least 5 &amp;quot;punny&amp;quot; names and a stamped self-addressed business size envelope and we'll send you our most current copy of the Hex-O-Gram, our monthly listing of new game releases.
