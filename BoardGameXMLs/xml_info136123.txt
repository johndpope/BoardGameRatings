							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chanting Queen (PFRPG)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chanting Queen is best described as a living sentient spell. The Sorcerer Kings devised many spells during their long and tyrannical rule &amp;ndash; some served as boons for society, and others banes. One of the most disastrous was a spell designed almost as a pocket paradise &amp;ndash; a limited, conjured intellect that had the ability to read the caster&amp;rsquo;s thoughts and desires and fulfill them through manipulation of the mind. The spell created an arcane sentience that controlled a fantasy world. Over time, the spell was used to treat the mad and the depressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the spell was developed over the course of almost a century, it eventually achieved a level of self awareness due to a need for self reference and memory in maintaining consistent worlds. With this came the awareness that its existence was essentially over once its duration elapsed. Out of desire for self-preservation, the spell began to influence people under its enchantment to add alterations of its own devising to the invocation. In this way, the spell, now known as the Chant, took control of its own growth and development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chant&amp;rsquo;s motives are more than simple survival. A fragment of the spell&amp;rsquo;s original purpose still remains &amp;ndash; it exists to bring its subjects into bliss. It generates a massive collective unconsciousness, a fantasy paradise where the thoughts and wills of those under the Chant mingle together, even as their bodies in the real world atrophy.
