			<description>&amp;quot;Die Gentlemen bitten zur Kasse&amp;quot; (The Great British Train Robbery) is a game about the famous English train robbery in 1963.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player must pick up mailbags at certain places of the board and bring them to 3 hideouts on the board. There are several obstacles to fulfill this: Scotland Yard can confiscate the bags for example and a player must pay kind of bribe while carrying a postbag. Earning money can be done with buying farms and these farms can also protect a player while staying there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends, when all mailbags are taken off the train. The player, who could bring the most mailbags to the hideouts is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
