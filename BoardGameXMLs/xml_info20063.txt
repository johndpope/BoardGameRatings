			<description>From the publisher's web page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regicide uses a standard card deck, tokens to mark each player's territories, the board and the rules. This is a game that you can play in 10-15 minutes and turn around to play again. You can enjoy tournament play by tracking points won at the end of the game. Abilities are granted to certain suits and allow you to perform tasks, win points for your trophy pile and control territories for points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is set with eight territories worth 1-3 points. Players battle each other for control of these territories and their points. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uses a standard 52 card deck, the Regicide board, and tokens to mark territories of each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expandable by adding more boards and decks to allow more than 8 players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
