							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darkling Plain: an Augmented Reality Miniature Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Darkling Plain is a miniatures board game that is powered by augmented reality (AR). Darkling Plain combines all the best aspects of a traditional board game such as Settlers of Catan or Ticket to Ride and a video game such as Final Fantasy or World of Warcraft. Board games offer a social experience and depth of play, while video games offer immersion, glorious eye-candy, and computational wizardry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no actual miniatures in Darkling Plain. You place cards that represent your units and other features, like a ring of standing stones or a village, upon a full-color game board. When the cards or board are viewed through the camera of a smart device or computer, the game comes to life like a video game. Spectacular special effects abound as a fantasy battle bursting with the magical and the medieval consumes your tabletop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
