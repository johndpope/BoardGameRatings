			<description>This is an abstract strategy game for two to four players based on a checkers theme. A spinner is employed for movement. Moves are made in a straight line, forward, backward or sideways, but not diagonally. The point of the spinner corresponding in color to the player's knights indicates the number of moves the player may make.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to get as many knights as possible into any of the other players' castles, and also to score by capturing the opponents' knights. A capture may be made by a player spinning a number that will land his knight directly in a space occupied by an opponent's knight when not on the gold field or in a castle. Knights may be passed or jumped at any time but they are safe from capture on the gold field or in a castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is determined by the score of points. For each knight captured the player scores five points. For each knight moved to opponent's castle the player scores 15 points. The game can be played to conclusion, even though one or two players may be eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
