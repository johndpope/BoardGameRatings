			<description>Kamasutra: The Game of Love was originally published as 8 pages of rules insert between pages 92 and 93 of Lee Siegel's book Love in a Dead Language. It is a competitive two-player game played on a board easily customized from a standard Pachisi board. In addition to the board and the text of the Kamasutra itself, the game requires the following components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     6 pawns of three sizes and two colors&lt;br/&gt;     64 unique cards divided into eight suits (each card representing a sexual technique) &lt;br/&gt;     1 pair of dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player has three male pawns, the other has three female ones. The goal of the game is to move these from their home circle to the central Kamaloka (&amp;quot;World of Eternal Pleasure&amp;quot;). To make the final approach to the Kamaloka requires that each pawn first collect one card in each of the 8 suits of the Kamakala deck. Cards may usually be acquired when a pawn is moved into a space containing a pawn of the opposite sex. Special spaces provide other conditions for acquisition, loss, or trading of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board design includes some double-sized spaces that provide a choice of paths, allowing players to adjust the effects of dice rolls for movement. Also, a pawn may move clockwise or counter-clockwise, but only one of the two directions on any given turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
