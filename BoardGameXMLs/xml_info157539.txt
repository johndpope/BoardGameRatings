			<description>from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;A player that has been introduced into our hobby by way of such structured systems is often at odds with systems such as The Window. When you tell such a player that they need only describe their character using words, it is not uncommon for them to lapse into total confusion. Indeed, I myself have seen many players over the years simply fail to grasp the principle of free form character creation altogether.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This stumbling block directly inspired the creation of The Window Frame. With this simple tool, those players confounded by free form character creation can circumvent that stumbling block and still enjoy all of the other benefits that The Window has to offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
