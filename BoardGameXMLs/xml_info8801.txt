							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Domino Land</name>
									
			<description>Domino Land is a variation on traditional dominoes for young children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from the rules:  In Domino Land the cards are slotted inside each other and built upwards rather than laid in a row.  Fitting the cards together in this way means that you can make creative 3-dimensional designs: a colorful ball here, a heart over there, a cat in between - and at the back is a donkey looking out of his stall!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces are divided evenly amongst the players and the object of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all of their pieces by matching the design on previously placed pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
