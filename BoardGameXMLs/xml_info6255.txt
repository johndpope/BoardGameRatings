			<description>Equipment:&lt;br/&gt;-Playing board, 4 playing pieces, 14 Sign cards, 32 Movements cards, Money&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECT&lt;br/&gt;To be the player with the most money after all the signs are placed in the proper order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple and attractive children game. Combine letters and numbers skills.&lt;br/&gt;The different signs of the 7 shops (TO-YS, BA-NK, PE-TS, FI-RE, PO-ST, MI-LK, BO-OK) have been misplaced. Players will collect them and placed them on the right places. Movement is not by dice, but by CARDS (like in fast 111s). Each card reads a nice riddle/rhyme, like for example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;PUTTING UP SIGNS IS SOMETIMES A CHORE,&lt;br/&gt;ADD 2 AND 2 AND  MOVE AHEAD  ----  &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;(this one will obviously move 4)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other cards will send you directly to a particular shop, or entitle to steal a sign from another player, etc, etc Additionally, players can steal signs when meeting on the board, as long as they don't have more than 2 at anytime in the hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every sign a player place on the right place is rewarded with 10 US !! The player with most money at the end is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, LETTERS, NUMBERS, COLORFUL BOARD AND MONEY. A good mix for children!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
