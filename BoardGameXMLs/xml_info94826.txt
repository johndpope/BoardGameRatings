							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fate of the World</name>
									
			<description>Based on the research of Dr. Myles Allen at Oxford University, Fate of the World simulates the social and environmental impact of global climate change over the next 200 years. The science, the politics, the destruction - it&amp;rsquo;s all real, and it&amp;rsquo;s scary.&lt;br/&gt;The planet is in crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your mission: Save the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;It won't be easy. As head of the Global Environmental Organization, you'll be pitted against strengthening natural disasters, dwindling food and energy resources, tense international situations...and an ever-growing population that will not accept failure. Armed with the newly granted powers of the GEO and your team of loyal agents, you must navigate the challenges of the next two centuries by any means you decide. Prevention and response, social change, clandestine operations, technological breakthroughs, alternative power, space navigation...all are at your disposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the dawn breaks on your inauguration day, everyone waits with both hope and trepidation to discover:&lt;br/&gt;Will you be the hero of the Earth and its people, or an agent of their destruction?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fate of the World is the sequel to BBC Climate Challenge - a game played by over a million people. BBC Climate Challenge won the Best European Green IT Award in 2008 and the DEFRA Climate Challenge Award, and was a finalist in for the 2009 Serious Games Award, the 2008 Games For Change, and EuroPaws 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
