			<description>A Brutal Adventure&lt;br/&gt;This adventure takes place in and around the city of New-Zella&amp;trade;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s this? ..A trap door buried in the dirt!&lt;br/&gt;What horrific monsters and deadly traps must wait below?&lt;br/&gt;What splendid treasures must they be guarding for centuries untold?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sure, ..everyone&amp;rsquo;s heard of the old Skullcap tower. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely an ancient ruin with untold secrets, but it&amp;rsquo;s also far too common of a landmark to still hide anything of real value. Bandits hide out, Orcs make camp, Adventurer&amp;rsquo;s get ambushed, etc. etc.&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;ldquo;High Road&amp;rdquo;, as it has come to be known travels between the Skullcap Tower and the city of New-Zella, along the rocky coast between the raging sea and the putrid swamp. Then here, at Skullcap tower, the road turns inward, winding along a meandering stream through the swamp where it eventually finds its way to the small village of &amp;ldquo;River City&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;Skullcap tower was built to look like a huge giant skull, stuck on top of a tall round tower, 30 feet across and 60 feet high. The lights that once burned in the eye sockets of the skull, are now nothing more then a spooky legend. The face of the skull gazes over to the sea, and directly beneath its jaw are the rusted hinges that once held the door where only a gaping hole now lies. Within the round tower can be seen the unsafe remains of an ancient spiral staircase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
