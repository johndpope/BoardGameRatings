							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Slave Wagon</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As society has crumbled and all the convenience of the modern age were lost the need for cheap labor grew and with that the slave markets. One of the most effective and feared slavers out there is known as the Black Sparrow. Her slave carts deliver their cargo to the towns, the tech cultists and the cannibals that make the wastes their home. Despite her hard heart there are still those who love her and will do anything to gain her favor but there are also those who despise the slave trade and have their own plans to clip the sparrows wings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Issue 2 of Post Apoc Toys gives you all the flavor, hooks and people you have come to expect from Occult Moon. It also includes tables for salvage, rumors and encounters your wasters might find along the way. The Black Sparrow is coming, will you stand with her, against her or will you stand on the auction block?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
