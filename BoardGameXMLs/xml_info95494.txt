							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Trianhole</name>
									
			<description>A ball/marble rolling game published in the 1920s by Glevum Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has at least three printings, one with the company name and wooden balls, one with the trademarked company name and logo(still with wooden balls) and a later printing with glass marbles and a different scoring target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early version used wooden balls and had 13 scoring holes numbered from 5 to 50 - (1x5, 3x10, 2x15m 2x20, 2x25, 2x30, 1x50) as depicted on the box cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The later version used glass marbles and had 20 scoring holes (4 x 5 pattern) numbered 5 to 20 - (4x5, 8x10, 6x15, 2x20)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play appears to be that each player (any number) rolls 4 balls towards the target and scores the total of the numbers where the balls settle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Double points are awarded should a ball settle in a hole of the same colour as the ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play stops when somebody reaches 100 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
