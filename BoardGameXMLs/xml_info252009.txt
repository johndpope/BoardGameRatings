			<description>What do you see when you stare at a Jackson Pollock? A drippy gooey mess or an angst ridden family dinner? Or how about when you gaze up at the clouds? Do you see a herd of African elephants or a bunch of cotton balls? Every day we are exposed to images that prompt or provoke our psyches. And what we see says a lot about our personalities--or lack thereof. That's why the simple act of seeing images in an ink blot can be so revealing--especially with the assistance of a highly paid, over-educated psychotherapist. But not everyone has that kind of time... or money. Which is exactly why Rorshock! cards are so indispensable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game includes 20 ink blot cards and a &amp;quot;Diagnosis Book&amp;quot; and offers multiple ways to play. Play can be as straightforward as one player saying what they see in an inkblot and another player diagnosing it with the closest matching diagnosis for that card in the book. Alternatively, the ink blots can be used to inspire  writing prompts or games of Charades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
