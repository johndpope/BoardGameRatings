			<description>&amp;quot;I've compiled the most obscene words and embellished each one with politically correct artwork for your own enjoyment. In this game each player is stamped with one of these improper words which would be totally inappropriate in almost any other situation, however I've created a game that generates an environment that turns vulgarity into a socially acceptable fun time. Win by cussing out your friends and family. The game has three intensifying rounds of play so hilarious you'll swear you never had so much fun.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Everyone draws a card from the obscene word deck.  After everyone has shares their new lable, players take turns flipping their cards in front of them. When the card onto of your pile matches someone elses , shout their lable before they shout yours.  The loser collects both piles of cards. The first one to get of their cards is the winner.  &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game description on kickstarter page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
