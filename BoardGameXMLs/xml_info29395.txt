			<description>Players are one of four people living in &amp;quot;Buddlbrunn&amp;quot;. The beer bottles are empty and you walk through the village to exchange them against full ones in the taverns or directly at the brewery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you meet one of your opponents, you have a drink, so both players lose one of their full bottles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also two neutral &amp;quot;Nassauer&amp;quot;, (German expression for a &amp;quot;scrounger&amp;quot;), and if a player meets one of him, he has to have a drink with that, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim is, to get as many full bottles at home as possible, which is easier late in the game, when you can just slip through empty taverns (=no full bottles anymore) and shorten your ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board representing &amp;quot;Buddlbrunn&amp;quot; has some similarities to the &amp;quot;Petri-Netz&amp;quot;, as do the other games of Helmut Dressler, &amp;quot;Play Net&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Glebdo&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some people shall have played this with real bottles and real drinking ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it&amp;acute;s quite an old game and very rare, it`s still available directly from the designer (April 2007)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
