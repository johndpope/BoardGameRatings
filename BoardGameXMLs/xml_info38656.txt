			<description>The game follows The Exploits of the French Resistance during WW2. It is a 2 player game of bluffing and deception. Each player selects his squad by dealing &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; amount of cards and then selecting only one, he continues until his pack is exhausted, he now has his squad. It may be good, as it is hand picked, but is it the best he would have liked?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each player has selected his squad the squads go to work. The Resistance player knows what his objective is, it is up to the German player to discover this and to ensure he has enough troops to stop the Resistance from being successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
