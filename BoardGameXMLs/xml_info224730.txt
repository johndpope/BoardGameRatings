			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More Dispatches from the Crowking- In the Depths of the Megadungeon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;All about them as they lay hung the darkness, hollow and immense, and they were oppressed by the loneliness and vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly branching stairs and passages. The wildest imaginings that dark rumour had ever suggested to the hobbits fell short of the actual dread and wonder of Moria.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-J.R.R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Megadungeons are a treasured tradition in fantasy role-playing games, from their humble entrances at the top, perhaps guarded by a few grubby goblins, to the ultimate power of evil festering at the very bottom &amp;ndash; the twentieth level!  In between, a host of horrors, ecosystems, and, hopefully, a bit of golden reward for our adventurers.  Think you can&amp;rsquo;t create a megadungeon of your own, that the only recourse is to spend your gold on someone else&amp;rsquo;s?  Look no further than Dispatches of the Raven Crowking IV- Megadungeons and Campaigns, the fourth installment from Daniel J. Bishop and published by Purple Duck Games.  This great issue discusses the literary background of megadungeons (the beloved J.R.R. being one of them), selecting themes and monsters to populate your dungeon, treasures and encounters, and a great list of evocative example areas that can give you ideas to confound, support, or help destroy would-be adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
