			<description>The game is essentially a modified deck of traditional playing cards, but featuring cartoon parodies of popular rap artists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt a hand of 12 cards from the deck, and a game lasts 12 rounds. The player to the left of the dealer goes first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round the top card of the deck is revealed, and the color of that card becomes the &amp;quot;trump&amp;quot; color. Each player plays a card from their hand of the trump color if they can. If the player does not have a card in the trump color he may play any card. The round ends when each player has played a card. If trump colored cards have been played, then the highest trump colored card played that round wins. If no trump colored cards were played, then the highest card of any color wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the round scores 10 points. The first player to score 187 points or higher is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(It should be noted that, since a game only lasts 12 rounds and players only score 10 points for a round, it is impossible to score the required number of points in a game to win)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
