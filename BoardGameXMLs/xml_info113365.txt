			<description>Princess Lillifee would like to go on a journey and is packing her bags. Since she would like to to take so many things along, she takes notes on small pieces of paper. But where did she place all her things in her room? Can you help Princess Lillifee to find her stuff?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;24 function cards&lt;br/&gt;24 item cards&lt;br/&gt;1 Princess Lillifee figure with base&lt;br/&gt;1 Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play the game:&lt;br/&gt;The youngest player starts. When it is your turn you show the top card of the function cards. It shows two or three things that Princess Lillifee would like to take along on her journey and which have to be packed into her bag. You have to try to reveal these items by showing the correct item cards. The order is up to you. If you make a mistakeand show the wrong item card with an item that is not on the function card, you turn only this item card face down again and it is the next players turn to try and find the correct items on the function card.  As soon as one player has revealed all items on a function card, he can keep the card and as soon as all item cards are turned face down again, he can continue with a new function card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End of the game:&lt;br/&gt;The game is over as soon as all function cards are given out or if one player got 6 function cards. Now you count your points on the cards. Each item on a function card counts 1 point, so you have as many points as items on your function card. The one with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
