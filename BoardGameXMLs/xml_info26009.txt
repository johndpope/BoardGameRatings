			<description>Starchec is actually a 2-games box with 2 different games in it. Common to both games is the use of 6-sided chess-die showing the 6 chess symbols: knight, bishop, rook, pawn, queen and king. Each turn, the die is rolled and allows 1 playing piece to make a chess move according to the roll of the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starchec-1, Wettlauf um die Sterne (race around the stars):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-4 players can play. Each player has 1 &amp;quot;saucer&amp;quot; and 1 &amp;quot;meteor&amp;quot;. Object of the game is to be the first player, who brings his saucer to the finish line. Meteors are used to block opponent saucer; they can only be moved, when a king is rolled, but the can be placed everywhere on the board then. If a saucer captures another saucer, the 2 involved saucers just change places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starchec-2, Spiel im Weltall (game in outer space):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is played on a normal chessboard. Each of the 2 players has 8 tokens, which are placed on two opposing sides of the board. Winner of the game is the player, who brings all 8 tokens on the opposing side of the board first. Captures result in an exchange of positions again, but it's also allowed to &amp;quot;capture&amp;quot; own pieces, if a player does not want to move any of his tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
