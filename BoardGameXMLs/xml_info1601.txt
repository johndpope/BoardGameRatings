			<description>Each player has a ladder of success that he must climb. Each rung of the ladder has a corresponding space on the outer (Monopoly like) track of the board and you must land on that space to progress. On a roll of the dice you can move forward the difference or backward the total of the dice. You cannot land on a space occupied by another player (the only interaction) and there are the ever present &amp;quot;chance cards&amp;quot; here in 2 flavors, credit and society. The playing pieces are appropriately Izod alligators. First player to climb to the top of the ladder of success is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
