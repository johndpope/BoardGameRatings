			<description>Ordalie is a two player game in which they are knights who fight each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players have a deck of cards 1-12, at the beginning of a round each player discards two cards.  After this each player plays one card face down and then they reveal it together.  The highest card wins (with 2 exceptions).  And he hits his opponent.  Then the player has to choose in secret which part of his opponents body he will hit.  First he chooses from two cards (left and right) and then from three cards (head, torso, legs), giving him a place and a height to hit.  His opponent may try to defend and also chooses these cards.  Then they both reveal their cards.  If they both played the same cards, nothing happens, if their is no card corresponding then the opponent gets full damage.  When one card corresponds he gets 'half' damage.  He puts this on his damage board (left side head, right side head, left side torso, right side torso, left leg, right leg), On each is a score track when the score track reaches the maximum the fight is lost.  If no maximum damage is obtained a new round starts (a fight takes 3 rounds maximum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
