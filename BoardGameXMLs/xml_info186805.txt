							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pagan</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in Pagan start with a Race (Human, Ogre, Pygmie, Gnome, Troglodyte, or Duck) which influences their Stat (attribute) generation.  Stats (Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Agility, Intelligence, Memory, Will Power, and Charisma) are randomly generated and generally run from 3-18, though this is limited by Race.  Characters will have a list of Skills generated in part from their (randomized) background and in part from their selected Class (Warrior, Ranger, Rogue, Mage, Monk, Paladin, or Bard).  Skills are placed into Groups, and each Class is prohibited from at least one of the Groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat matches a modified d20 roll to the character's Weapon Skill.  Attacks may be parried (Weapon Skill) or dodged (Contortions Skill).  Damage is reduced by armor and is tracked in points though characters may receive Major Wounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules present a few dozen spells and a few dozen monsters, along with a weapons list and an equipment list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
