							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hideout of the Long Dead Mardrid</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few years ago Mardrid was one of the most successful bandits in the area. He worked alone and was an expert at targeting his victims. He never killed any of his patrons and some reported, &amp;quot;he was a pleasant fellow&amp;quot;. There were rumors of the location of his hideout and the small horde it contained. No one has seen Mardrid in over two years. In recent days folks have been finding silver and gold coins in the creek.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer's Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's a side adventure that may attract the players. A few coins have been washed down the local creek and there have always been rumors that Mardrid, a notorious bandit, kept a hideout nearby. To get inside they'll have to swim up the creek without a paddle (I couldn't help myself).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mardrid didn't fair so well after one of his thefts and now lingers in the cavern feeling sorry for himself and waiting to extract revenge. In the meantime, the players can get away with a lot of loot without having to fight anything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've played with the level draining ability of Mardrid. He uses the captured life as a bargaining chip to retrieve the only person he's ever wanted to kill. Bring her to him and all life will be restored and Mardrid can finally rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Micro Adventure published on Tim Shorts's Patreon page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
