			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the outer edges of the Oort cloud, a Sun Gate links solar systems light years apart. The gate quickly becomes its own hub of activity as mining factions drag nearby asteroids into the gate's orbit. Hollowed asteroids become bases, homes to many. When riches are discovered, peace becomes cheap.With humble beginnings as a hobby project that began in May 2009 and a free prototype stage in January of 2011. The project has entered a commercial Early Access stage in January of 2014, and its initial release in January 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes Void Destroyer unique:&lt;br/&gt;I always enjoyed a great variety of games, I have combined many different ways of interacting with the game universe. Void Destroyer gives the player unique options on how to play.
