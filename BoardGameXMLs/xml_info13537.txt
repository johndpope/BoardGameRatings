							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bad Habits</name>
									
			<description>Players start by being dealt a hand of &amp;quot;bad habit&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;situation&amp;quot; cards.  During their turn, they must concoct a story as if they were in therapy, that persuades the other players that they have successfully overcome their bad habit.  Players then vote on the success of the storytelling....good, bad or ugly and play continues until one player successfully rids themselves of all their &amp;quot;bad habits&amp;quot;.  At that point, the winner is allowed to collect the other players bad habits and using pre-scripted personality profiles they fill in the blanks as humorously as they can and read out load the &amp;quot;bad habits&amp;quot; of the other losing players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
