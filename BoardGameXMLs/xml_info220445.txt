							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Unicante 2007: Das Spiel zum Chor</name>
									
			<description>Unicante 2007 is a German card game based on the student's choir Unicante, specifically its concert season 2007 and the choir members of that year. Cards represent singers, songs, events etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete to collect cards forming a choir and line-up of songs to gather victory points. They have to manage the balance of the vocal parts in their choir and the overall mood of their group, take into account the abilities of their choir members, and use event cards to improve themselves or impede the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A &amp;quot;concert&amp;quot; card mixed into the lower part of the deck announces the end of the game and victory points are counted for the final tally. The player with the highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
