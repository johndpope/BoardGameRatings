			<description>Movie monsters battle one another to prove which one is supreme!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slasher Clash is a horror movie-themed game of Supernatural Conflict for three to five Players. Players assume the roles of the monsters, who, in classic genre fashion, hunt and kill Civilians, using Action Cards on specific targets or to set up combos. As Characters complete Objectives, they unlock powerful upgrades to help them become more deadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But watch out! Your fellow players likely have their eye on many of the same targets, so you'll have to fight for them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Character has different abilities, a unique upgrade path, and sets up combos in different ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player that is the first to complete a series of Objectives, or kills the Last Girl, is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
