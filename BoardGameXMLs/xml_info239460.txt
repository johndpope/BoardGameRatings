							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cat&#039;s Meow: A One Page Adventure (Cypher)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Excuse me, my cat is lost. Can you help me? She&amp;rsquo;s a ginger cat, and this isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time she&amp;rsquo;s gone missing. If it was just a day or two, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be worried. I&amp;rsquo;ll pay you (an extreme amount) to help me find her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an adventure set in a urban setting that starts with a plea for help, includes a short investigation, and culminates with an encounter with a myusterous cult with an extradimensional connection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is the first of a series of One-Pagers, single page adventures that are perfect for a player or GM without a lot of time or running short on ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be dropped into any setting and is written so that it can be run as a starter quest, part of a longer adventure, a side quest if you are out of ideas, or even as a one-shot adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only that, but we have chosen to include the lionoid race you see pictured on the front cover, the Chatoulim, as bonus material to add to your campaign or even provide as an option for your players who want something a little out of the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
