			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Journey to Newhome is a series of short adventures designed for the Darwin&amp;rsquo;s World post-apocalyptic role-playing game. The adventures in this book are based around characters first introduced in the novel, Burning Lands. Journey to Newhome continues the story of several of those characters, but in a format usable in the Darwin&amp;rsquo;s World role-playing game. You will find usable game statistics for the book's major characters, as well as an overview of what happened to those characters after the events described in the novel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than just a write-up of stat blocks, however, Journey to Newhome provides usable adventures in the format of a protracted campaign of far-reaching consequences, though with some modification each adventure can be played individually as a short diversion or a single night&amp;rsquo;s challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Journey to Newhome is composed of eight adventures that tell the story of a heroic new beginning for the people of the Twisted Earth. These adventures are set approximately ten years after the events described in the Darwin's World novel, Burning Lands, and also weaves in elements of other Darwin's World adventures (such as Halidom and the Mind Masters series). Each installment in the campaign features one or more characters (either directly or indirectly) from the novel; during the course of the campaign the player characters get a chance to meet these figures, deal with them, possibly fight them, and in some circumstances, adventure alongside them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Product Highlights:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     8 Part adventure path&lt;br/&gt;     23 Color Maps&lt;br/&gt;     Appendix of new gear, NPCs, and terrors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
