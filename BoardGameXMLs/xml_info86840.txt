			<description>Zip! is a tactical boardgame for 2 to 4 players, in which each player is searching for a buried treasure and, once found, tries to get away with the loot.&lt;br/&gt;Who finds a treasure, has a bigger chance to win, but has to be extra careful too, because each player can &amp;quot;zip&amp;quot; his/her stone around the board to hit an opponent's stone in a flash, removing the opponent from play and stealing his/her treasure on top of that.&lt;br/&gt;All stones are being moved simultaneously (players can hit the stone of an opponent in another players' turn) and for expert players there's a variation in which all player's stones are invisible!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
