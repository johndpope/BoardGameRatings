			<description>Yoiso Flowers is a card game that challenges players to quickly and efficiently reduce their starting hand size of 10 cards to zero before their opponents do. Cards are played to 2 different piles and card order must always follow a simple matching rule of Large flower to Small flower of the same color. But this is not just a simple color and pattern matching game. Players can set up combos that allow for multiple cards to be played in a single turn, traps that cause their opponents to draw more cards, and force opponents to play specific card types. In the end, the player who can manage their card hand and takes advantage of card plays will win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
