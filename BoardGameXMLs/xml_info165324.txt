							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Empty Chamber</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Empty Chamber is a ghost story. A monk whose extensive learning drove him mad died or in some other way slipped out of reality there. It was a smart move with the world in a mess and the end of the age coming. The Old Seer was conniving , weaving events into cats&amp;rsquo; cradles full of knots and glue. But supernatural fingers don&amp;rsquo;t get stuck and, from where he&amp;rsquo;s at, the Mad Monk can slip new tangles into the Old Seer&amp;rsquo;s twists and skew the game toward a new age of peace and harmony. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t always look benign. Case in point - those Secret Sisters of the Perfect World, the Mad Monk&amp;rsquo;s posse of assassin nuns. But trust that a brain tinctured in the supernatural knows more than you do and take a lesson. Look through the lens of #92 for a glimpse of the whole picture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
