			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We Were WASP is a character drama about four women who volunteer as pilots for the WASP corps (Women Airforce Service Pilots) during World War II. It is the story about four very different people who come together around the common dream of flying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The narrative has three acts. The first act follows the characters during basic training in Texas, where they put their internal relationships to the test. The second act describes their active service in Arizona. During a period where female pilots are even rarer than today, they face prejudice, discrimination, and contempt from the US army, forcing them to stand together against the pressure from their surroundings. In the third act, they are on a mission in England. Here they face the horrors of the war. A war they cannot assist in, barred from helping by their gender. The game ends with the disbanding of the corps, and the GM giving the graduation speech that General Arnold (Commanding General of the Army Air Forces) gave to the last graduating WASP class before disbanding the corps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
