			<description>What's Wild?! is a rummy-based card game for 2-7 players Ages 7 and up. Instead of cards featuring suits, the game's cards are made up of four different animal skins&amp;mdash;alligator, cheetah, peacock, and zebra. And to further the &amp;quot;Wild&amp;quot; theme of the game, when a player's hand allows him or her to end a round of play, he or she must declare, &amp;quot;I'm going wild!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complete game of What's Wild?! includes 10 rounds. Each player receives three cards to begin the first round, and by the final round, each player is holding 12 cards in his or her hand. Players collect appropriately-named &amp;quot;herds&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;caravans&amp;quot;&amp;mdash;called &amp;quot;books&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;runs&amp;quot; in traditional rummy games&amp;mdash; throughout each round, until they are able to &amp;quot;Go Wild,&amp;quot; or end the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four cards - called &amp;quot;Chameleon Cards&amp;quot; change the Wild Card when played throughout the game. The four Chameleon Cards give the game a sort of &amp;quot;Old Maid&amp;quot; feel, in that if the card is in a player's hand when another player &amp;quot;Goes Wild,&amp;quot; the player holding the Chameleon Card is awarded the maximum amount of points. In a game in which the low score wins, players must carefully weigh their options for playing Chameleon Cards when holding one. Playing the card too early may allow the Wild Card to be changed in later turns, but holding on to it too long may lead to an stampede of points. The Chameleon Card makes each round of every game of What's Wild?! new, exciting, and completely unpredictable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.whatswildcardgame.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.whatswildcardgame.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
