			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jak 3 is a video game for Sony's PlayStation 2 console developed by Naughty Dog. It is the third game in the main Jak and Daxter series. Jak 3 was completely localized and dubbed in Japanese, but was not released in Japan due to Jak II's poor sales. Japanese, however, is selectable on the Korean release of the game and will play on a Japanese PlayStation 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Location&lt;br/&gt;Like its predecessors, Jak 3 takes place in an un-named fictional universe created by Naughty Dog specially for the games. Specifically, it is set in the New World, its time frame placing it around 200 years after the events of the first game. Jak 3 largely focuses on the Wasteland, a large desert only briefly referred to in the previous entry in the series as being completely uninhabited and inhospitable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spargus City, a large settlement within the Wasteland bordering the ocean, is where the game officially begins, and serves as a hub for the player, where new weapons and upgrades can be earned, and most missions are given out. Later on, the plot shifts focus to Haven City, a sprawling metropolis which was the central locale in Jak II, though the size of the area is only a fifth of the Wasteland.[1] Some levels from the previous game are radically altered (Haven Forest, Metropolitan area) or removed entirely (like the Arena, Bazaar,and farm district in Haven City), while others are added (New Haven City), branching off from Spargus and the Wasteland and Haven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
