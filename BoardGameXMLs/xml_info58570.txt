			<description>The players have suction hammers, going after cardboard chips which are face-down on the table. When they hit a chip so it is sucked to the hammer, they can check which color it is. If it matches their own ladybug puzzle, they can take it and go for the next one. The first player to find his or her six chips is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
