							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">How to Run: An Advanced Guide to Managing Role-playing Games</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book is divided into four parts:  The Art of Presentation (6 chapters), Managing Yourself as DM (2 chapters), Managing Your Players (2 chapters) and Worldbuilding (4 chapters).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In forty years, the role-playing community has sorely lacked a savvy investigation of the art of DMing, targeted exclusively for the long-standing enthusiast. For the first time, we have a book that presumes the reader knows what a role-playing game is, and how it is played, wasting no time covering old ground. Instead, How to Run exhaustively examines how to present the setting, handle players, draw forth emotion, cope with information overload and make a world from the ground up, step-by-step and point-by-point. Alexis Smolensk hasn&amp;rsquo;t written a dry, academic treatise of the game, he&amp;rsquo;s written an empowering field guide for grognards seeking illumination. No serious campaigner should venture forth without this book in their backpack!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
