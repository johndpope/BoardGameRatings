			<description>&amp;quot;Shadow the Hedgehog (シャドウ・ザ・ヘッジホッグ, Shadō za Hejjihoggu) is a 2005 video game developed by Sega Studio USA, the former United States division of Sega's Sonic Team. Featuring the titular fictional character Shadow the Hedgehog from Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series, the game was revealed at the March 2005 Walk of Game inauguration of Sonic, the series' main character. Shadow the Hedgehog is the third game (and the last in the Sonic series) developed by Sega Studio USA, which was merged back into Sega's Japanese division in early 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the trend of recent Sonic games such as Sonic Adventure and Sonic Heroes, Shadow the Hedgehog is a 3D platform game. Most levels have three possible missions&amp;mdash;&amp;quot;Hero&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Dark&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Normal&amp;quot;&amp;mdash;that the player may choose to complete; some levels have only two (which mostly are only &amp;quot;Hero&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Dark&amp;quot;). The missions completed determine the game's plot, a feature referenced by the game's tagline, &amp;quot;Hero or villain? You decide.&amp;quot; The plot centers on the attempt of Shadow, a creation of Doctor Eggman's grandfather Gerald Robotnik, to learn about his past after suffering from amnesia. To defeat enemies encountered, Shadow can use various weapons and special attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadow the Hedgehog was created for the Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox video game consoles, and released in 2005 in North America on November 15, in Europe on November 18, and in Japan on December 15. It received mixed to negative reviews; critics criticized its unwelcome &amp;quot;dark&amp;quot; theme, particularly the addition of guns and other weapons, but praised its replay value.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Shadow_the_Hedgehog_(video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
