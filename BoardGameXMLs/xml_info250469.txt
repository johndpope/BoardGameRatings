							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Faerie Dice 2: Invasion of the Pixies</name>
									
			<description>The Faerie Dice series evolved thematically from the board game Faeries in which Faeries, aided by Trolls, throw Cheese at each other while racing for safety. The Faerie Dice series of games use only dice-rolling; with players scoring over several rounds. Six is suggested as an ideal maximum number of players, though more could play, with rounds and games taking longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faerie Dice 2 Invasion of the Pixies comprises six unique dice each with a Faerie, a Cheese, and one of each of four clans of meddlesome Pixies who try to steal the Cheese from the Faeries. As with Faerie Dice there are rules to two games. Plundering Pixies is a jeopardy game where players try to aid Pixies in capturing Cheese, but must deduct points for combinations of dice lacking Cheese or Pixies or including Faeries. In the second, Thieves and Traitors, players try to roll the highest scores possible over up to three rolls each turn, with varying combinations of Thieving Pixies, a Traitor Pixie, Cheese and Faeries. In both games, scores are totalled over several rounds, with the winner the highest scorer after either a fixed number of rounds or after a set score has been reached by at least one player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
