			<description>Adomoc is an abstract strategy board game for two players. Each player has a &amp;quot;breed&amp;quot; of fifteen playing pieces of which there are three types: a foot, a moon, and a sun. The game is played on a circular board with eighty-one spaces arranged in nine concentric cycles. The goal is to move one's prime sun from the outer edge of the board, to the centre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adomoc games tend to involve a fair amount of motion. Players may conceptualize strategies that focus on organizing movement as opposed to blocking the opponent's movement. Because both players are aiming for the same goal and can in some situations use an opposing piece to aid a win, the game incorporates a collaborative ebb-and-flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players alternate turns. Each of the three types of playing piece have a particular pattern in which it can move. Feet can move around the cycles or back and forth along columns from cycle-to-cycle. Moons can move in spiral patterns between cycles, and suns can move in any of the directions. The pieces can behave in three different ways. These behaviours are: originating (sending an opponent's or one's own piece back to an origin space), consuming (removing an opponent's piece from play), and attracting (holding a foot in place).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adomoc was originally invented in 2001 and has evolved such that there are two variants to the official rules. Adomoc rules promote thinking beyond dual polarities. Its design reflects universal symbols that are grounding and expand beyond the concrete immediacy of common human experience. The game's rules and designs are available under both Creative Commons licences and the unique Adomoc Artisan Licence (AAL), which enables other people to produce their own Adomoc sets. Adomoc also has a standard notation, which enables it be played by correspondence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
