			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At last... an event that combines the class, superhoes, culture, roleplaying, mayhem, and an incredible body count... with show-stopping musical numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario was played as a farcical, stage-produced semi-LARP at Conduit, 2004, in Salt Lake City, Utah.  The game was hosted by the author.  All participants received improbable (and wimpy) pre-generated characters with &amp;quot;standard Attribute and Class&amp;quot; traits; each character was presented on a single sheet.  Play involved the simple expedient of attempting to stay alive the longest through a series of calamitous, random, and risible events.  At various points during the adventure surviving participants were required to join in singing topically relevant show tunes.  Usually, failure to sing well led to immediate death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This manuscript game, including extensive handouts of odd paper sizes, is available for public reading at Tracy and Laura Hickman papers on Killer Breakfast role-playing game; MSS 8180; Tracy and Laura Hickman papers; L. Tom Perry Special Collections; Literary Manuscripts; 1130 Harold B. Lee Library; Brigham Young University; Provo, Utah 84602.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
