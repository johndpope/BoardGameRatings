							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thrash Revised</name>
									
			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;As the title implies, Thrash Revised is a revision of the original martial arts RPG created by Ewen &amp;lsquo;Blackbird&amp;rsquo; Cluney. The original Thrash was born out of Blackbird&amp;rsquo;s need of an RPG that was as true-to-God to videogame martial arts as possible.&lt;br/&gt;Thrash combines elements from White Wolf&amp;rsquo;s long dead Street Fighter RPG, Mekton-Z, and Ninjas &amp;amp; Superspies to simulate fighting games as closely as possible. Also, as most fighting games come from Japan, incorporating several anime elements, the game also contemplates those elements characteristic to the&lt;br/&gt;genre and incorporate them into the game. The result was a system that&amp;rsquo;s incredibly flexible, easy to understand, and allows for the creation of nearly any character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
