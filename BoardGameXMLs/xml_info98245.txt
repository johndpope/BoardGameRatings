			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mutant Storm is a top-down, dual-stick shmup, similar in some ways to the classic Asteroids game. You pilot a tiny ship that careens through levels that exist in a vertical plane and you must blast all the encroaching mutants while dodging their incoming fire. This game differs from &amp;quot;Reloaded&amp;quot; because you play through actual levels that are long corridors. There are &amp;quot;bosses&amp;quot; that must be defeated at the end of each of these. You no longer get power-ups and instead have one super cannon that has a finite amount of ammo. You also have six hit points instead of being killed with one hit. You can play offline with either one or two players. When playing multiplayer, you no longer have access to the super cannon and the two players share the six hit points. There is no online multiplayer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
