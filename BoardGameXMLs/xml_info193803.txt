			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Fireside Tales is a collaborative storytelling game for 4 to 8 players. The goal of the game is to tell an enjoyable story together by suggesting appropriate story elements represented by the cards you play. If you wish to win, in addition to hearing an awesome story, suggest the cards that fit the story best - so that the other players choose to incorporate them in the story. Whoever gets the most elements into the story is the victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine Once Upon a Time meets Cards Against Humanity, then add deeper storytelling and wacky rules - and you'll get Fireside Tales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
