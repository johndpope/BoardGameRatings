							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wild West Exodus: Unfinished Business â€“ Dark Nation Faction Bundle</name>
									
			<description>Wild West Exodus is a table top miniatures game set in a sci-fi filled 1800's America. Technology and greed rule the old west. Wild West Exodus: Unfinished Business introduces 4 new factions to the game; The Confederate Rebellion, Dark Nation, Golden Army, and The Watchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About The Dark Nation:&lt;br/&gt;Once a proud and spiritual people, the Warrior Nation has fought long and hard to keep technology out of their lands.  However, the pull on its people has consumed many of their warriors, and the Dark Council has influenced even the strongest of their leaders.  With the corruption spreading like a virus, the shape shifting Warrior Nation men and women become trapped in a half animal half human form left to walk the land as deformed creatures with no home.  Once these proud warriors leave the guiding light of the great spirit, they are doomed to a blood thirsty life of war.  Their beast and human form aide them in their battles against anyone who would dare oppose them.  With weapons and technology at their side, these beasts may never be stopped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most exciting parts of the Wild West Exodus game mechanic is the reusable influence pool.  The influence pool will give players the option to gamble away a set amount of tokens in return for a reroll of the dice.  Be careful what you gamble on because once the tokens are committed they are lost for that turn.  The D10 system gives the game life and options that round out easily and allow for quick decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Halo that each model possesses creates an area of assault around the miniature allowing for fast and deadly close combat.  This helps move the game along quickly and gives each fight a more cinematic feel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wild West Exodus also benefits from an alternating 1-3 model activation system.  This system lets both players choose the most strategic way of advancing their characters across the battle field.  This means that you never have to wait more than a minute or two before taking control of your own posse for your next activation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each posse consists of a structured army list.  All factions will have 1 Boss model, 0 to 4 Underboss models, 0 to 8 Sidekick models, and an endless amount of Hired Hands.  Heavy and Light Support vehicles also make up an army list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This really gives the gamer the option to field a force led by one mighty general commanding a horde of troops or the complete opposite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some gamers may choose to load up on skilled Sidekicks and Underbosses or go heavy on Hired Hands for a true horde army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No matter what option you take, the world of Wild West Exodus will engulf you in fun and excitement from your very first game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
