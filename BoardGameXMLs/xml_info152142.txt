			<description>One of the wargames made by Tsukuda Hobby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game covers the hypothetical situations in 1990 that was near future in those days.&lt;br/&gt;The sea lane deffence was loudly discussed in those days in Japan.  Prime minister Nakasone made an announcement of unsinkable carrier for Japanese islands.&lt;br/&gt;The hypothetical enemy is Soviet union which was broken into pieces soon after the Nakasone's announcement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map covers Sakhalin to Taiwang.  But the combatsystem is quite tactical.  Unfortunately there are only 3 scenarios.  And 2 of them are just drills between US force and Japanese self-defence force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very rare game even in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
