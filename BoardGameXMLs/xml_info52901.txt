			<description>Ein Spiel f&amp;uuml;r 2 - 6 Spieler um hei&amp;szlig;e Pizzen und um ebensolche Reifen...&lt;br/&gt;Mach deinen Pizza-Express zum besten in der Stadt...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;English Description:&lt;br/&gt;Hot Pizza and hot Wheels...&lt;br/&gt;drive your Pizza-Express delivery Service to the best in the City...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game is Based in this early Variant (Later Variants are in the Phase of Planing) on a Hex Grid with Numbers inside like Sttlers from catan. All Players are setting there Pizza Express Central on a field with a &amp;quot;2&amp;quot; marked in the Center. The Numbers represented the Amount of Fees you must pay to the owner of the Building (Landlord?) every Round. The Starting Player rolls two dice on the random Events Table. Then he rolls for the field where the Pizza Couriers, must deliver their Pizzas. Every Player has one starting Courier. The first one is roling a Die to determine the Number of Crossing Points, his Driver could move this Turn. After this he moves his first driver as Near as Possible to a field with a Number rolled as Target field. If he reachs a crossing point adjacent to the target field he is earning the Printed Number multiplied with 100. These are the Pizza Units or PU (PE in German).  But not PUs are the Target of the Game! The Victory depends on Victory Points based on Quality, Price and a Cutt throug rate of Delivery Times from the Pizza Orders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I Personally like this Game but the realy simple Grafics of the Game had once avoided any succes on the Market. So i decided to release the Game with better Artwork in 2010 hopefully...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No English rules Available yet but in Praparation Status!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
