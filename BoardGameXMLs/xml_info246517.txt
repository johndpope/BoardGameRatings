							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Punkin Fight</name>
									
			<description>It's a rainy, Halloween Night. You're under attack. A rival gang is lobbing Punkin Bombs at your various clubhouses around town&amp;mdash;trying to bring them down, and take over your turf. It's time to fight back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How To Play&lt;br/&gt;Separate the &amp;quot;Clubhouse&amp;quot; cards from the deck and deal 3 face-up in front of each player. Place the rest of the deck face down between all players. The player left of the dealer has first turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each turn, players draw up to 5 cards (the hand limit), and then may play only 1 card of each card type. Punkin Bomb cards are played in front of a player's house to attack it. Witch cards are played behind a house to strengthen it. Ghost cards are played on the last bomb placed on a house to remove it to the discard pile, and Vampire cards may be paired with a card to play an extra card of that type during a turn. A turn is over when no card can be played. If a player already has 5 cards at the start of a turn, draw 1 more card. Play continues clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the total value of all Punkin Bombs played on a Clubhouse equals (or eclipses) its value (plus the value of Witch cards behind it), the Clubhouse is destroyed/removed from play. All cards played on the Clubhouse go to the discard pile. Should the game deck exhaust, reuse the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player with a Clubhouse left, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
