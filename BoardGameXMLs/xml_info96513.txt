			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Chess game designed especially for Windows Vista and later releases of Windows, and was released with their basic games pack along with Solitaire and FreeCell.  It had two modes of play, one vs humans in a hot-seat fashion, and the other vs the AI with a scaling difficulty from 1 to 10.  There were a few visual themes available for selection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is ultimately not challenging for experts, but is good enough for the vast majority of people who would be playing with the basic Windows game pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
