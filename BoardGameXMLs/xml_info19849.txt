			<description>ELEPHANT CHALLENGE is a memory game that can be played with individuals or teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with two sets of components each comprising 16 cards (numbered 1 to 16), 4 dice in different colours, 4 counters in different colours, and an elephant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player takes one bag of components and, after shuffling the cards places them in 4 rows of 4 in any order.  He then places the 4 dice, 4 counters and elephant on any 9 of the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On completion of this the timer (one minute) is turned over and the second player has until the time runs out to memorize the exact location of the cards, dice (colour and number), counters and elephant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cover is then placed over the puzzle, hiding it from view and the second player must reproduce it in every detail using the second bag of components.  He scores 1 point for every correct card, dice, counter and elephant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to beat your opponent's score but ultimately to remember all 25 items correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
