For details, and for information on how the versions are structured, see the series RPGGeek entry here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015. All of the entries are available here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Winners and Everything&lt;br/&gt;Entry #1530; Stage One: Samuel Briggson; Stage Two: Josh Crowe; Stage Three: Michael Wenman&lt;br/&gt;Stage One Title: A Bard's Tale&lt;br/&gt;Stage Two Title: Quiet Night&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Gather round and let us tell the stories of the heroes of the previous&lt;br/&gt;world. Your parents, your uncles and in some cases, your older siblings.&lt;br/&gt;They fought and died so that we might live.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let us set the stage: Monsters poured from the darkness, literally killing&lt;br/&gt;sound as they went. We tried to sound the alarm, the bell moved but no&lt;br/&gt;sound came. Our shouts made us hoarse, but little else. The monsters came&lt;br/&gt;and destroyed the world that was. But we were not defeated yet. People&lt;br/&gt;banded together and learned to fight the monsters. And they may yet succeed&lt;br/&gt;in destroying all the monsters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;ldquo;Quiet Night&amp;rdquo; you play as the children of heroes. Listening and pitching&lt;br/&gt;in to the tale woven by the village bard. The Bard leads a series of tales,&lt;br/&gt;while the audience contribute by describing the actions of survivors who&lt;br/&gt;were related to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
