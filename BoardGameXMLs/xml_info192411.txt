			<description>Back of the game box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many millions of light years away from a cooling planetary mass destined to be our Earth, the people of the planet Zero were facing almost certain extinction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They were a peaceful people, living below the surface of a planet that was permanently in an ice age.  Their power and heating source was a complex and intricate network of piping, carrying plutonium from manufacturing plants to the reactors.  These pipes ran along the surface in ten giant networks to be cooled by the external temperature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pipework with its deadly plutonium cargo proved to be a tempting target for the Destrovians who coveted the rich plutonium deposits on Zero.  Teams of saboteurs began to disrupt the outer networks, gaining strongholds.  They installed scanning orbs, dome-shaped supply dumps and other devices to protect their territorial gains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Zeronian council sent many a young hero to an untimely end, but still the Destrovian menace came on.  The Zerovian council decided to call on the one man they believe could save them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are that man, the Gunrunner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
