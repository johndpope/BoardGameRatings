			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created as my final year project at Teesside University, No Horizon is a rules-light Sci-fi tabletop game where players play the role of a ships crew, as part of an organisation that collects and responds to distress signals throughout the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In No Horizon, players choose between a selection of alien races and ship roles, customising their character with over 70 Advantages and Drawbacks, 40+ augmentations and gene therapies and a veritable armoury of equipment, guns and starships. Players can even tap into powerful energies and unleash devastating psychic abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No Horizon's Arcs system ties a characters' narrative and mechanical progression together, rewarding players for roleplaying and developing their character with the vital Talent needed to spend on improving their skills and attributes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
