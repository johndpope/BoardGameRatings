							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">7 Wonders: Playmat</name>
									
			<description>The 7 Wonders: Playmat is an organizing tool for players who don't just want to drop the counters and cards from 7 Wonders and its expansions any old place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In April 2014, GTS Distribution released a 7 Wonders: Playmat as a bonus item on a 1-for-1 basis for retailers who bought 7 Wonders from them. While not specifically having a spot for the Leaders deck, the playmat does have ample space for that deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2015, 7 Wonders publisher Repos Production released a 7 Wonders: Playmat with room for the base game cards, the Leaders deck, the central Babel game board, the large wonder cards from Babel, and the various coins and counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
