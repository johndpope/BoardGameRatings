			<description>Simple but addictive, drag AlexPanda to the destination while evading all the dangers. Supports Game Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poor Alex the Panda is having his flight trip to Hawaii but accidentally drops out of the plane to a deserted tropical island. Alex is too lazy to escape, so you are the only one that can help him to survive through all kinds of dangers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alex just doesn&amp;rsquo;t realize how desperate he is on this island. Drag him back and forth to finish every stage to keep him safe while getting to the destination. Alex is innocent, maybe a bit naive, but you&amp;rsquo;d better remind him of all the dangers in this terrible world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get higher scores of the stage by getting more flowers. Every time you finish a stage, you&amp;rsquo;ll get your score and you can compare with the global best score. Help Alex as quickly as possible to beat the record!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hidden flowers and creative techniques are everywhere in the game for you to explore. In a place full of uncertainties, considering how grave a helpless panda is. Try every method you can imagine to get Alex moving safely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
