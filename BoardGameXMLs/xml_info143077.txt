			<description>Abstract game for 2 players; can be played on plain grid paper, each player using a pen of different color. &lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;1. each player alternately place a mark of his color inside an empty cell of the grid.&lt;br/&gt;2. if player completes a closed polygonal with his marks, all the internal cells (empty or marked) take that color. A player can enlarge one of his existing polygonals by adding new marks.&lt;br/&gt;(a closed polygonal is any closed path connecting marks of the same color, each adjacent  horizontally, vertically or diagonally to next one)&lt;br/&gt;3. the cells, once colored, are blocked. They cannot change their color even when they are enclosed in a new polygonal of the opposite color and do not take part to any alignment of marks&lt;br/&gt;4.If a player makes a winning alignment of 5 or more marks (horizontally, vertically or diagonally), he gains additional moves: 1 for an alignment of 5, 2 for an alignment of 6, and so on (for n signs, n-4 moves, with n&amp;ge;5). Additional moves must be played in the same turn of play but cannot be used to increase in lenght a winning alignment built in the same turn; &lt;br/&gt;if an additional move makes a different winning alignment, the gained moves add up.&lt;br/&gt;5. if a move closes a polygonal, the coloring of its internal cells is mandatory and has the priority over marks alignments.&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the game:&lt;br/&gt;to color an arranged number of cells, by default 20. Players can choose a different number at the beginning of the match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
