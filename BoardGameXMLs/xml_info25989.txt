							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Truth, Dare or Damnation!</name>
									
			<description>Description from Khepher Games website:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The party game where you're damned if you do, and even more damned if you don't! Players decide to answer the truth on the purple dice or act out the dare on the blue dice. If they fail, the black die reveals the penalty.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with two purple truth dice, two blue dare dice and a black die with dares that must be carried out if the truth or dare are not completed to the satisfaction of the rest of the players. All dice are six-sided and have text on them. The dice of the same colour combine to give an instruction, such as &amp;quot;Spank or grope ... An inanimate object&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game doesn't actually specify an objective or how to win, but presumably the aim is to have the least embarrassing results after rolling ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amusingly, the game comes with the warning, &amp;quot;Not to be played with alcohol&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
