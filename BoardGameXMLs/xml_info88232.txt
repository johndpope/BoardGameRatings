							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Another 13 Shades of Darkness</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When thirteen shades of darkness aren't enough...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the original 13 Shades of Darkness, this sourcebook contains thirteen 2nd edition super-villains ranging in power from street-level to world-shaking, all fully detailed and ready to fight your campaign&amp;rsquo;s heroes. In the same vein as its predecessor, Another 13 Shades of Darkness focuses on the menaces that even other super-villains fear and shun -- the oddball, the psychotic, the occult, and the truly bizarre. Unlike the original tome, this volume does not dwell exclusively on supernaturally-themed villains, but also embraces those whose origins spring from weird science or the far fringes of space and time. From the shambling, extra-dimensional strongman X&amp;rsquo;Hort the Converted to the time-traveling quantum monomaniac Violator Red, this book is a must for game masters looking to expand the varieties of evil in their campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eleven All-New malefactors, from the gender-bending mastermind Sweet Adeline to the warped moral crusader Sister Splendor, each one featured along with adventure hooks and suggestions for use in your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; first edition super-villains -- both fully revamped and revised for their 2nd edition debuts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One complete villain-team-The Ordo Ultima, whose members run the gamut from the hapless wretch known as the Cretin to the human weapon of mass destruction called the Penitent. Included are details on their headquarters, their minions, and the threat they pose both individually and as a group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four bonus super-threats from the mega-adventure Promise of Purgatory -- but with greatly expanded material describing their backgrounds, motives, goals, and tactics.&lt;br/&gt;Five offbeat and intriguing NPCs who walk the &amp;quot;grey area&amp;quot; between good and evil-and who can play recurring roles as allies, enemies, or both, depending on how closely your heroes walk the line between justice and the law.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two completely new giant-sized supervillain lairs, mapped in painstaking detail and full color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A host of sinister spells, terrible weapons, and heinous secret formulas -- just the type of deadly devices every mad scientist should have readily at hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doomsday Weapons capable of melting a city or wiping humanity from the face of the Earth -- threats that should be sufficient to motivate even the most jaded super-champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evil Plot Devices that allow villains to acquire dominate the world -- or accidentally unleash forces that may bring down civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four adventures, thirty-five adventure seeds, dozens of minor and supporting NPCs. Could anyone possibly want more evil?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
