							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Qurious Space family card game</name>
									
			<description>This is an educational game which deals with space and space exploration. Much of the photography used is credited to NASA. The game goes in a small square tin and uses square cards. Some of the cards have symbols on one side and a single trivia question and picture on the other side. Others have four questions one one side  and responses on the back. Three modes of play involve trivia, symbol matching, and spinning cards to choose questions or activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
