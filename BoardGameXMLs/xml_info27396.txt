			<description>French game based on a show of the RTBF (Radio T&amp;eacute;l&amp;eacute;vison Belge).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player rolls a dice and advances, depending on the type of square he lands on, he might have to guess a definition, guess the author of a quote or even find the words that fit an appropriate combination of another word and its adjectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some areas are specially indicated &amp;quot;dictionnaire&amp;quot; (which means dictionary) and on these areas the questions are related to different categories ( exotic word, lost word, regional word, literature, culinary word, French slang (argot) or words from the francophone world (ex: Quebec, l'&amp;Icirc;le Maurice, etc.). Each category has a color and a small wooden dictionary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has a correct answer on one of these areas, he wins the appropriate dictionary. To win the game, the player needs to get a preset number of dictionaries (determined at the beginning of the game by the players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
