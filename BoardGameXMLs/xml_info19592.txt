			<description>Each player is dealt a &amp;quot;Program&amp;quot; card that specifies a colored horse pawn and the betting odds for that horse.  Each player is also dealt four movement cards.  Based on the strength of those movement cards, each player places bets on his horse. Bets can be to Win, Place or Show on a player's own horse. The players have the option to place a Daily Double bet, which in this game is betting that the player's own horse will win the first two races. The players, one at a time, play a movement card.  Most of the movement cards specify a number of spaces to move the player's horse pawn. Some of the movement cards state, &amp;quot;Ask Jockey&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;Ask Jockey&amp;quot; means that the player turns over the top card of the &amp;quot;Ask Jockey&amp;quot; deck.  The Ask Jockey cards are marked on their backs with a blue dot if the card has advantages for the player, red dot for disadvantages for the player, question marks ?? for instructions that may or may not affect the player that plays it.  Holding an Ask Jockey card until that deck has a card with a blue dot on top is ideal. After the players have put into play and discarded all of the cards dealt, the entire movement deck is shuffled and four more cards are dealt to each player. &amp;quot;Ask Jockey&amp;quot; cards can require a player to give a number of his movement cards to another player or just discard them without using them.  Therefore, players may use more or less than four movement cards per hand dealt. After the second race is complete, the Program cards are shuffled and dealt for each race.  The race track board is proportionally marked for all of the common lengths of horse races.  A game is complete after an agreed upon number of races and the instructions recommend 8 races.  The most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is NOT Knizia's Winner's Circle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
