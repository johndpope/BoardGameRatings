							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prototype: Industrial Saboteur</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daring, confident, and highly skilled, the Industrial Saboteur earns a living by stealing, modifying, or destroying information. A veritable nuisance for the powerful magnates and businesses of the world, the Industrial Saboteur works for a number of different clients. One day, he can steal cutting edge nanotechnology from one company and sell it to another. The next, he can be hired by the very same company he stole from (without his employer&amp;rsquo;s knowledge, of course) to destroy the latest research and discoveries of a competitor concerning new technological advancements, thus allowing his latest employer&amp;rsquo;s corporation to remain ahead in the race &amp;mdash; and thus allowing it to eventually reap all the benefits of being the first to develop such technology. For these services, an Industrial Saboteur is well paid. But the job is not without risks. This five page PDF is an easy-to-integrate PC class and just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern campaign world and gaming session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
