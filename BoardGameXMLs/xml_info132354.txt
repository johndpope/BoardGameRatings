			<description>The game consists of 36 6-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, all 36 dice are rolled. Each player takes a die that shows a 1 and puts it in front of him/herself. Then he/she takes a die showing a 2 and stacks it onto the first die. This continues until the 6 has been reached, then it's back to 1. All players act simultaneously and each player is only allowed to take one die at a time. Sooner or later, a player won't be able to find a dice with the correct number. He/she has to wait until the other players are also stuck. The left-over dice are rolled again. If a tower topples over, the dice are put into the pool for the next roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all dice have been stacked. The player with the highest tower wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
