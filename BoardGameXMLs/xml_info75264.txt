			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tropico 2: Pirate Cove is the 2003 sequel to the hit computer game Tropico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though much of it is based on the original Tropico, the gameplay is very different. The player runs a pirate island and, as the Pirate King, must keep the pirates happy while stealing as much booty as possible. Workers, called captives, are taken on raids, from shipwrecks off the player's island, or from nations with which an alliance has been established. They are the lifeblood of the economy, and all construction and production is done by their hands. They can take on most of the jobs available, including farmer, lumberjack, and blacksmith, and can even be promoted to a pirate. Skilled captives may be able to perform more specialized jobs unskilled captives cannot. Still, the main goal of the game, other than the objectives stated in a scenario, is to stay in power, much like the original Tropico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
