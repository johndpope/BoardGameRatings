							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brunswick World: Tournament of Champions</name>
									
			<description>Brunswick World: Tournament of Champions engages players in the life of a league bowler. The player can play exhibition mode or league mode for all the fun of bowling in a local league without the social interaction and/or dating. In addition to this, the player must choose the weight of his bowling ball (players can only play as a male character). The lighter it is, the more force the player needs to make a strike. The sounds when a new game is started are exactly like going to the bowling alley and how it should sound like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Brunswick World: Tournament of Champions&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
