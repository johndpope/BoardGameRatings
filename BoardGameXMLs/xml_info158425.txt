			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the unusual extra-dimensional organization known as iniTech comes a new TPS (Temporal Personnel Surveillance) Report on Sarge, one of the hard-hitting, militaristic Apoc High-bred. iniTech does its job admirably and makes certain that its clients have ALL the necessary information needed when assessing new potential threats or allies, regardless of the universe they inhabit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TPS Reports bring the core Untold setting: Splintered Serenity to the M&amp;amp;M Third Edition Ruleset. Part Post-Apocalyptic, Steampunk, and High Fantasy, Splintered Serenity will let you play a whole new game with the rules you already know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This, like all TPS Reports, comes with the standard required Cover Sheet (and yes, we read the memo about the new ones), an introduction by an iniTech Agent, and a detailed field report on the intended Subject. Further, you will find not one, but TWO character sheets with M&amp;amp;M Third Edition Game information for both the Heroic (PL 4) and Veteran Hero (PL 9) stages of the character's development! Use this TPS Report to easily introduce an advanced, militaristic, genetically-engineered edge into your M&amp;amp;M games!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanded sections on the Evolution of the character, six Hooks to aid you in incorporating the character into your game, and TWO distinct Untold Character Builds (complete with QRC) that mimic the M&amp;amp;M Third Edition builds, so you're ready for play in either M&amp;amp;M or Untold!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TPS Report, Subject: Sarge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No-nonsense and 99% business, Sarge is the epitome of the the Apoc High-bred, but she has a secret that could spell her doom -- and the doom of any around her. Haunted by visions of a nightmarish place that can only be termed &amp;quot;Beyond&amp;quot; an visited by a....something....that refers to itself as the Longfaced Man, Sarge has her work cut out for her. Sarge is not one to give up, however, with her trusty M1201 Assault Rifle and Silver Saber by her side, she just might come out on top!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
