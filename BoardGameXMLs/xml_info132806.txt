			<description>A sea-creature themed memory game for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 20 sea cards, 18 &amp;quot;yuck!&amp;quot; cards and 2 &amp;quot;wanted!&amp;quot; cards. Sea and &amp;quot;yuck!&amp;quot; cards show the same sea creatures. Some are very similar, differing only in colour or other small details. Cards also have a point value from 1-3. &lt;br/&gt;The sea cards are shuffled and laid out face-down. The &amp;quot;yuck!&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;wanted!&amp;quot; cards are also shuffled and placed in a face-down stack. The player whose turn it is turns over the top card from the stack and a sea card of his/her choice. If he/she turns over a card that matches the current &amp;quot;yuck!&amp;quot; card from the stack, he/she has to take the &amp;quot;yuck!&amp;quot; card, returns all the open sea cards to the face-down state but gets to look at as many sea cards as there are points on the card. &lt;br/&gt;If the top card from the stack is a &amp;quot;wanted!&amp;quot; card, players instead try to find (rather than avoid) the matching sea card. The player who earns a &amp;quot;wanted!&amp;quot; card can use it to remove one of his/her &amp;quot;yuck!&amp;quot; cards from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has received 5 or 7 &amp;quot;yuck!&amp;quot; cards (number depends on number of players). The player with the fewest &amp;quot;yuck!&amp;quot; cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
