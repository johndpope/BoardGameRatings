			<description>Step-by-step strategy for two players&lt;br/&gt;There are four armies inside the box, the armies of the North, West, East, and South. There are 17 units in each army, but the armies have a different balance of strength. This affects the tactics and allows you to have a new experience every time you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each unit card has a picture of a warrior, which can be either on foot or horse. There are also numbers of the attack strength and counter-attack strength. Players will compare these two to decide the outcome of a fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players put out a battle field that consists of 3 columns and 4 rows. Now everything is ready for battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play?&lt;br/&gt;The first player takes the top card from his army reserve and he leads it out onto the battlefield into one of the three cells of the first row. The unit is marching out of camp and joining battle. The unit comes out of camp and activates the unit in front. It displaces one of its comrades, that unit is activated and so on, until a unit comes into contact with the enemy. If a unit moves into an enemy cell, then the units start combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this we compare the attack strength of the attacker with the counterattack strength of the defender. The unit with the larger number is the winner of the round. The losing unit leaves the battlefield and is put into the discard pile, where it will remain until the end of the game, it cannot enter the battlefield again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then it is opponent's move. He goes through the same steps. He draws the top card of his army reserve and decides on the cell it will occupy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who wins?&lt;br/&gt;1. If we lead all of our units out onto the battlefield and there are no more reserve cards available, then the game is over. The winner is determined by the number of units still remaining on the field. The player with the most units wins.&lt;br/&gt;2. If a unit manages to cross the edge of the battlefield on the enemy side, we call this a break into the enemy camp and the game stops immediately, and the player who managed to break through wins immediately&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
