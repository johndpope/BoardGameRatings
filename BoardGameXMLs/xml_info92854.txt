			<description>The game begins with each player selecting one of seven secret identities - each a character from the Cogno games and books. The object of the game is to collect five of six character cards that match your secret identity before your opponents collect their cards or can guess who you are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, players ask their opponents for certain numbers or number ranges to collect the cards they need - while trying to keep their identity hidden. Meanwhile, they keep an eye on what everyone else is requesting in hopes of zeroing in on their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
