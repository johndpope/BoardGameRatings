							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MiniMonfa: 2 promo cards</name>
									
			<description>Two promotional cards for the game MiniMonfa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MiniMonFa is a 2-player, non-collectible card game that allows you to become an Archmage who must set up his dungeon in order to defend himself from the ongoing attacks of the local heroes, always covetous of glory, treasures, and experience points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have to build your dungeon with great mastery and shrewd strategy to stop the heroes: to achieve such a result, you can place insidious traps and unleash powerful and cunning creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides defending your underground dwelling, you will have to lead the fearless heroes you recruited to get rid of the competing Archmage who is weakening your grip on the surrounding areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defend your own dungeon and assail your enemy's! Will you find the way to manage both? Are you ready to try?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two promotional cards add Rigor Mortis himself to the game, as well as a bunch of Goblin Henchmen for Rigor Mortis. Rigor Mortis has three new abilities (Henchmen; Deadly Gaze and Firephoenix), his goblin servants won't die, but instead flee back to your hand if the Rigor Mortis card is in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
