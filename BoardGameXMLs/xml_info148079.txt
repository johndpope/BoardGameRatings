							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spiral Descent</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 40 x 20 inch, full color floorplan of a pool and cave entrance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It comes with Square, Hex and No Ovelays and includes the VTT files for online use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;There is a pool hidden deep within the mountains. One drink from its depths can give you eternal life if that is what you seek.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product includes two maps. The first map is an exterior view of a plateau that leads to a spiraling stone staircase descending to a pool of water. The second map is an interior cutaway view of a cave underneath the plateau.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product is intended for use in fantasy or modern settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spiral descent can be used as an exciting way to get to the cave below or a cave or dungeon of the Game Master&amp;rsquo;s choosing. There is a very real danger of falling as the adventurers fight their way down the spiral. If they are fortunate, they land in the middle of the pool to somewhat cushion their fall. The unlucky may not survive crashing into the rocks or shallow parts of the pool below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pool of Eternity: Local legends say that a pool that grants immortality is hidden deep within the mountains. A spiraling staircase descends to the pool and one drink of the waters can prevent death forever. What the local legends fail to reveal is the price. One drink of the pool grants immortality, but sunlight becomes a mortal enemy to the imbiber. This has forced most of the immortals into the dark cave next to the pool, unable to escape the mountains. If the group meets the immortals, they find most of them sad and depressed by their fate. Some immortals have become crazy and filled with hate, wishing only to inflict pain on mortals. Most notable is that their skin is fair and looks not to have aged at all, but nearly all of them have scars inflicted by the searing sun that permanently mar their bodies. Why does the pool grant immortality to those who drink from it? Is there a way to save the immortals from the curse of eternal life? Deep within the cave may be secret passages that lead to other areas within the mountains as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
