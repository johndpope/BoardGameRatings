			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action revolves around a twenty-four card chance deck and a pair of six-sided dice, three numbers of each die are green and the other three are red.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins the game with $40,000. After the deck of cards is shuffled and placed face down on the superfluous game board, the top card is drawn and read aloud to establish the conditions of trades for that player. That player follows the direction on the card. The dice are rolled and the results are enacted based on the chart on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After twenty four turns, the deck is depleted and the Power Play round begins. Each person, in turn, chooses one last trade and rolls the dice and check the card for each individual result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final round of play has each player roll the dice one last time to determine if each player must pay a trading fee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, the game is over and the player with the greatest net worth is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
