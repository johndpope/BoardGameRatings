			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Gladiator (arcade game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gladiator, known in Japan as Ougon no Shiro (黄金の城, lit. &amp;quot;Golden Castle&amp;quot;?), was a 1986 arcade game developed by Allumer and published by Taito. It was followed by a sequel titled Blandia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a gladiator/knight named Great Guaranos as he walks through a castle. Moving the joystick left and right moves Great Guaranos left and right, and up and down is used to position Great Guaranos's shield. The game's three buttons correspond to a high, medium, and low attack with Great Guaranos's sword. Gladiator consists of 4 Stages. The first level is the 'Underground Chamber', 2nd is the 'Brick Corridor', 3rd is the 'Roof Top' stage, and the 4th stage is called the 'Mysterious 4-D World'. Your reward for completing the game is to enter the &amp;quot;Treasure Place&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is split between two modes; in the &amp;quot;obstacle&amp;quot; mode, Great Guaranos walks forward, and the player must use the sword and shield to defend him from bats, fireballs, arrows, shuriken, and other flying hazards. The &amp;quot;obstacle&amp;quot; mode is broken up by a &amp;quot;fight&amp;quot; mode, in which Great Guaranos must fight against another, similarly-armored knight. In both modes, an un-defended hit to Great Guaranos knocks off part of his armor (his helmet for a high hit, his breastplate for a medium hit, and his leggings for a low hit), and a subsequent hit to the same area kills him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
