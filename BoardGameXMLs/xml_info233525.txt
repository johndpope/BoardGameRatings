			<description>Chicken Invaders: The Next Wave (or Chicken Invaders 2) is the second game in the series. It can be played by one or two players. The player takes command of the same lone spacecraft of the previous and must eliminate the chicken infestation of the solar system. The game features eleven levels, moving inwards from Pluto, each of which consists of 10 waves of attacking hostiles. In all the waves, chickens attack by dropping eggs which have to be dodged. The player can collect different items that help them in the game. Primary weapons may be changed by collecting parcels. Power-ups may also be collected to upgrade the primary weapon. Weapons may be upgraded up to eleven levels. The eleventh level however, is only acquired by collecting ten power-ups. Player may collect and accumulate drumsticks to get missiles, powerful weapons that can wipe out an entire wave. In all levels, except in the asteroid belt level, the ninth wave has a bonus (usually a new weapon, or extra firepower) awarded for not using missiles throughout the level, while the last wave features a boss. The game also comes in a Christmas Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_Invaders&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_Invaders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
