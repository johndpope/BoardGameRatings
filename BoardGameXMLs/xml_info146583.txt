							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeons of Derojhen, Epic Hero 2</name>
									
			<description>Catalog Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this adventure you take the place of a warrior, a subject of good King Brion. Presumably you are his favourite warrior because he instructs you to find the Jewel of Derojhen. King Brion needs this because he is having problems with the evil wizard, Sharleobon. The jewel will nullify the wizard's evil spells. The wizard's castle is probably not the most healthy of places to be, but when you bear in mind that you have to penetrate the dungeon you will see that you will have to have your wits about you. In addition to your wit, for self protection you will need a certain amount of intuition and luck because it will be necessary for you to find out what lurks within the three Halls of Cunning. As the same time you should be aware of the Keeper!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
