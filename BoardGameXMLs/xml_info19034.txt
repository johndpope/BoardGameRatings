			<description>Shuffle the pack of cards and place face down on the table. Starting with the youngest and going in a clockwise direction, each player takes a turn to pick up a card from the top of the pack. If this is a head card the player places this face up in front of him. If it is not the card is placed face up at the side of the pile. Play continues with each player taking a turn to pick up a card from the top of the pack. Once a player has a head card, he may add a body card and then a tail card. The player may collect up to three head cards before he starts adding body cards. should a farmer's wife card be picked up and some of the players mice have tails the player must return a tail card with the farmer's wife to the reject pack. If the players mice do not have any tails the farmer's wife is returned to the reject pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is finished when a player has in front of him three sets of Blind Mice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
