			<description>Subtitled &amp;quot;Simple Air To Air Combat in the Jet Age&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rulebook introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;These rules are intended to provide a very simple and fast-moving wargame using any scale of modern aircraft models available at present, in conjunction with a hexagon grid. The size of grid will obviously depend upon the scale of models used.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;To keep the game simple, much of the fine detail of air combat technology has been left out. Modern air combat is highly technical, but there is insufficient hard evidence to suggest the precise relative position of technology and pilot skill. Most writers on the subject are at pains to point out that the pilot's skill is still a significant factor, and it the skill of the player, rather than the technology that I have tried to emphasis here. Obviously, technology cannot be ignored, and in most cases I have tried to reflect the main differences in generic types of weapons and aircraft. Feel free to tinker if such detail that is available is insufficient for you.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The rules have designed with the wars of the 1960s and 1970s specifically in mind. They therefore exclude some of the more spectacular weapons developments of recent years.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game is mainly 2-dimensional, although there is a simplified height- band system to represent general operating heights. A fully implemented 3- D system would be much more complex to operate, and a lot slower in play, and for that reason has not been provided here.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game is intended to accommodate medium numbers of aircraft, and a single player should have no difficulty in handing 3-5 aircraft at once using the basic rules. The campaign rules are a different matter, however, and there is a separate section on those.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
