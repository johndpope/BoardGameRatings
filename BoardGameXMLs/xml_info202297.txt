			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moments are pieces of history, broken and scattered throughout time. The [characters] are able to preview these Moments and use the Sunblink cells to record them permanently. Each Moment is an instance of innovation and is coded with the region and era of its origin. Some Moments are more difficult to recover than others. Moments from the same region and era are more significant findings. Each researcher wants to build the most significant portfolio of recovered Moments and are even willing to steal for the distinction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played as a traditional card game using custom cards; role-playing elements include the character actions and various player decisions about how to assemble a narrative from components dictated by card play.  The custom cards are distributed as separate files intended for print-and-play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
