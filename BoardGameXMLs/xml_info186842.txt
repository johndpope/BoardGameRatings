			<description>Proles is subtitled &amp;quot;Dysangelium - Indecent Proletarian Sci-Fi Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note - the game features pro-Nazi and antisemitic content as well as violent and other mature themes.  The material is presented with experienced gamers in mind.  It is unclear whether the game was intended as a parody.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have four Statistics: Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Willpower.  Characters have a gender that is randomly determined between: male, female, neuter, or hermaphrodite.  Character demographics, such as age, country of origin, and personality are randomly determined.  Personality is comprised of Mind, Empathy, and Fanaticism.  These are randomly determined during build but subsequently fluctuate during play (to simulate insanity, depersonalization, etc.).  Characters have d6 Fanaticism traits randomly determined.  Characters have Skills which are purchased from a point pool.  Skills are based on a Statistic, and include traditional RPG Skills as well as several unconventional areas (cybemetics, dianetics, screwing, torture, etc.).  There are also about a dozen &amp;quot;Forbidden&amp;quot; Skills that are socially illegal to use (ambidexterity, bioluminescence, self-amputation, etc.).  Skills are used by rolling a d20 and &amp;quot;rolling under&amp;quot; the Skill rating modified by a difficulty factor--routine +10 to Very Difficult -10.  Combat mechanics are difficult to understand but the intent appears to have combat based on weapon Skill use.  Characters gain experience and then spend it to purchase Skills or Statistics ranks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The campaign setting provided is called &amp;quot;The Abrasive World of Final Times&amp;quot; and features a timeline from 1996 (when &amp;quot;the change&amp;quot; began) through 2012 (when the world &amp;quot;ended&amp;quot;).  The setting of the game, focused on Berlin, includes trans-dimensional aliens, demons, gangs, secret societies, criminal leagues, megacorporations, and random &amp;quot;stalkers&amp;quot;.  Berlin is lawless and &amp;quot;a large polluted area which has been mobbed by all the trash in the universe&amp;quot;.  The government is a science fictionalized Nazi regime.  Other regions are less well defined (&amp;quot;America is an evil land&amp;quot;; Russia is Gog; China is Magog; &amp;quot;AIDS has polluted African flesh&amp;quot;, etc.).  Satanism is rampant and in most places is the dominant, established religion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
