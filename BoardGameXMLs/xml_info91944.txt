			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dolfje Weerwolfje is on an adventure with Boura, Timmie and Dad. They're looking for Grandpa Werewolf, who's never afraid of anything. But hunters tricked him and now he's locked in a chicken coop. Now you are either Dolfje Weerwolfje, Noura, Timmie or Dad and you're trying to save Grandpa Werewolf as quickly as you can. But of course, you have to transforn into a werewolf first! Be the first to release Grandpa Werewolf from his cell to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game based on the popular books by Paul van Loon, about a little boy who's actually a werewolf. It's a simple 'roll and move', where cards replace the dice. The board is divided into day, twilight and night. During the day, players have to become werewolves. During the night, they have to find the items necessary to save Grandpa Werewolf. The 'twilight' part of the board serves as a second chance, where players can try to get the things they miss to finish either day or night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
