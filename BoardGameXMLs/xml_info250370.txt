							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chapter 9: Dapple Wood</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leaving the vast open plains which they have traveled through for weeks, the adventuring party enters the Dapple Wood, a forest thick with ipp, yarpick, and bronzewood trees. As they find themselves deep in the woods they will pass under a disturbing sight. Hanging over the river from an arched tree is the lifeless body of a bugbear. Around its neck is hung a wooden sign which reads, &amp;ldquo;Traytore to His Kind.&amp;rdquo; His kind were not happy with him in the Temple and they are even less happy with humans since the Temple&amp;rsquo;s fall. It won&amp;rsquo;t be long before the player characters will be begging for deliverance from this Dapple Wood. Will they survive the onslaught of Bugbear factions? Find out in Chapter 9 of the Great Flanaess River Adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
