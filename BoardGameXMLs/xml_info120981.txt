							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reanimation: A Zombie Survival Game</name>
									
			<description>The city of Whitewater has suffered a great tragedy; for reasons unknown the dead have risen up from their graves and seek to feed upon the living.  The city became overrun in a single night and the few remaining survivors now scavenge to survive during the day and barricade themselves safely away at night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take control of a small group of three survivors who have managed to last the first few days of infection and even barricade a small building to hunker down for the night in.  During the day you will send out two teams to scavenge for weapons, materials to build defenses with, supplies and even other survivors in order to prepare for the night; when 'they' come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, things would be easier if other groups of scavengers were not also competing for the same resources as you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
