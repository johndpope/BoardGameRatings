			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure in a Con:  an adventure designed with the &amp;AElig;ther Random Setting Generator, run Friday night of a convention, written on Saturday of the convention, and illustrated by an artist who attended the convention.  It&amp;rsquo;s an entire adventure&lt;br/&gt;pulling talent from a convetion!  It&amp;rsquo;s an Adventure in a Con!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Eater&amp;rsquo;s Tower&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A powerful cursed Human, an Eater, has taken up residence in an abandoned Byzantine tower which was long-ago overgrown by the forest it used to protect.  The party finds their way to the tower, possibly hunting the Eater, possibly seeking shelter from the dark of the woods; but no matter what their purpose is, they have a fight on their hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was designed by using the Random Setting Generator included in the &amp;AElig;ther Core Book and was designed at Vermincon in Vermillion, South Dakota on January 25th of 2013.  The players rolled the various aspects of three settings and chose their favorite from those results.  This adventure was based entirely on their rolls:  a Byzantine Empire setting with Renaissance Age level of technology that was a supernatural, alternate history setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This resulting adventure was crafted through their actions, written during the convention by Kevin Rohan and illustrated by the guest of honor, artist Fredd Gorham.  It is designed for three to six players, and, true to its roots, is perfect for either a convention game, a one-shot game, or possibly even a springboard into a larger campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
