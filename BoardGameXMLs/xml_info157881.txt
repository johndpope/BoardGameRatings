			<description>From Publisher website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last Stand is a tabletop roleplaying game of giant insects, enormous radioactive lizards, alien invaders, and destroyed cities. It&amp;rsquo;s also a game of biological power armor, weapons ripped from your enemies, climbing skyscraper-sized forces of nature, and collateral damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Last Stand, players take on the role of humanity&amp;rsquo;s last hope against an endless swarm of invaders. Giant bees colonize entire buildings, enormous ants convert subways into ant hills, and some kind of impossibly huge robot gorilla is on its way to destroy the city. To fight against them, you must become them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character has a suit of Bio-Armor, crafted from the corpses of the invaders. One character might wear the Hornet Bio-Armor, flying around the battlefield and tearing through enemies with the Hornet Sting. Another rampages through the city in Beetle Bio-Armor, practically invulnerable and inhumanly strong. If the Bio-Armor isn&amp;rsquo;t enough, you can also craft new weapons and equipment from the enemies you defeat in battle. Rip and slot your way to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
