			<description>The Roman Empire ruled the civilized world with an iron fist, seemingly all-powerful and limitless &amp;mdash; yet the power of Rome is secured not by its mighty legions, but by small bands of warriors and agents fighting a secret war. Tasked by the Emperor to explore ancient temples, forgotten labyrinths, and beast-haunted caverns, they seek out artifacts hidden by the gods themselves, hunt creatures of myth, and face enemies that would use dark magic against the empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broken Legions: Fantasy Skirmish Wargames in the Roman Empire is a set of fantasy skirmish rules for a war unknown to history, fought in the shadows of the Roman Empire. Various factions recruit small warbands to fight in tight, scenario-driven battles that could secure the mystical power to defend &amp;mdash; or crush &amp;mdash; Rome. A points system allows factions to easily build a warband, and mercenaries and free agents may also be hired to bolster a force. Heroes and leaders may possess a range of skills, traits, and magical abilities, but a henchman's blade can be just as sharp, and a campaign can see even the lowliest henchman become a hero of renown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mark Latham's blog, which provides additional rules, discussion, and FAQS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://thelostvictorian.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://thelostvictorian.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
