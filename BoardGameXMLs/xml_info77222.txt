							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Martian Memorandum</name>
									
			<description>Martian Memorandum is a dystopian cyberpunk/noir PC adventure game that was originally released in 1991 for PC. It was developed and published by Access Software. The game is the second in the series of Tex Murphy mysteries; its immediate sequel is Under a Killing Moon (which featured the return of a character introduced here, Lowell Percival). It is notable for its increased use of digitized human voices and digital &amp;quot;video&amp;quot; of human actors, playable even through a PC's internal speaker. The game play style is in the point-and-click adventure game style similar to that used in games made by Sierra Entertainment and others at the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_Memorandum&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_Memorandum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
