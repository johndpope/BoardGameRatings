							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mage Wars: Call to Arms</name>
									
			<description>Lord Yar issued the command with a wave of his hand. With a surge his mounted knights leaped into the charge, their lances lowered, ready to trample and pierce their goblin foes under heavy warhorses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a scream the Warlock&amp;rsquo;s dragon plunged out of the clouds above the battlefield, dropping down onto the charging knights. Flames and death followed as the mounted warriors charge was broken by the great beast of scales and wing. The victory did not last long though, as the high lord Wizard cast a mighty lighting bolt to strike the dragon dead, it falling out of the skies and crashing into the front lines of the goblin hoards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lord Yar cringed at the carnage that was already sweeping over the battlefield. The two great mages would both continue to throw their forces at each other, cast spells and counter these magics with their own powerful spells. By the end of the day, Yar doubted that anyone would be left alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Mage Wars, the newest Mini-Game from Bad Baby Productions. Mage Wars is a fast, fun game of magical conquest and war. Can your forces defeat your rivals before they grind you under their boot? Fully expandable, the system will showcase two new mages with each edition, as well as new hex boards, troops, magic and more. Gathered together, these different editions will create a massive game system which will devour hours of your time, so be warned, this game can be additive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This first set covers the forces and magic of the Arch-Mage and the Vile Warlock Lord. Each set comes with enough counters, map tiles and goodies to play, and when combined with other sets you can create a massive game system where several players can struggle for control of the magical realms of Mage War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
