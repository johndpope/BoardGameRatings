			<description>In the game, two Jedi Knights, one blue and one red, face each other off during lightsaber training. Player one is blue, the red Jedi is either a human or computer controlled opponent. The player controls his lightsaber with the paddle controller, defending himself from the laser blasts coming from the Seeker ball, fired by the opponent. The Seeker will regularly go wild and fire laser blasts randomly. The aim of the game is to fire laser blasts from the Seeker at the opponent's shield and finally the opponent himself. The game has four difficulty levels, changing the Seeker's speed, in the highest level the Seeker is invisible. The game ends when one player has received three direct hits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Star Wars: Jedi Arena,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
