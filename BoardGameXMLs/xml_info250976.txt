			<description>Fid the Frog is hungry and will eat anything he finds in his way, and you must help him eat as much as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feed the Frog is a party game for 2-6 players where each player tries to manage this appetite by placing hexes that include nutritious foods next to Fid. If a hex is green it includes a good meal for Fid. The player who placed that hex must remove in each round the food units from that hex until all are gone. Then he collects the points that are mentioned on that hex. If a hex is red it  includes a bad meal for Fid. The player who placed it on the table tries to keep the food units on it, cause if all units are gone, then the reward will be negative points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players must score the most point until they complete all 4 seasons. Each season is divided in 2 rounds and has a special ability that affects everyone in the game. At the end of the 8th round, the games ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes this crazy course will not finish just like that. The hexes are divided in 3 piles of Green food meals, Red ons and special cards. Players choose hexes from the different piles in each round and they try to use the special characters against the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end the only winner is Fid the Frog!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
