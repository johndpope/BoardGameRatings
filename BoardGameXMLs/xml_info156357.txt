			<description>Trilos is a game system featuring Triangular Dominoes (twenty-four Trilos and one Joker,) two playing boards, and two tile holders that include clips for tracking scores.  Each Trilo has a number of pips along each side, one through nine, and has a white face on one side, black on the other.  The spots on each side are the same, so that on one side the numbers run clockwise, the other anti-clockwise, which is indicated by an extra mark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules describe these games for play with Trilos:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dom Trilo &amp;ndash; a game of drawing Trilos and matching them on a table, in an attempt to rid one's hand of any remaining tiles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stones and Windows &amp;ndash; two players match randomly drawn Trilos around the blank edges of the small board (a triangular grid of 10 triangles the same size as the Trilos.)  The goal is to be the first to use all one's Trilos or, if reaching an unplayable position, to score the fewest points on remaining Trilos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rummy Trilo &amp;ndash; three players draw seven Trilos and privately try to match a pattern drawn in the rulebook, taking turns swapping out pieces until someone completes the pattern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crazy Pavement &amp;ndash; a more complicated version of Stones and Windows, with players trying to match pieces around the numbered sides of the small board, tracking several different ways to score points.  When the game becomes unplayable, the score determines the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Khuti &amp;ndash; two players lay Trilos on the larger board (which features a grid of twenty-two triangles,) attempting to fill the board while outscoring each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Khefren &amp;ndash; two players engage in a slightly less difficult version of the above game, Khuti.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two Patience Games &amp;ndash; there are two solitaire games included in the rules, Pyramid Patience and Trilex Patience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Troulette &amp;ndash; a game of chance utilizing a scoring board drawn in the rules and the Trilos pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
