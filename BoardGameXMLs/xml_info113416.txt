							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Catan: Cities and Knights</name>
									
			<description>Finally, the most popular Catan expansion is also available as a PC adaptation with strong computer opponents. It took a long time to fine-tune the artificial intelligence of the computer opponents so that the game would be challenging also for experienced Catan players. For this reason, Klaus Teuber as the author of the game was closely involved in the development, and together with the Catan Online World team the new version was created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Catan - Cities &amp;amp; Knights&amp;quot; is a thrilling gaming experience for everyone - fans since day one and first-time players alike. There are a total of eight different computer&lt;br/&gt;opponents to choose from. The extensive Campaign includes many varied scenarios, from the simple Base Game to diverse Seafarers scenarios (Oceania and Heading for New Shores, among others) to Cities &amp;amp; Knights scenarios in combination with Seafarers (Greater Catan C&amp;amp;K, among others).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The individual scenarios of the Campaign can be activated step by step; afterwards, you can also play the scenarios individually, using different options such as &amp;quot;Friendly Robber&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Card Stack&amp;quot;. Spoken story sequences develop the thread of the Campaign story. An interactive tutorial facilitates access to the game for newcomers, and for the skilled player extensive game statistics are available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
