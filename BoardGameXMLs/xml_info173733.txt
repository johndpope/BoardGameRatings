			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A printable rpg battlemap compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl or skirmish game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset. The map is 50x50, equivalent to 25 of our standard 10x10 tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A Japanese - style temple monastery complex, set in hilly terrain. A rocky stream makes it's way through a valley before passing under a wooden bridge, winding past cherry blossom trees. The temple is reached via a set of steep stone steps that pass devotional statues on the way to the main gate. The monastery complex is surrounded by a low wall, and contains several buildings linked by wooden-columned corridors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uses: Visit the warrior-priests and monks who live in the temple, work as a Ninja to infiltrate the complex and assassinate the Samurai general who is visiting, seek understanding from the wise priests who dwell in the hillside monastery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    250dpi A4 pdf, with gridded map spread across 50 pages for easy printing.&lt;br/&gt;    250dpi A4 pdf, with gridless map spread across 50 pages for easy printing.&lt;br/&gt;    250dpi full jpeg versions for VTT or poster printing (gridded and gridless)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Whilst the download looks large, it consists of several separate files - just download the versions you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A note on VTT use - we have deliberately kept the quality of the file high, and you may need to resize the jpeg for use in your VTT software. Keeping the file size and resolution high gives you the flexibility to use the map how you want - crop out a particular section or use the entire map, the choice is yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
