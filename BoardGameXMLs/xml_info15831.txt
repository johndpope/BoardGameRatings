			<description>This Parker Brothers game is different from the 1938 release with the same name. The 1956 version is a simple track game in which players play the parts of the Lone Ranger and Tonto. The board depicts the Wild West including trails and hideouts for outlaws. On your turn, you roll the dice and either move the Lone Ranger piece the amount shown on the white die, or the Tonto piece the amount shown on the colored die (all players move the same two pieces). If you land on a Star space next to a hideout, you spin the &amp;quot;Six Shooter&amp;quot; spinner to see if you score a hit. If you did, you turn over the disk on the hideout. If it has a bandit's name, you keep the disc and will score the points shown on it. If, however, the disc reads &amp;quot;Ambush&amp;quot;, then the piece that was ambushed is captured and placed on the hideout space. A captured piece is released and returned to the Sheriff's Office if a player rolls doubles. When all the disks have been turned over, the game ends and the player with the highest point total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
