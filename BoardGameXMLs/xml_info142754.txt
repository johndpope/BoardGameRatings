							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mattock of Mandabor</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mattock of Mandabor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five Dwarves set out from their mountain home in search of The Mattock of Mandabor. A long lost symbol of Kingship and rule. Facing the perils of open spaces. Dark fearsome forests. Ferocious Elves. Formidable Orcs and all manner of dangers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glimmerdeep Hold is a typical wealthy dwarven city with an excellent reputation for honor, unity, and perseverance (not to mention wealth!). Vast tunnels connect lucrative mines to a lively communal area where the Hold's approximately 1000 citizens spend their leisure time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city has been investigating the disappearance of Gantus, a young priest of Moradin, for two weeks. This morning the situation escalated when Father Matak discovered that the Mattock of Mandabor is not on its sacred pedestal. The elders immediately called a meeting of the council and have summoned you to their chamber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have been chosen as the heroes of the hold! The council asks you to investigate the disappearance of Gantus and the Mattock. Since Gantus has not been found in the Hold, they ask that you leave the safe confines of Glimmerdeep and seek information in the wider world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
