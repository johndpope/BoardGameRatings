			<description>From the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Huuuuu, they jump, they stack, they run... Who will be the first with his team of ghosts in the center of the castle and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this roll-and-move game, players control 4 ghosts which need to get to the centre of the board by exact count.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with 1 ghost. Once a ghost crosses the &amp;ldquo;2&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;3&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;4&amp;rdquo; space, the player may enter in play his second, third and fourth ghost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player&amp;rsquo;s ghost reaches a space occupied by another one of his ghosts, he stacks the ghosts and can then move them together as one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a ghost reaches a space of his color that is occupied by an opponent&amp;rsquo;s ghost, he sends the opponent&amp;rsquo;s ghost back to the beginning. If a ghost occupies a space of its color, it blocks the opponents&amp;rsquo; ghosts, who then need to roll a 6 to get by.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colored spaces are numbered 1 through 5 in ascending order. If a ghost reaches a space of his color, the player can choose to roll a die and move forward or back to the matching space (on a 6, the ghost goes back to the beginning).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every time a ghost reaches the centre, it is placed on a scoring track (first place gets 16 points, second place gets 15 points and so on). When all of the ghosts have reached the centre, the points for each color are added up and the highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
