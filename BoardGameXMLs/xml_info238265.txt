							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kingship: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>It's Medieval Crazy Eights! Cards are powerful when possessed in numbers, but only the first player to discard them all wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game of Kingship uses an 80 card deck ranging in card values from Ace to King and contains 3 various suits (Light, Dark, and Terra). Players must compete against their opponents to become the first player to use (or lose) all of their cards. Anyone familiar with the popular card game &amp;quot;Crazy Eights&amp;quot; with be able to jump into a game of Kingship right off the bat. Match the suit or number value to play a card and trigger its awesome card abilities! It is important to remember however that the closer you are to victory, the greater the chance you will become a target. That is why it's often a good idea to remain passive at the start and wait for another player to make the first move. For once a Queen is declared, any player may acquire Kingship, and from there, they can literally change the rules of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
