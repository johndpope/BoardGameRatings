			<description>The Mother Tree is ill and only you can heal it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Main appeal of the game is about exploring the forest and discovering the cause of the Mother Tree's illness. To do this you will be able to unlock new areas as well as revisit old areas in order to gain new powers to cure the disease. The game is based loosely on the Metroidvania concept but provides a more relaxing experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is comparable to a traditional shooter but with the freedom of flying. This adds exciting new gameplay in a whole new dimension!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phoenix Spirit is a game that is for everyone. Even if you haven't played games before it will be easy to understand with it's simple controls and gameplay using the iPhone's accelerometer. Getting through the game will be fun and provide plenty of challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
