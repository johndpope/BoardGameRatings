			<description>On an oval &amp;quot;400&amp;quot; meter Tenacity track, each player starts at the Hometown space and strives to end at the podium space where a roll of the die will determine which medal--gold, silver, bronze--they have won. Medals are included and must be placed around the winner's neck by the player on the right while others applaud and yell in support. Along the track there are sponsors, money and many miscellaneous gains and setbacks on the way to the winners' podium. Also included are clip-on athletes' passes and gold-colored metal playing pieces that represent different sports. Instructions, beside being on the inside of the box lid, are also included on a cassette tape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
