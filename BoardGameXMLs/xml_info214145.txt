							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monsters&#039; Night: Terror Stirs</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end of the harvest season means a great many things. Trees shed their leaves, the sun sets a bit sooner, and a strong chill dominates the air. The change of seasons? Perhaps. But the people of the world know this is not just summer changing into autumn. These are portents of a change in the world&amp;rsquo;s other inhabitants &amp;mdash; the Monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a small period of time each year, when the harvest ends and the fall sets in, MajiMonsters act strangely. Those unfortunate enough to encounter wild Monsters during this time speak of the Monsters&amp;rsquo; vastly increased aggression. Even placid Monsters suddenly become territorial, unruly, and prone to attack. Bound MajiMonsters show sudden unrest, eager to fight another battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As this change occurs, people look towards the sky for telltale sign the most dangerous night of the year is upon them. For when the full moon glows orange and the howls of Monsters echo through every corner of the world, they know Monsters&amp;rsquo; Night is upon them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsters' Night contains...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Information on Monsters' Night, a Halloween-themed event&lt;br/&gt;    Statistics for 10 brand new MajiMonsters, each themed for Monsters' Night&lt;br/&gt;    PDF contains digital bookmarks for quick reference of encounters, NPCs, and MajiMonster statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
