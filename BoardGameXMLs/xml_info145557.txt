			<description>Eureka City is a dice-and-card city construction game. Players all have a hand of cards and a common pool. They take turns setting up a &amp;quot;building plan&amp;quot; for their city by playing a series of cards that represent buildings, then rolling a number of dice and distributing them on the cards they have played. Each building completed gains the player some special effect. Buildings can be taken over by opponents unless you're careful. Once a player has five buildings of the same color, he is entitled to build a monument of that color, which also grants him some special effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all available monuments have been built, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
