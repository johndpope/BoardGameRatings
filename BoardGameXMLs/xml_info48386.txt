							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legend of the Ripper</name>
									
			<description>From the front cover: The city is gripped in fear! The Ripper has returned after a 125-year absence and is once again carving a trail of blood through the slums of Millers Court. Also returned is the ghost of Mari Kell, his last victim from more than a century ago, and she haunts the streets where she was killed. The city watch is at a loss to solve this supernatural mystery, much less apprehend the Ripper himself. All the clues point back to the hovel where Mari Kell was slain long ago. If the heroes are brave enough to enter, will they find the Ripper himself there?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for character levels 1-3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
