			<description>From the Rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NAVY is a fantastic and all absorbing pastime in air - naval strategy in which aircraft carriers, cruisers, frigates, submarines, tenders and fighter planes - a total of thirty perfectly detailed models - engage in combat (on a sparkling blue sea plan, criss-crossed by meridians, parallels and clearcut coastlines) to conquer islands, ports and airports, force naval blockades or impede the beforehand selected ever challenging military objectives from being hit or reached by the adversaries. This navy game can be played by two or more players (up to 12) from 8 years upwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;br/&gt;This navy game exclude blind luck, so badly needed with cards or dices, because the man-o-war and air attacckers move in precisely the same way as the teal task forces when sent out on a mission, having similar displacement, speed, navy apparel and airplane armaments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY:&lt;br/&gt;Board represent an hypothetic Pacific Sea divided into meridians and parallels, where only the intersections are marked. There are two home lands drown on the map, and other six movable.&lt;br/&gt;There are two factions in the game (Copper and Nickel) that face each others in order to accomplish certain objectives (capture the flag, dominate the sea, defende transport, tow home a captured enemy frigate ecc... scenarios are countless).&lt;br/&gt;Each faction has always an ADMIRAL, that decide where put the mines (secretly marked on &amp;quot;Admiral's plot&amp;quot;), his fome flag (the tower) and which unit group will move. An Admiral could have COMMANDERS, in charge to manage the units (there could be a commander that handle all units, two commanders that share the army or specific commanders that handle a group or a type of units... depends on the number of players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teams take turn by moving one unit at time (like in chess) orizontally or diagonally without change direction (planes can) and in case check if they hit a target.&lt;br/&gt;Each unit has three characteristics, Life points (1 to 3), speed (2 to 5 crosses) and range (0 to 3 crosses). Submarines can shoot only forward or backwards, and can immerse themselves (admiral removes the miniature from the board and tracks down their path on his plot), Airplanes can be very fast on high altitudes but can bomb (and be shot) only on low altitudes, they also can patrol 12 crosses away from a land or a carrier otherwise are considered lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
