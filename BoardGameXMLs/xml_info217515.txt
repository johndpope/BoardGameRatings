			<description>A space exploration spinning top board game. The object of the game is to spin and steer four capsule travel tops into the solar system game board and attempt to land on planets to win points. To win, tally up all points to make the highest possible score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player spins three yellow tops. The yellow capsule tops spins on the playing board and the player tilts the board to make the tops travel into the solar system and stop in a circular hole representing a planet and score points. This is repeated with one red top to score double points. Trouble if you land on the sun, either losing half your points if it was a yellow top or all points if your red capsule stops on the sun. The player having the highest score after spinning all four tops is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
