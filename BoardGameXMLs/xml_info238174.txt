							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Journey to Norumbega</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1559: a time of discovery and exploration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the New World, an ancient power sleeps, awaiting the stars to align in order to rise again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;are you ready?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been 500 years since the Old World last had contact with Norumbega. Is it a city of magic and gold, or of terror and death? The time has come, the stars have aligned, and a new cycle begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ThAT WHICH HAS sLEPT stirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost 50 years before the founding of Popham, and 30 years before Roanoke, the New World remains a vast place of mystery. No one knows what this land hides, or who&amp;mdash;or what&amp;mdash;waits in the shadows watching and hunting. There is a dark power that sleeps here, and its awakening will set great and terrible events in motion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you learn there may be something you wish you never knew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assuming, that is, you survive your journey to the New World to discover it&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michael LaMonica, author of French Revolutions for Beginners and The Ultimate Age of Discovery Guide: Renaissance France, brings the young New World to life in a time and place not usually depicted in roleplaying games. Focusing on early modern French Atlantic history, well before the American Revolution, this mega-adventure focuses on locations and legends you are not likely to have ever experienced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Norumbega.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Journey to Norumbega includes everything you will need to run this pulse-pounding epic adventure. The action does not stop here, however, as plenty of material is provided for you to continue adventuring in the pre-colonial period of Colonial Gothic, and to create your own mysteries in the New World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
