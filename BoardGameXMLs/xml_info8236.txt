			<description>Each player tries to fill out the same crossword puzzle grid.  Letters in completed words score a point each.  Words within words also score.&lt;br/&gt;To play, each player calls out a letter in turn, and writes it in the square of his choice.  The other players also place that same letter, but not necessarily in the same square, obviously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grids include scoring spaces to facilitate the tally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
