							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jimmy the Greek Odds Maker Football</name>
									
			<description>The game is based on American football and used cards to determine the outcome of plays. The plastic board represents an American Football field with a scoreboard, 10 yard marker, football, and has identical player charts on each side of the field. There is an Action deck of cards (52 in 4 suits) and two scrimmage decks (52 in 4 suits each). The suits represent different offensive and defensive play options, long pass (heart), short pass (diamond), running play (spade), or line play (club). The Action deck is used for non-scrimmage and special plays. Each player uses one of the scrimmage decks for plays from scrimmage. The scrimmage decks have a number 2-14 inclusive and a suit on the front. The back also has the suit. This allows the player to decide what type of play to run from the back of the cards without knowing how strong the play will be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For an example of a scrimmage play, assume the offensive player looks at the back of his deck and chooses long pass (heart). The defensive player chooses running defense (spade). Both players turn over their cards and show 10 of heart and 7 of spade for a +3. Cross reference +3 and spade on the long pass chart to see that this is a 16 yard gain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also rules for field goals, interceptions, fumbles, penalties and options, fair catch, on-side kick, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Odds Maker wheel is used to handicap the people playing the game and uses the number of times they have played this game, age, did they play football, do they like football, and do they follow football.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
