			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gothnog's Magnificent Cantrips: Volume 3 is a collection of specialized cantrips for those we often take for granted. Namely those hard working folk who provide the goods and services we use on a regular basis as professional adventurers. These were some of the first spells that Gothnog acquired during his early days as a traveling merchant and scholar of the lesser arcane arts. Unlike most cantrips, these have been divided up into reputable spells used by your average, upstanding shop owner, and disreputable spells used by those of questionable character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
