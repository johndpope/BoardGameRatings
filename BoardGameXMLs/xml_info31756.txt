							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">LOBO</name>
									
			<description>This game is a rummy style collecting game based upon the underground [subway] railway [railroad] stations of London, England. From names of stations and fact that Thomas De La Rue, address as given on my pack is given as 110 Bunhill Row, London EC1, which was destroyed by bombs during WW2,this game dates from 1930s.  The pack consists of 72 cards - 50 unique station cards which have small photograph of area around station, 16 junction cards i.e. EARL'S COURT, BANK &amp;amp; MONUMENT, HOLBORN [x2], KING'S CROSS, OXFORD CIRCUS, TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD, LEICESTER SQUARE [x2], PICADILLY [x2], BAKER STREET and CHARING CROSS [x4]. and 6 exactly the same Season Tickets [which act as jokers for interchange cards.]&lt;br/&gt;The Object of the game is go LOBO by making up a hand of two or more completed journeys either exposed or unexposed.  A completed journey consists of a junction card together with two station cards.  On the junction card are printed the names of starting or finishing stations made through that particular junction.&lt;br/&gt;Although rules state that game can be played by any number there is a limit to number of players which is constrained by the size of the pack which I suggest is 6 at most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
