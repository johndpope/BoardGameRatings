			<description>Basketball dunked in a box! All the excitement and the fast-thrilling actions of a basketball match recreated in a family game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By rolling two special dices, the players can organize their attack actions, by passing, running or shooting, while the opponents will try to stop them by defending their area. Are you able to score before the time in the shoot clock ends?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first team who scores 25 points during the 4 periods of the match wins the game! And with the special &amp;ldquo;team rules&amp;rdquo;, the game goes up to 10 players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
