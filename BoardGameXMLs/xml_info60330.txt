							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Froderick&#039;s Tomb</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for characters of 4th-6th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wizened sage shuffles through some yellowed papers on the desk of his cluttered study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;As you probably know, Froderick the Uncanny, master thief and arch-mage, died 150 years ago. In life, he was a consummate rogue and avid game player. As Froderick neared the end of his days, he built an unknown number of tombs in which his remains and most valued possessions might be interred. Two so far have been discovered, but tales tell of as many as a dozen. Froderick's remains and full wealth have never been found. Recently, I discovered excerpts from Froderick's diaries in a treatise written by an imperial architect on magical construction techniques. Based on these fragments, I have been able to discern the location of another of Froderick's tombs. As you can well imagine, I am extremely interested in learning the secrets of this lost tomb. I am willing to pay you 500 gp for a map of the tomb. In addition, I am offering 50 gp to each of you who agrees to grant me an interview after your exploration of the complex. You, of course, can keep any treasure you find in the tomb. Now, I must warn you, this excursion is likely to be perilous. Froderick was a master architect who favored both magical and mechanical traps, as well as summoned and bound guardians. You must be alert, cautious, and skillful if you are to succeed.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
