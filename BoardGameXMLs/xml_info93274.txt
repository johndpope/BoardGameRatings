			<description>Candidates begin their campaign on the inner Resource loop of the board, gathering resources to be able to win individual state Electoral Votes on the outer loops of the board.  A die (considered the Campaign Manager) is rolled to move the game piece.  Most spaces on the board result in answering a political history trivia question to win resource points or electoral college votes.  The winner is the first candidate to reach an Electoral College majority.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces are provided for four candidates.  More can be added.  Six can be tracked on the Electoral Ballet card.  If four or more players are involved, teams of two can be created as candidate and running mate.  Rules variations are also included for teams and a short game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was commissioned by Ford Motor Company national Public Affairs which owns the copyright.  The game was intended as an entertaining and educational lead-up to the 1988 presidential election.  It was conceived, designed and produced by Braddock Communications, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
