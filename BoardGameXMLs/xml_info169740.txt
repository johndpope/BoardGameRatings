			<description>This game helps kids learn math by engaging multiple learning styles (Social, Visual, Verbal/Auditory, and Logical/Mathematical)  The game is won by collecting goal cards.  Goal cards are won by using mathematical operators to join cards in a grid into other cards which are set aside as goal cards.  The grid cards are revealed and re-hidden during the game, so there is a memory aspect as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played at multiple levels from early elementary (just learning addition and subtraction with two digit numbers) to teens who know multiplication and division well and are learning powers, roots, and the Fibonacci series.  Using a timer (not provided), you can handicap the game so that adults can play against young children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game teaches both regular numbers (1, 2, 3...) as well as Roman numbers.  All cards also use images of dice to help kids understand the connection between the abstract number and the quantity that it represents.  This can help anyone struggling with math, but it is especially helpful for certain special needs students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was designed by a group of kids aged 10-15 as part of their First Lego League research project.  The game works well as a team game, if you have more than 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
