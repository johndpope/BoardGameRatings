							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Automobile: Wooden Money</name>
									
			<description>About two hundred copies of these wooden bills of currency were offered by Martin Wallace through his own publication house. They use the same, big, chunky wooden blocks used in the Treefrog Line version of Automobile, but printed with denominations on them.  They were designed for use in Warfrog Games and games from the Treefrog Line, but of course can be used however you like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
