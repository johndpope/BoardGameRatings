			<description>Four pizzerias, four city districts and four groups of starving customers&amp;hellip; It is here, where Gill Bates created his Micropizzas while listening to Jack Michaelson singing &amp;ldquo;Eat it&amp;rdquo;. It is also here where the world-famous scientist, Stevie Falconing, is looking for holes in dough and Beat Oven composed his Grosse Funghi&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pizza Wars PL is a hilarious game for both children and adults in which you take over as an owner of one of four pizzerias and you compete with others, trying to pay the credit off, taken to set up your business. With every baked pizza, you are one step closer to achieve your target..!&lt;br/&gt;Will you meet all your customers&amp;rsquo; needs or will you rather meet&amp;hellip; a debt collector..?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Pizza Wars PL, you run a pizzeria in one of four districts of the city Margherita. These are: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     business district,&lt;br/&gt;     bohemian, &lt;br/&gt;     villa &lt;br/&gt;     district of poverty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 15 unique customers (customer cards) originating from each of them (a total of 60). Each player starts with a different game board and some money.&lt;br/&gt;As an owner of the premises in a given social background you possess a special feature (fixed bonus) helping you to serve guests from your neighbourhood. During the game you can also acquire an extra piece of equipment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     fridge &lt;br/&gt;     oven&lt;br/&gt;     trolley&lt;br/&gt;     table&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;ldquo;connections&amp;rdquo; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These increases your chance of victory and modify the strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each customer requires a pizza with particular ingredients that you have to acquire to bake (cards of ingredients). You may buy them from the market place (on display) or draw randomly for free from the deck. After each round the market place changes (ingredients rot).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are as many turns as players and within your turn there are also two phases: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     you may either collect new ingredients or bake a pizza, &lt;br/&gt;     pay your credit off (move on the board) or acquire a piece of equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can have a maximum of 2 customers and 6 ingredients (some bonuses can change this rule) on hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having baked a pizza, your customer pays you some money, one&amp;rsquo;s card is discarded and you compulsorily draw a new customer &amp;ndash; you may decide if you want one from your own district or from the common deck. The money you earn has to be spent on new ingredients and on a rate of the credit. The player who pays the credit off as first, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an extra set of easier rules for younger children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
