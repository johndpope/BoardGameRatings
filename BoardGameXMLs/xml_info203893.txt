			<description>From publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder Roleplaying Game GM&amp;rsquo;s Resource supplement by Jeff Gomez&lt;br/&gt;Umelas has sold its soul. Thirty years ago, when the town was suffering from hardship and plague, a dark spirit offered a deal: Health, happiness and long life in exchange for the eternal torment of a single citizen. The mayor&amp;rsquo;s son was chosen as sacrifice, a simple lad of nine years with wide eyes and a dull expression. Down into the earth he went, and only screams echoed thereafter. Now Umelas thrives, a village of prosperity and good cheer. But to the wary traveller, something dark and guilty lies couched behind the saccharine smiles, and hangs heavy in the cloying air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Village Backdrops are short, richly detailed supplements that each present a single village ready to insert into almost any home campaign. Perfect for use as a waystop on the road to adventure, as an adventure site themselves or as a PC&amp;rsquo;s home, Village Backdrop present the details so the busy GM can focus on crafting exciting, compelling adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
