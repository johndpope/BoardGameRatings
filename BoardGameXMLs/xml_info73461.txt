			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incantations from the Other Side: Spirit Magic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incantations give an exciting twist to magic and are accessible to any character. Be warned, though, for the incantations in this book are not for the weak of heart. They tempt with great power but bring only ruin to the unwary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this book, you&amp;rsquo;ll discover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The intensity of Voodoo, a bridge between the mundane and divine&lt;br/&gt;     The wonder of an idyllic Old World folklore, an animistic celebration of nature and Slavic fairy tale&lt;br/&gt;     The madness of the Arcanum, a supplication to mind-blasting terror&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This magic is mysterious and powerful. It is not something to be played with and can quickly consume the careless. This is magic with a price, and it demands your respect. This is an unpredictable, living, breathing magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incantations from the Other Side: Spirit Magic is a perfect resource for players wanting to add a little danger to their characters or for game masters needing that extra something for their game world. This 38-page, high-quality, full-color, web-optimized pdf is compatible with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and contains 20 dangerous new incantations, 36 new spirits, a sample arcane lodge, and a new disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
