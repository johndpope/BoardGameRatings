			<description>So, you think you know games?  You are reading the latest magazines, going to the most recent conventions, and perusing the Boardgame Geek?  then perhaps you and a partner are ready to take on your knowledgeable opponents at A Game of Games as teams compete to guess titles of games before their learned companions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is similar to Password, but players try to clue the names of games instead of English words, and there are a few additional scoring opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
