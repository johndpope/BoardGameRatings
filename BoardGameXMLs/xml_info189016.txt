							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Topsy Turvy Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The Suite Life of Zach &amp;amp; Cody themed game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the description on the back:&lt;br/&gt;It's a card game that's as topsy turvy as Zack and Cody themselves.  Each player has his own deck of suite life cards.  When the game mat is on the &amp;quot;High&amp;quot; side, you're trying to have a higher number card than your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;But throughout the game things get topsy turvy and sometimes you're trying to have the lower number.  The game always ends unexpectedly when the special suite life cards show up.  When that happens, the player with the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
