A Sega Mega Drive version was released in 1994 with an enhanced 16-bit color palette. It is a religious-themed game heavily influenced by The Legend of Zelda. The engine it uses was also used in Bible Buffet.&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a young Christian whose town has been infested with demons apparently under the command of Satan himself. His task is to purify and convert the denizens to Christianity. Strewn about the town are the Fruit of the Spirit, taken from Galatians 5:22-23 and represented allegorically by five fruits (pears, pomegranates, apples, grapes and bananas). The player may use these to defeat enemies by hurling the fruits at unbelievers who repent immediately upon contact. In order to free the town of the influences of &amp;quot;ultimate source of evil,&amp;quot; the Christian must collect each of the six pieces of the Armor of God, which are guarded by &amp;quot;bosses&amp;quot; that are particularly resistant to conversion. Along the way, the player may collect other helpful Biblical items such as Samson's Jawbone and Anointing Oil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Areas of the game include a park, a downtown, an airport, a warehouse district, a hotel district, a shipyard, a residential area (houses), a junkyard (slums), a beach, some woods, and a prison, which sits upon the Demon Stronghold, the final level.&lt;br/&gt;The game was also ported to the PC, and was available on 3 1/2&amp;quot; and 5 1/4&amp;quot; floppy diskettes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spiritual Warfare and all Wisdom Tree NES games are playable online through the official website in the Arcade Section via the vNES Java Emulator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_Warfare_(video_game),&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_Warfare_(video_ga...&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
