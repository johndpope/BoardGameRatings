							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Partisan Carrier Version</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a full-color, 48 inch by 30 inch, floor plan of a Fighter, Carrier, Spaceship, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Zip File includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;If the Red Drudge pirates have been infiltrated by xenos, The Constabulary needs to know.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Chief Constable Doreen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Partisan Carrier Version is a single floor interior map of a spaceship that can split in half to function as two separate vessels. Alternatively, you can use it as a two floor ship with the airlocks used as elevators to get to the second level instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Partisan Carrier Version is intended for use in near or far-future science fiction settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunting the Red Drudge: The focus of the Red Drudge piracy group has slowly changed from stealing cargo to kidnapping humans. So much so that a rival piracy group called Ratchek&amp;rsquo;s Raiders have actually been muscling in on their territory and stealing more and more cargo. The Constabulary remains confused that their cargo trap was ignored by The Red Drudge last month and Ratchek&amp;rsquo;s Raiders taking the bait instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Constabulary has received new information from a witness, a human that escaped the Red Drudge recently. She claims that the once human pirates have been taken over by aliens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group is brought in as either Constables or mercenary fighter pilots for a new scheme to catch the Red Drudge pirates. Using The Partisan again, they disguise a military vessel as the passenger version of the ship and tithe to the Red Drudge. If the Red Drudge takes the bait, they find that this version of The Partisan is a light carrier and has teeth on both sides of the ship. Can the group catch the Red Drudge this time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
