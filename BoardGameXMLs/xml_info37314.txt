			<description>This game is a spin-off of the Star Wars: Return of the Jedi movie with the Ewoks. This game was aimed at children Ages 4 - 8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are trying to place all their cards in the &amp;quot;Friendship chain&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Like everything else they do, EWOKS have a special way of dancing. They hold up their arms and link their paws in a never-ending chain of friendship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EWOKS claim that the more they dance, the livelier they seem to feel. No doubt that's true. And you'll soon find out for yourself as you play this charming game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays by placing cards that fits the place where the paws of the other EWOKS' paws are located on the cards. Each cards placed next to another card must allow the paws of the eworks to be next to each other so that they &amp;quot;hold their paws&amp;quot;. The winner is the first player to depel his cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Placing cards, requires that the paws are aligned with each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
