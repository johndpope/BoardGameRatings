			<description>Progression is a game that illustrates God's plan as taught by the LDS church. Players begin in the pre-existence and are either born as a member or non-member of the Mormon church. They then proceed through earth life, death, judgment, Paradise or Spirit Prison, the 2nd coming and Millennium, and finally gaining eternal glory in one of the three levels of heaven or being cast out into outer darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is fairly non-PC by today's standards and would probably not be endorsed by the LDS as non-members of the church are portrayed as sinners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first person to achieve eternal glory is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
