			<description>From the cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As parties of adventurers roam the globe in search of treasure, not everything they find will be gold, silver, or precious gems. Sometimes the party will come across more mundane, yet still valuable, commodities that are bought and sold every day and help keep the world economies going. How do you determine what the value of a copper kettle, or a silver candelabra should be? If a party should liberate a cart of china vases from an unsuspecting merchant, what price will they get when they sell it in the next town?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To answer this question Tangent Games has created Commodity Cards. Commodity Cards are cards that the GM can print out and use to determine the type, quantity, and value for different commodities. Commodity Cards V: Finished Goods - Hearth and Home deals with those commodities that have been made into clothing, dishes, fabric, footwear, and other house-hold items. The set contains 330 different cards depicting finished goods from corsets to spinning wheels and armoires to rolling pins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commodity Cards V: Finished Goods - Hearth and Home contains 330 different commodities for use in your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No GM should be without Commodity Cards. Make them part of your gaming essentials today. Purchase your copy of the complete set of Commodity Cards V: Finished Goods - Hearth and Home today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
