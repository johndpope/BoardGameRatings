			<description>The Christian self reflection game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How is your daily walk as a Christian? Are you a Christian by name only or do you seek God's forgiveness daily? Sin may not seem like anything severe at first but, watch as your sins pile up in front of you. The closer the game comes to a close people will panic because they are still holding onto sins. What is a person to do? Don't you know we have an advocate with God the Father? Don't hold onto your sins in secret as the Hypocrites do. Accept the REBUKE and be made new.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have NO fear, this is not a trivia based game. Because it is not trivia based this allows everyone to pick-up and play the game easily. REBUKE is a cooperative family game. The goal is at the end of the game everyone must be without sin, or... everyone reaps the fate of failure. Use Forgiveness, Christian Character, and Recall to aid in removing Sin. There are also cards with topics that will heighten the game experience. You will come to realize that REBUKE is more than just a game, it is a great self reflection tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great to play with:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Ministries&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Bible Studies&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Families&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Friends&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Churches&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Academy Classrooms&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Anti-Bullying School Programs&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Road Tripping&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Game Nights&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Camping&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
