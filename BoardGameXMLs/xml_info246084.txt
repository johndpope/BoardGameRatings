			<description>(From GMT's website:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wing Leader: Eagles is the second expansion for GMT&amp;rsquo;s Wing Leader system. Eagles adds more aircraft, and more thrilling scenarios from the late war. Fly Hs 129 tank busters against the Soviet armored spearheads. Lead Ki-45 bomber-killers attacking B-29s over mainland Japan. Direct Coastal Command Mosquitos to strafe Luftwaffe airfields in Norway. Launch Me 163 rocket fighters against swarms of B-17s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Aircraft will also include the German Me 210 and He 177, the Soviet Yak-3, Yak-9U and La-7, the Japanese Ki-44 and Ki-100 fighters, as well as key late-war Swedish aircraft, including the J 22, B 17 and B 18. Counters for Finnish and Hungarian fighters make their debut in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will need a copy of Wing Leader: Supremacy 1943-1945 to play Wing Leader: Eagles.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to new aircraft and scenarios, Wing Leader: Eagles features a new campaign game, which recreates the 5th Air Force campaign against Rabaul in late 1943. The campaign comes with its own 11 x 17&amp;rdquo; campaign map, and will confront the American and Japanese players with tough decisions on targeting, force planning and raid execution in the lead-up to the invasion of Bougainville.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wing Leader: Eagles brings the major air combats of the late war right to your gaming table!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;1 x Campaign rules and scenario book&lt;br/&gt;1 x 11 x 17&amp;rdquo; campaign map&lt;br/&gt;1 x countersheet&lt;br/&gt;3 x sheets of Aircraft Data Cards&lt;br/&gt;1 x Campaign player aid sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
