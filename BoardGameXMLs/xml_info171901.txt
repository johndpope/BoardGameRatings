			<description>Triskelion is a connection game for three players that is played on a hexagon-shaped board made of hexagonal cells.  A distinctive feature of the game is that playing pieces are shared by all players, that is, players do not each have their own color of pieces.  Instead, each player is associated with two opposites sides of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only white and black stones are used. The board starts empty. Taking turns clockwise, on his turn each player drops a single stone onto any empty space. The color of the stone must be different from the previous stone placed (thus, the stones alternate). The first stone to be played is black.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player wins in either of two ways: (1) By connecting his/her two sides with a chain of stones of either color (i.e. a black chain or a white chain); OR (2) by making a Y shaped chain that connects one of his/her sides with each of his/her opponents' sides on the opposite half of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name Triskelion (pronounced try-SKEL-ee-un) is the name of a Celtic motif design that consists of three curved branches radiating from a center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
