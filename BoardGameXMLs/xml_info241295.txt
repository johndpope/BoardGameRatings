							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lackadaisy: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>With a unique cast of characters with special powers from the Eisner Award-nominated comic series, you and up to seven friends play as a gang of shifty shady felines trying to keep their speakeasy afloat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is cooperative with all players loading into their car, the Fordor, and exploring a randomly arranged deck of location cards laid out face down on the table. Players must get enough of &amp;quot;The Good Stuff&amp;quot; back to the Lackadaisy Speakeasy before the time runs out and the speakeasy folds like a cheap suit. Players will need to arm themselves and use the special location powers to their best ability to win. With event cards that can help as much as harm, the tide of the game can turn at any moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
