							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shrek: Super Party</name>
									
			<description>Shrek: Super Party is based on the Shrek movie series but is similar to the Mario Party series of games.  The characters Shrek, Fiona, Donkey, Lord Farquaad, Thelonius, and Monsieur Hood are available for play. Five realms are available for play, each with its own mini-games: The Keep, The Windmill, The Swamp, The Castle, and The Farm. The cover features four colored castles and four characters Shrek, Donkey, Princess Fiona, and Lord Farquaad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the game Shrek Super Party is to be the first player to collect a certain number of &amp;quot;Precious Drops&amp;quot;. This number can be preset in the &amp;quot;game settings&amp;quot; menu at the beginning of the game as anything between 200 and 800 in intervals of 100. The drops can be collected through making bug matches or by reaching &amp;quot;Realm Caches&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a realm to traverse toward a &amp;quot;Realm Cache&amp;quot;. The game is set up along a board game model, with each player taking turns moving spaces along paths towards the &amp;quot;Realm Cache&amp;quot;. Player movement is determined by a ball-drop game over a three-by-three numbered grid, with each of the numbered squares corresponding to a different number of spaces the player moves forward: 1-9. Each square also results in a different outcome. The possible outcomes include: Epic Battle, Daring Duel, Lose Drops, Gain Drops, Magic Mirror, Boots (which send the player to the evil bog), Magic Portal, Pixie Dust, Short Cut, and the final Realm Cache. The squares Magic Mirror, Boots, Magic Portal, Pixie Dust, and Short Cut appear only once per realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Shrek: Super Party&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
