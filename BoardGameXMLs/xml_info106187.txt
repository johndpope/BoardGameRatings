			<description>Savage Reign (風雲黙示録 ～格闘創世～, Fūun Mokushiroku: Kakutou Sousei?, lit. &amp;quot;Wind and Cloud Apocalypse: Hand-to-Hand Fighting Genesis&amp;quot;) is a 1995 futuristic-themed competitive fighting game released by SNK for their Neo Geo arcade and home platform. It was ported to the Neo Geo CD, as well as for the PlayStation 2 along with its sequel Kizuna Encounter in Japan only (as part of the Fūun Super Combo).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Savage Reign is set in the first half of the 21st century in the fictional city of South Town (the same city used in the Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting series). A mysterious man known only as King Lion has risen up from the shadows and issued a challenge on television for the strongest of fighters to battle him in a fighting competition known as the Battle of the Beast God. He promises wealth beyond anyone's dreams and fame beyond imagination. Nine fighters have come to the tournament, each with their own sole purpose and reason for battling against King Lion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Savage Reign&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
