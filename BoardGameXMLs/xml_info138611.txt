							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Pale Rider</name>
									
			<description>From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A minion for the Guild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Guild's own Rider, the Pale Rider is a fast-moving ranged combatant, with some clever ways to get increased offensive ability, resilience, and mobility. Depending on when you activate the Rider, the Pale Rider can be a hard-hitting ranged attacker or a fairly resilient and fast (if expensive) objective-grabber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the other Riders, the Pale Rider is fairly fragile for its cost, and likely to be destroyed quickly if directly targeted. However, the Rider is full of tricks and options to keep that from happening. Also like all the Riders, the Pale Rider has a complex adjustable Ability that you can use to give the Pale Rider different abilities depending on your need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pale Rider is a Guild model and offers a lot of mobility to the usually-slow Guild, but it also has significant synergy with Leveticus. You're most likely to see the Pale Rider with either C. Hoffman or Leveticus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C. Hoffman can benefit from the Pale Rider's fast movement with his Drawn to Metal ability, and can boost the Pale Rider with healing, Reactivations, or just using its attacks with Machine Puppet. The Pale Rider is one of the three most likely models for carrying Hoffman around (alongside the Peacemaker and the Mechanical Rider.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leveticus doesn't have a lot of synergy with the Pale Rider as a Master, but the Pale Rider usually operates solo anyway, and Avatar Leveticus gets significant benefit from having the Pale Rider in play. Avatar Leveticus can also summon the Pale Rider after Manifesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other Guild Masters may benefit from the Pale Rider's speed, since many Guild models are quite slow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
