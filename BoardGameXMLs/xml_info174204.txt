			<description>You have worked out the calculations, perfected the runes and the glyphs, and have timed your ritual to the minute in order for it to coincide with a series of stellar alignments. When completed, the ritual will bring you your wildest dreams and heart&amp;rsquo;s desires. All that is left is to gather the components needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem is you aren't the only one planning to make use of the stellar alignment. Local merchants have had a run on the components you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cast the ritual is a 2-5 player card game where each player takes on the role of a different style of magic-user. The players work through the 3 nights that coincide with the stellar alignment. Each night they struggle to acquire the components they need (by collecting cards) in order to be the first to perform the ritual and harness the energy of the alignment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have what it takes to be the first to cast the spell? Will you steal, attack, and pick through the trash to get what you need? At the end of the 3rd day if you've cast the most spells you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;- Character Cards, with unique abilities&lt;br/&gt;- Ritual Component Cards&lt;br/&gt;- Component/Spell Cards&lt;br/&gt;- Actions Cards&lt;br/&gt;- Specialty Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turns consist of players either playing cards, drawing cards, organize their hand of cards, using their character's special ability, or completing the objective (performing the ritual).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
