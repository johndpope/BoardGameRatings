							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mr. Karoshi</name>
									
			<description>We've been taught we need to survive. We need to reach the end, save the princess and be the hero. That's all well and good, but it's getting boring. Who says it has to be this way?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr Karoshi is an overworked Japanese salaryman who&amp;rsquo;s had enough and his only goal is to end it all. You control him to work through the fast logic puzzles trying to find hilarious ways to his demise in this highly original, puzzle, platformer with a twist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not as easy as it sounds!! You need to think cleverly and sometimes &amp;lsquo;outside the box&amp;rsquo; to find a solution. Forget everything you know so far!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
