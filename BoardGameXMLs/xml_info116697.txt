							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Curious George</name>
									
			<description>Curious George is a 2006 video game published by Namco Bandai Games, and developed by Monkey Bar Games, a division of Vicious Cycle Software. The game was also published under Universal Pictures because of Universal Studio's work on the animated movie. It was released for the Nintendo GameCube, Game Boy Advance, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and PC, and is based on the 2006 film of the same name. Plans for a Nintendo DS version were canceled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game used cel-shaded graphics, which did not aid in the constant problems with the camera angles and occasionally difficult dark areas. Most of the animated film's original voices were not used in any of the in-game dialogue (However Frank Welker reprised his role as George).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Curious George (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From back of box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore, solve puzzles, tackle rhythm challenges and above all, make mischief -- all in reactive 3D environments&lt;br/&gt;    Meet and greet your favorite characters from the movie, with in-game cut scenes crafted from actual film footage&lt;br/&gt;    Unlock special mini-games, film clips, movie tunes, and other bonus content&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
