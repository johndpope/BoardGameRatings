			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gull, the largest city on the island of Phoron. The Chamber of Commerce, in the vain attempt to shed the terrible image created by the city's nickname, City of Terrors, bids you ignore the painted barbarians lurking in the Jungles surrounding the city. They ask you to forget about the annual pirate raids, and the criminal gangs running cutthroat theft and smuggling rings. You needn't even worry about the horror to the north despoiling Elven Tombs. Gull is a nice town, honest. If you wanted nice, you would have stayed home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gull and it's environs are once again at their best in this collection of five interlocked adventures. Some of them in their original form, appeared in Sorcerer's Apprentice magazine while the others are original or previously unavailable material written by Michael A. Stackpole, author of the popular CITY OF TERRORS solitaire. The illustrations by Liz Danforth, including the cover, are previously unpublished or were available in limited quantities through small print run publications. This signed &amp;amp; numbered collector's edition is being printed in a limited edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gull's back, and so's the old gang who brought it to you originally. If you've had your shots, and your passport's in order, the City of Terrors will once again do it's best to live up to its name and provide you all the adventure you can handle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
