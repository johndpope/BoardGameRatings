							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Centaurian (Cavalier Archetype)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those who have spent significant time with centaurs know them as brutal but efficient hunters who are fiercely loyal to their family unit and tribe. Their speed and strength are coveted by the weaker humanoid races, and some have taken to studying them in hopes of harnessing that strength. While few centaur tribes will accept an outsider, those that are able to convince the tribe of their worth get the opportunity to learn much about the way that centaurs hunt and fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
