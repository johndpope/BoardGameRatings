							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Keeping Counsel</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The people of the Queendom do not think of themselves as one blood; only now, under her sagacious rule, they put aside their feuds. Through conquest, diplomacy, and spell-craft, your liege has united ancient foes: the far-riders of the veld, the pike-women of the crags, the merchant-lords of the Three Jeweled Cities. They do not love one another, but they respect the queen&amp;mdash;or fear her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have an Office within her court&amp;mdash;and with that title comes both Duties and Rights. Your liege will keep your counsel, for those seated around her are her trusted viziers; you may lead her into majesty or madness&amp;mdash;but there can never be an easy, perfect peace. You must balance the Favor of the people, the Will of the gods, and the Demands of neighbor-states eager to seize mastery over all that your liege has built.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
