			<description>In this game, each player starts with a set of 12 hero cards, numbered 1-12. The main deck of monsters is played one at a time, and each monster has a value (a few are even negative). Players then each play a hero card, and the high card kills the monster, and the player gets points equal to the value of the monster. If there is a tie, the highest non-tied character wins, so the winner when heroes rated 9,9,5,and 4 are played is the player who played the 5). At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
