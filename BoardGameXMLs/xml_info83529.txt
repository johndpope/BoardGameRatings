			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GodFinger is a Apple OS game developed by Wonderland Software. The player takes the role of a god in control of their own planet. The goal of the game is to level up your powers by building structures and cultivating your planet&amp;rsquo;s civilization. There are a number of wonders available for the player to use that can either aid or hinder a civilization&amp;rsquo;s growth. Converting followers to your religion or building structures will earn gold which can unlock additional features. Friends&amp;rsquo; worlds can be added to your galaxy to allow interaction between players online as well. The game emphasizes micro-transactions, as there is a limited ability to perform actions in a short period of time. Additional resources can be purchased to complete extra actions using real currency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
