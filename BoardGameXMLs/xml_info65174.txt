			<description>From the cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The only dead end here, my dear Gwen, is theirs.&amp;rdquo; Reginald smiled at the rogue and pulled out a small golden disk as he stepped forward. Without giving the vampires a chance to react he flourished the disk, a small piece of pyrite, which flashed in the dim torchlight. The corridor brightened as a beam of golden light speared down the corridor. Screams rose from the throats of the five vampires and were suddenly cut short. As the light faded, a fine mist of dust floated in the air where the vampires once stood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well I think we&amp;rsquo;ve brightened their day,&amp;rdquo; Reginald quipped. &amp;ldquo;Shall we continue our little expedition?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholars and wizards of great renown have proven that the gems and minerals that make up the very heart of the world hold untapped power. Each mineral, they have shown, holds a natural magic within its crystalline structure waiting to be unlocked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mineral Magic: Volume Two is a short book with 36 new magic items, which can be made from 31 commonly found gems and minerals, including the powerful Immortality Stone, the versatile Totem Amber, and the Barrier Gems which are made from different varieties of garnets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mineral Magic: Volume Two contains detailed descriptions of all 36 new magical minerals along with the necessary rules for creating and selling them to your players. Also included are 2 new feats that will allow your players to harness their own magical minerals, and detailed tables allowing you to add these magic items into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
