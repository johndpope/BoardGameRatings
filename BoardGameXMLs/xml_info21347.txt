			<description>Applying Biblical Principles to Everyday Situations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You wanted a stereo CD player for your birthday, and made sure that your grandparents knew it. They've given you an encyclopedia program for the family computer instead. What will you say to them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A student in charge of lunch tickets has given you too many tickets for the money you gave him. What will you do with the extra tickets?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't like the clothes your mom buys for you. You prefer denim and T-shirts. What will you tell her?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Making the right choice can be tough. But with the help of Kid's Choices, learning to make the best decisions becomes exciting entertainment!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab your family or your friends (or both!) and get ready to come face to face with some of life's toughest decisions, including those involving friendship, forgiveness and obedience. Learn how to base all your decision making on biblical principles (twenty in all, supported by several verses from the popular NIV&amp;reg; translation of the Bible).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for Ages 6 - 12, The New Kid's Choices is great game play for three to six players, and can also be played in teams. Includes colorful game board, six player markers, 150 dilemma cards, 10 principle cards and an instruction/reference booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
