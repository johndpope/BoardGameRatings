							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of Hens and Chickens</name>
									
			<description>Hens and Chickens consists of 49 cards, an indicator, and numbered counters.  The counters are made up of tiny thick square pieces of paper which are marked with the numbers 1,2,3,5, or 10.  The cards comprise of five different types of images.  &lt;br/&gt;There is one card displaying the image of Uncle Ned and one card displaying the image of a Fox.  Then there are 8 Egg cards, 25 Chick cards, and 14 Hen cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins by placing the Uncle Ned card in the center of all the players.  Next, an appointed dealer will shuffle and equally distribute the other cards, including the fox card, to all the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are stacked face up in front of each player.  The counters are also equally distributed to the players based on their amounts.  Each player should have the same number of cards and equal value of &amp;lsquo;counters&amp;rsquo;.  Players then each place the amount of 10 in counters on Uncle Ned.  He is considered the score-keeper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player spins the indicator and adds the total pointed by both arrows.  If this number is found on the player&amp;rsquo;s top card, he takes the value of 5 in counters from Uncle Ned.  If the number spun does not appear on the player&amp;rsquo;s card, he gives the value of 2 in counters to Uncle Ned. The card is turned over.&lt;br/&gt;The next player then spins, but adds his total to the previous player&amp;rsquo;s total spin, wrapping around at the number 15.  &lt;br/&gt;The winner of the game is the player with the most points/counter values after all cards have been used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
