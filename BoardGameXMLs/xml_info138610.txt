							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Guild Austringer</name>
									
			<description>From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He's a guy with a bird. How scary can that be? The answer, apparently, is &amp;quot;very scary.&amp;quot; With a very long range and the ability to ignore Line of Sight, the Austringer has quickly become a premier Guild Minion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Austringer has an average 4&amp;quot; Walk, cannot Charge and beyond Quick Retreat (see below), has no other way of enhancing his own mobility. Fortunately, after the Austringer finds a nice piece of terrain to hide in, his long reach means he'll rarely needs to move anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Austringer is armed with a Raptor - a Range 12 weapon that ignores cover modifiers and Line of Sight. This means you can sit behind a huge piece of blocking terrain and still attack up to 12&amp;quot; away, ignoring any negative flips from cover that your opponent is trying to use to avoid getting hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Austringer has little direct synergy with any one Master. The closest is Lucius (a Henchman), but in any case, he still makes for a good choice in your average Guild crew, regardless of who's leading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
