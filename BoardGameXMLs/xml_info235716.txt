							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido: Hitoshi</name>
									
			<description>A seasoned veteran of many conflicts and a loyal servant of the Ito clan. On the battlefield Hitoshi skilfully wields the sasumata to immobilise his enemies, pinning them to the spot after knocking them from their feet with a deft spin of his pole arm, enabling his comrades to close and finish them with little difficulty. Although the Ito clan were laughed at by other clans for their development and implementation of the sasumata, now in open war many are made to reconsider their opinions as the effectiveness of this unusual weapon cannot be denied. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
