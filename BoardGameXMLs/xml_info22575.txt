			<description>Players attempt to build 3 specific robots by trading for certain robot parts. As parts become scarce, trading becomes more intense. A wrench is thrown into the mix. The player in charge of the wrench decides how many parts will be traded. He also uses the wrench to determine turn order. The first person to build their robots first, wins. Don't forget to do the &amp;quot;Robot&amp;quot; dance when your robot is complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
