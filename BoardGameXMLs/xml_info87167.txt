			<description>The year is 5777. 3,000 years ago the scientists thought that the Sun was going to explode. Therefore the humanity had to leave Earth, looking for a hospitable planet. Four different empires were created and they forgot the solar system and the planet where the humanity evolved. Now, 3,000 years later, the scientists have discovered that the  solar system still survives. Each of the four empires decide to conquer the cradle of humanity for itself... a space conflict is about to erupt!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kosmojet is an educational game on the Solar System and for developing memory and dexterity skills. Each player represents one empire and must reconquer the Solar System planet by planet by means of a classical memory-style competition as well as some dexterity matches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
