							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Benny Goodman Swings into a Game of Musical Information</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Benny Goodman Swings into a Game of Musical Information&amp;quot; is a Benny-Goodman-endorsed game which includes an 8-note metal xylophone with a wooden mallet, which is used for a music-guessing portion of the game, similar to Name That Tune.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player acts as a &amp;quot;Music Professor&amp;quot; (a sort of host for the game), while the other players are his students.  The students are quizzed on their knowledge of popular songs and classical music.  Challenges include straight question-and-answer trivia, guessing songs from their chorus, and guessing songs which the professor plays on the xylophone.  The player with the highest score, based on number of correct answers, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
