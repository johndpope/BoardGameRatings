			<description>Card game from company Trixeso.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game:&lt;br/&gt;To get the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;Cards are triangle shaped with pictures from movies with actors and from animations. Each player is dealt five cards and they start working together to build a pyramid 17 cards each side.&lt;br/&gt;They must start from top and top card will not give points by itself.&lt;br/&gt;When each row is finished 2-17 in three possible ways (triangle) then points is given. The one who placed the last card into that row will get points. 1 point for each card in the row (possible to make many row at once). 2 points for each one sex actor (male or female will give 2 points each, the one sex who is less than other). If sexes are equal, then both score 2 points each. 3 point for each animation, if at least 3 different are in the row and 5 points for the same card (3 of each in the deck). If every card is placed then the one with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
