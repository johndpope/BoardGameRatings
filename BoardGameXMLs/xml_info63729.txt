			<description>The main game is played in teams of two. Each player of a team gets 18 (black and white) photos of people. One player puts them in an order. The other player has to copy the order by asking questions. The team which manages to copy the order with less questions is the winning team. &lt;br/&gt;Two other game variants are also described in the rule book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
