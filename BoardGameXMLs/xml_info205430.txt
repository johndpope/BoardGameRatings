			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fair is here and it's time to nosh on all your favorite treats! Unfortunately, you have only so much allowance to go around and you're not the only kid with a sweet tooth...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Nosh, players bid their limited allowance on groups of treats available at each day of the fair. Everyone has their own secret favorites, and only certain combinations of treats can score each day. To win the game, a player has to carefully time their biggest bids on the treats they like the most and the ones that score the biggest on each day's Nosh cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
