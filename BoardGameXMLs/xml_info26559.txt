			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;An exciting war game set in space for 2 players age 9 - 90.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Dominator is a war between two Battle Fleets for space domination.  Each player commands a fleet which consists of a Flagship and fourteen War Craft.  The object of the game is to manoeuvre the War Craft to capture the opponents Flagship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each Battlefleet there are three types of War Craft, and a Flagship.  These all have different values of mobility and attacking power.  The two players take it in turns to move the pieces anywhere on the playing board in an effort to capture the opponents flagship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The War Craft may be used independently or combined to increase their power.  However, when pieces are combined their mobility is reduced.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
