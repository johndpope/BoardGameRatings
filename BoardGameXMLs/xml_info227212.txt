			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Glory is a deck-building game for 2 players that puts each player in the role of a gladiator school owner in ancient Rome. Each player uses money and influence in order to develop a team of gladiators with the hopes of gaining the most glory in the arenas of Rome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the machinations phase each turn, players acquire new cards to build their decks, and play cards to develop their schools. Card types include gladiators, schemes, tactics, reactions, income,  and assets which are all used in unique ways to help the player's school gain money, influence, combat prowess, and ultimately glory in the arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the arena phase of each turn, gladiators battle for their schools in arenas in a bloody contest where only one side survives. Gladiators have attack, health, and agility stats which determine how much damage they deal, how much punishment they can take, and the order in which they act, respectively. They also each possess a unique ability which can be combined with the abilities of other gladiators to get an edge in combat. Players can also play tactics and reactions from their hands during battles in order to turn the tides in their favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning a battle provides a one-time benefit, an ongoing benefit, and glory, depending on the arena where the battle was fought. The first player to amass ten glory points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
