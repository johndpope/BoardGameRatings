			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TAKE A TRIP ON THE PULP TRAIN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daring Tales of Adventure: Compendium 2 contains four two-fisted pulp adventures set in the 1930's for the award-winning Savage Worlds roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flying high above the cloud layer is a highly advanced flying airfield. It stays there using a variety of advanced engineering and weird science, it hovers undetected allowing the Sky Pirates to swoop on unsuspecting victims! Our heroes are thrust into the middle of this adventure. Once attacked by the Sky Pirates they discover the real reason for the missing ships and planes in Sky Pirates of the Caribbean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Palladium Peril the mission is simple, prevent an ancient but powerful magical statue falling into the hands of the Third Riech. The magical Palladium was once the treasure of Troy and its magic was most evident during the Trojan War. Can the heroes prevent the Palladium falling into the Fuhrer&amp;rsquo;s hands making Berlin almost impregnable?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apep, the demonic serpent of Egyptian mythology, stirs in the Underworld. On the surface world, his mortal minions work tirelessly to ensure the sun will never rise again! When the reporter Valerie Braveheart visits the heroes with a strange story it starts them on a perilous journey taking them from Boston to the dusty streets of Cairo, onto an ancient, trapped tomb deep in the Egyptian desert, and finally into the Underworld itself. The heroes have mere days to complete their quest before mankind is plunged into eternal darkness!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only way to ensure victory over darkness is to prevent Apep from sealing The Twelfth Gate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Christmas shopping break in New York City seems an ideal way to unwind, but the Nazis have other ideas. An attack by flying Nazi stormtroopers leads the heroes on an exciting chase through the streets of the Big Apple as they try to disable remote-controlled bombs, to the glittering lights of Paris and the famous Les Folies-Berg&amp;egrave;res nightclub, into Nazi Germany in search of clues, and finally to the ice-covered wastes of Antarctica on the trail of a secret Nazi base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get into the action and solve the Terror of the Z-Bomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
