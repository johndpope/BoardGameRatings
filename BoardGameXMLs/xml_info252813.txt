			<description>Storm Dragons is a clash of dragons in the realm of Westarland.  Lead your faction of dragons, including Kings, Warlords, Rogues, Conjurors, Slayers and more, to victory against several other dragon factions. Guard your King well or he will fall to assassins. Watch out for magical storms. Only Assassins and Summoners survive them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays in two phases:  In the skirmish phase, each player plays one card against the player to his left and one against the player to his right.  A third card is saved for the battle round.  Plays against your neighbor can result in banished cards, captured cards, and/or cards promoted to the battle phase.  After six rounds of skirmishing, the game moves into the battle phase.  The battle phase is a trick taking game.  Each player only has access to a few of his cards at a time and attempts to win tricks by playing the strongest combination of dragons and storms.  But watch out, many of the dragons have special abilities that alter the play and some have special vulnerabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until one or more players has run out of cards.  The winner is the player who has captured the most points worth of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Storm Dragons is a card game (trick taking) for 3-6 players. One round plays in 10-20 minutes.  For a longer game, play till one player wins three times to determine the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
