							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wild Rumpus</name>
									
			<description>This is a deck of 48 large cards in 4 different colored suits with artwork from Maurice Sendak's &amp;quot;Where the Wild Things Are.&amp;quot; These cards can be used to play 3 different games described on the instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Wild Rumpus is a game for 4 or more. Each player gets an hand of 6 cards. Each turn, each player will pass one card to the player to the left. The first player to end up with a hand of just one color calls &amp;quot;Wild Rumpus&amp;quot; and wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    In Old Jenny, 3-6 players are trying not to get stuck with the card of Max's dog Jenny when the game ends. In each turn, the player will take a card at random from the player on the left. If the player then has a pair of cards, they are played on the table. Once all of the pairs are made, one player will be left with Jenny and loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Steal the Deck is a game for 2-4 players who try to collect the most cards by the time the game ends. Each player gets 4 cards and 4 cards are played face up to the middle of the table. Each player can play a card from the hand that matches one of the cards in the center. this pair is then placed face up in a stack front of the player. Further pairs are placed on the top of this stack. Players can also take another player's stack if a card in the hand matches the top card of the other player's stack. If a player cannot match wither a center card or another player's top stack card, a card must be discarded to the center. Hands are replenished when everyone runs out of cards to play. the game ends when no more plays can be made. The player with the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
