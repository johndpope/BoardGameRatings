							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Options for Swords &amp; Wizardry Complete: Psionics</name>
									
			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This product is written specifically for use with Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry: Complete by Mythmere Games and currently available from Frog God Games. Page references given are for the latest publicly available edition of those rules. With a bit of tweaking this system may also be used any mid-1970's era FRPG or compatible rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psionic ability, or simply &amp;quot;psionics,&amp;quot; denotes the powers of mind. These powers are similar to magic in that they do not obey the natural laws of physics or cause and effect; instead they more closely resemble magic. These rules were envisioned for use with the various man-type races in a typical campaign milieu. It should be noted that, due to its rarity of occurrence, this system for psionics may be extended to any race or character without unbalancing play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user note:&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is available as either a one-up PDF for screen reading or single-sided printing on invoice size paper, or as a two-up PDF formatted for printing a booklet using letter-size paper.  The content of both versions is the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
