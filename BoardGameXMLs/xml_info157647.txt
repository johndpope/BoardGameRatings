			<description>from the cover&lt;br/&gt;A mini LARP for 5 to 6 players and 1 GM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;In 1910 the Turnbull family were brutally murdered in their home. The reason why was never discovered, but over the years a number of brutal and increasingly outlandish tales have been told. A tradition has also started amongst students and lovers of ghost stories to stay the night in the abandoned &amp;ldquo;Turnbull House&amp;rdquo; on the night that the murders happened, Oct 16th.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the 100 year anniversary and the group who spend the night here this year will get more than they bargained for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Did you hear the one...? is a game about ghost stories and their aftermath. In this game a group of players will experience first-hand what happens when lies about events stop the dead from resting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
