			<description>User Summary: The third edition of the rules for the Lorien Trust Role-Playing system (known ubiquitously as &amp;quot;Rules 3&amp;quot;) contain everything a starting player needs to know. However, there is no discussion of the setting that is used in Lorien Trust games, other than in general terms where the setting affects the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The document is laid out in order of importance of information (contrasting with earlier editions that began with character creation):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Initial introduction, FAQ, and notes on event logistics.&lt;br/&gt;     Overarching rules, including identifying staff members by role, and the safety calls that are used during events.&lt;br/&gt;     Universal rules, including the combat system, the damage system, and the spell system.&lt;br/&gt;     Character logistics, which discusses various additional rules that a player needs to be aware of during play.&lt;br/&gt;     Character creation, which is left as an appendix since these rules are generally only needed in downtime between games.&lt;br/&gt;     Additional appendices that include reference tables and a glossary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat system uses foam and latex weapons with a solid core for m&amp;ecirc;l&amp;eacute;e weapons (or no core for claws and thrown weapons). Combat is intended to run at a safe speed, with clear weapon swings and damage calls, pulled blows, and no hitting with the point of a weapon (all for safety reasons). Projectile weapons such as bows and crossbows are allowed, with various additional safety constraints. Armour can be constructed of various materials including metal, so long as it is not a hazard to any player. Physical contact is not allowed except through the application of a weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The magic system uses power cards to perform spells (with higher level spells requiring more cards to cast). Players receive a number of cards per day based on their Character Skills. Power cards are valid only individual days, so cannot be stockpiled. They are transferable between spell lists though, so a character that has access to both the Healing and Incantation spell lists (for example) can use their power cards for any one day on any combination of spells from both of those lists. All spells have clear verbal components so that nearby players can react accordingly (somatic components are very limited and there are no physical components).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lore system uses sets of three digit codes to label particular identifiable items. Certain Character Skills will provide a player with a loresheet that translates these codes into meaningful information. Lore codes change each year, and loresheets are out-of-character conveniences that should not be proliferated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are created by spending a fixed number of points on a list of Character Skills (CS) that allow one to perform various actions. The number of CS points is fixed and does not increase with experience, so that one character cannot do all things; this encourages co-operation between players. Instead character development is achieved through a separate system of supplemental Occupational Skills (detailed in a different rulebook).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no advantages or disadvantages between the basic races that a starting character can select.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
