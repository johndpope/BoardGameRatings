							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darwin&#039;s Children: The Gallusians</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the sixth issue of Going Postal, a series of supplements for the Mutant Future role-playing game by Goblinoid Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gallusians are bipedal humanoid descendants of a genetically altered strain of poultry created prior to the Apocalypse.  The original stock had been altered to increase the size and mass of the poultry for greater food generation.  The labs and farms where the stock was maintained were located in more rural areas and several flocks survived and quickly evolved into their current form.  The genetic manipulation was amplified the low doses of radiation causing the Gallusians to become more intelligent and nearly human level sentience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement includes both the monster stat block as well as the player character description.  New weapons used solely by the Gallusians including the Blunderbuss and black powder bombs are listed and three new monsters. All for only 99 cents.  The PDF has been set up with individual layers for page backgrounds which can be turned off for ease of printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
