			<description>This game deals with careers in professional life. First the education and after a while earning money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is done on a board with 4 rings at 24 spaces each. Players begin on the out-most ring, where education costs nothing. When moving to the inner rings, players choose a profession and start to earn money. It's possible to choose a profession, where you don't have all required qualifications, but you take the risk of loosing that job during an inspection. Further education, money investments and other things are still possible on the 3 inner rings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner is the richest player after a previously agreed playing time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
