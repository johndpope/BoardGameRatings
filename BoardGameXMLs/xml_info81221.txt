			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are looking for an innovative, groundbreaking, revolutionary roleplaying game that will lead a paradigm shift in the hobby, this is not it. For experienced roleplayers, there is nothing new, not a single original idea, presented in Toaster that cannot be found elsewhere. Rather, Toaster is just an exercise in creating a straightforward roleplaying system that has enough flexibility to be used in a wide range of campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why Toaster?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That humble household appliance, the toaster, is a good model for simplicity of concept and design. Toasters have one basic function, a simple user-interface, and so long as you don't try to shove anything too large in it, they are generally very reliable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toaster is also a humble roleplaying game built around a few basic concepts and mechanics, using simple math and die rolling, and it can handle most genres and settings with no difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a toaster, you can cook bread, breakfast pastries, frozen waffles, English muffins, or perhaps even bagels. Toasters work great for all these applications, but do not try to bake a cake with one. Likewise, this game is not specific to any genre, so you can use it in a wide variety of campaigns, but it will not work for every setting or every style of roleplaying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules in Toaster are designed to give Players a sketch of the system and how it might be applied in a variety of circumstances. However, many of the details have been made vague or left out completely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
