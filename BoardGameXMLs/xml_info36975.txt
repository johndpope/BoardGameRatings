							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ATS Warfighting Guide #2</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ATS Warfighting Guide #2 contains 52 pages of ATS material aimed at making the ATSer a system expert. Included in the new issue is George Anderson's ATS Robot, a card-based system for playing ANY ATS scenario solo with a random generation of actions by the 'enemy'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ATS Robot includes a set of over 50 cards (provided on cardstock for you to trim out) for use with George's solo rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included in the issue are the first installment of Drew Dorman's 'ATS Set Ups', suggested set up data for all six D-Day Ranger scenarios. You can set up either side Drew's way, then use the ATS Robot to hammer it out. Alone. Just like you like it! What's more, Drew uses the D-Day Rangers NEW Edition scenarios, which also happen to be included in the issue as a FREE bonus!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FREE bonus approach continues...with a strip of funky new ATS leader counters bundled with EACH copy of ATS Warfighting Guide #2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So this is it. And this is NO DRILL. The expert ATSer needs his warfighting, and he (or she) needs it now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
