			<description>The game board depicts a city map. Each player has a plastic truck which can hold up to four goods (plastic cubes). There are also mission tiles which either ask the player to pick up pieces or to deliver them.&lt;br/&gt; On a turn, a player rolls a die and moves his/her truck forward the corresponding number of fields. When a truck reaches a building, the player can load or unload goods. There is no 1 on the die, but a stop symbol. A player who rolls this symbol can move the stop sign to any street field, thus blocking the street for all trucks. Trucks can also block each other. The goal of the game is to be the first player to deliver 11 goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
