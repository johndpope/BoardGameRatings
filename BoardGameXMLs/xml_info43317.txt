			<description>The game of  Bible Trav-E-Log by ZONDERVAN PUBLISHING of Grand Rapids, Michigan is played by 2, 3, or 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with &amp;quot;Quiz Strips&amp;quot; which have questions on them. Players begin with a pawn on the square called &amp;quot;THE BEGINNING&amp;quot; on the trail of the CHART,  with the object being to get one's pawn to &amp;quot;JOURNEYS END&amp;quot; by answering questions correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The directions state that  &amp;quot;this is an exciting contest which will afford hours of pleasant entertainment and a wealth of Bible knowledge&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a question is answered correctly the question sheet is turned over showing a number. A correct answer has a value of one more than the number showing on the card. If the question is not answered correctly the player still scores the value of the number. The game rewards the &amp;quot;Bible student&amp;quot; but permits the uninformed to enjoy the game. &amp;quot;You learn as you play.&amp;quot; The first to reach the 'JOURNEYS END' by exact count wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
