							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Snood 2: On Vacation</name>
									
			<description>Back of the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome back to Snood with a brand new style and super exciting gameplay. Same old friends with new twists that are great fun for the whole family! Snood turned sideways provides a new challenge to this classic puzzle game. In Snood Grab, use a grappling hook to pull a Snood back to Snood central and launch it again to match up with two others in this strategic mode of play. Test your skills with Snood Ball. Watch out, since there's no straight sides to bounce off. Just when you think you have the game beat, your sphere of Snoods increases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
