							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Venture</name>
									
			<description>Dark Venture is a card game where players construct a twisting narrative to explore a dystopian future with unique heroes, completing quests to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From writings found on the deceased body of the hero, Torgon the Hunter: &amp;quot;We are the new rulers of the Earth and this is our struggle against one another. We venture into the darkness, the uncertainty, ambling through the ruins of progress every day. We live the repercussions of the events that spun civilization backwards while propelling the remaining inhabitants forwards along various inconceivable and diverse refractions. The world has unquestionably become a new, peculiar and merciless place.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose a hero, roll to select a quest and begin to explore. The map that they explore is created by playing location cards. When locations are played they trigger game events. The first hero to complete a quest wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has a set-up time of about 15 minutes and a play session can last anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
