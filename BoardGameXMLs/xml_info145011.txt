							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DexQuest</name>
									
			<description>DexQuest is a fast and fun fantasy adventure dexterity game that offers total control for all ages and abilities by using a roller launcher and carefully weighted balls that are whizzed down forest, river and mountain steps to control movement on a map showing the Kingdom of Chance. Think Tumblin' Dice spliced with a very simple Runebound and you're still nowhere near!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenges can be found on the map which are played out on the 4-step system. Magic duels use the same step system but see a different player roll for the 'monster' each time meaning you never know how tough they will really be. Players aim for zones on the steps to score different magic 'hits'. Spell challenges see the player aim for 6 sections of the 3 main steps that form a combo to actually make the spell. Boss challenges have players aiming their DexBalls through the mouths of scary Snozzgobblers and Lurks (standees added to steps by opponents) so make sure you practice those rolls to get better. A scaling difficulty level allows new players to have more rolls and still enjoy the game.&lt;br/&gt;Upgrades are bought with gold, allowing re-rolls, teleportation, magic boosts, gold boosts, etc. Collect gold, choose from 10 cool upgrades and get the Happy Juice back in time for the festival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story:&lt;br/&gt;Those mischevious Snozzgobblers have stolen the last bottle of happy juice from the village of Chance. Leader of the Widgets, Mayor Yakwaffle, has ordered trainee magicians Noggin, Noodle, Schminka and Belch to find the Snozzgobblers' cave and return with the magical brew before the Festival of Starlight in seven days.&lt;br/&gt;     This adventure will test both stamina and dexterity, as our four little heroes must use rather unreliable wooden cages called DexBalls to travel the forests, rivers and mountains of Chance while defeating Lurts and 'Gobblers who sneak in the shadows. Our four heroes must roll at speed, collecting gold for magical upgrades while improving spells faster by successfully completing challenges as they search desperately for the last known bottle of elixir.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will be self published by Solway Games, launched at the UK Game Expo 2017. There will be two versions of the game: Travel and Ultimate - the first in a sub-A4 box and the latter in a much larger A3 format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
