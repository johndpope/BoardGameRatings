							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Armory (RMSS/RMFRP)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ERA (Electronic Roleplaying Assistant) is the ultimate companion for Rolemaster campaigns. Using ERA players can create their characters using a step by step wizard, then level them up and configure all details in stats, skills and special abilities, even overriding the automatic calculations. Afterwards, they can be added to a running campaign in the adventuring module. From there, the game master can control all aspects of the game: resolve maneuvers, resistances, resting, and of course, spell casting and combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With ERA you can create Rolemaster characters and then manage their adventures. Players can also monitor their characters from their mobile devices as the action progresses. But no adventure is complete without some gritty combat. Blows must be dealt, and damage resolved. In the free base ERA product you will find 2 sample weapons and 3 critical tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reality bites. Get The Armory for ERA!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a simple broadsword no longer cuts it, and the old mace no longer krushes it, the time has come for a different set of tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this package you get the 54 weapon attack tables in The Armory supplement for Rolemaster, along with the 7 critical tables required for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before they get close enough, throw Shurikens, Boomerangs or your own Nodwick henchman. From behind the front lines, use a Military Fork or Man Catcher. And when things get close and personal, switch to the offense with a deadly Katana, or go defensive with a Sai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ERA is compatible with Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
