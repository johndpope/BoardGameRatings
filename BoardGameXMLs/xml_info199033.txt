							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aether Captains: Fleet of Doom</name>
									
			<description>Fleet of Doom is the 2nd expansion of Aether Captains and is not a standalone game. This expansion includes new components for the War-Captains. It adds the triple dice-ships for the War-Captains along with new rules and strategies.  The triple dice-ships are quite similar to the Navy Commander&amp;rsquo;s ones but are also equipped with new abilties and Action cards. The War-Captains fleet will be enpowered however there is a flow. These ships are part of more than one dice therefore a War-Captain can choose just one of those ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the same time you will discover the new powers of the Action cards as well as the new Crew Members. Additionally new Objectives will turn the game into a challenge for those who join the enemy&amp;rsquo;s forces. The new Objectives offer different missions and targets for the War-Captains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
