							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Harvest: The Legacy of Frankenstein</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What if Frankenstein got it right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What if Victor Frankenstein had embraced his discoveries rather than seeking to destroy them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rejected by his peers and his family, hunted by the Creature, Victor slips into the background of history. Manipulating people, events, whole countries, Frankenstein slowly plans and executes his revenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carved out of the Balkan conflicts of the mid-1800&amp;rsquo;s, Victor Frankenstein hijacks the unification of Romania and creates his own country: Promethea. Established on high ideals of equality and scientific advancement for the good of all, the reality is very different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creating Promethea saw Victor make deals that compromised the integrity of his vision. Almost literally walled off from the rest of Europe, Promethea is a nightmare where the rich elite feed off the beauty and strength of the poor. While incredible advances across all scientific disciplines promise a bright future, the land is blighted by a new feudal regime - the Harvest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even as Frankenstein moves to bring Promethea in line with his original vision, so he is stalked by the Creature. Seeking to destroy all his creator&amp;rsquo;s works, the Creature and the resistance movement he leads often find they share Frankenstein&amp;rsquo;s goals. Both Victor and the Creature know that Frankenstein&amp;rsquo;s gift must never escape the fortified borders of Promethea, bringing the dark harvest to all the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Harvest: Legacy of Frankenstein is a detailed, fascinating game setting, a terrifyingly plausible alternative history and a fiction anthology; a gothic horror fantasy that will appeal to gamers and the general public alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A standalone product, Dark Harvest: Legacy of Frankenstein uses a version of the Heresy Engine system and is fully compatible with the Victoriana 2nd Edition, also available from Cubicle 7 Entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
