							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Steal Away Jordan: Stories from America&#039;s Peculiar Institution</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steal Away Jordan is a vehicle for players to tell a collective story of the lives of people who live in the shadow of slavery. The emphasis here is on the people, not the place or time. The institution affects everyone, from the child born into bondage to the man who owns him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steal Away Jordan is a role playing game written in the spirit of neo slave narratives like Margaret Walker's Jubilee, Toni Morrison's Beloved, and Octavia Butler's Kindred. Like these fictional accounts of slave life, players explore the social and psychological implications of life in a society where people can be property. Ultimately, players consider slavery&amp;rsquo;s long-term impact on a society and on the descendants of slaves and slave owners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
