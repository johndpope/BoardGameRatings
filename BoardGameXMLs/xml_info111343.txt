							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">30-ton Ship&#039;s Boat</name>
									
			<description>From Loren Wiseman's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ship's boat is a small vessel ordinarily carried to perform odd jobs and minor operations for a larger ship or deep space installation. This book contains five variants on the same basic design, and includes deckplans (scaled at 1/2&amp;quot; = 1.5 meters) and game ratings for Classic Traveller, MegaTraveller, and GURPS Traveller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the standard, unmodified ship's boat, this book details:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The lifeboat variant, carried by such starships as the Bastien-class subsidized Liner, and equipped with emergency low berths for 48 passengers.&lt;br/&gt;    The System Transport variant, used for short trips within a star system.&lt;br/&gt;    The VIP variant, used to convey nobles, executives, or high government officials in comfort and style.&lt;br/&gt;    The ramshackle Belter variant, used for deep space prospecting among the planetoid belts of hundreds of star systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
