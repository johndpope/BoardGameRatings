			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in defined stages, with players assuming different roles in each stage, or phase.  Event cards are used to generate random events during play (examples are presented in the document, but a complete set would have to be created prior to play) and a simple die roll is used to resolve certain situations.  Typically, however, the game entirely is narrative and resolution is attempted through voting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
