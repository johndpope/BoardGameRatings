							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fate Codex (Vol 3, Issue 4 - Sep 2016)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fate Codex is a mostly-monthly e-zine featuring Quick Start Adventures and more for the Fate roleplaying system. The project, funded through Patreon, grows and swells as more patrons support our work. We've been lucky to have lots of folks pledge, and we're now entering our third year of production!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our backers have enabled us to not only hire great authors, but also to include great art in every issue. Issue 4 of Volume 3 features Robert Crum, Mike Mumah, Manuela Soriani, and Juan Ochoa! There's some great work in this piece and over 10,000 words of awesome Fate content, ready to be thrown into your next game of Fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now we're bringing this content to you on DriveThruRPG, so you can find and download your issues easily. Since every title is saved to your library on the site, you'll always have The Fate Codex right at hand when you need it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this fourth issue of Volume 3, we've got:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A new building block from Fate Codex favorite Andr&amp;eacute; La Roche, The Arch, about an alien gateway that pulls technology from strange dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;    An essay from Mark Diaz Truman on adding Apocalypse World-style MC Moves to Fate, Gamemaster Moves.&lt;br/&gt;    A systems piece from June Shores, Setting the Stakes, that shows you how to use variable conditions to create drama at your table.&lt;br/&gt;    A new Quick Start from Andrew Tuttle, Time of the Horsemen, in which the end of the world is just the beginning... and the Riders loom large. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
