			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tombs &amp;amp; Treasure (Taiyou no Shinden Asteka II  in Japan) is an adventure game originally developed by Nihon Falcom in 1987 for the PC-8801, PC-9801, FM-7, and X1 Japanese systems. An English-language NES  version, published by Infocom in 1989, was altered to be more story-based, and featured new music and role-playing elements. Japanese enhanced remakes were released for the Saturn  and Windows systems in 1998 and 1999, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in the ancient Mayan city of Chichen Itza on the Yucat&amp;aacute;n Peninsula. It alternates between using a three-quarters overhead view for travelling from ruin to ruin, and switching to a first-person perspective upon entering a specific location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, the player is allowed to name both the protagonist, a young brown-haired man, and the lead female, a green-haired lass who is the daughter of one Professor Imes; if no names are manually entered, the game will randomly choose from a pre-coded list of names for both characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Imes is a renowned archaeologist who has been investigating an artifact known as the Sun Key, which potentially has the ability to unlock the greatest secrets of the lost Mayan civilization, and is rumored to be housed somewhere within Chichen Itza. However, on his latest expedition, he and his team mysteriously disappeared while exploring different temples between the dates of June 22 and July 14; only his guide, Jos&amp;eacute;, was able to escape unharmed and return with some artifacts that the team found, hoping they will help the player in his quest to find the professor. The three, after talking with the professor's secretary Anne, travel to Mexico and into the ancient city to look for clues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several actual sites of Chichen Itza are explored by the player, although their interiors and purposes are purposefully changed slightly in order to help create an atmosphere of fantasy and mystery-solving intrigue. Furthermore, each ruin is home to a demon that is said to be under the control of a creature known only as Tentacula, although this is only speculation that is gathered from the professor's notes and what Jos&amp;eacute; has to say to the player at the start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
