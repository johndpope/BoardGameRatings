			<description>With Border Bed, instead of having the bed completely stolen by your partner during night, you will play bed space through series of questions and actions. The most successful player will enjoy more bed space - to the detriment of the other - for the following night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning, the bed is equally split on the &amp;ldquo;bed space&amp;rdquo; tracker. Then, each player moves one after the other on a simple board using a D6. Depending on where the player ends up, he or she will need to either answer a question or perform an action - on a successful answer, he/she will gain 5 cm on the bed (the other losing an equal amount) and will be allow to play again.&lt;br/&gt;A few squares on the board have extra bonuses/maluses beside the basic question or action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions are taken from a trivial pursuit style deck, with 5 categories: sport/entertainement/musik, general knowledge, day-to-day life, erotism/sexuality, and &amp;ldquo;personal&amp;rdquo;. The last one typically consist of question asking you to know something about your partner - favorite dish, name of first pet and more personal things. Actions come from an action card deck. They usually involves some personal things - kissing your partner for more than 10s, doing a massage and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one of the player arrives at the last position on the board. The loser - player who is going to have less space on the bed - can still decide to perform a few extra actions to regain a bit of space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
