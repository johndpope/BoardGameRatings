			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;acute;s no room for error when travelling a the speed of light, racing through star systems in a desperate search for a new world to house Mankind. But there are plenty of oportunities for mistakes. Alien races of every conceivable size, shape, temperament and sophistification seek to aid, use, corrupt or destroy you - and you don&amp;acute;t know which.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sure, your starship is 15,000 feet long and armed with remote-controlled fightercraft, kamikaze fighters, a devasting plasma gun and high-tech probes, but will all that firepower be enough against The Stentor, ruthless time-traveling space pirates, or the colossal energy beings known as The ZOR?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps diplomacy is the answer. The Ciscibeo are vain and arrogant - perhaps that ego can be worked to your advantage. The Broodmaster are sinister, manipulative and seek universal domination, but are they a little too eager?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps something can be gained from shrewd trading. But that will be though against the ever-seeking, ever-hungry Collectors, keepers of the Museum of Time; not to mention the supra-intelligent Jot, who control the minds of everyone nearby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever choices you make, make them quickly. You&amp;acute;re moving at Hyperspeed - seconds thoughs could be fatal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
