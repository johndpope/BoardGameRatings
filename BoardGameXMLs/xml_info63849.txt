							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bugami</name>
									
			<description>In this Hearts-type game the penalty-suit is not fixed, but every player chooses one for himself. Bugami is played with a standard deck of cards, but every player needs one card from each suit additionally. Everybody selects one of those before play (but after deal), simulaneously.  Then tricks are played, and each player tries to avoid taking cards from the suit he has chosen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
