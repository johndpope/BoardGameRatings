			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a one round Living Jungle adventure for low/mid level heroes. In this adventure the heroes must aid a lacerial priest in her quest to locate an artifact in the far off Forbidden Mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs are summoned to the village of the lacerials, located along the River of Laughing Idols. There they meet the lacerial shaman, Starr. He claims he has had a vision, and he must travel to the Forbidden Mountains and recover the Sound of Silence, which will end the earthshakes that have been plaguing Malatra. His vision has said that he must travel with six strangers to this mountain, there to recover this elusive and unnamed sound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
