			<description>user summary in English&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do You Dare Brave The Deep?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When delvers talk about the strange places they have seen in the caverns of Trollworld, there are occasional tales of a great Fungus Forest. It is said to lie somewhere east of the ruins of Tharothar, and that it is protected from wizards. Wizards claim that it is a myth. No wizard has ever seen it. None ever will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Caverns of Hael&amp;rsquo; is a solo adventure designed for a monster or warrior only &amp;ndash; a big, tough, practical warrior! Common trolls, ogres, minotaurs, and urookin are the recommended kindred for this delve. You may also use a human, dwarf, elf, hobgoblin, or the like, if you really want to, but only warriors ought to show up here, only one at a time, and of no more than 3rd level. This solo was designed to be used with a tough, battle-minded character from the 7th Edition rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note that if you send in an ogre or a smaller sized delver, the adventure will be shorter than for a troll or a bigger sized monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not welcome here are wizards, rogues, specialists (or any spell-slingers for that matter); neither are powerful mountain trolls, wolf trolls, or giants (basically anything with more than a x3 STR modifier); nor faeries, harpies, or basically anything that can fly, as any of these would have an advantage that might spoil your enjoyment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
