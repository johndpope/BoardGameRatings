			<description>Object: To claim opponent&amp;rsquo;s cards by determining the number of a given card in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn a card will be turned face up and each player will announce how many cards in their hand can be divided evenly into it. These cards should be put in separate piles by rank so everyone can see what has been draw through out the game. If a player has no cards that can be evenly divided into it they announce Indivisible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting with the player with the coin and continuing clockwise each player may attempt (but is not required) to guess one other players cards. The need to tell what card they are looking for and how many that player has in their hand. Guessing 0 is not valid. If they are correct in guessing both the rank of the card and how many the guessing player gets that card/s and places them face up in front of them for scoring at the games end. If they are wrong they must discard one card from their hand face up onto the common piles. When a player has no more cards in their hand they may no longer guess and are out until scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full Rules: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.pyromythgames.com/offerings/freegames/indivisible/indivisible.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.pyromythgames.com/offerings/freegames/indivisible...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
