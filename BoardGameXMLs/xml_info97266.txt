			<description>Nightbreed is a 1990 American horror film written and directed by Clive Barker, based on his novella Cabal. Although it was not well received by critics or audiences at the time of its release, over time it developed a cult status.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two videogames based on the film were released shortly after the movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first game released was called &amp;quot;Nightbreed, The Action Game&amp;quot;. This was literally an action type game based on the film. It was released on the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and DOS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second, called &amp;quot;Nightbreed, The Interactive Movie&amp;quot;, was released on the Amiga, Atari ST, and DOS. There was less gameplay involved than in the action game as it was more of an interactive movie. It loosely followed the same plot as the movie and is interspersed with various action game sequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games had been intended to be part of a trilogy. Due to the poor success ratings of both games, the third game was never made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Nightbreed&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE NIGHTMARE HAS BEGUN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take control of Boone as he makes his way through the depths and caverns of the necropolis - to the underground city of Midian where dwell the NIGHTBREED, supernatural creatures who have shielded themselves from the inhumanities of man. Not only must you confront and defeat these creatures, but you must pit yourself against the murderous redneck gang from the nearby above-ground city, and ultimately defeat the insane serial killer known as &amp;quot;The Mask&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AT LAST THE NIGHT HAS A HERO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
