			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a list of 100 different items that could be found in the pocket - or purse, handbag or other bag - of a modern-era person, from roughly the 1980s onwards. Some of the results have multiple options, and some items have rough dates as to when they would start being found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some items may be useful, and the pocket may be one that is picked, or that of a corpse that is rummaged through, following a zombie apocalypse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;74. Pocket Knife (Folding knife, or perhaps a switchblade, possibly of an illegal length or type)&lt;br/&gt;75. Poo Bags (For cleaning up after dogs, either single or in a roll, may be scented)&lt;br/&gt;76. Portable Game System (Such as Game &amp;amp; Watch, which was available from 1980-91, Nintendo Game Boy from 1989-2003, Game Boy Advance from 2001-8, Nintendo DS, and later models, from 2004, PlayStation Portable from 2004-14 and PlayStation Vita from 2011, including game)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
