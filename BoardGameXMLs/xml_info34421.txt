			<description>In this game, players manage stores in New York City.  Stores are established in spaces on the apple-shaped board, and players manage their inventory by holding onto cards representing goods.  These cards are purchased from warehouse spaces and frequently change hands since a player is obliged to purchase a card whenever he or she lands on an opponent's store.  The maximum price which may be charged for an item depends on the number of floors in a store, so players are constantly expanding their outlets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game deals with more than just cash -- every player gets a balance sheet used for tracking bank loans and credit with other players.  Credit limits are determined at the start of the game and affect the length of the game -- a $300 limit is recommended for an hour-long game, while $500 can last two hours or more.  As players reach their credit limits and are unable to pay back their creditors, they go bankrupt and drop out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the normal flow of buying and selling, the game features board spaces and cards that spice up gameplay with random events.  There are also some special transportation spaces (taxis and subways) which allow players a little more control over their movement to add variety to the normal rolling and moving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big Apple obviously draws a lot of inspiration from Monopoly, but it's not just a retheming -- there are enough differences to make it distinct from its more famous predecessor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
