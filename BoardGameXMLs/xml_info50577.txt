			<description>You and your opponents are Pirate Captains looking to assemble crews of scalawags to loot the ships just visible on the horizon. Some ships will belch more Gold than others and it will take a crafty captain to assemble the right crew for the job. High Tides are fortuitous, giving you more options while Low Tides will make times tough for everyone. Keep an eye to skies for Hurricanes as they will foil your plans by sinking all the available Ships and replacing them with a new selection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freelooter is a unique set collecting card game for 2-5 players where the suits are more than just a category, they actually have a function. Your Goal Sets (Ships and Plunder) will be randomly determined every time you play. Freelooter comes with 2 Decks, one Crew Deck containing cards with assigned ranks, colors and suits and a Ship Deck full of Goal Sets to complete for Gold. Be the player to Bury the most Gold and your rival Captains will be left in the flotsam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
