							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tales of Entropy: Final Act</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action drama set in Africa in the style of the 80s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small country of Beneen resides in Central Africa on the coast of the Atlantic. Colonial forces were expelled in the 80s, when Oluwafemi Itri disbanded the government and took the country in his own hands. Since then, reports from the country have been scarce and contradictory. Only images delivered abroad publicly depict the grandiose parades and festivities arranged by the president, with happy and healthy citizens abundantly present. Beneen trades a bit with foreign countries, and there is a black market of sorts present as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
