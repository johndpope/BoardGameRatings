			<description>A game made in England in the 1950's. There is no publisher listed on the game box. It is a very simple roll and move game on a board with a serpentine track that goes from the start (0) to the finish line (100).&lt;br/&gt; A six is needed to start the race and an exact roll is needed to hit the finish line. There are many penalty spaces on the board that will stop you or move you back. there are some bonus spaces which move you ahead or give you an extra die roll.&lt;br/&gt; It comes in a simple cardboard box with the 5 sentence rules glued to the inside top cover lid. The tri-fold board is ~ 16&amp;quot; x 10&amp;quot; when unfolded. There are 4 different colored plastic greyhounds for pawns. A small plastic die tumbler and die are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
