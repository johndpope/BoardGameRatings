							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Her Majesty&#039;s Clockwork Tournament</name>
									
			<description>The Queen has need of your services, tinkerer. Whosoever can demonstrate the greatest ingenuity and build the most amazing gizmos will win her favour and become the new Minister of Clockwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll the dice and place gears to build a machine that will earn you coins, dice or wrenches. Press your luck as you race to impress her majesty by engineering the unlikeliest of machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three modes (Hindenberg, Tesla &amp;amp; Eisntein) let you play fast &amp;amp; loose, add some strategy, or take it to the max.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, roll your dice which have different combinations of gears on each face. Place one or more of them and then repeat, rerolling the rest, placing and rerolling until they're all on the board. Each machine that you connect to the driver gear gives you a reward. Pick up all your dice at the end of each turn&amp;mdash;except for dice which rolled the locked face and remain permanently, affecting how both you and your opponent play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get cracking, chap!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
