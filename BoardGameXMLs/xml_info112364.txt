			<description>ABOUT THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outside the Box&amp;trade; was designed to be unique in many ways. First of all, the box top or cover actually becomes the game board (we don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone has ever done this before), hence the name Outside the Box. Secondly, it is a team game (there are very few team games out there) where everyone is actively involved throughout the game. This makes it a great party game, but also gives every single player a chance to be a hero by helping his or her team win. Most importantly, Outside the Box is all skill. There are no dice. Teams can only advance by getting the answers right. It&amp;rsquo;s very fast. It&amp;rsquo;s very fun and it&amp;rsquo;s very, very addictive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME PLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outside the Box&amp;trade; consists of four types of rounds: Volley Box, Team Play, To Each His Own, and Speed Round. In most rounds, answers are given, in order, A through Z. Teams begin on the Start square with a Volley Box round. The team that wins the Volley Box moves onto the board to the first Team Play space, receives 3 PassCards, and will play the first Team Play round. As your teams progress through the game, you advance through 3 phases, and the 377 categories become more challenging. To win the game, you leave Phase 3, flip over the Start square (which reveals the Winner's Box), and attempt your Final Challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FOUR ROUNDS OF PLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With four different rounds and hundreds of categories, it's like playing four games in one...so it's never the same, as it changes each time you play. Here are some examples:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Play - You have been chosen as the Captain of your team for this round. The category is: &amp;quot;Musical Groups and Rock Bands.&amp;quot; The timer is set for 2 minutes, and the pressure is on! You must go, in order, A through Z, and name a group or band that begins with each letter of the alphabet. Your team may help you, but only by giving you &amp;quot;outside the box&amp;quot; clues. Did you just say, &amp;quot;That's easy?&amp;quot; Ready, set, go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volley Box - In this round, teams battle back and forth through the alphabet in a verbal hot potato! The category is: &amp;quot;Things you give, share, or offer to others.&amp;quot; The timer is placed away from view and is set for 1 minute. Again, going in order, A through Z, the first team could shout, &amp;quot;Alimony!&amp;quot; The other team might respond with, &amp;quot;Benefit of the doubt!&amp;quot; The first team says, &amp;quot;Condolences!&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;Cup of sugar!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Custody!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;CPR!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Coat!&amp;quot;) The team that is stuck when the timer beeps loses the round. Just how far &amp;quot;outside the box&amp;quot; will you go to help your team win?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Each His Own - The category is picked and 4 letters are randomly chosen from the alphabet. Both teams are given 2 minutes to secretly write down a response for each letter. Try not to match each other. If you're really good, you may just get the chance to &amp;quot;stump the Master!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speed Round - You are the &amp;quot;Actor.&amp;quot; You have picked a Speed Round card and the timer is set. You must go in order through the alphabet and get your team to say exactly what is on that card. Go ahead, jump around, sing, use props -- but you better not say any part of the words on the card, or &amp;quot;it sounds like&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;rhymes with..&amp;quot; The timer is going... what are you waiting for?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTENTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are 377 category cards with thousands of possible answers (which makes the game different each time you play). The Master List is a three year compilation of well over 15,000 possible responses in which you could get the chance to stump the &amp;ldquo;Master&amp;rdquo; by coming up with your own &amp;ldquo;outside the box&amp;rdquo; answers. Also included is an audio CD featuring the inventor of the game, Rick Sugarman, explaining the rules. There are also live unscripted role playing examples, as well as helpful hints. In addition, the game comes complete with easy-to-follow, learn-as-you-play instructions and quick reference cards, an electronic digital programmable timer (battery included), team game pawns, scoring chips, letter cards, and PassCards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
