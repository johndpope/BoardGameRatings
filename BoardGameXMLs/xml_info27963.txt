							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Popular Game of Broadway</name>
									
			<description>The Popular Game of Broadway celebrates four of the historic thoroughfare's architectural landmarks:&lt;br/&gt;The Metropolitan Life Towers (built in 1909) The Times Tower (1903), the Flatiron Building (1902) and the Woolworth Building (1913). The game offers players the thrill of the big city within the comforts of the parlor - a perfect armchair traveling experience. - from the book 'The Games We Played' by Margaret Hofer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is similar to Pachisi or Sorry-type games where you get your pieces on the board and then try to get them home (Broadway) before your opponents do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
