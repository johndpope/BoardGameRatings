			<description>All beginnings are difficult. Imagine you assemble a poor wooden self-made lemonade stand and work yourself up to a global juice producer. That's exactly what you do in Squeeze. In this two player card game you can either win if you max out one business niche (stuff, production, marketing) or if you prevent your opponent from doing this.&lt;br/&gt;                                                                                           With Squeeze you get:&lt;br/&gt;-Fast and arousing two player card game.&lt;br/&gt;-Simple rules but you need a sharp eye to master it.&lt;br/&gt;-A perfect lunch-break game, invites to an immediate revanche.&lt;br/&gt;-Family friendly and easy to carry (small cardbox)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After every quarter of the year (quick card duels) you have the opportunity to get business cards from the market with which you upgrade your business. How many depends on how much more lemonade you sold this quarter than your opponent. A business unit which has the most upgrades in the game - and that's what makes the game interesting - gives you a certain advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But pay attention, not every business card can immediately upgrade your company. If you still sell your lemonade for 50 cents in the neighborhood you probably will not need the lemon squeezer ultra 9000 yet. If there is nothing in your interest you can let yourself cash out and use the money on later markets. It is quite important to keep a close eye on what your opponent is doing because before you know it he &amp;quot;strikes&amp;quot; all your niches and wins the game. If the legal way doesn't work you can also get the black &amp;quot;illegal cards&amp;quot; from the market to gain mad advantages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Squeeze is the kind of game you want to play in every lunch break. It takes around 10 minutes and invites to an immediate revanche. It is perfectly made for two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
