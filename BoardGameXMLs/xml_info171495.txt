							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Armada Beginner&#039;s Box</name>
									
			<description>Armada is a multiple-deck deckbuilding game of fast-paced space combat. Each player controls two to five decks, each of which represents one ship in the fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card in a deck represents one system coming online. As the AI alerts the control crew to which systems are ready, power can be diverted, weapons reloaded, hardware destroyed, AI disrupted &amp;mdash; all using a rules light system that is easy to understand but difficult to master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player attempts to use his ships to destroy his opponent's ships and be the last player remaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the distant future, mankind has spread across the stars of our galaxy. Matter configuration technology requires vast quantities of Osmium. Interstellar corporations are locked in a battle for control of Osmium reserves and, thus, control of the galaxy. Cryogenically preserved crew sleep for centuries, awaiting their awakening to the sound of klaxons as an enemy armada enters sensor range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle will be joined. Ships will be destroyed. Men may die. When the cryopod opens only one thing is certain: only one armada can survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
