							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ice Falls</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Careful this will be slippery. The war for the future is moving to the Ice Falls. Those guys from the Woodsman&amp;rsquo;s Cabin wrote it this way. The Godslayer&amp;rsquo;s bought in too. So, if you want to be part of the future, you can&amp;rsquo;t escape. Pack some dragon&amp;rsquo;s blood, then use the blue salve. It will keep you warm. It will give you powers. Dumondra&amp;rsquo;s been looking for the blue men for more than a year. Now she&amp;rsquo;s looking for you. There&amp;rsquo;s no way out. Be warned though - were-creatures and a rage elemental/woman type thing are on the horizon. But get on with it. See that manga kind of girl with the flying hair approaching over the ice? That&amp;rsquo;s her. That&amp;rsquo;s Dumondra. She&amp;rsquo;s depending on you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
