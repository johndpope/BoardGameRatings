			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This offshore sailing game allows players to recreate various courses of the classic Baltic Sea regatta Round Gotland Race (Swedish: Gotland runt). Four courses are suggested although it's easy enough to set up custom or other historical courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yachts race across a square grid according to wind strength and direction which are changed periodically as indicated by a spinner: strength by rolling a die, direction by player choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Certain spinner results occasion the drawing of event cards from one of two decks depending on whether a yacht has a headwind or a tailwind. These cards may speed a yacht up or slow it down, cause it to drift, or even knock it out of the race (although the rules suggest that the storm cards can be removed).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
