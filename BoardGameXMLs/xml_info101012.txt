			<description>From the Publisher Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The College Years is the college football counterpart to Solecismic Software's award-winning Front Office Football.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The College Years, you assume the role of the head coach of a major college football team. Each year, you'll recruit athletes from any of nearly 14,000 public high schools modeled in the game, train them and try to build a winning team in the challenging world of college football. The College Years&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long-term success in The College Years requires you to win championships, develop your school's academic reputation and build a profitable football program through alumni donations, television revenue and ticket sales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The College Years is a text-based sports simulation aimed at fans who enjoy the numbers in sports as much as they enjoy the on-field action. The interface focuses on packing enormous amounts of data about each team and athlete into easily accessible lists and charts. The game simulation is depicted through play-by-play descriptions of the on-field action. Coaches can optionally view games through a graphical representation of a stadium scoreboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coaches can simulate a full season in less than ten minutes on one of today's low-end computers. This speed is vital. The game's success centers around its depth, replay value and the ability to play literally hundreds of seasons in a career. The game is designed to run on any Windows-based operating system, '95 or later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The College Years is the sequel to original Front Office Football, a professional football simulation originally released in 1998. It received an Editors' Choice Award from Computer Gaming World and was nominated by Computer Gaming World and several online magazines for Sports Game of the Year. EA Sports Front Office Football (Front Office Football 2) and Front Office Football 2001 were published by Electronic Arts and also received Editors' Choice Awards from Computer Gaming World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please visit our web store for a link to the order page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
