			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zehn is a role-playing game designed to help players capture the feel and essence of the stories they love to read about and watch on television. The target attempt in Zehn was to create a consistent system for playing in a world representing the fiction we enjoy, while being simultaneously simple enough for newcomers and casual players to understand yet complex enough to allow virtually any character from fiction to be created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to accomplish these two feats a few things had to be done. First some simple and expansive core rules had to be invented in order to cover all the ranges of abilities character have in fiction and second those rules had to be simple enough to make sense to people trying to use them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
