			<description>Plume is a bird-collecting card game for two players, and your goal is to attract the coolest birds to your birdhouse. Keep your varieties balanced to have the coolest house on the flock! In the game, players alternate taking turns, starting with whoever most recently flew. On your turn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Choose one card that is next to the pawn. Take that card into your area, called your birdhouse. Move the pawn into the space left behind by that card.&lt;br/&gt;    If you divide the flock, place the group with fewer cards on the discard pile. If they are of equal quantity, you decide which group to discard.&lt;br/&gt;    If the pawn is next to only one card, take that card as well. Continue until the pawn is next to at least two cards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when no more cards remain to be claimed. At the end of the game, each player may discard one card from their birdhouse to the discard pile. Check which type of bird appears most frequently in your birdhouse. Resolve the scoring effect of each card that is part of that majority. If two or more types are tied for majority, resolve the scoring effect of each of those cards, so try to keep the types balanced so that you can score as many of your cards as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By combining two Plume decks, you can have up to four players compete in the same game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
