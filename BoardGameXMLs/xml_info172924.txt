							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beneath the Spire / Tunnels &amp; Skulls</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back for more adventure?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Return to a world of post-apocalyptic gonzo adventure with One Day Digs Double Feature 3 &amp;amp; 4! This evening&amp;rsquo;s first flick is irresistible, especially to those cyborgs in your team! Beneath the Spire will electrify your PCs, then, after a short intermission, dim the lights for Tunnels &amp;amp; Skulls, a post-apocalyptic random sewer generator!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for introductory games at conventions, game stores, and private home tables, One Day Digs are the brain child of author Brandon Goeringer and illustrated by Will McAusland. They are crafted to showcase a bit of The Mutant Epoch setting and flavor, introduce some creatures and relics, as well as offer an example of how the Outland System game mechanic works. For the most part, these adventures are for 4 to 6 new PCs of first rank. Not using the Mutant Epoch rules? No sweat, GM&amp;rsquo;s can easily convert the stats found in these mini-adventures to some other mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beneath the Spire is best suited to character parties with one or two cyborgs, and involves the investigation of a mysterious tower in the wastes, as well as the soothing promises to those of flesh and chrome, bone and steel. This adventure includes a full page map and new robotic nightmare to challenge your players.  Tunnels &amp;amp; Skulls involves an assortment of adventure hooks, a random sewer tunnel generator, two grid sheets for your own sewer network maps, a random encounter table, d100 treasure table plus an all new creature (pictured on the cover).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
