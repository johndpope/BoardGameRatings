			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introducing the ZEALANDIA Trading Card Game! Your students will have a blast learning about New Zealand bird life through addictive gameplay and trading. This game is designed to be fun and engaging while teaching students about our many manu (birds) and how to identify them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each bird's card has three ability ratings that range from 0 to 9, 0 being the lowest and 9 being the highest. The uppermost ability rating is flight (F) followed by camouflage (C) and special (S). The numbers reflect the bird&amp;rsquo;s abilities for each category. &amp;lsquo;Special&amp;rsquo; indicates how unique or special that bird is to New Zealand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Each player starts with an odd number of cards in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;2. Before the game starts each player may place down one environment card.&lt;br/&gt;3. The youngest player starts by calling flight (F) camouflage (C) special (S) or night time (which is all three numbers added together.)&lt;br/&gt;4. Each player places a card face down on the table.&lt;br/&gt;5. Name your card and flip it face up.&lt;br/&gt;6. The player with the highest rating for that ability wins and leaves their card face up on the table and the loser places theirs face down. If the rating is even, then the player who didn&amp;rsquo;t call the round wins.&lt;br/&gt;7. It is now the other player&amp;rsquo;s turn to call and start a new round.&lt;br/&gt;8. Once there are no more cards left, count the number of win cards you have in your pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to play the advanced version, read the abilities on the cards and use them when you turn your card face up. If a card talks about the pile, these are the cards you have down on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
