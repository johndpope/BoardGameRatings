			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monday 7th June 2004: One of the investigators is contacted by Andrea Watson, a solicitor who lives and works in Redgrove. Her brother Richard, an archaeologist engaged in a dig in the town, has been murdered. Although the killing took place a month ago the local police don't seem any closer to making an arrest. The case is a strange one and Miss Watson believes that someone with a more &amp;quot;unconventional&amp;quot; approach has a better chance of getting to the bottom of her brother's death than the local police. Richard was killed by a pack of black rats which attacked him as he slept. Miss Watson is aware of the investigator's penchant for the bizarre and thinks he/she is the ideal person to look into her brother's death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario typically is distributed as a PDF scenario file and five JPG map files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
