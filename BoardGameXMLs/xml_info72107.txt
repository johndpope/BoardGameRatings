			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it's the 18th title of the series it is by far not the best. The graphics is okay I guess, but that's really about all. User interface has so many errors that the game loses it's charm. For example - when you pass the ball to another player, he will in most cases imediately return the ball to you, since the same &amp;quot;button&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;pass&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;call for the ball&amp;quot;. So instead of receiving the ball and moving forward or passing onwards, he returns the ball back to you - if you're lucky enough it doesn't get stolen before it reaches you. It also lags like it was running on a computer for middle age - when you get close to the goal and press to shoot it takes about two second before your player actually kicks the ball and in most cases the goalkeeper will by then throw himself on the ball and all you can do is cry. By then you will probably lose the will to play another match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
