							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">Le Tour de France: La Boîte à Quiz</name>
									
			<description>Released by French company Marabout in their 'La Bo&amp;icirc;te &amp;agrave; Quiz' series. This trivia style party game is about the Tour de France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The author is French cycling journalist Jean-Paul Ollivier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The yellow box contains 160 cards, divided in the five categories. The back of the cards is of a different colour for each category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To give the game some &amp;quot;strategic&amp;quot; edge, there are 4 types of cards in each category.&lt;br/&gt;22 (out of 32) cards in each category named after the category. Besides, there are 3 &amp;quot;booster&amp;quot; cards, 3 &amp;quot;accident&amp;quot; cards and 4 &amp;quot;contre la montre&amp;quot; (time trial) cards in each category. These cards have a different symbol in the back, making a total of 20 different card backs (5 colours, 4 symbols each).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 22 &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; cards give one point for a correct answer.The &amp;quot;booster&amp;quot; cards give three points, while the &amp;quot;accidents&amp;quot; deduct three points from the player in case of a wrong answer. The three categories of questions in the card are given different names for each type of card, which only adds a baroque touch to the game. In all cases the player only has to answer to one question, chosen by the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the other hand, the time trial cards have four questions and the player must answer as many as he can in one minute, getting 1, 2, 3 or 5 points.&lt;br/&gt;Winner is the player who scores the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
