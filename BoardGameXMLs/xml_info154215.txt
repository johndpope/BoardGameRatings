							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Creature Feature: The ROLF! Halloween Horror Show</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mummies and Zombies and Vampires, Oh My!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's All-Hallows Eve and intrepid monster-hunters Lady Emma and Professor Tarkington have vowed to put an end to the reign of terror that Baron Nemutor and his undead minions have visited upon the peasants of Transylvania. But who will be victorious when the sun comes up... the monsters or the monster-hunters?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creature Feature!: The ROLF! Horror Show is a celebration of the spooky stuff that makes Halloween fun, not to mention another excuse to have characters bash the heck out of each without any motivation deeper than they happen to be in the same room with one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by Steve Miller, co-creator of ROLF!: The Rollplaying Game of Big Dumb Fighters, and contributor to numerous products for Ravenloft, the venerable gothic horror game setting from TSR and Arthaus, this supplement includes six pregenerated characters (two heroes and four monsters), new combat maneuvers and traits, and a three-part combat scenario that puts the best of Hammer Films to shame! (Okay, so that last bit might be hyperbole... but this is an attempt to get you to spend your money after all!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
