			<description>A word game with 160 letter tiles, 4 racks and 4 playing boards. Each player uses a hand of 8 letters, replenishing them at the end of his turn. In your turn, you hope to make a word from your collection of letters, the longer the better. However, some thought is needed because once a word is played, it can be added to, to make a longer word. Thus you would score some points for the first word, and yet more for the longer second word. So it pays to be thinking this through. The score increases as words get longer (1 for a two letter word, 2 for three, 4 for four, 6 for five, 10 for six, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;They obviously had AP in the 50's because the rules say &amp;quot;To save time, players should be considering their next play while their opponents are playing&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;A more advanced game &amp;quot;For experts&amp;quot; allows you to intrduce a little more interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
