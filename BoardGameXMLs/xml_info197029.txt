							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Siege of Grimm Iron Peaks</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your people have been living under threat from the ruthless, merciless beings, calling themselves &amp;quot;Adventurers&amp;quot; for longer then anyone can remember. They have waged a ceaseless campaign of persecution and conquest across the land. Yours and other tribes have been pushed back time and time again. Now several tribes of differing races have banded together, to settle in the low hills of the Grimm Iron Peaks mountain range, forming the town of Outkast. It's not much, but it's home,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure has been designed as a one shot adventure for 4-8 players, pregen characters included, in 4-6 hours. It tells a classic story of the &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; races oppressing the &amp;quot;dark&amp;quot; races, with their warlike expansionist ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
