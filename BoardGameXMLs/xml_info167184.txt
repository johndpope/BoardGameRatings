The game consists of 87 levels where you jump from balloon to balloon, trying to reach a target star patterned balloon which will then rise to take you up to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each level can include dangers that will cause Pop to burst, for example push pins, saw blades and cats (cats can be scared away by Pop barking).  There are balloons which catapult Pop to another location on the level, firecrackers which cause sections of the level to burst, and if you jump in the wrong direction you will plummet to your doom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
