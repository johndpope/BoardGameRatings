			<description>Brothers in Arms: Hour of Heroes is a 2008 World War II-era third-person shooter video game for iOS, developed and published by Gameloft. It was released on 23 November 2008, and is part of the Brothers in Arms series of video games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game offers three methods of control: &amp;quot;Cam Move&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;2 Pads&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Sight Move&amp;quot;. In all three modes, movement is controlled by a virtual joystick on the left of the screen, but how the player looks around changes depending on the control method used. In &amp;quot;Cam Move&amp;quot;, sight and aim is controlled by swiping across the touchscreen; in &amp;quot;2 Pads&amp;quot; sight and aim is controlled by a virtual joystick on the right of the screen; in &amp;quot;Sight Move&amp;quot;, sight and aim is controlled by the player touching the screen to have the character look in that direction. Accelerometer controls for movement are also available in all three control methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;Players can also crouch, throw grenades, use iron sights, reload, change weapons and shoot using virtual buttons on the touchscreen, and can control two vehicles during the game; an M3 Scout Car and an M4A1 Sherman Tank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot:&lt;br/&gt;The game has no narrative plot as such. Instead, the player controls an unnamed soldier in the 101st Airborne Division over the course of thirteen missions set during World War II. The missions take place during three separate campaigns; Operation Overlord (Normandy), the Tunisia Campaign and the Battle of the Bulge (Ardennes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Brothers in Arms: Hour of Heroes&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
