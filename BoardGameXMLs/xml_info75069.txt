							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Goblins of Summerkeep</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Goblins of Summerkeep is a 4-encounter D&amp;amp;D 4th  Edition Heroic Tier adventure that's been designed so it can be scaled for 1st through 10th level adventurers. It's the first of a series of campaign modules that can be added to any Heroic Tier campaign. It's designed to be easy to run and easy to drop in to an existing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each monster is presented in three variations, one for 1st level adventurers, one for 5th level, and one for 10th level. As a result, it's easy to tweak the monsters for any party from 1st to 10th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, each piece of dialogue is presented in two columns: a carefully-written piece of dialogue that you can read as &amp;quot;boxed text,&amp;quot; and a detailed summary that you can customize according to your preferred speech patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full-color artwork and maps have been carefully color-corrected to print perfectly on color and black-and-white printers. The module includes maps that will print in standard one-inch squares on a normal piece of paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
