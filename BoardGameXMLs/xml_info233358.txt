			<description>Description from publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RING! Class is back in session at Bayside High School! You&amp;rsquo;ll be reaching &amp;ldquo;squad goals&amp;rdquo; with Zack, Jessie, Kelly, Slater, Lisa, and Screech as you hit the school hallways or visit The Max, your favorite caf&amp;eacute; hangout. In the official Saved by the Bell Game, you&amp;rsquo;ll relive the classic 90&amp;rsquo;s sitcom and the unforgettable episodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you identified as a trouble maker like Zack, a jock like Slater, a nerd like Screech, a beauty queen like Kelly, a fashionista like Lisa or a straight-A student like Jessie &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s something for everyone to channel their high school self! To begin, select your favorite player to travel throughout this retro-90s game board visiting various locations such as homeroom, Zach&amp;rsquo;s room, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your homework assignment: Be the first player to collect one of each Character Card, or 3 Character Cards of the same player. Once you spin &amp;ldquo;View a Scene,&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;ll have a few seconds to glance at snapshots of classic scenes from the show. Be prepared to answer random questions. So, study up and don&amp;rsquo;t flunk this memory test to win a Character Card!&lt;br/&gt;If you spin a number, you must move your character that number of spaces on the board. You can land on &amp;ldquo;Time Out&amp;rdquo; and steal from your fellow players. You&amp;rsquo;ll even receive your own Yearbook to collect your Character Cards, but don&amp;rsquo;t doodle on Zack &amp;ndash; you must be focused to get an A+!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve collected one card of each Character or three cards of a single Character, you&amp;rsquo;ve won the game and you&amp;rsquo;ve been&amp;hellip; Saved by the Bell!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
