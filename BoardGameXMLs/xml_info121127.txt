							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goldfield Gully</name>
									
			<description>In the spring of 1893, a torrential season of constant downpour and flash floods exposed gold-bearing quartz in a large gully in the Goldfield Mining District in the small mining town of Goldfield, Arizona. $25,000 worth of gold began washing down the street that ran through Goldfield. The mad dash was on to collect the gold before it was gone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Goldfield Gully players press their luck to uncover as much gold as they possibly can before the ever-watchful eyes of the local Marshal catches them in the act. Players must choose which buildings in the town of Goldfield they will dig for gold in front of, then hide from the Marshal. Every round the Marshal visits one building, forcing the player in that building to give up his entire treasure. Players may also forgo their turn to bank their treasure by giving up half to the Marshal and &amp;quot;banking&amp;quot; the other half. The player with the most gold at the end of ten rounds wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
