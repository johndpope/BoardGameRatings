							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mini-Games: Football</name>
									
			<description>Mini-Games: Football is part of the Package Creators Mini-Games line. It includes a pocket sized box containing 54 cards, a magnetic football field and magnetic tokens for keeping the state of the game.  The 54 cards are broken up into 27 Offensive and 27 Defensive cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players each receive a hand of random cards with the offensive player playing a card and the defensive player either trying to counter it or discard a card.  Whether the play is countered or not the winning card's instructions are followed.  The players then move the tokens on the magnetic board to keep track of the down, line of scrimmage and distance to the next down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An example offensive card is &amp;quot;DRAW PLAY - 10 Yard Gain&amp;quot; with it's counter defensive card &amp;quot;DRAW PLAY - 10 Yard Loss&amp;quot;.  If the offensive card is not countered then the ball moves 10 yards, otherwise it moves back 10 yards.&lt;br/&gt;There are also cards for intercepting, fumbling, field goals, field goal block and punting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Essentially it's a derivative of Snap with state and a few special cards thrown in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
