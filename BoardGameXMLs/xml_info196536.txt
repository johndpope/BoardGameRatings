			<description>&amp;quot;The Game&amp;quot; is the digital single player edition of the popular card game, which was in 2015 nominated for &amp;quot;Game of the Year&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ... as long as you can! The game is your opponent. You can it defeat, but even if the rules are super easy - easy it is not. Think carefully and plan ahead, just so you can do it! During the game, created four decks. Two stacks are ascending (numbers 1-99), two stacks are decreasing (figures 100-2). You try as many cards, ideally every 98 to bear on the four card stacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play the game - or the game play with you ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.
