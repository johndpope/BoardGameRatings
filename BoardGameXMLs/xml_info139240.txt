							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Master LOL</name>
									
			<description>It's a game made for making laugh the others. Each player will answear to the message sent by the narrator, writing the most original and funny thing. The 2 fastest players will take microfones to gain points in the improvisation points-track. Each player will then read his sentence and the others will vote with 1, 2 or 3 fingers (1 = not so fun, 2 = funny, 3 = hilarious). A player need a certain number of votes to gain points! Also, there are jokers that double the votes of a certain player. Master LOL is an unusual challenge for humorists! In one word, the game is made for laugh!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
