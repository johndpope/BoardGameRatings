			<description>Science fiction skirmish level miniatures rule set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's web site: &amp;quot;Ideal for use with 28mm or 15mm scale miniatures (so can use 40k armies with these if you like), the rules cover heroes, vehicles, individuals and units as well. They handle armoured vehicles, gunships, power armour, aliens, humanoids, bugs, robots&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player shoots and/or moves a unit or individual/model, then rolls to see if he can activate another unit that round, and so on until a roll to get another unit to act fails, then the other player has a round. The chance of getting 2+ units to respond in a round depends on the motivation, communications and the like for the unit/individual/model involved... but it a case of shoot first, then move, then combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morale includes a form of pinning/going prone as a voluntary action against incoming fire to reduce the risk of, erm, death, and the main element is that all units/individuals/models start to test once a certain level of casualties have been sustained by your army (not per unit). Level of losses at which you test is worse for militia-type units, better for regulars and much better for special forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A points system is included in the rules, as well as ideas for linking games from one to another.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
