			<description>Game Documentation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Train clatters along the lines relentlessly, you stare out of the window at the seemingly endless countryside rolling by. Soon you will reach your destination and then you will receive the opportunity to bring into play your famous investigative talents. For a moment you wonder whether or not you have the talent that will be needed on this case - ever since the national press released news of the fantastic fortune to be discovered at the old Mansion of Major Johnston-Smythe, treasure hunters have tried their luck, most of them have never been heard from again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Train begins to slow down you prepare yourself for what is ahead by mentally recapping all the information you have gathered so far about the famous treasures:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Major was a cunning old fox, in order to make it virtually impossible for anyone to inherit his fortune, he had put all his money into Gold, cast into the form of a Figurine or Idol. He then hid this away and told no-one of it's whereabouts. Further to this he commissioned Ten more Figurines to be made of various materials and, although worthless in themselves, they were for some reason absolutely essential in order to obtain the main prize. Shortly after this, the Major died and his jealous Nephew made public the information he had obtained about the Major's activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Train finally stops, now your task begins in earnest. Can you succeed where so many others have failed, or will death be your only prize?.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
