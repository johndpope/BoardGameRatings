							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Pandora Sanction</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the PCs are offered a chance to act as bodyguards for the famous adult entertainer Pandora Quince, little do they know that the job entails much more than simply rubbing elbows with one of the most alluring figures in the subsector. They must also deal with overly-ardent fans, jealous partners, and a host of other ills both deadly and benign as she completes a tour. But Pandora&amp;rsquo;s past is quickly catching up to her in the form of a previous lover with high political ambitions &amp;mdash; and who now views Pandora&amp;rsquo;s continued existence as a threat to those ambitions. Can the heroes distinguish mere annoyances from death moving ever closer in time to prevent tragedy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pandora Sanction is a one-page, no-frills adventure for Cepheus Engine and other science fiction roleplaying games using a 2D6 mechanic (including The Original 2D6 Science Fiction Game) starring characters of varied career backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: this adventure, while not designed strictly for adults, obliquely touches on adult themes. Discretion is advised.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
