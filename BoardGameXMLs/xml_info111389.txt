			<description>L&amp;ouml;wenzahn (common dandelion) is a game where the players try to plant dandelion in &amp;quot;Peter Lustigs&amp;quot; garden. The player who has first plant 3 of the flowers wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To reach the garden the players have to move the seed over the main game board. With a special dice, the figure &amp;quot;Peter Lustig&amp;quot;, is used on a side board to declare what happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are some mechanics that makes the game more difficult on just move the seeds over the gameboard:&lt;br/&gt;A bee is used on the gameboard to dust the seeds, while a cow eats the flowers and the seeds. To get a fast move the windcards are very handy. When a seed counter is moved on a question mark the players can answer a question from some cards and if right they can move again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;L&amp;ouml;wenzahn is a german TV show for children in which &amp;quot;Peter Lustig&amp;quot; explain ecological, technical and economic topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
