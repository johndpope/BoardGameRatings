							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sylvan Temple</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some two hundred years ago, a group of elves from the Arcaskdry tribe split from their folk, so as to establish a cult to a demon who had revealed himself to them as a savior god of the elves. They travelled to the small woods (now known as the Vale Woods) that were just to the west of the Arcaskdry Forest, and built a large, tree-shaped tower to serve as a temple to their new &amp;ldquo;god.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[...]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The temple has stood since, slowly falling into ruin. Since the settlement of other races in the area, and the founding of Neathby, a handful of adventurers have explored it, some returning with riches, others never to be heard from again. The last successful excursion into the temple happened a few generations ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
