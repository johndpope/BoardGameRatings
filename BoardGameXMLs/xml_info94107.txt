			<description>Treasure Galaxy! is an educational computer game intended to teach children mathematical problem solving.&lt;br/&gt;The Master of Mischief has wreaked havoc on Crystal City. To restore it, the player must collect crystals by solving letter code words.&lt;br/&gt;Crystal City is divided into three levels. To advance to the next level, the player has to complete various challenges; the first is related to weighing and measuring, the second to geometric shapes, and the final to calendar dates.&lt;br/&gt;The player can also earn points, called star bucks. They can spend these at a special shop for buying sunbeams to shoot good bright yellow shooting stars. By successfully answering math questions from these stars, the player also earns star bucks.&lt;br/&gt;Disasteroids, evil flying asteroids, serve as the main antagonists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Treasure Galaxy!&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
