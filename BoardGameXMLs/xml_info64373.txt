							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">64-32 Ranch Roundup</name>
									
			<description>64-32 Ranch Roundup is an abstract strategy game system that may or may not employ cards for luck, depending on which of the provided rules are used.  The board consists of a central round-up area and four corner corral areas; all the game pieces begin in the round-up area and it is the goal of each player to move their colored pieces to their own corral area.  Pieces and spaces are numbered, and this can be employed in different ways, again depending on the variation being played, and paper money is included for scoring.  Other games from Wales Game Systems were subsequently given a &amp;quot;64-32 Ranch&amp;quot; western theme, undoubtedly to maximize sales in an era when Westerns were extremely popular.  The game's designer states in the patent files for these games that they are abstract and that any theme could be applied to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
