			<description>Gods - A Game of Righteous Smiting is a fast playing &amp;quot;take that&amp;quot; card game. The players take the roles of gods trying to win followers by smiting tribes with horrible plagues and thus scoring points. Because carrots may be nice, but when it comes to religion, sticks &amp;ndash; and the occasional flood or swarm of locusts &amp;ndash; are even better. Each player has a collection of tribes they try to smite and make more devout by playing &amp;quot;plague cards&amp;quot; on them. But since you can also smite your opponents tribes, you have to be careful. If they suffer too much your tribes will turn against you and score no points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
