			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revealations is an easy to play party board game which tests your knowledge of Movie, TV show and Song titles in a fun and unique way. The titles have to be guessed by seeing only the initial letters of titles printed on the various category card decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revealations has simple rules, is quick to set up and the game play involves a race to the top of the game board. Players earn points depending on how many initial letters are revealed before the player can guess the title. The game combines knowledge of Movie, TV and Song titles with a hint of anagram/code breaking skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
