			<description>In The Vine Game you earn your fortune in the world of wine.  You can make money producing wine in your own vineyard or operating a winery.  You can also earn money trading in grapes, exporting grapes or by having the best combination of all those strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At various times money, grapes or equipment can be in short supply so alliances and savvy trading between players will give you an advantage.  At some point you might need to trash yor alliances to break out on your own and go for gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vine Game uses money as the means of exchange and has a nice retro feel which will give it a broader cross generational appeal. So your dad will love it too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
