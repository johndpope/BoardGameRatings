			<description>Each player is dealt 10 cards.  Each frame a player will draw one card from the deck and play one or two cards.  A player can draw cards to complete the 10th frame.  A player may draw more than one card to complete his or her frame.  If a player has a Spare card in hard when the 10th frame is completed, it will count 10 point off for every Spare card in hand, as well as the face value of the number cards.  The player with the highest score after penalty cards are deducted  from the 10th frame is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is produced by B &amp;amp; B Games, Inc. of Midwest City, Oklahoma.  According to a game insert, Bill Weingartner appears to be the designer and/or publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
