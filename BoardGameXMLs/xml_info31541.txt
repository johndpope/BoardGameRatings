			<description>Swarm is a turn based abstract strategy game where opponents strive to take over the Hive, or board by eliminating other swarms.  Game pieces move across a number of hexagonal spaces determined by the number of pieces in the stack (called a swarm), and stack and unstack upon landing on specific spaces.&lt;br/&gt;Opponents are eliminated by landing on their spaces, or &amp;quot;stinging&amp;quot; them.  2-player, 3-player, and 6-player boards are currently available.  There are many board variations, but only three are currently in print.  There are also a variety of spaces which have different properties to enhance game strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/swarmplayer/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/swarmplayer/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
