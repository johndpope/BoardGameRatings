			<description>The multiplicity of the Crawling Chaos!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     9 Dark Demon Miniatures&lt;br/&gt;     9 Loyalty cards&lt;br/&gt;     2 Spellbooks&lt;br/&gt;     The Shadown Pharaoh figure&lt;br/&gt;     The Bloated Woman figure&lt;br/&gt;     Haunter of the Dark figure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dark Demons &lt;br/&gt;The dark demon is a form of Nyarlathotep which manifests itself by literally engulfing and transforming his summoner. When the avatar departs, the victim&amp;rsquo;s body is left transformed, forever a hideous monster. In the box, we provide Dark Demons in every faction color: nine total figures! When you recruit the Dark Demon, all the enemy factions also get one, but theirs is a burden and weakness to them, while yours is more of an asset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shadow Pharaoh &lt;br/&gt;This manifestation is Nyarlathotep&amp;rsquo;s Egyptian connection, well-known from many stories. The figure itself is a sort of combination of sphinx, scorpion, mummy, pharaoh, and tentacled horror. I really like it, and I think you will too. It has an especially nasty ability which drives cultists off gates, making the gates vulnerable to be captured once the Pharaoh leaves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bloated Woman&lt;br/&gt;First popularized in the well-known adventure Masks of Nyarlathotep for the Call of Cthulhu system, the Bloated Woman is Nyarlathotep in a rather repulsive female form. She steals killed enemies, and later transforms your gates so they produce Elder Signs rather than Power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Haunter of the Dark&lt;br/&gt;The Haunter of the Dark is a full-on Great Old One. It is awakened as with most independent Great Old Ones &amp;ndash; you need a Gate with your own Great Old One. In the Haunter&amp;rsquo;s case, you spend 6 Power to get the loyalty card, putting it in the same high-end category as game-changers such as Atlach-Nacha, Cthugha, or Daoloth. (Most Independent Great Old Ones only cost 4, or even 2.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re Crawling Chaos, you can awaken the Haunter for just 5 Power, and you don&amp;rsquo;t need a Great Old One, so obtaining it is a lot easier, BUT every other faction does get an Elder Sign when you do this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Haunter is explicitly a combat critter. It has a combat of 1 per enemy spellbook (so in theory 0-6, but in practice usually at the high end). I wanted to reflect the fact that one of the Haunter&amp;rsquo;s best-known characteristics is that it can&amp;rsquo;t survive well in the light. Therefore, it actually starts with a weakness, representing this disability &amp;ndash; Fly The Light. This &amp;ldquo;ability&amp;rdquo; states that post-Battle, if the enemy scored only 1 Kill, it MUST be applied to the Haunter. If the enemy scored 2 or more kills though, you can target them normally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Haunter&amp;rsquo;s spellbook is really easy to get &amp;ndash; just spend 1 Power as an action. Trivial. In fact, normally this is the first thing you&amp;rsquo;ll do after awakening the Haunter, which gives your enemies a one-turn window to try to take it out, before you get this frightful pre-Battle ability. It&amp;rsquo;s The Shining Trapezohedron. Before rolling combat dice, your enemy has to roll 1 die per unit he has in the battle. For each Kill he rolls, he must eliminate a unit (his choice).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
