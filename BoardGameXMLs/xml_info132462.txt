			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every few decades, when the moon is full on the last day of the 10th Month, the fabric of reality thins and a door may be opened. This door, the Door, is a gateway to Hell - filled with teeming masses of demons and devils, abominations and the unholy, all thirsting for blood, destruction, and death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And there are always people, whether by chance or design, by careful planning or sheer dumb luck, who seek to open the Door or keep it shut. Those who seek to let the forces of Hell into this world, the Openers, believe they will be rewarded with incredible power for their dedicated service, though some seek the end of all things, alongside their own due, because of despair, or madness. Those seeking to keep the forces of Hell at bay, the Closers, do so for the good of all mankind, to save them from a fate worse than death &amp;ndash; or to make sure the competition doesn&amp;rsquo;t beat them to taking over. The Great Contest for the fate of the world takes place while the world sleeps, unaware of an eternal struggle that repeats itself, until such time as the Closers win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full moon rises on the night of October 31st, 1887. It is October 1st, and the players gather on the outskirts of London for the Great Contest. They have 31 days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players will be members of the two opposing camps, predominantly composed of figures of historical and literary importance in Victorian London.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an entry into the RPGGeek Holiday Adventure Contest 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
