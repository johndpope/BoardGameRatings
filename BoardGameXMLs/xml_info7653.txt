			<description>In Columbus Was Wrong, players compete by trying to sail from Spain to India and back. However, there is a twist: they must do so without sailing off the edge of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major components include an antique globe with two movable disks suspended around the equator, twelve small plastic ships (3 per player), and the dice that determine movement. Each player has only one ship on the board at a time; the remainder are a reserve to be drawn upon if needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players uses their turn to advance his ship and rotate the board based on his die roll. Certain spaces will allow a ship to move closer to the globe; others force the player further out. If a ship is force to sail off the edge of the board, the player tries again with a fresh ship in Spain. A player who runs out of ships is out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
