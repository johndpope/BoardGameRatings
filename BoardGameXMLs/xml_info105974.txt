			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ranma 1/2: Hard Battle is a 2D fighting game based on the anime series Ranma 1/2. It is the only Ranma 1/2 game to be translated for American audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story for the game is that Principal Kouchou is promising others favors if they fight each other. Thus, chaos ensues and all of the characters are eager to fight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is quite similar to other 2D fighting games that were released in the early nineties. Every character has their own move set and unique characteristics, and post-fight dialogue. For the US version of the game, a lot of character names were changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a Story mode, VS mode, and Team Challenge (5-on-5 battle) mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are twelve playable characters from the anime series: Ranma, Ranma-Chan, Akane, Shampoo, Mousse, Ukyou, Genma, Gosunkugi, King, Ryouga, Pantyhose Tarou, Pantyhose Tarou (Transformed), and Happousai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
