			<description>This is Game #13 in the Games on Half a Checkerboard Series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game that started as an attempt to come up with a game in the Halma family, which also includes Chinese Checkers.  As it developed, it began to take on its own flavor, which includes pieces starting off the board, sending enemy pieces back to their reserve area off the board when jumped, and exiting one's own pieces from a single space on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
