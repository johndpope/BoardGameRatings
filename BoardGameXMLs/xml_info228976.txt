							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pactborn: An Original New Race (5e)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pactborn: When warlocks dare to test their luck by forging pacts with powerful creatures outside the material realm they risk not only their own souls but the souls of their kin as well. Pactborn are the children of warlocks whose binding relationship to otherworldly patrons left a telling imprint on their spawn. Pactborn children are almost always shunned by society and usually just as likely to be rejected by their parents. In the eyes of their parents, pactborn are a cruel reminder of the price they paid for power. In everyday society, pactborn are unfairly and incorrectly seen as innately evil or nefarious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
