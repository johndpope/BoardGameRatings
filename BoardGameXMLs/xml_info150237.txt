							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Extreme Future: Fate Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extreme Future is now available as a setting for FATE. Fate is a generic role-playing game system designed to offer the least possible obstruction to role-playing. Fate has a large number of innovative gaming mechanics. This game includes the Fate core rules and the Extreme Future setting in one integrated package.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extreme Future is about a universe where human space spans the galaxy, but where we share it with countless alien powers and robot empires. It's a dangerous galaxy, strewn with the remains of civilizations that came before us, their secrets, powerful weapons, and enigmatic ruins waiting to be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This distinctive background, with a high-adventure, space-opera feel, integrates beautifully with the Fate rules to create a huge game universe where the GM's and players' imaginations can run wild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF includes everything needed to start playing, all wrapped up in a beautifully illustrated book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book contains character creation rules &amp;ndash; which are also used to create robots, aliens and vehicles &amp;ndash; and lots and lots of examples of vehicles, equipment and monsters. There are whole systems, planets, an adventure, mecha and psionics, all implemented in Fate's simple but sophisticated and powerful way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So start exploring the Extreme Future now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
