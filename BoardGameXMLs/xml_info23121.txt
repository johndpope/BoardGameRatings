							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Boneyard Murder!</name>
									
			<description>In this game, the murder of Lord Sagen Ray takes place at the start of the party....but that doesn't mean he stays dead and buried.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again, the infamous celebrities of the &amp;quot;dark side&amp;quot; have gathered together for their annual secret gala and this time it is a &amp;quot;fete champetre&amp;quot; (outdoor feast)!  Each year they assemble on All Hallow's Eve for a chilling celebration of sinfulness, an evening of evilness and a night chock-full of nightmares&amp;hellip;.to say the least.  This year's blast will be NO exception as there is sure to be some major blood-curdling and hell-raising going on!  And so on this evil evening,  black silhouettes of broomstick riders can clearly be seen across the bright full moon as they head for the annual bash. The setting is perfect - a long forgotten cemetery where vampires and zombies, ghosts and ghouls, and mummies and monsters from all over the globe will party hardy ... until the sun begins to rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So what happened?&amp;quot; Last seen, everyone was having a delightfully devilish time.  The guests were feasting on a barbeque of Malaysian monkey brain medley, river rat ragout, along with bubbling cauldrons overflowing with the potent plasma of Peruvian llamas. Bone chilling music, provided by Haggy May Maudlin and the &amp;quot;Undertakers&amp;quot;, echoed through the graveyard. A s&amp;eacute;ance was in session and interestingly enough, the spirit of Sir Matthew Tudworthy had been conjured (executed for wizardry on October 31, 1694, Grave Harbor's only recorded execution). All in all, the boneyard bash was quite the smash! &amp;hellip;that is until Lord Sagen Ray arrived.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Tell us more.&amp;quot; Suddenly the evil gaiety stilled in silence as Lord Ray and Nadia Tarot (local gypsy extraordinaire) became involved in a rather &amp;quot;heated&amp;quot; conversation.  Nadia was heard to lash out, &amp;quot;Liar! Liar!! Lord Sagen Ray&amp;hellip;..you are nothing but a miserable master of falsehoods, an overlord of deception and, worst yet&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;..a loathsome heart breaker!!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nadia burst into tears and dashed toward a grove of pine.  The music began once again but the party was disrupted, for the second time, when an arrow flying through the air with the force of the devil speared and lodged into Lord Sagen Ray's head. Sagen's blood covered body then fell upon the grave of Sir Matthew Tudworthy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now it is time to join the Bogey Mann; Count and Countess Cadaver; the Grave Harbor Butcher; the Cemetery Skreecher; Boney Baloney; Black Beauty (the Headless Horsewoman); the ghosts of Sir Matthew Tudworthy and Lord Sagen Ray and many, many other creatures of the night. So get ready for a ghoulish, ghastly evening of masquerade, mystery and, of course, MURDER!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
