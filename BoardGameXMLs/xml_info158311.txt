			<description>The players start at the lower right corner of the game map and try to be the first at the train station at the upper right corner. They beginn as pedestrians, but can take the tram or a car along the way, if they pay a certain amount of game coins. Whenever a player gets on a numbered space, he has to consult the game rules and follow the instructions. In the center of the game board, there is a crossroad with a traffic cop. The cop is rotated every turn to block one road or the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
