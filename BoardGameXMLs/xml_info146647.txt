							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legacy Action Tracking Promo</name>
									
			<description>This is a small punchboard designed to facilitate tracking your actions when playing Legacy: Gears of Time, or your actions and optional technology activation when playing Legacy: Forbidden Machines.  It was originally offered as a stretch reward for backers of the Kickstarter project for Legacy: Forbidden Machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No instructions are given for its use; however, one method you can use is to punch out the holes as you use those actions, then return them to the tracker for the next player's turn.  The intended mode of use is to employ a cube or two, but considering that you can run short of cubes, the no-cube solution of eternally re-punching the tracker is a good option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
