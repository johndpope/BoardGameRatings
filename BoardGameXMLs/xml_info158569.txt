							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Xpand Rally Xtreme</name>
									
			<description>Xpand Rally Xtreme contains similar content to the original Xpand Rally but in totally extreme variation. In game, apart from well known rally cars, gamers find super-fast GT vehicles, DTR group buggies, off-road 4x4 cars and Monster Trucks group trucks. Game also presents about 40 tracks in typical SS contests, off-road cross-country rides, and racing track races against challenging opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the original XR, game contains career mode, single races and multiplayer. It is based on the proven Chrome Engine and players will get the ChromEd editor to create their own tracks and even game modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Xpand Rally&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
