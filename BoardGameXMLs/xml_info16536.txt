							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Party for Pooh!</name>
									
			<description>This picture matching game, with a Winnie the Pooh theme, is actually two games-in-one...&lt;br/&gt; Pooh's Birthday Party: In this game players try to gather up Pooh's friends for the party. On your turn you spin the spinner, place your finger on the same color Dialer hole indicated, and turn the Dial until your finger falls through the hole by Kanga &amp;amp; Roo. If the pointer points to Piglet, Eeyore, Tigger or Kanga and Roo, you may collect the piece of your chosen color that matches that character (if you haven't already). If it points to Pooh, you may collect the Pooh pawn. Be the first to collect the Pooh Pawn and four character pieces of your color to win. The winner gets to assemble all the character pieces to form the gameboard for Game 2.&lt;br/&gt; The Path to Tigger's House: In this game players once again spin the spinner and rotate the color dial, but this time they look at the gift that the character is holding. They then move the Pooh pawn along the gameboard path to the next space with the matching gift picture. The winner is the player that moves the pawn to the last honey pot space by Tigger's house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
