			<description>Subsidie is a quick card game for 3 to 6 players and the players try to win projects with government grants. In addition several obstacles must be overcome: grants can be lost, somebody else can take over the project, the project can fail due to scandal... The purpose of the play is to apply enough government funds as possible for the realization of projects. The winner is who at the end of the play has applied the largest amount subsidy for realized projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
