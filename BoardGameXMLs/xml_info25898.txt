			<description>The Bicentennial Game&lt;br/&gt;1776-1976&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Experience the Birth of Our Nation&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was published in 1976 by Doc Roc Enterprises.  This game appears to be a teaching aid, as there is little to no strategy, and focuses on highlighting the people, places, and facts of the American Revolutionary War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a roll-and-move game, with a board divided into three sections: a left circular track, a right snake-like track, and a middle track that is a straight-away to the victory space on top.  Each space on the board has a bit of trivia that I assume is intended to be read aloud when a player lands on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The flow of the game is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Section I, People&lt;br/&gt;Players roll and move on the right side of the board, landing on spaces that describe the major players of the war.  Some spaces require you to draw a card, which could move you forward or backward.   The object is to get to the end of the Section I path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Section II, The Original 13 Colonies&lt;br/&gt;Once they reach the end of Section I, players roll and move on the left side of the board, landing on spaces that represent the 13 colonies.  If a player lands on a colony that they have not previously landed, they mark on a piece of paper that they have &amp;quot;collected&amp;quot; this colony.  Players will continue on the circular path until they have &amp;quot;collected&amp;quot; all 13 colonies, which will allow them to move to Section III.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Section III, The American Character&lt;br/&gt;A player rolls and moves up the center path towards the top of the board.  The player must roll exactly to land on the last space, The Bell Tower, in order to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
