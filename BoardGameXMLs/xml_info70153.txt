			<description>Author: Michael J. Clinton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Squadron Level Air Combat Rules Aerial Combat in the Great War WATCH YOUR SIX ! is an in depth hex based game of squadron level air combat that took place on the Western Front during the Great War.&lt;br/&gt;Emphasis is placed on outcomes rather than processes.&lt;br/&gt;Unlike similar games, these rules were designed to allow a single player to handle multiple aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;Pilot skill is just as important as the characteristics of the aircraft flown.&lt;br/&gt;The WATCH YOUR SIX! rules are not a stand alone product.&lt;br/&gt;Two sample aircraft and a single scenario are included in the rules set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanded by YANKS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: wy6 site: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.wy6.us&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.wy6.us&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
