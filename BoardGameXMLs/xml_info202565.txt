			<description>The princess is imprisoned in the castle. &lt;br/&gt;All the knights come rushing to save her&amp;hellip;To earn a kiss from the princess they will have to: win a sword, trek over the mountain, collect the key to the keep, then cross the river.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(text from publisher's website)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you the knight that will save the princess? The first player who can overcome the obstacles and save the princess from the dungeon where she is kept captive wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How the game is played:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     each player (up to 4) has a wooden figure representing a knight, they start in the (4) corners of the board.&lt;br/&gt;     the wooden figure of the princess, who is trapped in the dungeons of the castle, start in the middle of the board (castle)&lt;br/&gt;     the two dragon figures start in the caves.&lt;br/&gt;         during the game the players can gain swords (these are neede to defend against a dragon) or keys&lt;br/&gt;         via dice rolls (the dice have no pips but images on them) the swords can be won&lt;br/&gt;         in the caves the players can gain cards but beware of the dragons! These cards are needed to gain a key&lt;br/&gt;         once they key is obtained the players still need to pass a bridge (a dice is rolled there) and when they do they can free the princess with their obtained key.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     the player who succeeds in releasing the princess from the castle wins the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
