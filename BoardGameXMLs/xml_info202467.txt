							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crossing the Alps</name>
									
			<description>This is a simple roll and move game where each player must try to move five men &amp;quot;across the alps&amp;quot; on his playing card. Each card has a row of circles marked &amp;quot;5&amp;quot;, two rows of mountain scenery, and a row of goats. Unusually, the rules are printed on the front cover of the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling a single die. Rolls of 2, 4 and 6 count for nothing. A roll of 5 allows a man to be put on the first row. A roll of 3 allows a move directly from the first (5) row to the goat row. And a roll of 1 allows a man to move forward a single row - but once in the alps, a 3 roll is useless to him. First player to get all five men to the goat row wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
