			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shared Pool System is a generic, universal character creation and action resolution system for tabletop roleplaying.  It must be supplemented with a genre or setting to be playable.  Characters in the system have four Attributes with values distributed from a points pool.  Attributes range in value from 1 to 5, with the human average being 2.  Characters also have a variety of Skills with numeric values ranging from 1 to 8.  Hit Points are a derived value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core resolution mechanic involves a modified die roll against a target difficulty number.  The system provides a common &amp;quot;pool&amp;quot; of dice accessible to all players at any time - but, once used, the dice are not replenished.  Management of the shared pool thus becomes significant (and possibly contentious).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
