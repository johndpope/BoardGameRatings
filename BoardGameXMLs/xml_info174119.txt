			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you such an expert pitchman that you can sell ice (that attracts beautiful butterflies all summer long) to Eskimos? Then the But Wait, There's More!: That's The Best Part! expansion for you! Every good pitchman lets his audience ask questions, and that's precisely what this expansion adds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each pitch, the next player plays their &amp;quot;That's the Best Part!&amp;quot; card, which contains a curious question such as &amp;quot;What happens if Grandma can't lift it?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;What happens if it induces vomiting?&amp;quot;. The pitching player responds with a confident &amp;quot;That's the Best Part!&amp;quot; and has to continue their pitch, quickly improvising an answer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This add-on expansion contains forty new cards and brings a wonderfully entertaining new aspect to But Wait, There's More!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
