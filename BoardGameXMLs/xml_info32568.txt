			<description>This is an old game (1800s or early 1900s) that has a board made of squares numbered 1 to 65, with stars in place of some of the numbers.  There is a jail in the top right corner where players go if they miscount or play out of turn (cheat?).  The game includes a spinner, and there are four playing pieces to go with it.  It is a typical spin-and-move game of the era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
