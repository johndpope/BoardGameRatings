			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golems - Big, dumb, dangerous.  Halflings - Little, speedy, wanderlust.  Done!  Right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re done with just that, you are ignoring some fascinating creatures, on both sides!  Golems can be anything.  They can be defenders of dungeons.  They can be workhorses and fantasy engines.  They can be gladiators.  Really, they can be nearly anything.  And the little guys - Well, just assume that we&amp;rsquo;re saying halflings can be so much more than simple stereo-types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a ton of new ideas, ideas you can easily use in your existing game world or use to craft a new game world, then Small Bites is what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for.  Our goal is to take a subject, whether an archetype, a monster class, or some other FRPG theme and bring you as much content about it as we can.  But this isn&amp;rsquo;t a simple one-shot supplement.  We want to get you involved in the process - giving us the themes you want most, the articles you like the best, and the feedback we need to make you happy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the &amp;ldquo;World Walker&amp;rdquo; edition.  The Game Master edition gives you even more, including ideas about campaigns, enemy characters, and world building.  We know that veteran and starting players and game masters are all going to find things they can use, and ideas to spark their characters, campaigns and game worlds!  Come on - You&amp;rsquo;ve got nothing to lose!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains 18 pages of content, compared to the full version which contains 48 pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
