							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Euthymia</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Euthymia uses a shared bottle of drink (palatable to all players) in separate glasses as a type of randomizer; having more drink remaining in a glass gives the owning player an advantage during conflict.  The rules detail when glasses may be refilled.  The game also uses a standard pack of French playing cards and players may bid during conflicts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game have Aspects (Traits, which are narrative tags); Aspects have a value indicating their relative strength.  The game is played in ten rounds.  The first round involves the shared creation of world and the types of people that live in it.  One player secretly becomes an agent (the &amp;quot;bad guy&amp;quot;) for the remaining rounds.  Play then proceeds as a series of narrative developments and resolved conflicts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
