							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Stick Super Jock Hockey</name>
									
			<description>Similar to other Super Jock games, the player pounds the jocks head to propel the puck.  The other player is the goalie, which is a plastic piece with a handle, and tried to prevent the jock from scoring.  The players take turns trying to score and the winner is the one that scores the most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
