			<description>An abstract game combining piece elimination strategy with memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players mix 12 tiles of their color face down in a square pattern and then reveal 2/3 by flipping them face up. The player with the fewest face up tiles in his color goes first. Each move consists of a die roll followed by the move of either one of his face up pieces or a face down piece in a series of horizontal or vertical hops onto other pieces or stacks of pieces, which ends by flipping the moved piece, and removing the piece (if any) the moved piece was on top of when it started. Players who cannot make exactly the number of steps rolled with any legal piece must pass. Once all players have passed, the game ends and the player with the most visible pieces his color wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
