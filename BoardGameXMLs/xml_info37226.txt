							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">UFO Red Alert</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Commander Straker has just about the toughest job on this planet - defending Earth for our safety. Now here's your chance to match your skill against the menacing UFO'S. The game can be played by two to seven people. One person takes the role of Straker and defends the Earth by shooting down the UFO's while the other one to six players divide the UFO's between them and try to land on Earth.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game included a 29 x 19 inch tri-fold game board, an instruction sheet, six UFO pieces, five earth defense ships, and a die. The game came in a black soft plastic folder rather than a box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
