			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A shocked and divided Denmark looks on while Prime Minister Ninna Bro J&amp;oslash;rgensen drifts between life and death at Othello Private Hospital, after the attack on Tuesday evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nothing much is known to explain the cold-blooded attack. Nothing is known about the perpetrator or motive, but everything indicates that Denmark has experienced its first attempted political assassination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the day, hundreds of mourners have lit candles in a daylong vigil.  Meanwhile, political opponents stood in line to distance themselves from the crime. For a moment, there was almost peace in an election campaign, which otherwise has been abnormally vituperative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moderate candidate Frank Damsted had good need of his hired bodyguards when an excited mob surged forward, screaming about murder. &amp;quot;They must be as disturbed as the sick person that started all this,&amp;quot; was his only comment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
