							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Modern Ruins 6</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;his is a 40 x 40 inch Battlemap of a Modern Ruin, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Someone has to go through the gate to gather supplies. When you entered the camp you knew this as a price of your entry. Your lot numbers say it&amp;rsquo;s your time to get supplies.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;John Turner, Camp Leader&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern Ruins 6 is an exterior map of a ruined city block with three barricades in the northwest, southwest, and east. The east barricade has the main gate and a guard tower. The middle of the area has three shanty buildings that the camp of survivors uses for shelter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern Ruins 6 is intended for use in modern post-apocalyptic survivor games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map makes an excellent survivor camp and base in a post-apocalyptic game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Camp Turner: John Turner&amp;rsquo;s urban encampment is barely holding on as food, water, and bullets continue to deplete. Surrounded on all sides by zombies, the entire encampment drew lots for the next group of scavengers to leave the camp and explore the ruins of the city for food, water, and bullets. Looks like the player characters are the &amp;ldquo;winners&amp;rdquo; of this lottery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;John Turner gives them a K-ration, a canteen, and a pistol with six bullets. He suggests they save their last bullet for themselves, beats the pain of beating eaten. As they open the gate, the zombies come pouring at the camp, forcing the camp guards to fire on them as the group escapes into the city under the cover of darkness to look for supplies to keep themselves alive and the camp if they decide to return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When they attempt to come back to the camp, they are chased by zombies. They have to fend them off long enough for the camp to open the gates again. Worse, the zombies have come in full force to attack all three sides of the encampment and try to break through the barricades again. Will the group and Camp Turner survive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
