			<description>From the Back Cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bristling with Possibilities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cities and Settlements is packed with timeless material.  The designers, led by Jeff Ibach, present nineteen separate settings. The settings comprise a wide variety of settlements and cities; wilderness, desert camps, orc strongholds, gnoll camps, dwarven halls and human villages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This  is a sourcebook that both players and game masters can use.  Complete with maps and illustrations, Cities and Settlements is the definitive sourcebook for game settings.  Each community is an officially sized Thorp, Hamlet, Village or Small Town complete with stat blocks conforming to the rules presented in the updated rules along with a full  history and background with notes on customs, laws, religion, and more.  Each presents a different interesting culture; NPCs bristling with interactive possibilities, plots and adventure hooks and offers some new d20 crunchy bits to add to your game as well, from prestige classes to poisons, spells to new monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Any Campaign&lt;br/&gt;This useful sourcebook can be used for well structured homebrew campaigns or for those on they moment, fly by the seat of yor pants escapades into a night's round of iron and blood.  The enterprising players will find a host of background material to flesh out those skeletal character histories ad add a world of depth to their play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
