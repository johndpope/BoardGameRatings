			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original version of what became S4: The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth (note the different spelling of the last word). Originally written for WinterCon V by Gary Gygax.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is estimated the print run of the module is only 300.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Counting the pages is difficult. Most accounts of this module list &amp;quot;8 loose leaf pages&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, there is the cover itself that's 11 by 17 inches, there are 4 8.5 by 11 inch sheets with typing front and back. One 8.5 by 11 sheet with 4 illustrations, each occupying a 5.5 by 8 inch space, and 6 5.5 by 8 inch single sided character sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The character sheets were printed two to a page and then cut in half when used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the only module by Gary Gygax that was published separately for the original version of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
