							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hardwood Spades</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hardwood Spades is a very reasonable adaptation of the classic card game onto an online platform. The classic game is included and follows the same rules you would use while playing with real cards. The object is to bid on winning tricks and to avoid overbidding. Silvercreek has included local single-player and online multiplayer for up to four people. There are some graphical enhancements to the game that let you alter the background of the playing area. You can also &amp;quot;foom&amp;quot; the other players (which is sort of like an animated emoticon) as a means of taunting them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
