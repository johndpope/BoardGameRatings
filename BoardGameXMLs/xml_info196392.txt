							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Turin Market</name>
									
			<description>Turin Market is an auction set collection game for 2-5 players, takes 10-30 minutes to play, and utilizes bluffing, silent auctions, sales, and loans. It is incredibly quick and easy to pick up, but has a deep breadth of strategy driven by player interaction and perceptive card value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 18 goods cards in the game, each with 3 of one good, 2 of another, and 1 of another. The goal of the game is to have the most Scudo (aka money) when the game ends. Each round all players will put one card from their hand in the center, and reveal them simultaneously. Then all players will participate in a Silent Auction, with the highest bidder receiving the most cards and so on down the chain. All players who received any cards pay their bid to the bank, and anyone who did not receive a card (lowest bidders) will pay half their bid rounded down. Everyone will then have the option to put a card they have won up for sale using their own Scudo as collateral for the sale price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are slight variations based on the number of players, such as keeping a secret card in your hand until game end to add to your goods. In the 2-4 player games there are 5 auction rounds, after which a payout phase begins. Players with the most of each good are paid an amount from bank, as well as 1 Scudo from each other player with any of the good. Once payout is complete, everyone pays back their loans (taken out for 10 and paid back for 15) and the game is over. The player with the most Scudo is declared the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
