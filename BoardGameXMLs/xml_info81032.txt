			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Embark on a quest to build your all-time fantasy football team by competing against opponents while managing a salary cap to become the best General Manager in football history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build your fantasy team with the roster of trading cards provided or use your own trading cards from any era to enhance your roster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play:&lt;br/&gt;Players pick up challenge cards in the categories they are trying to advance in, example &amp;quot;Touchdowns&amp;quot;, a sample of one question would be &amp;quot;how many career Touchdowns does your opponent's Wide Receiver have? Your opponent will then tell you who their Wide Receiver (trading card) is and the last year of statistics on his/her card. For Example, &amp;quot;My Wide Receiver is Jerry Rice and the last year of stats is 1996. You must then make your best guess as to how many Touchdowns you think Jerry Rice had by the end of the 1996 season. The closer you are to the correct answer, the further up the fantasy charts you go in the Touchdowns category. So....the more you know about Jerry Rice and how many Touchdowns he averaged, the better guess you can make as your answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't ever have to be exact, but the closer you are to the correct answer the faster you move up the fantasy category charts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
