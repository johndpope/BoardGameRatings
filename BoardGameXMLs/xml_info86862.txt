			<description>From the Preface:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all is said and done, Live Action Role Playing (short form: larp) is just playing - neither more nor less. And as with other forms of play, costumes and props are not a necessity. And yet it is more fun to play cops &amp;amp; robbers, when the robbers look like robbers and the pistols say &amp;quot;Bang!&amp;quot;. And therein lies part of the explanation for the popularity of larp in Denmark. For we are a small country with nearly 5.5 million citizens, and of those more than 100,000 play larp. 15 years ago that number was below 1,000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many reasons for this growth - not the least of them being the Lord of the Rings movies and the wave of Fantasy literature. But one of the most important reasons is, that the play has become more visual. Beautiful costumes and impressive settings can sometimes make you feel like you are part of a movie, and who doesn't dream of being the hero of one's own adventure? It was these reflections that laid the foundation for this, which is a collection of pictures from some of the larps we have done in 2008 - for children through the organization Junior Roleplaying Copenhagen and for the adults through The Roleplaying Factory organization. Because even though this is only the tip of the iceberg, when it comes to what Danish larp has to offer, it shows a little of the variety, diversity and enthusiasm that is hidden in the realm of imagination. So come with us through the universe of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A book of larp photos. Nearly all pages contain a single large colour photo. All the photos are from various larp events in 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
