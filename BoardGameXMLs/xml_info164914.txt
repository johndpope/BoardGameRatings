							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Asking for Trobils: Trobil Makers</name>
									
			<description>Trobil Makers is an expansion to Asking for Trobils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The small Sagan Colony, full of the galaxy's most ridiculously intelligent people, has taken it upon themselves to get rid of all the Trobils in Paradise by creating robot Trobil-eaters!  Of course, their programming went a little awry (as programming tends to do in these situations) and are now just as much trouble as real Trobils!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As if your job as a Trobil Hunter wasn't difficult enough, now you also have to get rid of these mechanical monstrosities!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trobil Makers adds 2 new Locations to the board called the Sagan Colony and Colony Ship.  The expansion also adds new Riffraff cards, new Bonus MechaTrobils, and a new deck of cards called Companions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
