			<description>Two Player card game in which each player attempts to reduce the other player's Power to zero before their own is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player selects a card from their hand as their leader, and plays additional cards to support it. The two sides compare their Attack and the loser's Power is reduced by the difference. After that each player loses Power for each card they have played and play proceeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's art is from postings on the Chicken Maker blog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
