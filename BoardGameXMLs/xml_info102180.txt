							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alabama Smith in Escape from Pompeii</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Alabama Smith in Escape from Pompeii&amp;quot; is a short adventure game, which consists of a series of relatively simple puzzles. The main protagonist is an American archaeology student called Alabama Smith, who is sent by his University to do some research in Italy, where his professor needs him to find an artifact that allows its bearer to travel through time. He soon discovers this &amp;quot;time traveling device&amp;quot;, and a conspiracy, involving a secret society.&lt;br/&gt;Basically it is an ordinary &amp;quot;point &amp;amp; click&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;seek &amp;amp; find&amp;quot; adventure, where some of the screen hotspots bring up an interactive window, that might contain required objects, or require some action to be performed. However, the difference being that the game keeps track of your score at the top of the screen, where a meter shows your scenario progress - and too many &amp;quot;wrong clicks&amp;quot; takes points off!&lt;br/&gt;Photorealistic visuals, and atmospheric audio make this already captivating adventure all the more compelling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
