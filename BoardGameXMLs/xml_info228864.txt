							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sentient Song</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It begins as a whisper on the wind. A melody so faint, most don&amp;rsquo;t even hear it. Except for the one who does. They hear it, they comprehend it, and it&amp;rsquo;s in their fertile brain that the infection takes root.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A creature of living song, the Sentient Song hails from an obscure plain of existence where sound is alive and dominant. Though it&amp;rsquo;s rare, sometimes a creature from this plane slips through into the material realm where it takes form as a traveling wisp of music that takes control of anyone who hears it clearly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once that&amp;rsquo;s happened, its host spreads its infecting song to others through any means it can.  Patient, conniving, and angry over its inability to return to its own plane, the Sentient Song will seek to take command of its new world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
