			<description>Greetings, brave adventurer! No doubt you've heard tales of the abandoned mine that brims with gemstones? It's also said to be a deep and dangerous place. Going down mines after treasure is really a dwarf's speciality, so rather than risk your own neck, why don't you head to the local tavern to recruit the wee buggers into doing your dirty work? The only problem is, the other players have had the same idea!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 60 Dwarves, the race is on to hire dwarves and collect the most valuable gems from down the mine. Unfortunately the hardest working dwarves are also the thirstiest, and they'll take some convincing to abandon their ales. Compete with other players for turn order and secure the best team - but will you trade quantity for quality, as the Dwarves on offer come and go? You had best make every turn count!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
