			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quaint village of Prayer&amp;rsquo;s Point is a prosperous place. Many folk believe it is blessed by the gods, for numerous aasimar children are born to its residents and visitors alike. As if the villagers needed additional confirmation their home is touched by divinity, the nearby river of Angel&amp;rsquo;s Run and the bay it feeds are famous for their waters, which shine with golden light each sunrise and sunset. Still, even such a tranquil place as Prayer&amp;rsquo;s Point isn&amp;rsquo;t without its problems. Whispered rumours speak of lycanthropes in the nearby forest, ghosts stalking the village&amp;rsquo;s graveyard and of strange, rotting carcasses floating down Angel&amp;rsquo;s Run. And looming above all hangs the horrible truth: terrible, unnatural things craving nothing more than wanton death lurk within nearby Mount Hoarfrost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a Dual Format PDF. The downloadable ZIP file contains two versions, one optimised for printing and use on a normal computer and one optimised for use on a mobile device such as an iPad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
