			<description>The gameboard is a map of the Eastern Hemisphere with the land masses divided into forty-eight territories. Each player will place units on the gameboard until the gameboard is filled. Each player then chooses one territory claimed as headquarters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player may either fortify established territories or attack an opponent. In an attack both players roll a die and the player who rolls the lower number must remove a number of units which is the difference between the two dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to eliminate all the opponents by taking over their headquarters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
