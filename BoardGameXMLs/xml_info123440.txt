							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Three Little Pigs: The Game</name>
									
			<description>Take on the role of one of the Three Little Pigs as you try to build a house strong enough before the Big Bad Wolf arrives to blow it down and eat you.  Move around the board collecting straw, sticks, and/or bricks and then bring them back to your building site to build your house before the big bad wolf arrives.  Will you risk travelling further to get to the brick pile, or build a house of straw quickly and then sit back and relax counting on luck to save you when the big bad wolf comes calling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch out, your brother pigs can steal what you&amp;rsquo;ve collected before you get it back to your house or speed up the wolf&amp;rsquo;s approach.  The pigs whose houses still stand at the end of the game are the winners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extra points are awarded for being lazy, but they only matter if your house can survive the coming wolf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you want to take your chances by building a house of straw?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have the time to gather the bricks for your house before the wolf arrives?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are your brother pigs going to steal your bricks before you can get them back to your house?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Move fast and be smart or it won't matter how much hair you have on your chinny chin chin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
