			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the great strengths of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is that it provides players with so many options for their characters. Yet that very strength can also be a source of confusion for new players and casual gamers. For folks who have school, careers, family, and other activities, the seemingly simple task of creating a character and periodically leveling up can feel like a serious commitment rather than a fun pastime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're not a &amp;quot;dummy&amp;quot;. You're not a &amp;quot;complete idiot&amp;quot;. But you could use a guide, so you can just sit down with your friends and play Pathfinder. Each 48 page Character Workbook was created with the time-crunched player in mind. It is intended to help those unfamiliar with the system, yet want to make a character that is perfect for them, filter out the things that may not apply and zero in on only the abilities that are relevant to their character Class. It also serves as a level-by-level guide to character advancement, reminding even experienced players what needs to be changed and what decisions need to be made when &amp;quot;leveling up&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
