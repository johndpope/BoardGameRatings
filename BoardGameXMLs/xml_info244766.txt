							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Relic Bearer</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Relic Bearer is a powerful tank and support class capable of protecting teammates and dishing out powerful attacks with it's unique weapon, the relic.  It is a class that can be manipulated heavily through role-playing to be incredibly interesting and dynamic.  It comes with three subclasses:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Order of Legends- The Order of Legends consists of gloryseekers and treasure hunters. Knowing they cannot find glory on their own, they carry the banner to inspire their fellow adventurers. They train with other fighters to hone their capabilities in combat and to reach peak athleticism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Order of Incantation- The Order of Incantation uses the arcane to forward their goals. They train with wizards to hone their craft and use powerful magics to carve out paths and destroy their foes. Though magicians, they stride headstrong into battle the same as other relic bearers, although with a magical trick up their sleeve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Order of Providence- Relic Bearers who join the Order of Providence devote themselves to an ideal or religion much bigger than themselves. Many give themselves fully to their higher power, allowing the gods to shape their life (and even body) as they see fit to aid the bearer in their quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
