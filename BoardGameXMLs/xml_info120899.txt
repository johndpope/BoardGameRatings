			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UFO? James Bond? Restaurant? What's your ID? The answer is &amp;quot;glued&amp;quot; to your face. It's more than just what you know. Be smart, do the right questions and guess your ID quickly. The cards, with very funny images, garantee laughs during all play. You will laugh and have fun trying to discover yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player attaches a headband with a card, and the card may have a famous person, a object or even a place. Players alternate turns asking questions, and the other players must answer either &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I don't know&amp;quot;. When a player correctly guesses the content of his card, he advances one space in the board, while the others continue with the same cards on their heads. The first player to cross the board is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
