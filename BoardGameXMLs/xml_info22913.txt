			<description>The game consists of a spiral recessed track, 32 small containers (8 in each of 4 colors) and 16 chips.  The chips are put in half the containers (four per color) and the containers are mixed together so that the locations of the chips are hidden.  The containers are placed in the spiral and players take turns rearranging the containers.  When players move pieces of their own color (or have permission from the owning player) they shake them and listen for the chips.  When four pieces of a color are in a row in the spiral, the player collects the chips contained within.  The first player to find all of his chips wins.  (The complete rules contain a number of additional details.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
