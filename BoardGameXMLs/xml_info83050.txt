			<description>Facing a sudden cataclysmic event on a distant planet, survivors from a remote military research outpost manage to transport themselves onto an ancient alien ship.  Earth appears to be the destination, but the ship is also making regular stops automatically along the way, giving the stowaways a chance to learn about alien worlds and scavenge for supplies.  The ancient ship contains both valuable scientific knowledge and exotic weapons technology.  The Military and the Civilian Scientist survivors both believe that if they outperform the other, they will be granted access to the ship when it reaches Earth.  But first they must survive...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will move about the ship and through the transporter gate exploring and finding much needed supplies and scientific knowledge.  Each player will have their own agendas.  The Civilian Scientists want to learn as much as they can about the worlds they are stopping at as well as the alien ship.  The Military player's duty is to keep the crew supplied and protect the civilians.  Each side will also need to deal with Threats as well as not let the other player get the upper hand with too much respect with the big wigs back on Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play consists of placing and responding to ship layout tiles (modular board) as well as responding to draw from a Gate Mission deck of mission cards with worker placement as well as cards drawn from a Results deck of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn Sequence&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.
