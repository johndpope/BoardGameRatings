			<description>A CARNIVAL OF DARKNESS HAS SPRUNG TO LIFE...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synchronized with the wavelength of dreams, the miserable Tyrant has discovered a way to enter them and convolute what children see, hear and feel while they sleep &amp;mdash; all for the benefit of his twisted amusement. Enter Flynn and his twin brother Floyd, two virtuous leprechauns who refuse to sit idly by while the Tyrant weaves his dreadful delusions. Get going, gents! There's no time to lose!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
