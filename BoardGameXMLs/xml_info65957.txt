			<description>Based on a French tv show from the 1970's. The game consists of 82 tokens, each one marked with a letter and a wooden board with two rows with 10 squares (in each square a token fits). Each round a player forms two words (one on each row) ranging from 4 to 5 letters. Then the players take turns to modify the words (changing or to make it longer by adding and / or removing one or more tokens). The player that manages to make the word that can't be changed anymore wins that round. The player who scores the most points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
