							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oil Pressure</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This mini-adventure was very generously developed for us by game designer, Talzhemir, co-creator of the popular MMORPG Furcadia, as a free download to celebrate the return of Villains and Vigilantes.&amp;quot; MONKEY HOUSE GAMES co-founder JACK HERMAN announced. &amp;quot;Oil Pressure has a storyline that can very easily be worked into your V&amp;amp;V&amp;quot; campaign. It&amp;rsquo;s an encounter leading up to a big battle with an especially despicable super-villain. It also includes a really cool new superhero character that can either accompany the players as an NPC, or be run by a player. It&amp;rsquo;s a little package that contains a lot of fun.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The response to the launch of our company and the re-launch of Villains and Vigilantes&amp;quot; has already far exceeded our expectations,&amp;quot; added MONKEY HOUSE GAMES&amp;quot; co-founder Jeff Dee. &amp;quot;So, to show our appreciation, we present Oil Pressure for Villains and Vigilantes- with bonus stats for Living Legends. Enjoy!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
