			<description>Challenge the Yankees is the official New York Yankees baseball game. A two-player baseball simulation strategy game, it was published in 1964 and 1965 by Hassenfeld Brothers (now Hasbro), in conjunction with its creator, Roger Franklin. CTY uses the lifetime statistics of players, as of the prior season. 250,000 copies were sold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player manages the Yankees' 25-man roster, while the other manages a team of 25 MLB All-Stars. Players can also manage a team of their own creation, using blank player cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is represented by a Player Performance strategy card, which contains his photograph, autograph, lifetime batting average (as of the prior year's season), and some basic biographical information. Each card also contains twelve outcomes that detail the result of the roll of two dice. Ex: if Mickey Mantle is at bat and the Yankees manager roles a 3, Mantle hits a home run. If a player hits a single, double, triple, ground ball, or fly ball, the fielding team's manager draws a corresponding Fielders Action card. Ex: Mantle hits a single; the Fielder Actions card says the batter is safe at first, runner on first advances 1 base, all other runners score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Original copies are rare today. Individual player cards and full sets are highly sought after and often fetch hundreds of dollars on secondary markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the 1964 edition of Challenge the Yankees is now being reproduced by creator Roger Franklin; his uncle, Richard Franklin; and his grandson, Michael Sokolow. The team will be funding the manufacture of a new run of the game using an Indiegogo campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information about the game can be found at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.challengetheyankees.co&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.challengetheyankees.co&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
