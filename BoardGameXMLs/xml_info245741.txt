			<description>Taco Ninja Adventure is a card game for 2-6 players created by Turn Sideways Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are unique Taco Ninjas with special abilities and play on 2 teams. Players land attacks on the opposing team's Taco Ninjas by rolling combinations on 5 dice. Players can power up their attacks by learning new, more powerful attacks in the Dojo. Players may also play tricks in the form of item cards acquired while training in the Dojo. If a Taco Ninja's life points go to 0, they go to the afterlife. In the afterlife Taco Ninjas can heal their friends on the battlefield, and if they are very lucky, they can come back from the afterlife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One team wins when the life total of all opposing Taco Ninja's are sent to the afterlife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free Print and Play and Rules are available at TacoNinjaAdventure.com. &lt;br/&gt;Print and Play is being updated as new artwork is being completed.&lt;br/&gt;Kickstarter launch targeted for Q4 2018.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
