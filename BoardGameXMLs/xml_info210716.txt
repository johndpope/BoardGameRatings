			<description>Description from the publihser:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mime Control is a fresh and lively twist on classic charades. Short instructions and intense gameplay make this one ideal for parties and energetic groups of friends looking for a few laughs. In the game, players must work together with a partner to get the crowd to guess the four items on the card before the time expires. Only one player sees the card. That player stays out of view to everyone except their partner and acts out the items on the card. The partner mimics every action to try to get the crowd to guess correctly. Points are awarded for correct guesses. Opposing teams get a chance to steal points on each round. Everyone is either acting or guessing on every turn, so there is never any down-time, sitting around twiddling your thumbs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
