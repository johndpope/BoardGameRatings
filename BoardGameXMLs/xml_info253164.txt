			<description>To get out of Baketage Museum (バケタージュ美術館), you must first free the four ghosts that are guarding the exits &amp;mdash; and to do that, you must find the paired objects where these ghosts have placed their spirit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up the game, create the stage inside the game box, then place your phone in the stage once you've downloaded the app needed for the game. Place the cards in a circle around the stage, then place each of the playing figures on a separate card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, you roll the die, then move your figure the indicated number of spaces in either direction. You then take the card you've landed on and any other card in the circle and you hold those cards near your face within view of the phone's camera. The app reads the image on the back of each card and transforms each half of your face in some way. Perhaps your left eye grows to an enormous balloon, while your right eye curls like a rainbow. If the cards don't transform your face in the same eye, you return them to their places in the circle, with everyone else remembering what they saw on your face. Perhaps they should tell a story about what the objects you saw in the museum and why they made you look that way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you don't make a match, you lose one of your life tokens, and if someone runs out of tokens, you lose the game. If you do find a match, then great! Remove those cards from play. You're one step closer to escaping the museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The app randomizes which cards have which effects each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
