							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Peregrinus: Santiago de Compostela</name>
									
			<description>The players are pilgrims that get lost in an old enchanted forest. In order to find the exit they have to collect the magical items watched by Meiga, Moura and Lobishome in their dwellings, but...be careful! one of the players is the Santa Compa&amp;ntilde;a, who disguised like a pilgrim try to undermine its playmates' pursuit and turn them one by one in its allies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player has a Character card that shows if it is a Pilgrim or the Santa Compa&amp;ntilde;a. He can't show it to the other players. Each player will use Pathway cards to move around the board choosing every turn what card have to play (they can be steps, bridge or do not move). Every Pilgrim has to look for two item cards shown in his Character card. The item cards are kept in the creature dwellings. In order to gain these cards the Pilgrim has to pay life tokens to the keepers. &lt;br/&gt;In the meantime the Santa Compa&amp;ntilde;a player, secretly, will use its cards to threaten the other players, steal their life tokens and finally convert them to its allies. The only way for the Pilgrims to save themselves is to discover who is the Santa Compa&amp;ntilde;a, use defensive item cards to repel it or finally find the requested cards to open the magical door and escape, reaching Santiago de Compostela.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peregrinus is a dynamic and amusing game where luck, teamwork, intuition and strategy are equally necessary in order to discover dangers, find out the correct magical items, leave the enchanted forest before being caught by the Santa Compa&amp;ntilde;a and reach Santiago. So, dare to enter the forest?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
