			<description>Rolemodels: The Battle For Vyk'Tornaahl &amp;mdash; a limited-edition, RPG-themed card game curated and designed by Light Grey Art Lab &amp;mdash; features a diverse collection of alter-egos and fantasy self portraits from 99 artists from around the globe. Each of these artists have traded in their pencils and brushes for battle armor and wands in an effort to embrace their inner swordsman, warrior, and healer. This exhibition of artwork celebrates each artist as a creator, individual, and a modern-day art hero and role model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each artist's self-portrait represents a character in the game that players use to outwit their enemies, form their ranks, battle against foes, define their allies, and go to battle in the hope of obtaining influence and, ultimately, power over the fallen land of Vyk'Tornaahl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At heart Rolemodels is a poker variant with additional rules and flavor. Players start the game with five cards in hand. Three cards from the deck are revealed to form the Adventurer's Tavern. At the start of a round, the dealer rolls a d20 die to determine the amount of influence up for grabs. Each player then takes one of two actions on his turn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Draw two cards, one from the Adventurer's Tavern and the other from the face-up cards or the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Declare battle, which takes place in two phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Scout Phase: Whoever started the battle plays two cards (called &amp;quot;Scouts&amp;quot;) face up in front of him. Each other player in turn decided whether to pass or join the battle; in the latter case, they also play two Scouts face up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Reinforcements Phase: First, a player can choose to surrender and withdraw from battle. All players who don't surrender, then simulaneously play and reveal three cards as reinforcements. Whoever has the strongest cards wins the available influence; in games with three and four players, the second best hand wins half this amount of influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After discard all played cards, the player who initiated battle draws two cards, then a new round begins. When one player has fifty or more influence, the game ends and he wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
