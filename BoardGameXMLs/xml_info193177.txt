			<description>When you go shopping you must make sure to get everything you need while being attentive to the Daily Specials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Supermarket Shuffle, players will draft cards to gain points over three rounds. Every round there are Daily Specials which will make the cards less expensive, but you must make sure that you can buy everything at the end of every round because you only start with $10 at the beginning of each round. After bonuses are handed out at the end of the third round, the player with the most points at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
