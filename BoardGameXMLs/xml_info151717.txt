							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lair of the Mist Men</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first Sunken City Mini-Adventure is here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most find death in the crumbling ruins that stretch beyond sight into the mists south of the Great City; once rich districts now claimed by swamp and dark denizens. But for the desperate folk of the city, the ruins offer treasures the Great City denies them: fortune, glory, and a fighting chance! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The day has come when you can finally confront an enemy previously cloaked in mist, hidden and impervious to retaliation. For the past 3 months, strange creatures known as Mist Men have plagued your village and roads, striking without warning or apparent purpose, only to vanish into the mists from whence they came. After their latest raid, however, they left something behind: a talisman found by a farm boy that will guide you to their hidden lair. Finally, questions will be answered, and revenge will be yours to savor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;Lair of the Mist Men is a short adventure designed to be run in a session or two for 6-8 1st-level characters. The Mist Men were first introduced in SC-2: The Ooze Pits of Jonas Gralk, but the initial battle with the Mist Men found in that adventure has been reproduced here for those who wish to introduce the Mist Men to their campaign without also including Slither&amp;rsquo;s End and its environs. (Though we encourage everyone to check out The Ooze Pits of Jonas Gralk... it's tremendously fun!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
