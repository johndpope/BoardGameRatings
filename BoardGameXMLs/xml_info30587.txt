			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;By the year 2750, the 150 year old galaxy-wide war had escalated to the point where casualties were measured in millions per day.  Entire populations were wiped out and planets made uninhabitable by the fallout of warfare.  Faced with annihilation, both sides (the United Democratic Planets or UDP and the Republic of Soviet-Socialist Planets or RSSP)developed an alternative method of waging war.  Their solution was the Omega Suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Omega Suit represents the ultimate development of military technology.  Each suit stands over 7' tall and is manned by a genetically superior soldier called an Omega Warrior.  The Omega Suit is a fully enclosed system which enhances strength, reflexes and senses of its wearer.  Omega Suits can withstand tremendous amounts of damage and can carry enough firepower to lay waste to an entire division of conventional armored vehicles.  Instead of sending tens of thousands of infantry to fight a battle, the same goal can be accomplished with a handful of Omega Warriors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Now, in the year 3000 AD, the war continues.  Big armies, while maintained by the larger factions involved in the war, are seldom used.  Most battles are fought by the Omega Warriors and where they go the ground trembles and the skies burn, for no target is out of their reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Omega Warrior is a miniature rules set for creating the battles of the future using 6mm-28mm figures.  Omega Warrior is a complete rules system, including rules for conventional infantry, vehicles, robots, AIs, and of course, the Omega Warriors themselves.  Also included are army lists and a campaign system.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
