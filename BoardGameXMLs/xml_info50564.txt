			<description>From the back of the book...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For many years, Evermeet has remained a mystery, known only as the elves place of refuge. So far, details about the island itself, its geography, rulers, and society have been sketchy. It is known that Evermeet is protected by illusory magic, that ships lose their way or vanish mysteriously if they approach the isle, and that the elven navy is the finest in the Realms. Past publications have revealed that Evermeet is rules by Queen Amlaruil, and that her husband Zaor was murdered decades ago. Beyond this , little is known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Elves of Evermeet attempts to investigate and explain the inner workings of the elven island, and develop the realm as a setting for Forgotten Realms adventures. Until now, Evermeet has been reserved exclusively for elves and officially closed to humans, dwarves, and other races. But this product will help work Evermeet into your campaign and allow other PC races to visit, or at least interact, with the mysterious island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; New elven magic (for High Mages),&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Elven NPC's&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Tips on playing Evermeet elves, and&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Adventure ideas for your own campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring the wonder that is Evermeet into your game, with this sourcebook. It's a mystery no more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
