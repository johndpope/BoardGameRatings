							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ASE Character Tumbler</name>
									
			<description>designer's comment:&lt;br/&gt;I decided to rewrite my character tumbler for Basic Fantasy for ASE (and for Basic D&amp;amp;D). The layout is the same, but the professions are all fresh and are, dare I say it, cleverer and more likely to produce amusing gameplay. I also took the liberty of crafting logos and slogans for the two pre-apocalyptic corporations that (SPOILER) unearthed the Anomalous Subsurface Environment&amp;mdash;check all this out after the jump.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those unfamiliar with the concept, a character tumbler (or funnel, as the genius inventors at DCC RPG call it) starts each player off with four sadsack 0-Level characters who are forced into a dungeon. Each has -100 XP, and most will die quickly. But those who survive to 1 XP attain Level 1, and become full-fledged PCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user note:&lt;br/&gt;The designer states that this character tumbler is written for Basic D&amp;D, this will also work with Labyrinth Lord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
