							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doomsday Cult 2000</name>
									
			<description>In Doomsday Cult 2000, players take the role of cult leaders bent on bringing about the end of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, each player secretly chooses a Doomsday date in the month of December, 1999 (play commences on December 1st, and each turn is one day long). From there, play mechanics are reminiscent of Steve Jackson's Illuminati: cards representing potential cult members (a/k/a Sheep) are dealt into a common pool in the middle of the table. Players in their turn use Influence to recruit Sheep for their Flock (cult); each new Sheep you control adds to your Influence, and many of them grant special abilities as well. In addition to recruiting uncontrolled Sheep, you can also try to convert (steal) or &amp;quot;deprogram&amp;quot; (make uncontrolled) Sheep belonging to other players' Flocks, or declare jihad and have one of your Sheep making a suicide attack on one of your rivals' Sheep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When your chosen Doomsday comes around, all of the Sheep you currently control commit ritual mass suicide in an attempt to trigger the apocalypse. A die roll determines whether they succeed; the more Sheep you sacrifice, the better the odds. If you do successfully end the world, you win; if you fail, you pick a new Doomsday and start gathering a Flock again; if the world hasn't ended by January 1st, 2000, everybody loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is DTP quality, with the cards laser-printed on (pre-cut) heavy marbled paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
