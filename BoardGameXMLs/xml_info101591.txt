							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Captain Bible in the Dome of Darkness</name>
									
			<description>Captain Bible in Dome of Darkness was a Christian video game title released by Bridgestone Multimedia Group in 1994. The main focus of the game is scripture memorization but action video game elements can also play a significant role depending on options selected during setup.&lt;br/&gt;The game centers around a city of humans which was one day encased by a Dome of Darkness, perpetrated by robot 'cybers,' who have trapped the citizens in lies. While the organization known as Bible Corps has managed to make a hole in the dome, they have not been able to accomplish much more.&lt;br/&gt;Captain Bible is engaged by Bible Corps to be beamed into the city. Though he is able to take his computer Bible with him, all of the verses are erased. To remedy this, Bible Corps beams Scripture stations into the city where he may reload it. Gameplay centers around Captain Bible obtaining these verses and using them to confront the cybers who obstruct the hallways of the buildings in the city. An optional feature allows the player to engage the cybers in hand-to-hand combat, which is performed using the Sword of the Spirit and the Shield of Faith.&lt;br/&gt;The game is presumably set in the somewhat distant future based upon several of the game details, including the cybers themselves, the transporter-type device used to beam Captain Bible into the Dome, and the spacecraft he uses in the opening screen to fly to the command post.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Captain Bible in Dome of Darkness&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
