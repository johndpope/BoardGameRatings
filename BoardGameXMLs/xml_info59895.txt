			<description>This product is a consolidation of all the encounters from the Dungeonaday.com website that makes up level 1 of the Dragon's Delve dungeon. It is available for free download by Charter Members or Yearly Dungeonaday.com subscribers, or for purchase for a small fee (as of Oct 2009 US$5) for Quarterly and Monthly subscribers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first level of the dungeon appears to be an old ruin, but it&amp;rsquo;s actually the youngest portion of the entire complex. Most of it was built by Duke Chordille for storage, keeping prisoners, and eventually to honor the goddess Glarias. As the subterranean portion of the keep expanded, the duke&amp;rsquo;s workers found old chambers originally built by Queen Ryssa&amp;rsquo;s dwarves. This allowed the duke&amp;rsquo;s dungeon to connect to the other levels, although the duke kept the rest of the dungeon a secret from all but his most trusted confidants and forbade anyone to explore its depths for fear of rousing something dangerous (a wise move, really&amp;mdash;the duke apparently knew something about the nature of dungeons).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
