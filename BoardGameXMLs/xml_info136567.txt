							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Influence: Rise of a Roman</name>
									
			<description>Influence is a a game set in ancient Rome, where each player competes to become the Emperor. This is done by passing laws to gain influence points with the four people classes: Military, Priests, Upper Class, and Lower Class. The game centres around bribing, bidding, and the use of action cards to further progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in rounds, with several phases in each round. Players move to different areas of the city of Rome to increase their influence in a particular class, trade, bribe, and interact with other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A round consists of the Draw Phase, where players may draw and play action cards; the Trade Phase, where players may trade and bribe each others support in coming phases; the Move phase, where players must move to an area of the city to increase their points in a particular class; and the Forum phase, where players bribe the current Emperor to pass the law that benefits them the most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Influence is a social, reasonably paced game with no waits between turns, and a variable game length.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
