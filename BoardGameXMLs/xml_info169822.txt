							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Uresia: Grave of Heaven, All-Systems Library</name>
									
			<description>From Publisher's Page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gods have died, heaven has fallen, and man has rebuilt his world on the wreckage. The Elves belong to an ancient demon. The Dwarves can turn to smoke and walk on the wind. Men wage wars of trade for the emeralds which fuel the most powerful sorceries, and the Satyrs sail the high seas ... to stage panty-raids. Beneath it all, the dungeons are the crushed remains of heaven itself. This is Uresia, the acclaimed, eccentric, and basically good-natured fantasy world by S. John Ross.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A world explored at several zoom-levels, from the broad sweep of kingdoms to a detailed fantasy city to the day-to-day of a remote rural village to the individual troubles and triumphs of specific characters across the grave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Familiar enough to provide firm footing for traditional-fantasy fans (it's a world of warriors, wizards, thieves and vagabonds), but with a warmth &amp;amp; personality entirely its own, with unexpected details around every corner (it's a world where Slimes and haunted snowmen are valid PCs, the &amp;quot;common tongue&amp;quot; is dangerous in the wrong company, and your campaign is just as likely to visit a sporting arena as the nearby trap-laden ruin).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed from the core as a game world. Every detail chosen to inspire characters and adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uresia comes from the author of such timeless classics as a cartoon in Dragon Magazine that one time, and a pretty good recipe for General Tso's Chicken. It's a wholly-revised-and-expanded edition, perfect for newcomers and satisfying to long-time fans. Uresia is fully illustrated, indexed, mapped, has clicky-things for the screen readers and removable layers for the home-printers. Every copy is made of 100% post-consumer recycled genre love and nitrate-free pixels. Serve with snacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Comment: this is a system neutral version of this setting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
