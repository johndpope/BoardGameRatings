			<description>Rauf und Runter is a roll-and-move board game with a meerkat theme on two layers with a few twists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player's meerkat pawns are magnetic and move therefore simultaneously on the top and bottom side of the gaming board.&lt;br/&gt;Players start in the corners and must move their meerkat to a specific location, randomly revealed, and back to a corner. Roll the die and move accordingly one to three spaces to your destination. Borders (hedges, walls) may not be crossed. Then it's the move of the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once reaching a corner, however, the board is immediately turned upside down and play commences on this side. Players that did not reached their target space get a random one-shot-bonus of either moving two extra spaces, crossing a border, or taking a second move. The first player to visit all locations, then reach a corner wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be sure not to lift your meerkat from the board while moving as this will cause the corresponding figure to fall off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
