							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Confessions: The Game of Secrets and Lies</name>
									
			<description>Confessions: The Game of Secrets &amp;amp; Lies is a simple bluffing game. You read a card prompt and tell a story, giving as many or as few details as you want. The other players guess if you're telling the truth or a lie. The genius? The card prompts range from hilarious to fantastically awkward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you enjoy playing games like Cards Against Humanity, Truth or Dare &amp;amp; Never Have I Ever, it's likely that you'll LOVE playing Confessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Confessions pack includes 308 cards (298 Confession cards &amp;amp; 10 voting cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Confessions can also be played as an adult drinking game and the alternative drinking rules are included with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the naughty nature of the Confessions game, we recommend that it's played by guys and girls who are 17+ years of age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is NOT a family card game and we strongly recommend that you don&amp;rsquo;t play this with your parents or children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
