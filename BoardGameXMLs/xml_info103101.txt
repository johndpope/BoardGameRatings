			<description>The Legend of Blacksilver is a fantasy adventure game which is an indirect sequel to the game Legacy of the Ancients.&lt;br/&gt;The principal character in the game is first contacted by Princess Aylea in a dream-vision. They are told that the evil Baron Taragas from the Kingdom of Maelbane has conspired with a local baron, Baron Mantrek, to find a magical material called Blacksilver. Supposedly in the hands of evil, Blacksilver could be used to create weapons of mass destruction.
