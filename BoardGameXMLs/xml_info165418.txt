			<description>Worms Battlegrounds is an artillery strategy video game developed and published by Team 17. It was released on 30 May 2014 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Set within a world history museum, the single-player story follows the player's worms attempt to stop Lord Crowley-Mesmer, a worm attempting to take control of the museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See also: Gameplay in the Worms series&lt;br/&gt;Worms Battlegrounds is an artillery strategy game. Gameplay follows on the earlier games of the series, in which teams of worms take turns to use a variety of weapons and items in order to eliminate the opposing teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a total of sixty five weapons, which is the most in any Worms game to date. Among the ten new weapons is a ray gun, which was created due to the criticism of that the ninja rope wasn't authentic enough compared to older Worms games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Xbox One version enables Xbox SmartGlass to keep track of stats, while the PlayStation 4's DualShock light bar changes color depending on the status of the player's worm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Worms Battlegrounds&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
