			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's exciting, it's challenging. It's Cubular! Join in the 4-player action where strategies are built and alliances are formed. Be the only player left standing as you out-maneuver and out-wit your opponents. Grow a legion of cubes by jumping your opponents to &amp;quot;flip&amp;quot; their color to your own, but be careful because it's 3 against 1. Cubular is a fast-paced strategy game that will have you fully engaged in every player's move. Developed within the classical style of board games, Cubular adds a fresh, original spin to the game-play. Cubular is also a great game for helping students develop strategic thinking and problem solving skills in the classroom. Included are directions for 4-player and 2-player games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
