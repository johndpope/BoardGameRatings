			<description>quizzone is a trivia game containing 3.000 questions in 10 categories (Music, Movies &amp;amp; TV, Language &amp;amp; literature, History and religion, Sport and leisure, Art and culture, The world, Society and business, Out and about, Nature and science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is two sided. On one side all 10 categories are in play and have a predefined color. On the other side you choose 6 categories to play with and define their color by placing a token on colored circles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is possible to play as individuals or teams - up to 8 in total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player places their token on one of the squares at the rim of the circular board. There must be at least one free space between players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the game starts you get a question in the color that you are standing on - if you answer the question correctly you move one space closer to the centre. If you answer incorrectly nothing happens. The winner is the one that reaches the centre first and answers a question of a self chosen category correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives 4 tactics cards at the start of the game and 2 extra every time you land on a shaded square (though only once in a ring of the board). Normally you can only move directly forward towards the centre but the tcatics cards change this. Some cards let you move a player token of your own chosing back or forward or sideways or even diagonally. Other cards let you answer other players cards, force other players to answer yours or let you choose the category of a question disregarding which color you are currently on. Finally there are cards that override other cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you land on a square where another player already is standing he is sent 2 squares further away from the centre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
