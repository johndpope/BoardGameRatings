							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War on Terror</name>
									
			<description>War on Terror, the application is an absurdly addictive and wickedly satirical strategy game of global domination liberation. Imagine a darkly comedic alliance between Risk, Monopoly and Settlers of Catan and you're halfway there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This app is the long-awaited computer version of our best-selling board game, War on Terror, the boardgame. Over the years, no fewer than three developers have told us it was impossible to translate this game to mobile - and we were inclined to agree with them. Then we met David Partouche, a French, vegan anarchist and A.I. specialist who refused to take 'no' for an answer. A year later, War on Terror, the application exploded onto the App Store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you expand your empire, secure the best oil reserves, strike up alliances and generally bomb, nuke and war your way to FREEDOM!(TM), here's a taster of exactly what's in store for you:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     INTERACTIVE WORLD MAP, WITH 49 TERRITORIES&lt;br/&gt;     DYNAMIC OIL DISTRIBUTION (EVERY GAME IS DIFFERENT)&lt;br/&gt;     ADVANCED, REACTIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE&lt;br/&gt;     ANONYMOUS TERRORIST FUNDING&lt;br/&gt;     ALL ORIGINAL ARTWORK BY AWARD-WINNING ILLUSTRATOR, TOM MORGAN-JONES&lt;br/&gt;     ORIGINAL SOUND AND MUSIC BY ROBERT TALIESIN OWEN&lt;br/&gt;     ADDITIONAL MUSIC BY JARVIS COCKER!&lt;br/&gt;     AND PERHAPS THE MOST DISTURBING CREDITS SCREEN EVER&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
