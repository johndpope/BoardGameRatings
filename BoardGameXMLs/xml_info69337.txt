			<description>With a strong will like steel Spartans responsed to the call of war:&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Go tell the Spartans, stranger passing by,&lt;br/&gt;that here, obedient to their law, we lie.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;-Simonides.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;During the 2nd Persian Invasion to Greece  and after the battles of Thermopylae, Artemision and Boeotia led by Xerxes himself, the Persians retreated after their first loss at the naval Battle of Salamis. Persian forces retreated to Asia and General Mardonius returned to finish what the Persian King has started. He built a fortified camp outside Plataea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greeks have assembled an army allied by many cities of ancient Greece. Spartans led the forces of Peloponnesos , Athenians answered the call with many other cities. It was Summer of 479 BC where the two armies has met each other opposed , even if at the Percian forces had many greek traitors  and mercenaries,  for a battle that actually ended the Persian vanquishment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General Mardonius met his own destiny in this battle, and General Pausanias from Sparta, has archived a victory , even if their forces were outnumbered.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Steel Will: 479 BC, The Battle of Plataea&amp;quot; is a history-themed wargame for two players that simulates that battle. With an abstract taste of gameplay, the core of classic historic-wargame and the feeling of a new approach at combat mechanism, we tried to create something that keeps the interest of the players alive!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
