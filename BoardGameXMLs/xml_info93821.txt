							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mercury Boulevard</name>
									
			<description>From the rules: The idea of the game is to get out of town. To do so you must reach either the Hampton Roads Tunnel, the James River Bridge, or the Williamsburg Pottery Company.  However, before arriving at one of these exits, the player must visit a landmark within the town. Landmarks to visit are designated at the start of the game by a card drawn by each player from the deck on the All America Game Symbol. The game starts at Fort Monroe. Players roll one die and move their markers along Mercury Boulevard the number of squares indicated. Two to eight players may play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
