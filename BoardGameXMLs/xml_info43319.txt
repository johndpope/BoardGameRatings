			<description>This game is played in two ways.  First, by matching the States and their respective Capitals correctly together. 6 Cards with either a state or a capital are dealt to each player. Then each player draws one card from the stack until all cards are picked.  Each player discards face up to the center, one card at a time that they do not want and picks up one card that they do want to match their hand. When all cards are correctly matched, the one having the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You seperate all of the state and capital cards, placing the Capital cards on the table face up. The State cards are dealt to the players to form a hand. The dealer shouts &amp;quot;GO!&amp;quot; Every player picks up matching Capital cards as fast as they can. The first player to match his State cards with their matching Capital cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
