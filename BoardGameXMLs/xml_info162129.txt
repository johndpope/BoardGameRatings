							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Skunny: Wild West</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skunny: Wild West follows Skunny after the events of Skunny: Save our Pizzas.  After recovering the recipe for pizza in ancient Rome, Skunny attempts to travel back to his home time.  Unfortunately, he gets stuck in 1909 where his father is suffering from the acts of a sheep thief.  Skunny sets out on a new adventure to recover his father's sheep and thus restore things to their proper order before travelling to his present time with the pizza recipe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a side scrolling platformer, much like Save our Pizzas, with Skunny being able to run like Sonic the Hedgehog.  Skunny must avoid enemies and can jump on their heads, as in other Skunny games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
