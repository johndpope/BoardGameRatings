			<description>Stage Chaser is a bicycle race themed board game.  It allows players to compete against each other in any of the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest bike races; including ones they&amp;rsquo;ve just made up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is made up of interchangeable terrain mats which, when fitted together, form the profile of a stage.  The stage can be flat, hilly or mountainous &amp;ndash; whatever the players choose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is in a charge of star rider.  They move their rider along the board by playing action cards, whose values vary according to the kind of terrain they are played on.  The majority of the action cards show other riders in the race (team mates of the star riders) who can be slipstreamed, but there are also &amp;lsquo;attack&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;block!&amp;rsquo; cards.   Players need energy tokens to move forward when they play attack cards and these are fought over during the race.  Block! cards allow players to sabotage the moves of their competitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to cross the finish line first.  If just one stage is played, the winner of the stage is the winner of the game.  If more than one stage is played, the winner of the game is the player with the best overall score when all the stage results have been added together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
