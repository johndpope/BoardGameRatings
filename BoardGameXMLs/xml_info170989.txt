			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From sprinkles and swirls to ribbons and roses, there&amp;rsquo;s something for everyone in this super-sweet bakery-inspired game &amp;ndash; winning is just the icing on the cake! Players work on multiple cakes at a time &amp;ndash; spinning the wheel to determine their pieces, stacking luscious layers and toppers to complete their cakes, and judging finished creations for points. With thousands of possible designs, the game is deliciously different every time you play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play:&lt;br/&gt;1. Players take turns spinning the wheel to determine the number and type of pieces they may pick from the pile.&lt;br/&gt;2. After each turn, players place the pieces they can on one of many cakes they are creating, following the specific order outlined on the package.&lt;br/&gt;3. Upon completion of a cake, players use the measuring stick to determine how many ribbon cards their cakes have earned.&lt;br/&gt;4. Play continues until all ribbon cards have been distributed. The player with the most cards wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
