			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsters and Other Childish Things is a roleplaying game about kids with pet monsters. Like childhood, its tone is intended to be in parts whimsical and horrific.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kids from age ten up to early teens find themselves bonded to horrors from beyond time and space who want to be their friends, play fun games, and devour the souls of their enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adult world is still reeling from the revelation of monsters, and many can&amp;rsquo;t help wondering, &amp;ldquo;Why now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But while it&amp;rsquo;s about kids, this game isn&amp;rsquo;t really meant to be played by kids. Gamer kids could totally handle the mechanics, but I think mostly adults will appreciate the gallows humor and the occasional grownup themes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From user summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the original version available prior to the publication of Monsters and Other Childish Things: The Completely Monstrous Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
