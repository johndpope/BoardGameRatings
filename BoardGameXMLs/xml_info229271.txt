			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Durgat Bloodbeard and Glarnack fra Farthklan looked at each other and smiled. &amp;ldquo;Aye, we have plenty of gold in our bags,&amp;rdquo; Durgat said, turning his head towards the group of bandits that were blocking their passage on the road. &amp;ldquo;But not a goddamn coin of it will ever touch your hands,&amp;rdquo; finished Glarnack with a hearty laugh. The two Barbarians hefted their axes. Before the bandits had a chance to process what was happening, their lives ended in a blur of whirling steel and splattering blood...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theo'remus coughed as dust, which had stirred up from opening a long-sealed door, made its way into his lungs. &amp;ldquo;I hate this place&amp;hellip; everything feels so&amp;hellip; I don't know. It's too damned quiet.&amp;rdquo; Perren laughed, &amp;ldquo;Quiet is good, friend. Goblins are loud. Orcs louder still. This tomb is&amp;hellip; well, it's silent as the grave. Bones aren't going to hurt us.&amp;rdquo; Flint quietly smirked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wet thwack of an arrow hitting Perren made Theo'remus jump, followed immediately by a yelp of pain from the Ranger. &amp;ldquo;My brothers, it is time for you to meet the bones that will indeed hurt you,&amp;rdquo; Flint said stoically. He pulled a small bottle out of his belt pouch inside of which a single firefly buzzed about, and smashed it against a copper coin while saying a quick prayer. The coin flared up with white light, and he tossed it down the hallway in front of him. The coin landed mere feet in front of a group of skeletons, armed with rusted swords, that were silently and eerily making their way towards the trio. Flint pulled the symbol of Odin he kept around his neck out from under his tunic and started chanting...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theo wasn't the biggest fan of this whole &amp;ldquo;adventuring&amp;rdquo; business. He was less of a fan of being poor, however. And of course, he had Glarnack and Finn to help keep him safe. He took in a deep breath, fragrant from the incense he had began burning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;They're coming!&amp;rdquo; Glarnack's shout broke Theo's meditation.&amp;ldquo;Well aware, my uncouth friend, well aware. Perhaps you could let me know in a gentler fashion next time, eh?&amp;rdquo; Theo stood up, cracked his knuckles, and straightened the pointed cap he was wearing. He took a few steps outside of the magical hut that he and his companions were using to safely camp, and the smell of the band of ogres marauding towards them assaulted his nostrils. &amp;ldquo;Filthy beasts,&amp;rdquo; he muttered to himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;FLAMME! SCHL&amp;Auml;GT SIE NIEDER!!&amp;rdquo;With a loud crack, a bolt of fire shot from Theo's finger leaving the smell of burnt ozone behind. The flame raced towards the center of the group of ogres and exploded in a giant ball of fire. When it cleared, the charred bodies of the brutes lay smoldering. &amp;ldquo;Perhaps it is I that keep them safe,&amp;rdquo; mused Theo...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introducing Mithgarthr: The Roleplaying Game! Enter a rich, original world inspired by Norse and Germanic culture. Explore the dark places where Gooblitts and D&amp;yacute;rverr roam. Battle against the treacherous forces of Chaos led by Orcus and The Thrir. Die horribly at the hands of greenskins while trying to get rich quick with your friends!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mithgarthr takes its mechanics from the fifth edition of the world's most popular role playing game, but molds them against its grim setting. Characters start at zero level with just the skills they have from their mundane profession (of which there are nine to choose from) and a desire to make a better life for themselves. Players may choose from seven races including the murine Ratten and the winged, hawk-like Fjothr. Life is cheap and death comes often, but those adventurers who survive long enough to attain first level have eight iconic classes to choose from. Magic is cast using a point system, and is less common than usual. Monsters have their own magic system, drawing their power from Orcus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the core rulebook are everything you need to play the game! Character creation rules, combat, adventuring, equipment, magic, monsters, world setting information, and even a fully fleshed out town and surrounding wilderness to start in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
