			<description>Mexican-American War is an area movement game that plays very similar to Risk, but with some added twists. 2 to 4 players fight over an area map of the Western USA and Mexico. The US player advances on several different cities that the Mexican player must defend. Random event cards keep the game interesting, while playing to the strengths and weaknesses of each side. Cards add strategic options for both players. Six-sided dice are needed to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game includes these components:&lt;br/&gt;a map including the Western USA and Mexico;&lt;br/&gt;approximately 120 square counters;&lt;br/&gt;Rules.&lt;br/&gt;(6-sided dice not included)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has a similar system to The Seven Years War &amp; The War of Austrian Succession, also published by the Calumet Armchair Gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
