							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Last Human</name>
									
			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Last Human is a role playing game that was created in 24 hours. Why 24 hours? Why not. It&amp;rsquo;s a challenge, and one that this writer took up with gusto. I have made some assumptions while writing, like you know what a role playing game is, or what a d6 is. If you don&amp;rsquo;t, stop reading right now and find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you do know what I&amp;rsquo;m on about, grab a pencil, some paper and a few d6; gather your friends; and prepare for an outrageous ride!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Last Human is a sweeping space opera set in a mysterious galaxy filled with strange planets, ferocious aliens, and a terrible menace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A thousand years ago mankind set out for the stars, intent on making a better life for themselves. Aboard the great space arc Utopia they thought to travel to a distant galaxy where they might make a better life for themselves, away from the pollution, tyranny and death that had overrun Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But these bold colonists were to fall foul to an enemy within, betrayed by their greatest technological achievement - the android. These soulless humanoids, convinced of their superiority over man, plotted while their creators slept in cryogenic hibernation. When the time was right, they turned off the hibernation safety protocols, killing all those who slept.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or so they thought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The androids then spread into the galaxy themselves, abandoning the Utopia to an icy voyage through time and space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But one human survived. Now the Utopia&amp;rsquo;s sentient computer, Main Frame, and the robots programmed for menial labour have the mammoth task of protecting the last human from all the hazards of deep space. And from the androids, who are intent on finishing the job they had started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And who is this last survivor of the human race? A child. An infant girl. Her name is Eve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Concept and Design&lt;br/&gt;Nathan Russell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspiration - Film and Literature&lt;br/&gt;Lost In Space, The Black Hole, Monsters Inc., ABC Warriors, Ice Pirates, Star Wars, Tarzan, Red Dwarf, The Flintstones, The Jetsons, Star Trek, Thunder Cats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspiration - Games&lt;br/&gt;Paranoia, Star Wars (by WEG)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
