			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNLICENSED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is an unlicensed version of Microsoft Flight Simulator X.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prepar3D is Lockheed Martin's continuation of the Microsoft Flight Simulator family of games. It is based on the Microsoft ESP simulator, which is the commercial-user version of Microsoft Flight Simulator X. While Prepar3D is fully licensed and authorized by Microsoft, the limitations of that license prevent it being sold for &amp;quot;personal computer entertainment&amp;quot;. It is however seen by many members of the flight sim community as the natural continuation of the series, and the licensing constraints that it is sold under are not seen as a limitation to the end user.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;v4 is the most substantial update to the core flight simulator engine to date, marking the transition from a 32-bit to 64-bit binary, making it far more expandable through third party add-ons than previous versions of Prepar3D, or Microsoft Flight Simulator before it. Also of note is that v4 integrates native virtual reality support (Oculus Rift &amp;amp; HTC Vive).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;v4 also includes additional aircraft created in-house and by third party developers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     F-16A&lt;br/&gt;     F-16AM&lt;br/&gt;     F-16C&lt;br/&gt;     Lockheed Electra 10A&lt;br/&gt;     Milviz P-38L&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While retaining the same name as its predecessors, it is sold as a separate product, much like an annual edition of a sports video game franchise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
