							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tj√∂rn-Monopol</name>
									
			<description>This is a version of Monopoly, based entirely in the Swedish translation (using Stockholm streets) of the game that was patented in 1935 by Charles Darrow and released by Parker Brothers. &lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is similar to Monopoly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Tj&amp;ouml;rn-Monopol the streets are instead places/harbours along the cost of the island of Tj&amp;ouml;rn, one of Sewdens largest islands and a summer holiday paradise. Instead of house upgrades the owner of a harbour upgrade the pier of the place to more and more luxurous versions. Instead of money the economy is handled using cases of fish of differen kinds. The board is designed in a marine manor and the cards texts are rewritten ti fit the theme, as pieces used for movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
