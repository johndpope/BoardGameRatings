			<description>The Cinematic Game of Insane Survival Horror&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die Screaming is a tale of unimaginable horror that overwhelms the feeble constraints of the human mind, now in theaters near you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every game of Die Screaming begins with the apocalypse. Civilization has ended, and now there are only survivors, forever changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some things are worse than death. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll live long enough to become one of them. Die Screaming is a love letter to horror cinema of the last three decades, written in the form of a game. Your character begins as a horror movie trope, and your charisma is an element in the gameplay - as if an outside force is rooting for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To fight the horrors of the apocalypse, however, you must sacrifice - first your sanity, and then your humanity. Armies of monsters beyond human knowledge and the known universe now roam the earth. With evil, alien intellects, they and their slaves now lay dominion over the world. Dark forces are everywhere, seeping into the fragile human psyche with their corrupting influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To destroy a monster, you must become one. Only by bending insanity and eldritch power to your will can you survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
