							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elves of Athas</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They run across the burning plains where others fear to walk.  They live for the moment, these savages of a dying world.  The elves of Athas are wiled, dangerous, and unlike any other elves.  Forget the frail forest dwellers of other campaign worlds.  Athas's elves stand tall and lean, with long limbs and fearsome faces.  They are thieves and raiders, swift warriors and terrible foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elves of Athas explores the passions that drive them, the abilities that make them different from other races, and the outlook that lets them survive beneath the crimson sun.  This accessory includes savage encounters with the better known tribes and an updated map of the Tablelands region.  For players, there are new rules for character creation and new Athasian elf kits -- offered to DARK SUN(r) game characters for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elves of Athas are forged in the endless desert -- burned dark by the sun, toughened by the swirling sand, and given strength and swiftness by the constant wind.  Come run with them -- if you dare!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
