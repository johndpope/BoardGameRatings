			<description>FIFA 2003 is the tenth game in the FIFA series and the seventh to be produced in 3D. A number of new features were added to improve upon the previous version. Club Championship Mode was introduced with the feature of playing against 17 of Europe's top clubs in their own stadiums and the fans singing their unique chants and songs. A TV-style broadcast package gave highlights at half-time and full-time, as well as comprehensive analysis. One of the most anticipated new features was EA Sport's &amp;quot;Freestyle Control&amp;quot; which allows the user to flick the ball on and lay it off to team mates. Other additions include greater likenesses of players such as Thierry Henry and Ronaldinho, as well as realistic player responses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, FIFA Football 2003 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
