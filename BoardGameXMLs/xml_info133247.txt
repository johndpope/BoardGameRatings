							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bop It Extreme 2</name>
									
			<description>Like the original, Bop It!, this game is a noisy speed reaction race. The active player responds as quickly as possible to recorded commands to manipulate the game device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The layout of Hasbro's Bop It Extreme 2 was shown to be altered from that of Bop It Extreme. The shapes of several inputs were also altered. Volume controls were added, and the method of score reporting was changed to using plain English. In addition to the four modes featured in Bop It Extreme, a &amp;quot;One on One&amp;quot; mode was added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
