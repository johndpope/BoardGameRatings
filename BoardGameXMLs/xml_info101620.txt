							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sanctuary of Souls</name>
									
			<description>From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The demon walks among us!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You smirk to yourself; the Abbot is always being over-dramatic to get attention. You look around at your fellow classmates. Brother Vengis is listening intently to the abbot as always. He always was a bit too serious. Brother Mendi is pulling faces to the other members of the class. He is a few years older than you are, but he has been visiting his parent's for the last few years. Both were ill and died shortly before he returned, but he does not seem to be particularly upset about it. Sister Ariasna is looking out the window dreamily running her fingers through her curly blonde hair. It is odd to think the four of you are the most senior acolytes in the sanctuary. You have all been serving the Lady Aurosa, Goddess of peace since childhood. Now after twenty years you are about to leave the sanctuary in a few short weeks. You will all be made full warrior priests of Aurosa and must leave the safety of the sanctuary in the mountains of Kazan, in South-Western Khul in order to vanquish evil and spread the word of Aurosa to the people. Aurosa is a more or less forgotten Goddess in Titan now. In fact your small monastery is really the last order left that still worships her. You are hopeful that you can rectify that situation when the time comes. For now though, you turn your attention back to the abbot. Perhaps some of his teachings will come in useful?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Later that night, you are awakened from your dreams of adventuring in far off lands by a primal scream. Casting a nervous glance out your window you see the cause of it. Many dark bat like creatures fly through the air around the Sanctuary, screaming in bloodlust. More screams come, but this time it is not the screams of the fell beasts, but screams of acolytes being attacked! You hear the demons smashing at the sanctuary's main gates and you know their purpose; the demons have come to destroy your order. Whispering a prayer to Aurosa you leap out of bed and pill on your leather jerkin. Now is the time to see if you are ready for the life of adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
