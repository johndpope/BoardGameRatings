							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Side Stitch</name>
									
			<description>Side stitch is played on board tessellated with hexagonal cells and possessing an odd numbered of sides. The goal is to create a group of stones that touches more sides than your opponent.  (Note that on game boards that have colored borders, each distinct color counts as a distinct &amp;quot;side.&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, a player plays a single stone of his/her color to any empty cell; once placed, stones do not move. Play continues until the board is full or until both players pass in succession. The pie rule applies (that is, once the first stone is played, the second player can opt to switch colors with his/her opponent).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of same-color stones has a value equal to the number of sides it touches. (Note that a stone in the cell where two sides meet touches both of those sides). At the end of the game, each player identifies his/her highest-valued group. The player whose highest-valued group is highest is the winner. In case of tie, the players should ignore the tied groups and compare their remaining groups; the highest value among the remaining groups wins. This process is repeated until the tie is broken.  Draws are not possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
