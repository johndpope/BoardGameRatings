			<description>The board contains 104 squares (diagonal faced - not like on chess) in four different colours; Dark Green, Light Green, Brown and Yellow, the battle field is divided by a line into four sections with a base on each symbolized by a white circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players now get a platoon each of 13 Commandos and one Leader. And put them up in a grid according to the rule sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the game is to move your Commander into the enemy's base(s).&lt;br/&gt;The Commander can not take a unit or be taken by a unit, except that he can take an enemy Commander if he is on his own base. The Commander can move one space in any direction he wants.&lt;br/&gt;The units can take or be taken by other units and moves to either the next space of the same colour has he stands on (as long as there is no friendly unit or an enemy Commander on this space) or he can move like a Commandor but only if the space is idle. An enemy unit is taken by the first type of movement if he stands on the space where the active player lands. A Unit can not occupy any base - own or enemy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player move ONE soldier (Unit or Commander) in EACH sector he have a soldier on (giving 1-4 moves per turn).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Point is given by capturing soldiers and bases.&lt;br/&gt;When a Commander occopy an enemy base, the remaining soldiers and Commander is captured by the victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there is only one active player left and the points are counted as follows:&lt;br/&gt;1 point per enemy soldier caputred&lt;br/&gt;1 point for any of his own soldiers still alive&lt;br/&gt;10 points per enemy Commandor captured&lt;br/&gt;20 for winning the game (= being the last player on the board).&lt;br/&gt;Minus 28 points - because the rules say so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
