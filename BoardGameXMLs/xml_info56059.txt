							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sweet Wall of Death</name>
									
			<description>This module is for 4-6 player characters of levels 2-4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The figure mounting the top of the hill wears the unmistakable colors of the town watch, but they are in some way distorted, covered with a thick amber-hued substance that reflects the late afternoon sun. The robbery of the temple this morning had sent him and two other guards in pursuit of the perpetrators. Now, the lone guard staggers once and tumbles down the hill, the amber substance adhering leaves and twigs to his exhausted form. When he finally ends his violent descent at your feet, you see on his skin, partially obscured by debris and completely coated with the sticky substance, several large ripe welts, bright red in color. At this close distance, the substance caries a familiar scent - that sugary smell of honey. His last words are a whispered response to the unspoken question on your astonished faces; 'The Sweet Wall of Death.'&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
