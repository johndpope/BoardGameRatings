			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Fire is a pencil-and-paper RPG set in a fictional world based on the myths, cultures, and geography of Mesoamerica prior to the arrival of Europeans in the New World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is centered on the people of the glorious Empire of the Sun, a composite nation inspired by the Aztec and Maya civilizations, and consists of adventures and dramatic storytelling driven by a tight set of simple but flexible rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on a variety of roles--a mighty Warrior, a mystical Priest, a devious Nahual Sorcerer, and others--and head out into the world in search of glory and prestige for themselves, their people, and the gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your search may take you to epic battlefields against daunting enemy city-states, to grand courts and religious ceremonies where power, ambition, intrigue, and religion all converge into a vortex of danger and excitement, to burning deserts or steamy jungles or lofty mountain tops or ancient ruins, or to rough and tumble conflicts between rival tribes or even between members of your own tribe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may confront foreign opponents, malevolent supernatural entities, or your own personal demons, but in New Fire the stakes are always high, the rewards are sweet and dangers severe, and the world is ever balanced on the edge of disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
