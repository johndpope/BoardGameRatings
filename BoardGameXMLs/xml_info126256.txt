							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Canopy</name>
									
			<description>Special version for VGG based on website and game rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In meadows, woodlands, forests and jungles, it is the plants that grow tallest and widest that capture the most sunshine. The question is: can you grow and dominate the canopy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Canopy is a turn-based game played on a hexagonal grid. Gameplay starts with each player taking it in turn to place a Root into an empty 'soil' hexagon along the bottom of the board. When everyone has 2 roots, normal play begins. During normal play, players can grow up and out from the roots, place additional roots, uproot other players and snap opponents' branches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of roots a player has at the start of their turn is the number of moves they can make in that turn; more roots means more moves. The Grow move doesn't require a dice. Root, Uproot and Snap do rely on the dice, but players can roll the dice before deciding how to use their luck, so there's an element of strategy even in dice use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to grow your plants so that your uppermost branches cover the whole width of the board and are higher than everyone else's plants. You can also win if all the other players are out. (A player is out if they are smothered such that it's impossible for them to play a turn.) The game is played over one 'growing season' of 20 turns. If no one has completed the canopy during this season, the game ends in stalemate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
