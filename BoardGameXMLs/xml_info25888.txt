			<description>This Heyne travel game is played on a 4-piece board showing 2x3 prisons and several traveling ways between them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 18 tokens in 3 colors. The 6 tokens per color form 3 &amp;quot;tribes&amp;quot; of tokens, where one is the master tribe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to capture all 6 tokens of the opposing master tribe. This is not so easy, because captured tokens can be rescued from the prisons and brought back into the game. Another problem is, that the tokens can only enter the game by throwing a 6. A player on the way to losing the game can therefore try to inhibit tokens from his master tribe to enter the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
