							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Summer C.A.M.P.</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working for the Summer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Schools out, and the Kids&amp;rsquo; parents hooked them up with a sweet gig that will make adults of them all &amp;mdash; fixing up Camp Hope, an ideal property on a picturesque lake just outside of town. The fact that it was the scene of several grisly murders performed by a deranged camp counselor in the 1960&amp;rsquo;s is nearly called an &amp;ldquo;urban legend,&amp;rdquo; but the camp was closed after a series of lawsuits bankrupted the owner over its sordid history. Now, decades later, the camp has a new owner who needs help fixing up the dilapidated campgrounds and he&amp;rsquo;s hired local teens to help spruce the place up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, something strange is going on. Tools go missing. Sounds wake people up at night. Odd lights are seen at night. Is this the ghost of a former camper? Perhaps the &amp;ldquo;Camp Creeper&amp;rdquo; has returned? Only the Kids can figure this mystery out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;vs. Stranger Stuff Adventure: Summer C.A.M.P. is an adventure for the vs. Stranger Stuff rules-light tabletop roleplaying game using the vs. M Engine system, in which you play a group of Kids in a version of the 1980&amp;rsquo;s we all fondly remember from movies and TV shows. All you need to play this adventure is the core vs. Stranger Stuff rules, a pack of standard playing cards, some pencils, paper, and a few friends!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
