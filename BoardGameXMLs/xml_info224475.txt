			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lost in the Wilderness!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A scout scrambles down hill, panicked that the hunters on her trail will hear the cries of her fallen pack lizard. A squire sneezes, farts, and belches his way back to his tent, dropping handfuls of half eaten exotic nuts. A group of starved and thirsty explorers pass around a small cup of gray water with single bites of rabbit meat floating in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a fantasy world with vast expanses of wilderness between islands of civilization, the limits of the player characters are often tested when undertaking the simplest journey. This can mean dealing with some of the most basic daily needs including food, water, and shelter, as well as dealing with illness, poisonous creatures and wild beasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The question then becomes, how do we make basic survival exciting without the necessity of adding bandit ambushes or troll attacks? While these random events can be fun if used sparingly, the players can become jaded to these contrived encounters if they are used every time they travel. By making the very acts of passing through a forest, setting up camp, building a shelter, making a fire, gathering food, and finding water an adventure, the DM can transform even the simplest journey into a grand adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book will provide some creative options to keep what is often the least interesting part of the game &amp;ndash; getting from point A to point B &amp;ndash; interesting and memorable. These will include the use of more evocative descriptors for rations such as salted pork, dried mushrooms, and hardtack instead of rations. It could include finding potable water, building a shelter against the coming rain, or caring for mounts. Additionally, the book will cover a variety of threats from hungry predators to hypothermia to venomous insects. There can also be natural solutions to these threats, such as, herbal remedies, pest repellents, and securing a campsite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included in this books is a new character background, new equipment, 200 random events, and a new character sheet specifically designed for Cinematic Environs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
