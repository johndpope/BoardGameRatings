							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guide to Saurian</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If we measured success by longevity, then dinosaurs must rank as the number one success story in the history of land life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many races of reptilian humanoids in the world, but few are as ancient and  secretive as the Saurians. The Saurian civilization was old when the other races were born, having survived the catastrophes that periodically cleanse the world. Ancient saurian scrolls tell of a time when the world was covered in jungle and giant reptiles stomped across the continents. Perhaps because of this pedigree, Saurians feel a bit out of place in the modern world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
