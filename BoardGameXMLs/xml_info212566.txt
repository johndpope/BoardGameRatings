							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Catch</name>
									
			<description>Big Catch is a division board game for students of grade 3 and up. It is designed to get them 8 times more division practice than classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player draws a card on their turn with a number that must be divided by the current number of islands in play. A token is placed on each island equal to the result, with the remainders being saved for subsequent rounds.  These can also be used to move from island to island, creating an area-control mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also an included dry erase slate to help the child work out the problems with long division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first to get to &amp;quot;Home Island&amp;quot; wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
