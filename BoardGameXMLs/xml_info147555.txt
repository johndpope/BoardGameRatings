Amidst the chaos, gangs emerged as the new elite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the outskirts of town, twin brothers Jimmy Lee and Billy Lee contemplate their future in the aftermath of the war. But one day, Billy's girlfriend Marian is kidnapped off of the streets, and the brothers receive a letter. It reads, &amp;quot;We have Marian. If you want to see her again,, bring us the secret book of Sou-Setsu-Ken by 10a.m. tomorrow morning.&amp;quot; Billy is both angry and confused by the mysterious disappearance of his girlfriend. Little does he know that his own brother also has feelings for Marion...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    All new game modes created specifically for this enhanced version, including a two player cooperative mode, vs. mode and a one player mode where you can control both Lee brothers.&lt;br/&gt;    Double Dragon Dojo Survival mode will let you test your skills against an unending number of enemies. Play alone or with a friend!&lt;br/&gt;    All new fighting techniques and weapons such as the dash punch, rising knee and wall jump allow you to gain the upper hand.&lt;br/&gt;    Never before seen stages containing all new enemies and boss characters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
