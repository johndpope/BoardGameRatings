			<description>Vancouveropoly is a wealth acquisition game.  The object is to obtain the most money and businesses.  Players start with $2500 cash which is used to buy the un-owned businesses that they land on.  A player must pay rent to the owner if the business is already owned.  The rent increases if the business has one or more retail outlets or an office tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It will be helpful to compare this game to it's cousin, Monopoly; &lt;br/&gt;- there is no element of bidding for un-purchased properties, although players are encouraged to &amp;quot;make your own deals!&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt;- Money paid for Socks or Bonds cards is put in the centre as a jackpot for landing on the Free Parking square&lt;br/&gt;- On rolling doubles, a player may move the the token the sum of both dice, or double that amount.  The player does not get to roll again after rolling doubles.&lt;br/&gt;- There is no payment for passing Go on each lap of the board, so financial resources are more limited.&lt;br/&gt;- Players pay $100 to get out of Court (Jail).&lt;br/&gt;- The game ends when one player becomes bankrupt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is very commercial.  The board and the Stocks and Bonds cards read like advertisements for local businesses. They often include real world addresses and phone numbers.  There are two Coupon cards included with the Stocks and Bonds cards that appear to be intended for use as real-world coupons at those businesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
