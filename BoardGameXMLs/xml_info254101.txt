			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action, diplomacy and adventure on a world riven by factional strife&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;STARDATE 48326.3,  our mission is to proceed to the Federation protectorate world of Tolen IV to help mediate a disagreement between two rival factions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The government of Tolen IV wishes to remain under the Federation&amp;rsquo;s protection, with the hopes of joining as a member world later. Their opposition wishes for Tolen IV to withdraw itself from Federation protection to take its place in the galactic community on its own terms. Tolen IV is located near the Romulan Neutral Zone and, thus, is in a strategic location for Starfleet to monitor Romulan activity and is also rich in dilithium, tritanium, and trillium-D, so the mining rights of the planet&amp;rsquo;s surface are of great interest to the Tolen people and to their more powerful neighbours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This will require all my crew's skills of tact, diplomacy and negotiation, if we're to come to a peaceful resolution which satisfies both factions, as well as the interests of Starfleet.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This standalone 24 page PDF adventure by Troy Mepyans for the Star Trek Adventures RPG,  pitches your Starfleet crew into the middle of a tense negotiation between the rival factions of Tolen IV.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you bring an end to the dispute before it spills over into civil war and how will you react when events take a turn for the worse, sending your crew tumbling into a world of intrigue, action and adventure?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
