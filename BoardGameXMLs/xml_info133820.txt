							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">American War of Independence: Campaign Set 1 â€“ The Northern Theatre</name>
									
			<description>Nine battles of the early Revolutionary war using a common set of rules. Each battle includes its own specific rules page and map (Bunker Hill has 2 versions).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles included in this set include Concord-Lexington, Bunker Hill, White Plains, Trenton, Paoli, Hubbardton, Germantown, Valley Forge, Saratoga&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving their forces and attacking enemy units in order to achieve the specific objectives for a battle. One important difference to typical wargames is that before the moving player can attack, his units are subject to defencive fire from the opponent&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
