							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fading Suns Emperor Wars</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Card game for 5 players. Based on the 1995 SF PC Game Emperor of the Fading Suns.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this detailed game of interplanetary struggle and conquest, each player is the leader of a Noble House who is seeking to become the Emperor. Each player starts with control of a Noble House, five random planets, five Scepters, and a War Fleet. Each Noble House has a unique bonus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to hold the position of Regent for four consecutive turns. The first player to do so is declared Emperor. The Regent is selected by vote of the players, with each Scepter they hold being worth one vote. In addition, a player with the favor of the Church or Guilds may vote with Scepters controlled by those groups. In the case of a tie vote, no player serves as Regent that turn. Scepters can be obtained from other players by making successful attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
