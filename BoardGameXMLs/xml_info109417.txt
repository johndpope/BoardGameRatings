			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The magus (plural magi) is a new base class designed for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. She is a hybrid spellcaster, combining arcane spells drawn from power within herself and the faith needed to also call upon divine spells. A magus may be a church wizard, a priestess of magic who has studied the arcane arts, or a dynamic spiritualist who sees no difference in the two traditional forms of magic. Magi may be called bruxa, church mages, ecclesiathurges, ovates, spell lords, thaumaturges, white wizards, or other titles that suit the needs of your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A magus is considered both an arcane and divine spellcaster (and can count as either for purposes of requirements and prerequisites). The magus is similar to a sorcerer in that she draws spell power from within herself, casting a limited list of spells known with no need for advanced preparation. Unlike a sorcerer, a magus can draw from both arcane and divine spell lists when selecting spells known, allowing magus&amp;rsquo;s to be prepared for a broader range of circumstances. This is important as the magus&amp;rsquo;s focus is spells to the exclusion of nearly everything else, even more so than other spellcasting classes. Depending on the mystic bond a magus makes, she may not have powers beyond her spells, but instead she&amp;rsquo;ll learn new ways to use the spells she knows to maximum benefit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
