			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No wonder kids love to be at their Wit's End! In this enormously fun and unique game, children expand their knowledge base and develop important skills. Specially-designed cards contain different questions for younger and older children (Ages 8 - 10 and Ages 11 - 12), so they can be challenged at their own levels. Parents may also join in the fun! The four different card categories add plenty of exciting variety. What will the category be? Teasers are amusing and intriguing riddles often disguised as rhymes. Odd1Out has three choices to consider but which one doesn't belong. Sequence questions involve arranging items in order like animals by size, events by date, and special features such as Silly Syllables, Dictionary Detectives and Wild Card category including Alphabet Soup, Word Whiz, Voice Owl and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
