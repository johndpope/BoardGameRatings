							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lucifer&#039;s War</name>
									
			<description>Lucifer's War is a tabletop miniatures battle game designed that players may simulate the war between the immortal creatures that comprise the Celestial Hierarchy. As a warband led by the Archangel Michael you could battle to defend the divine order from jealous usurpers or wage war as Lucifer and fight to take the position in the cosmos that is yours by right. Stain the Gates of Heaven with the blood of those who dare question the Will, or rend asunder those that dared to cast you from the light of the upper planes into realms of black stone and sulfur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucifer's War uses the Goalsystem mechanics made popular by West Wind's previous skirmish games, SuperSystem and Chaos In Cairo. Battles in Lucifer's War can involve as few as two models per side, or as many as the players desire. There are two basic types of models in Lucifer's War: Angelic or Demonic Orders and Minions. The Orders are the immortal creatures that occupy lofty positions within the Celestial Hierarchy. Minions represent the lower classes of servants or constructs employed by the Orders in their struggles for power or vengeance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
