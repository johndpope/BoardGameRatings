							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Choose Your Crew: Pirates</name>
									
			<description>Yaar! Anchors up! Here&amp;rsquo;s an exciting new card game that&amp;rsquo;s simple to learn and fun to play! Gather your crew of dastardly pirates to set sail before your opponents and win the game! Along the way you can sabotage their efforts with cannon fire, a bout of scurvy or incite mutiny in their midst! Convince more pirates to join your crew with spiced rum and treasure. Or even kidnap a crew member from a rival ship! If you have an abundance of Swabbies mopping the decks but not enough Gunners to man the cannons you can trade them across to a rival crew for someone more worthy of your ship. But beware you might not always get what you bargain for. After all, pirates are a deceitful lot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
