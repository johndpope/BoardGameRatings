							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Blackguard Hybrid Class</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is full of dark intentions and bleak moral apathy. Issue #81 introduces a new class that thrives in such a world, willing to take advantage of any situation for its own gratification. The blackguard is based on the barbarian and rogue classes, learning to focus hiw own dark deeds to a preternatural degree while learning new ways to use this focus intensity to his own betterment. The blackguard is especially hardy and just as skilled with the sword as any warrior but he knows how to stack the deck in his favor and when it is better to cut and run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
