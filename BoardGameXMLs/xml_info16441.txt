							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mr. T Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This game, based on the Mr. T cartoon show, plays like the card game &amp;quot;War&amp;quot; with a few extra twists. The cards depict various characters from the show and a small board is used to organize them as they're played. The entire deck is dealt out evenly among the players into face down piles. Players then draw the top 3 cards to form their hands. In a preliminary round, players take the top card from their piles and play them onto their board space. If no cards match but one is a Mr. T card, the player who played Mr. T wins all the cards. If two or three cards match, a showdown takes place in which players play cards from their hands trying to be the only player to match one of the non-matching cards played by another player. The winner gets all the cards played. If you lose all your cards you're out. When only 2 players remain, the one with the greatest number of cards wins. Rules for playing 2-player are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
