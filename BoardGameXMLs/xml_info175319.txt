							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Inspector</name>
									
			<description>The object is to collect the most possible of a complete &amp;ldquo;set&amp;rdquo; of cards in sequence before the Inspector turns up. A valid set of cards is either a;&lt;br/&gt;Male Nudist + Shirt + Trousers + Tie + Shoes (M) + Hat (M) + Pipe&lt;br/&gt;or&lt;br/&gt;Female Nudist + Undies + Jumper + Skirt + Shoes (F) Hat (F) + Gloves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;METHOD OF PLAY&lt;br/&gt;The dealer gives one unexposed card to each player, places the rest of the pack face down on the table and turns up the top card which is put face up near the pack.&lt;br/&gt;In the event of the Inspector being dealt or turned up in this round (the first of any hand), the cards are reshuffled and the next player on left of dealer deals.&lt;br/&gt;The player on the left of dealer must now choose two cards, the exposed one and one from the pack or two from the pack.&lt;br/&gt;He then discards one, placing it face up on the exposed heap.&lt;br/&gt;The next player does the same, until the Inspector is brought into play. On turning up the Inspector, the player must call &amp;ldquo;Inspector&amp;rdquo; at which all hands are exposed on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCORING&lt;br/&gt;Player turning up &amp;ldquo;Inspector&amp;rdquo; counts &amp;ldquo; 0 &amp;rdquo; for hand.&lt;br/&gt;The numbers on the cards headed by a nudist and in sequence, of the same set, are not counted.&lt;br/&gt;But all cards not of the same set, and not in sequence, are added and scored against player.&lt;br/&gt;If a player has two or more Nudists, 12 points is counted for each one after the first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REMNANT CARD&lt;br/&gt;Player holding &amp;ldquo;Remnant Card&amp;rdquo;, may call it any card except a Nudist, but if it is found in a hand, when inspected, not holding a Nudist, it counts 15 points against the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE WINNER&lt;br/&gt;The player with the least number of points after playing as many deals as there are players wins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
