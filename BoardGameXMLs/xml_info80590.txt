			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Quest (or DQ) is a game of action and adventure in a realm of fantasy and danger. In games of DQ you take the role of a bold hero mastering the arts of the warrior, wizard, thief or priest, setting forth in search of adventure, fame and fortune. DQ is a role playing game of classic swords and sorcery adventure, where YOU become the hero. All you need to play are a few friends, some dice and a character sheet for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer wrote this game very quickly to play with his nephews as he wanted them to be able to take a copy of the game home with them.  He had intended to run a published game, but didn't have any spare copies to give away, so wrote this one instead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
