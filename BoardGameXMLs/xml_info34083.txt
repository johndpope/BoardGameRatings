			<description>From the website.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So it was with a sense of relief, rather than concern, that the citizens of Terra watched the ascension to power of Purser Wheylan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;To them, the one-time opposition leader offered a chance for humanity to pull itself from the ashes, and more importantly, for Terra to take back her rightful place as the center of human civilization&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;Vicar Buros (AA +315- )&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Imperial Starmada Sourcebook, the first in what is hoped to be a long series of setting books in support of the Starmada game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These pages describe the universe of the Imperial Starmada: the interstellar naval arm of the Terran military. Although in a state of uneasy peace with its immediate neighbors, the Starmada is now faced with its greatest threat&amp;mdash;an alien power of unknown size, strength, and intention. Can the Terrans summon a coalition to face down this new adversary, or will old enmities force the Empire to its knees?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to historical background for five different factions in the Starmada universe, the Imperial Starmada Sourcebook includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Thirty starship designs for the Starmada and its major adversaries;&lt;br/&gt;    * New starship options and weapon traits, including anti-fighter batteries, overthrusters, limited ammunition, and more;&lt;br/&gt;    * Rules for three-dimensional movement and combat interception;&lt;br/&gt;    * The &amp;quot;Simplest Campaign System&amp;quot;; and&lt;br/&gt;    * A complete board game that can be used as a scenario generator for Starmada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Imperial Starmada Sourcebook is not a stand-alone product; ownership of the Starmada Admiralty Edition Core Rulebook is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Starmada: The Admiralty Edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
