			<description>This game is vaguely similar in play to Careers without the strategy.  The similarities are in that there are different tracks players can take, however players have no choice where they go.  Roll and move and do whatever the spaces say to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces move around an outside blue track if their piece is male and the inside pink track if female.  This is purportedly so the men can protect the women.  Players move by rolling 2 dice, if on outside track, and 1 die if on inside track or &amp;quot;Profession&amp;quot; track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Men start with paychecks of $710 and Women with $300.  The first player to reach 10 status points and have $20,000 wins.  Of course, the odds are so stacked that the lesson here is that no matter what a woman does she cannot come out ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
