			<description>Simple game involving a spinner, a mouse playing piece and twelve die-cut, heavy card-stock slices of &amp;quot;cheese.&amp;quot; Cheese slices have printed holes and actual holes. Shuffle the cheese pieces, then stack them with the die-cut edges aligned. Mouse starts on any printed hole and first player spins and moves clockwise the number that the spinner lands on. If mouse lands in an actual hole player carefully lifts the cheese slice over the mouse, keeps it and takes another turn. When the mouse has made his way through the entire pile of cheese slices, the game is over and the player with the most slices of cheese is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
