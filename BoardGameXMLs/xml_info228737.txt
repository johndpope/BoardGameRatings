			<description>A one round Living City Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On this particularly cool spring night in Ravens Bluff, you and your companions have found yourselves at the Crossed Swords Inne, located in the northwestern quarter of the city. The inn is crowded and very busy. The barmaids are busy serving people, including you, and is filled to near capacity. At a table in the corner of the inn sit another group of people, apparently led by a rather tall knight in Field Plate, who's cape seems to billow, as if there were a slight breeze. Seated next to him is a priest (of Torm) and a comely half-elven woman, also dressed in plate mail. Across from them sits a handsome half-elf playing a mandolin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
