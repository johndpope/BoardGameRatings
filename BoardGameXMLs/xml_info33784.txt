			<description>&amp;quot;Each player takes a large card. Separate the small cards and place them face down on the table. The first player draws a card and tries to match it to his large card. If it matches, it is placed on the card, and the player draws another card. He continues as long as he draws a matching card. when the card does not match, it is returned face down to the pile. The next player then takes his turn. The first one to fill his card is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
