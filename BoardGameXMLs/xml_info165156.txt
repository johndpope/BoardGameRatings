							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lost Colony</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back at the Dreck and Bother pub we started to hear some murmurings about a failed colony and the shadowy backers who were still making money off it. This week sail far to the south, past the pirate islands and the dangerous waters that surround it, down to where the air starts to grow cold once again. Here we find the remains of the lost colony and perhaps a few secrets will be revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
