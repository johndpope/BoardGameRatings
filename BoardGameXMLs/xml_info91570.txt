							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Catwoman</name>
									
			<description>Catwoman is a 2004 action-adventure video game published by Electronic Arts UK and Argonaut Games. The game is based on the unsuccessful 2004 film of the same name starring Halle Berry. Featuring the voice talents of Halle Berry, the game varied from the film's plot and received a few good reviews. Other reviewers complained about the repetitive nature of levels and the method by which the player disposes of enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catwoman follows the tale of Patience Phillips, a shy office peon in the Hedare corporate empire. She accidentally discovers her employers' dark secret and is subsequently murdered. However, death won't stop Patience from seeking vengeance. Our heroine is brought back to life by a magical Egyptian cat. Patience soon discovers that along with her restored life, she has received several &amp;quot;cat powers&amp;quot; that will enable her revenge. Thus, Catwoman is born.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Catwoman (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
