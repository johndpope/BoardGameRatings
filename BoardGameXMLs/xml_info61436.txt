							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Montreal Expos Control Action Baseball Game</name>
									
			<description>This game was produced by COLECO World Sports games and is reminiscent of the old time electronic games where vibration made players move after a hit ball. This game board looks somewhat similar but is not electronicall controlled. There are fielders out in the field and there are depressions throughout the field. When the pitched ball is hit is rolls into ares that let the player know if a hit or an out has occured. There are places to put runners who are on base. There is a depression in the infield which creates mostly automatic outs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
