							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Burning Phoenix Inn</name>
									
			<description>You are an adventurer setting out to find your fame and fortune in some fantastic adventure.  The only problem is, you don&amp;rsquo;t know where to find any adventures!  You have heard vague tales of various and sundry perilous exploits you might attempt, such as the Forbidden Forest, the Haunted Hamlet, and several others.  In order to find out more, you have halted your journey just outside the borders of your homelands in a tavern known for its unruly crowd of battle-worn adventurers, the Burning Phoenix Inn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You hope to glean enough information from these experienced warriors and wizards to find out where to begin your adventures.  But someone knows what you are up to and is out to stop you.  Watch out for the mysterious Shadow Riders, trying to prevent you from going on your journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Burning Phoenix Inn is a set collection card game for 2-6 players for the whole family in which players will talk to inn patrons seeking rumors, gamble, and play other games like darts and arm wrestling.  It plays in about 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, players can play a card for its action, letting them interact with other players to gain other rumor cards, gamble by drawing cards and checking their gambling value to see if you win or lose, start a game such as darts or arm wrestling, or play a legendary adventurer card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A legendary adventurer card may help free the player from Shadow Riders or let them draw cards, get money, or help them win playing darts at arm wrestling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games of darts, arm wrestling, and the drinking game are resolved by drawing and comparing cards to determine the winner.  Certain legendary adventurer cards can help a player win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player wins immediately when they have collected five matching rumor cards, five Shadow Riders, or has collected fifteen gold coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
