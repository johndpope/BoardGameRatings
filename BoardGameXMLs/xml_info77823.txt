			<description>The gameplay is similar to the original Chibi-Robo! in which the player takes control of the titular character, a 10-cm tall robot whose job is to clean the inside of a house to make his family happy. Chibi-Robo is owned by Jenny from the previous game, who is now all grown up and living with her son Keith and dog Lucky. The game introduces a tiny vacuum cleaner that Chibi-Robo can use to suck up dirt whilst connected to a power outlet and a tiny sifter used to find gems which can be turned in for money. The player can use the money to buy furniture for the house over a home shopping network using the telephone. The main difference from the original games in the series, is that instead of just having power outlets which let the player charge Chibi-Robo's battery, they need to put rubbish into a trash compactor to get electricity for the outlets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Okaeri!
