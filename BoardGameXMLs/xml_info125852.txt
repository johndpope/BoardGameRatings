			<description>This 2 player children's game consists of a board, a rabbit and a die.  Both players use the rabbit, which starts the game in a field in the middle of the board.  One player's goal is to move the rabbit to a carrot patch, the other's goal is to move the rabbit to a lettuce patch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player moves the rabbit toward their goal in turn using the number rolled on the die.  There are two types of special squares.  Landing on a plank gives that player an extra turn.  Landing on a fence causes that player to lose a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player to reach their goal wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
