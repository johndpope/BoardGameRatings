			<description>A British geography board game, in which globe-trotting kids move their playing pieces across a map of the world, attempting to send postcards home from six different cities: Cape Town, London, New York, Rio de Janeiro, Sydney, and Tokyo. As they move from place to place, they must answer general-knowledge &amp;quot;Journey Questions&amp;quot; or geography-related &amp;quot;Postbox Questions.&amp;quot; (Example: &amp;quot;What is the name of the longest river in the world?&amp;quot;) Once players have reached a target city and correctly answered a Postbox Question, they get to mail a postcard home. The postcards are real cards: kids address them, write or draw a message, stamp the cards with a cancellation rubber stamp, and drop them into a bright-red British-style postbox, assembled from folded cardboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
