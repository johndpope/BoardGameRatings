							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pickles&#039; Veggie Pick</name>
									
			<description>Hop down the rabbit trail to pick some garden fresh veggies.  But watch out!  Pickles and Digger are in a playful mood.  Sneak past them to bring home fresh veggies for a delicious treat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, roll the 3 colored dice and resolve them in order:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Blue Die:  Shows which section of the garden Pickles the Farmer will visit this turn.  Any rabbits in that section lose the Veggie Tile they're carrying, and must go to the farmhouse until their next turn.&lt;br/&gt; - Orange Die:  Shows how many spaces Digger the Dog will move around the dog run on his turn.  If the dog enters a forest where a Rabbit Pawn is waiting, that rabbit drops their veggies and must return to their rabbit hole until their next turn.&lt;br/&gt; - White Die:  Move your Rabbit Pawn up to the number of spaces you rolled.  You may stop to pick up a Veggie Tile then continue on until the number of spaces you rolled are used up.  But remember...sometimes it's safer to move fewer spaces than you rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect veggies (carrots, radishes, lettuce, or eggplants) for points -- if they're from another rabbit's corner of the garden you earn bonus points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT THEY'LL LEARN:  Sequencing, Risk vs Reward, Early Counting &amp;amp; Math&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
