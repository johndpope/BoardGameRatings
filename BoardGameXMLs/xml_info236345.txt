			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though long vanished from Golarion, shreds of the world's greatest ancient civilizations live on in their descendants. This player-focused volume delves into the backgrounds of such scions, from humans who trace their lineage meticulously to ancient times to heroes whose connection to such civilizations manifest in surprising ways. From the mighty mechanical aptitude of the Jistka Imperium to the God-Kings of Ancient Osirion to the earliest days of more recently fallen empires, Pathfinder Player Companion: Blood of the Ancients provides racial traits, class options, spells, and wondrous items for those who draw their power from the past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
