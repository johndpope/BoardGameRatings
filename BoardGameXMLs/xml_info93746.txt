							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Doomsday Device: Fantastic Four vs Doctor Doom</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;The Future of New York is in Your Hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside are two books for two players. One of you becomes the crazed scientist and would-be world conqueror DOCTOR DOOM. The other plays Doom's arch rival in the MARVEL UNIVERSE, REED RICHARDS, and the FANTASTIC FOUR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you play the part of the brilliant super villain Doctor Doom, your objective will be to make New York a has-been on your way to taking over Florida -- and the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you play the part of the Fantastic Four, your goal will be to make Doctor Doom and his doomsday device look like amusements from Coney Island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything you need to play is provided: two books, Combat Table, and Character Sheets. No dice are required. All you need is a healthy supply of luck and two pencils!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAY ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, MANY TIMES!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is different every time you play, but your well-being is always at stake in THE DOOMSDAY DEVICE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
