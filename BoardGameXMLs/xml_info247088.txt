			<description>&amp;quot;What is STOOPID The Card Game?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;STOOPID is the glorious absence of common sense.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In STOOPID The Card Game, you the player use (BURN) your common sense to play an array of cards that you draw from your deck and play from your hand. These cards have all kinds of effects that cause damage or hinder the other players in some way. You can even call on your neighbors to come fight at your side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 5 card types in the STOOPID Core Deck; each one does something different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Accidents&lt;br/&gt;     Happenings&lt;br/&gt;     Neighbors&lt;br/&gt;     Skirmish&lt;br/&gt;     Things&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of STOOPID is to use your cards to knock the other player(s) health down to zero and out of the game. But are they?!.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing STOOPID with 3 or more players, the players that get &amp;quot;knocked out&amp;rdquo; become ghosts. As ghosts they use their Skirmish (red) cards to haunt the players that are still alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
