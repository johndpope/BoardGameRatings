			<description>Cards of Kink is game for your naughty mind.  It is a question and answer game inspired by Mad Libs, Apples To Apples, and Cards Against Humanity. The game is built with content focused on the Fetish/Kink community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are the draft instructions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Deal Cards: Deal 10 Answer Cards to Everyone.&lt;br/&gt;2. Choose a Card Dom: The person with the most subs at the table becomes the first Card Dom. Everyone else is a card sub.&lt;br/&gt;3. Pick Master Card: The Card Dom picks a Question card and reads it aloud. This card is called the Master Card.&lt;br/&gt;4. Create Submission Pile: All players, except the Card Dom, choose an Answer Card from their hand and pass it to the Card Dom.&lt;br/&gt;5. Choose Cards: The Card Dom picks Answer Cards from the submission pile, and reads them aloud one by one.The Card Dom then chooses his favorite card. That Master Card goes to the player who submitted the favorite Answer Card. Each Question Card is worth one point&lt;br/&gt;6. Choose a New Card Dom: The person to the Card Dom&amp;rsquo;s left becomes the new Card Dom.&lt;br/&gt;7. Replenish and Repeat: Every player picks a new answer card.  Then go to Step 3 for the next hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
