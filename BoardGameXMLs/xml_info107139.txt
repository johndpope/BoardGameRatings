			<description>Publisher's Catalog&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meet the Chromatic Dragon face-to-flame in BALROG, the first in the MACES &amp;amp; MAGIC Series. This fantasy adventure features one of the larges data bases ever created for a microcomputer role playing game. Not only can you create completely individual characters, but you may also choose from a huge inventory of specific weapons and armor items. Freeform input combined with choices suggested by the program makes the discovery of the more secret areas of the dungeon a real challenge!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MACES &amp;amp; MAGIC are fantasy adventures involving you and your computer. Armed only with your wits, a microcomputer, and the software provided, you can become the hero or the meal your destiny dictates. You create a character, equip him (or her) with suitable weapons and armor, and enter the dungeon in search of fame and fortune. Neither is particularly easy to obtain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are successful in avoiding or conquering the various monsters, traps, enchantments and illusions set by our nefarious dungeonmasters, you may escape with riches and glory. Your name and deeds will be recorded for posterity in the records of the dungeon. More importantly, you'll be alive. You may then use the same character in his more experienced and wealthy form when you enter dungeons on later occasions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
