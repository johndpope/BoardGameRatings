							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombicide Survivor: Eva</name>
									
			<description>Inspired and gifted, Eva was unsatisfied with her humble life as an accountant. Being part of the rank and file was like being a zombie to her. So, in her spare time, Eva danced, drew, sculpted and even took Japanese fencing lessons. Like everyone else, the zombie invasion changed Eva&amp;rsquo;s life: acting normal is now a nonsense and she feels more alive than ever. Extroverted and hyperactive, Eva is a messenger between survivors groups. No way she&amp;rsquo;s going to give up on her old activities: her notebook is full of sketches and that sword sure comes in handy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eva is a promotional Survivor that was available to those that pledged extra during the Kickstarter campaign.  She may be available in limited quantities at upcoming conventions.  A zombie version (Zombivor) will be available to backers in 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
