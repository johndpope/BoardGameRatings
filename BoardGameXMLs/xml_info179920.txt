			<description>Many Parsecs of Space (working title but yes - pun intended!) is an upcoming space 4X game that reimplements Martin Wallace's innovative deck building mechanic from A Few Acres of Snow. Anyone familiar with AFAoS or Mythotopia will be playing MPoS in minutes, though it's far from a simple reskinning. MPoS takes the core mechanic in an entirely new direction by introducing exploration and trade in a multi-player science fiction setting. Location (world) cards are variable and hidden at setup and revealed only when explored. This is not only thematic, but creates infinite replayability and solves the dominant strategy issues (ex. Halifax's Hammer) that can plague low luck games with a static setup. Trading with your neighbor is essential because nearby star systems may lack the resources you need to expand your empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME FEATURES:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Unique sentient races for asymmetrical play.&lt;br/&gt;     Secretly customize your race beforehand so other players won't know what they're up against until first contact!&lt;br/&gt;     Choose a government and economy that allows you to discard, reserve, and remove cards according to your playing style. &lt;br/&gt;     A world suitable for your race to colonize may not be for your neighbor. One race's garbage is another race's treasure!&lt;br/&gt;     Technology cards function like empire cards from AFAoS but with the added wrinkle of a tech tree.&lt;br/&gt;     Steal resources and technology from your neighbor or trade partner with piracy and espionage.&lt;br/&gt;     5 scarce resources (energy, metals, military, organics, and science) must be acquired so trading is a MUST to efficiently grow your empire.&lt;br/&gt;     Discover ancient artifacts on dead planets and worm holes that connect distant star systems.&lt;br/&gt;     Terraform tide locked worlds to make them suitable for colonization.&lt;br/&gt;     Invade an outpost or colony to make it your own or NUKE it so nobody can colonize it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
