							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Is This Just Another Bug Hunt</name>
									
			<description>From the rules Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Is this going to be a stand-up fight, sir, or another bug hunt&amp;quot; - Hudson&lt;br/&gt;These rules are inspired by the films Aliens (tm). They can be played solo as the Aliens are all generated by dice rolls. Two possible games can be played:&lt;br/&gt;(1) The players are Colonial Marines who are exploring a base where a group of colonists have settled. Earth has lost all contact with the colonists. The marines are sent to check the base out.&lt;br/&gt;(2) The Colonial Marines are planetside defending a group of settlements where contact has been made with the bugs.&lt;br/&gt;Further scenarios may be created too if preferred, use the films for ideas. Any scale of figure will do from 10mm to 25mm, a collection of D6 are required. Measurements used are by squares if using floorplans otherwise substitute inches for squares.&lt;br/&gt;Now includes Alien background history and Miniature Figures available.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players run a squad of space Marines through a derelict space base or landscape attempting to eliminate as many Aliens as possible and eventually eliminating the Queen.  Elimination of the Queen constitutes a victory.  Each turn the space Marine player is allotted Action Points to spend that turn on movement and attacks.  Aliens are controlled by the game system using tables. There are a number of tactical details that the player can manipulate to gain an advantage over the Aliens such as bringing Androids to fix equipment, special weapons, and autoturrets.  Rules also cover acid splashes, line of sight and Command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
