			<description>From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player walks his counters across the board. If he lands on a space marked with one of the seven different plant symbols, he may take the matching plant card. But before all 64 board spaces have been &amp;quot;planted&amp;quot; with altogether four kinds of plant, the amateur gardener may suffer several cruel turns of fortune. Drought may wither his lawn, sunflowers or plums, caterpillars and greenfly attack his pansies and lettuce beds. The lucky player will be protected against such ravages by having earlier drawn an &amp;quot;antidote&amp;quot; card, such as insurance against flooding, bug killer to combat a plague of maybugs. A player landing on the &amp;quot;Garden Party&amp;quot; space is served a small refreshment for relaxation, such as a sweet or a glass of lemonade. Adults will prefer a glass of the harder stuff.&lt;br/&gt;Winner is the first player to plant the 16 spaces of his garden with 4 different types of plant cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
