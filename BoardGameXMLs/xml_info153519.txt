			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This release of The Manual of Mutants &amp;amp; Monsters provides game stats on the Cyclops, the single-eyed giants of myth who once mastered lightning but have since fallen into disgrace and degradation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes common cyclops game statistics, providing a dangerous threat to throw at one's players, as well as the elder cyclops, a larger, more powerful ancient who has somehow found a way to avoid the curse of their kind and retain much of their power of old. Rounding out this product are three caper ideas for using cyclops in your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
