			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Whom It May Concern:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Most Honorable Prime Minister Murray Pug Esq. formally requests an audience at your most expedient capacity. His excellency is in need of the service of a dog of your stature, as you exemplify the best of your field of expertise. The Office of the Prime Minister requests that you keep this missive private, though, for discretion is key in this rather precarious and sensitive situation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please meet the Prime Minister at The Royal Pugmire Opera House, 212 Burrower Street, Southgate, this morrow&amp;rsquo;s evening for the rendition of &amp;ldquo;Don Golden Retriever.&amp;rdquo; Upon your arrival, please give this token to the front desk. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fare thee well great adventurer, and may Man look over you in these trying and turbulent times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Mother Superior Mudd Coyote-Shetland&lt;br/&gt;Inquisitor Curate &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the opening module of &amp;ldquo;The Cult of the Post Man.&amp;rdquo; This module is set within the world of Pugmire, highlighting the themes of religious ideology and political corruption. It is aimed at a more adult audience but can be modified anywhere from slapstick comedy to dark and brooding to fit the age range of the players involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
