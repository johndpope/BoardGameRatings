							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blades of Exile</name>
									
			<description>Blades of Exile consists of three short scenarios set after the main trilogy as well as an editor that allows players to create their own scenarios, which need not be set in the Exile game world at all. Several hundred custom-made scenarios have been designed since the release of the game in 1997. The most prominent meeting places on the web of the Blades of Exile community are the official company-hosted internet forum. These forums offer support for beginning designers and players, reviews of new scenarios and general discussions about the use of the scenario editor. In June 2007, Jeff Vogel released the source code for Blades of Exile, which is currently under the GNU General Public License, version 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Exile (video game series),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
