			<description>Big changes are about to happen in the charming town of Sanset City. Reforms in mental health care, dubbed &amp;quot;107 City&amp;quot; are coming.&lt;br/&gt;You live in this town and are confronted with different mental health issues. Try to find solutions by making the best use of the available services.&lt;br/&gt;Will you be able to improve your quality of life?&lt;br/&gt;Or will you be washed away by even more problems heading in your direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player incarnates a citizen, each with his own personal problems. For this you get a personal player board with starting stats on money, medical health, social situation. By playing cards and moving you can get to locations which improve these stats by rolling a die or get you the help of characters in the game.&lt;br/&gt;You play once on each side of the board; one side representing the state of the city before reforms and the other representing the state after reforms. Make sure your citizen ends with the best stats; meaning the best quality of live!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
