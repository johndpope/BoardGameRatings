							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Watchtower on the Hill</name>
									
			<description>From the rear cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The door to the Mughouse bursts open as a man yells &amp;quot;Help, someone, anyone!&amp;quot; The pub quiets into whispers and frightened stares. The man is an overweight laborer in a blue grey tunic and flowing brown hair and beard. He is sweating excissively and looks very winded. A boy runs in behind him and stands to his side, helping the man stay on his feet. It takes the laborer a moment to catch his breathe before wheezing out, &amp;quot;please someone, my boy Kevin has fallen down a hole at the old watchtower! I cannot get to him. I need able-bodied folk to get my boy out safe!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another bar patron yells forth &amp;quot;the old watchtower? What do ye mean Donald? Many people have been up to the tower, kids play in it, it has no holes or anything?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Donald replies, &amp;quot; I know, but Gregory here came to get me when Kevin fell in and took me up to where the hole is. There is a hole and ladder under the dirt and boards of the main floor of the tower. I don't know why it's never been found before, but the hole sure is there and my boy is down in it, so who's gonna help me?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old watchtower stands outside of town. The boy's frantic father requests your aid. Are you brave enough to delve deep down inside the watchtower on the hill?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
