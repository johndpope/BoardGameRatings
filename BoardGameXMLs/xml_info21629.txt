							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tickityboo</name>
									
			<description>Tickityboo(tm)  is a game similar to Stubborn(tm), but with hexagonal tiles, and more of them.  The hexagonal tiles mean that each tile has six large triangles, each of a different color...Stubborn has only four large triangles and hence only four colors.  Each Tickityboo tile is therefore a member of 6 different numerical series.  &lt;br/&gt;Despite its increased intricacy, Tickityboo is begun just like Stubborn, by placing the specially marked Starting Tile face up on the table.  Each player  then takes 9 tiles blindly from the remaining total of 143 tiles still face down on the table.   When there is more than one player they take turns, but unlike in Stubborn, in Tickityboo each player becomes &amp;quot;vulnerable&amp;quot; if they cannot place a tile, and the another player can move an overlooked tile, and discard one of their own tiles to the vulnerable player's pile. &lt;br/&gt;Like the other games in the &amp;quot;Mining Order From Chaos&amp;quot;(tm) series, Tickityboo is a great solitaire game.  It supports up to nine players, however, to make an engaging pastime for a small party or a third of a normal classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
