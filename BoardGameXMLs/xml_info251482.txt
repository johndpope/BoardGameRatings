			<description>Braintopia Kids is a follow-up to the fast-paced brain bender that tests your mental focus,  flexibility, and speed, but geared toward younger players. Comprised of eight different types of challenges, up to six players race through a deck of cards, fighting to keep up with the ever- changing mini-games, and attempt to solve the puzzles faster than their opponents. Collect brain tokens by beating a single Touch challenge or claiming a pair of cards from any of the other seven games: Maze, Odd one out, Coordination, Duplicates, Frequency, and Reasoning. The first player to collect four brain tokens wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
