							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crisis on Canyon Road</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the file's introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In real life, heroes are often ordinary people who find themselves in extraordinary situations, such as aiding accident victims, dealing with the aftermath of a calamity, or rescuing children in danger. When they see others in trouble or need, they step in and offer assistance with no thought of reward or gain. It is this kind of selfless action that earns them the title of hero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sort of heroism is sometimes forgotten in a d20 MODERN campaign, where threats often come in the form of overwhelming foes or supernatural forces. In situations such as these, heroes are by necessity adventurers&amp;mdash;well-equipped, highly trained individuals who seek out action, mystery, and most of all danger in many exotic forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crisis on Canyon Road allows the heroes to test their mettle in a more mundane way. It places them in a situation that any ordinary person might face&amp;mdash; namely, happening upon the aftermath of an automobile accident on a remote road. Although they are likely to uncover one or two surprises along the way, the main question is whether or not the characters have what it takes to be real heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Short d20 Modern Adventure for Four 17th-Level Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
