			<description>In the depths of space, millions of light years away from the Universal core, a habitable planet has been discovered. Orbiting a young sun and being ripe with resources it is immediately desirable for the High Races. Conquering its primitive inhabitants by force would be easy but the all-knowing, ever-present Overseers do not allow any acts of violence towards infantile races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the High Races has its own way of subduing and infiltrating the simple bipedal mammals on the planet. All aim to to build up a technologically superior and highly productive flock of humans that will rule the entire planet for all ages to come. All wish the other Races to fail in this common task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the planet later known as Earth a tribe of hunter-gatherers huddled together against the night-time cold and look up as an impossibly bright light opens the sky and reaches down to them.  They are not afraid, but curious&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ancient Aliens: Creators of Civilizationsis a card driven build-up &amp;amp; resource management game for 2 - 4 players, ages 10 and up. Players control their own Alien Race that each has their own unique deck of cards. The aim of the game is to improve your puny humans on your continental area of influence to civilized stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During this process, alien technologies and powers are used to control and manipulate the humans in order to improve 3 vital abilities;  Skill, Knowledge and Loyalty. At the same time, you try to outsmart your Alien opponents to make sure your faction becomes superior! As you develop, you gain access to to higher level technologies and can build more beneficial structures and monuments for future generations to gaze upon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as any one player improves their last ability to civilized stage, it triggers the end of the game. Then Civilization points are counted (gained from built buildings, built monuments, crystals and agendas fulfilled) and the player with the most points is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
