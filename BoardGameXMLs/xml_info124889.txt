							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Escape From Pirate Island</name>
									
			<description>Yaaar!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh no!  You and your friends have all become shipwrecked on the dangerous Pirate Island.  Now you all have to work together to escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But watch out!  The island is teeming with hazards, from the treacherous Tall Peak to the deadly Raging River.  Enemies abound on Pirate Island: Headhunters, Skeletons, and - of course - Pirates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there is hope.  There is a rumor of a treasure buried on Pirate Island.  If you and your friends can navigate through the hazards and avoid or kill the enemies, then maybe you can follow the treasure map and find the treasure.   Then you could sneak aboard the docked pirate ship and Escape From Pirate Island!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pirate Island is a cooperative game of exploration and risk management.  Your characters move around Pirate Island uncovering new hexes which could be helpful or hazardous.  You need to manage your food and resources, running out of either can be dangerous, and you need to fight or escape from deadly enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You also need to find the hexes that contain clues to the treasure map, and then, once you have the treasure, you need to get to the lagoon to board the pirate ship to escape.  And you need to do it before time -- represented by the event deck -- runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
