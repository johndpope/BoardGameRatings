			<description>The game is a race from Kansas City to New York. It is a spin and move game from 1911.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planes and Cars start the race in Kansas City and Boats are placed initially in Chicago. All Aeroplanes (sic) must always move using Black Lines, Automobiles using Green Lines and Boats using Red Lines. You can change modes of travel at any common station as long as there is a conveyance that is available and not in use by someone else. Changing from one mode of transportation to another uses up your turn. Lots of things can happen to you on your way across the country. (well half a country)(see some of the pictures for examples)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All pictures of the game come from DAN also known as(treasuresof-yesterday)an EBAY seller who had the game for sale. I saw the game and wrote him asking for permission to use his photos and he kindly game that permission to me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
