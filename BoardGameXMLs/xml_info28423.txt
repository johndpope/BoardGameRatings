			<description>from the games website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FamilyLore, a new board game that centers around the players&amp;rsquo; family history, genealogy, ancestors and traditions, encourages families to bond and share stories together &amp;hellip; so every player is a winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FamilyLore Game is a unique board game for YOUR family. Unique because the game changes and grows as your family plays. FamilyLore Game is based on themes familiar to all families--and to other groups that have a shared history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move around the board by answering questions about the family. These questions are organized around 20 themes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of the 600 Story Cards that are part of the game, 300 have questions to help you get underway. The remaining Story Cards provide players with a chance to write questions unique to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Serendipity spaces are at each corner of the board. When a player lands on one, s/he takes a Serendipity Card and follows its directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete five trips around the board wins the game. Except, this is a game where everyone who plays wins because every player gets to tell his or her favorite family stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
