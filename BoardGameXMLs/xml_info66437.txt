			<description>In Souvlaki Wars, players are owners of Greek restaurants serving traditional greek fast food like &amp;quot;souvlaki&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;gyros&amp;quot;. They try to attract new customers, making sure they can serve them in time, increasing their fortune and fame at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, this is easier said than done as many things can go wrong while trying to serve a customer: People change their minds, orders go wrong and restaurant owners try to sabotage each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you become the most successful Greek restaurant owner?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Souvlaki Wars is a light family card game for 2-4 players. Players draft new customers and try to serve them with food cards they draw at the beginning of each turn. This way they earn the money and the reputation each customer represents. However, before they have a chance to do so, cards with &amp;quot;Unforeseen Events&amp;quot; are played by every player, affecting the game in many different ways like altering the order in lines, adding more customers, decreasing the opponent's reputation etc. And of course, each player has to take into consideration that the customers are served on a first-come basis. If someone's order can't be fulfilled, everyone behind him will have to wait another turn...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach a certain level of money and reputation is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is going to be published by the Greek company &amp;quot;Kaissa Chess &amp;amp; Games&amp;quot; during 2011. It is going to be bilingual, having text both in Greek and English. Its international debut will be at the 2011 Spiel Essen fair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Winner of BGG's Greek Guild's 1st Game Design Contest in the category: &amp;quot;Best Game&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
