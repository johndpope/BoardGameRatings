			<description>Fast play rules for Napoleonic Wargaming c.1805 to 1815. A soft cover book of 38 pages in black &amp;amp; white print.&lt;br/&gt;Tremble ye Tyrants! is a set of rules for medium to large scale wargames set in the last decade or so of the Napoleonic Wars, or roughly between 1805 and 1815. This is the classic Napoleonic &amp;ldquo;Empire&amp;rdquo; period, including the great campaigns of Austerlitz, Jena, Eylau and Friedland, Aspern and Wagram, as well as the invasions of Spain and Russia, and the decisive allied victories at Leipzig and Waterloo. Tabletop armies can represent a wide variety of real life levels of organisation, from a division up to a full scale army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tremble ye Tyrants! is aimed at players who want a fast playing and enjoyable game with a minimum of complex mechanisms, but which retains as much as possible of the tactical flavour of the period, and makes large scale manoeuvres feasible within the confines of an evening&amp;rsquo;s game. Although designed mainly with 28mm figures in mind, it is suitable for any scale and any size of game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
