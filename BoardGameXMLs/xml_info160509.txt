			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With gorgeous cover art done by Nick Ladd, this collection of playbooks for the RPG Dungeon World will allow you to take on the role as virtuous characters who possess honor, chivalry and a righteous heart. This bundle will grant four new classes of holy armored warriors to your Dungeon World games as you adequately cleave, smash, smite, blast and impale any evil your party encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Lancer: Play a glory seeking knight who specializes in riding down foes and winning hearts at tournaments. Although more self-centered than most righteous warriors, The Lancer is no less vigilant or willing to defeat countless villains and monster then other saintly warriors.&lt;br/&gt;     The Redemption Seeker: A sinner who has forsaken their past blasphemous ways and now takes up the mantle of a fanatic holy warrior who will purge evil from this world with his perpetually battle frenzied zeal.&lt;br/&gt;     The Sorcerous Templar: A crusader who has sought out the secrets of studied magic and uses its power to guide the party on their quests or to banish dark forces. The magic the Sorcerous Templar studies is of the same ilk that wizards use, but his faith in just gods is no less than the spell casting clerics of his order.&lt;br/&gt;     The Turtle Knight: A strange knight form a foreign land who has travelled to this less savory realm to root out all cowards and villains and bring them the justice they deserve. The people of your home land, for lack of a better description, are giant turtle people. Your appearance my look silly to some of the locals, but such notions of comedy are lost as your massive armored hulk comes crashing down on the vile souls who stand before you. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
