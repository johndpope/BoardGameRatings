			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rage, Precognition, Grace, was originally released as part of a 24-Hour RPG contest as a one-page RPG.  It was later re-worked and re-released in this expanded format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have three Base Traits:  Rage, Precognition, and Grace.  Characters select a Race which grants bonus points into a Pool; Base Traits start at a value of 8 but can be varied between 0-23 (the Combat Table matrix only runs to 20, however).  Combat is resolved by comparing the Attacker's Combat Value (Grace + Weapon Skill + 7) against the Defender's Combat Value (Grace + Weapon Skill + 7) on a matrix table to obtain a target number between 3 and 12.  The attacker must roll 2d6 and meet or exceed the target number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have a variety of Skills available and also may cast several Spells.  Characters do not have a Class but do have a Type which determines (limits) some abilities.  The rules conclude with a character sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
