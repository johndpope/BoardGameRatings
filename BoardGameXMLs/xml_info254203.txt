			<description>In prehistoric times, players strive to become the leader of their clan by being the most skillful farter, which they achieve when everyone else has passed out from the smells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uga-Uga Bufapum is a &amp;quot;take that&amp;quot; card game in which you play cards that either affect specific other players or the whole village. Players also might get the chance to eat meals to improve their farting abilities. The effect of each card is noted on it; aside from a &amp;quot;draw 2, play 2&amp;quot; rule, there seem to be few other rules in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
