							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Moment of Silence</name>
									
			<description>The Moment of Silence is an investigative thriller adventure game developed in 2004 by German video game developer House of Tales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in the year 2044 in downtown New York City, in a future with many Orwellian influences. The player plays an advertising agency worker named Peter Wright, who is depressed and drinking heavily after the death of his wife and child in a terrorist attack. One night, as he is drinking, he hears a commotion in the hall. Looking out through the peephole in his apartment door, he sees a SWAT team storm the apartment of his next door neighbour and carry out a middle-aged man, much to the pain and anguish of his wife. Peter learns that the man was a journalist named Graham Oswald, and his wife asks Peter to try and find out what happened to him. Peter accepts and, after many encounters, discovers that Oswald was part of a Rebel organization dedicated to revealing a massive government conspiracy to keep the truth from the people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Moment of Silence&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
