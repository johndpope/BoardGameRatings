			<description>1970 Robin Hood boardgame by Editrice Giochi. The game included a 3d representation of the Sherwood Forest, along with a part of the Nottingham castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have to actually shoot the Nottingham Sheriff figure which walks through the forest. Four small firing crossbows are included in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was marketed by Editrice Giochi as a &amp;quot;3Dimensional Game&amp;quot;, because of the Sherwood forest setting which has actually to be built before playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
