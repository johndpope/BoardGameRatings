							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Qruzlat: The Way of the Crushing Fist</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the beginning, when Argok lead his people west, across the Dragonspine  Mountains, he traveled with an advisor known as Tarok Bonecrusher.  Tarok was a warrior without peer, believed to have even bested Argok himself in one-on-one combat.  But what made Tarok unique was that he eschewed both armor and weapons, preferring to fight in only foreign robes, with fists and feet wrapped in leather...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Qruzlat is the orcish martial art developed by Tarok to harness the natural strength and rage of the orc.  This supplement was written specifically for the Life of Rage - OSR Edition game, but can be used in a number of OGL-based systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
