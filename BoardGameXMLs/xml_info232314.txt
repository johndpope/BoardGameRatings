			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awesome Powers is a supplement for the BASH! Ultimate Edition RPG'. Inside, you will find new Powers, new Enhancements, new Limitations, and new ideas to incorporate into your BASH! campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chiefly, this product is designed to allow you to create characters with themes, making use of pre-designed powers.  You can use these powers for inspiration, or you can even create your character by rolling for powers at random. As the Awesome Powers library grows, so will the list of available powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume 10 of Awesome Powers deals with powers of a Light and Shadow. It is ideal for building luminous beings who soar through the cosmos, shadowy figures who melt into the dark, or manipulators of light or dark energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Light allows you to control photons, produce damaging lasers or radiation, phase through matter, or withstand the rigors of cosmic travel at incredible speed, as well as many other tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadow allows you to manipulate darkness itself, solidifying it to make weapons and traps, or to desolidify matter to move through solid objects. It can also be used as a means of travel (or storage) through use of the mysterious &amp;quot;Shadow Dimension&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume 10 Also introduces two new powers. First, there is an alternative to Super Speed called &amp;quot;Hyper Speed&amp;quot; which allows characters to perform a number of &amp;quot;Speed Stunts&amp;quot; in a given Panel in lieu of taking additional Panels per Page. There is also a playtest for the Wizardry power, that will be a part of our final volume on Magic &amp;amp; Artifacts. Wizardry is meant to be a catch-all power that allows you to perform any number of wonderous effects without requiring Cosmic-scale powers. It is intended for making wizards, extra-dimensional beings, and certain magical creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll also find all new Alterations and Enhancements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
