							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Campaign Bautzen</name>
									
			<description>In December and January of 1813 Napoleon's La Grande Arm&amp;eacute;e limped back into Germany and Poland from the debacle that was the 1812 Russian campaign. Leaving Eugene to hold off the Allied onslaught, the Emperor returned to France to work his magic and out of the recruits of France a new army was formed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, Eugene had fallen back in the face of the larger Allied host. The Prussians walked a diplomatic tight rope for the first months of the year but by March were in open revolt. The Prussian generals formed new forces in East Prussia and Silesia and other parts of the realm. Along with the standing army they were ready to stand with their Russian allies. England helped the Allies with cash and clothing and munitions. The Sixth Coalition was formed to liberate Germany and take the war to France. In the battles to come both sides would be sorely tested to hold their armies together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Campaign Bautzen allows the players to refight the battles of L&amp;uuml;tzen and the massive battle of Bautzen, which was the largest land battle fought in Europe up to this time, and many other actions of the Spring Campaign of 1813. Will the Allies pull off a victory against Napoleon or will they succumb to his mastery on the battlefield?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a bonus included in this title are the battles of the Russo-Swedish War of 1808-09. Refight the actions in Finland and Sweden which pitted the Russians against their old foes the Swedes. Engage the Swedes in their homeland in the last actions of the war. It's all there for you to enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
