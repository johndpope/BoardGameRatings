			<description>Description from the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Mario Kart - The Card Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fast running card game, players cannot reach the goal before items such as bananas and shells jam your kart and prevent victory! Mushrooms and Stars help you get in first place and achieve victory! Two game modes are included with this game! Grand Prix and Battle Mode!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Super Mario Kart Card Game, there are two games you can play: Grand Prix and Battle Mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Grand Prix, players use numbered movement cards as well as item cards to navigate through the pack of racers from the back of the line to the front of the line. When players play movement cards, the numbers are compared to determine placement of one's kart in that round. However, players can also use item cards to assist themselves or hurt other players in their quest to win the race!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Battle Mode, players are equipped with three balloons (like the video game) and players must manage their hand as well as anticipate the moves of other players to try and outmaneuver their attacks while landing their own. The last player with balloons is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
