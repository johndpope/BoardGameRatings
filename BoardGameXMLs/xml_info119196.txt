							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Realm of the Undead</name>
									
			<description>From the cassette inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To you has fallen the task of rescuing the villagers and killing the Dark Lord. To do this you must travel through the Realms of the Undead collecting as much garlic as you can and avoiding the deadly bite of tarantulas, the kiss of the vampires and the caress of the zombies. On being caught by one of the servants of the Dark Lord you will lose one clove of garlic and when your supply has expired you shall most surely perish. However, if you are bitten by Dracula three times, although you do not perish, you are banished to the outskirts of his realm and have to recommence your original task rescuing the villagers and then return to the final confrontation with Dracula. Throughout the game are secret doors and levers which, on use, provide interesting results that may, or may not, be beneficial to your quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
