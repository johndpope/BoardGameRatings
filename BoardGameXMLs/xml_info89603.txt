			<description>Game box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jousting on a flying ostrich will sap your strength and stretch your sanity. Drop your lance and you're dead. Too much haste and you perish. Lose sight of an enemy egg and you're finished. As you flap your wings to move around the screen you have to be constantly alert to hold on to your three lives. This joust is no jest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climb onto your mighty ostrich, level your lance, make sure of your balance, take off and do combat. Your main objective is to stay alive, and that's hard enough. With careful control of the ostriches wings and direction, you must destroy the rest of the buzzards in the arena. The only way to do this is to &amp;quot;joust&amp;quot; with them. You must involve yourself in a high speed collision with one of these ugly specimens. On contact you must ensure that your lance is above theirs - else you will end up as buzzard bait. But should you survive this collision,&lt;br/&gt;your opponent will dissolve in a puff of smoke and drop an egg to the ground. You must destroy this egg by jumping on top of it whilst avoiding the swooping movements of the other ostriches. If you fail to destroy the egg quickly it will mutate and hatch into another of these evil beasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On lower levels with only 3 or so ostriches, it is only hard, but as you move onto arenas with at least seven ostriches, you will find that it is virtually impossible especially as the eggs will mutate in just a few moments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
