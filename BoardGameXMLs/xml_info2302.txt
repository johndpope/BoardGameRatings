							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bill Oddie&#039;s Great Bird Race Game</name>
									
			<description>Drive to the various locations on the board and indulge in some bird-spotting by picking up one of the bird cards relevant to that location.  The cards are worth various points depending on their rarity.&lt;br/&gt;The are also very rare birds that become available on occasion to whoever gets to them first.&lt;br/&gt;The game is intended more as a fun way to learn about birds rather than a strategy game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
