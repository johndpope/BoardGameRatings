							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Archery Range</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of an even larger compound is this quite sizeable training hall for archers with its attached archery range. Very little of the actual training hall is built from stone. Most of it has been constructed from wood. Its back wall consists entirely of sliding doors opening towards the practice range. The archery range in turn is essentially a grassy square, surrounded by a low retaining wall to keep people from wandering into the line of fire. At the far end of the yard a number of straw targets on wooden frames are arranged under a simple roof to protect them from the weather. A few more of these targets stand in the training hall itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
