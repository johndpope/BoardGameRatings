			<description>Super Spy Hunter is a vehicular combat video game developed and published by Sunsoft for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was originally released in Japan on September 27, 1991 as Battle Formula (バトルフォーミュラ?), which means that this game originally was not a sequel of Spy Hunter. Sunsoft would later obtain the license from Bally Midway to market the game as such in 1992. The game was rereleased in Japan for the two-in-one Sony Playstation game, Memorial Series SunSoft Vol.6, which also included Gimmick!, another SunSoft game which is also known in Europe as Mr. Gimmick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Spy Hunter&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
