			<description>from the cover:&lt;br/&gt;A Starting Fantasy Adventure Intended for beginning Adventurers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was created to work in a fantasy role-playing game, intended for use in Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic edition, but could also work with Labyrinth Lord or other adaptable fantasy role-playing games. It would be advisable to use a system with little or no skill required for the characters, as the adventure involves animal handling, survival, diplomacy, and creative problem resolution. Game systems that use skills may cause complications if the players did not pick particular skills effective to this adventure. The adventure is expecting player characters will act in a heroic way and help the destitute family, and it is unlikely the adventure will happen if they do not participate in a heroic fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters will be outdoors and it occurs during a winter storm, so characters will have to quickly scrounge up winter gear. As with all our adventures feel free to modify or change any parts you like or just ignore it all together. There are a gross amount of Christmas and holiday references, which may be adjusted to a more fitting symbol should you have a different cultural background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment:&lt;br/&gt;from Episode 3 - The Unicorn without a Horn and Episode 4- The Unicorn Without A Horn part 2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
