							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ghoul</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are dead. You do not feel blood coursing through your veins, the warmth of another&amp;rsquo;s touch, or the gentle caress of a cool breeze. Only hunger. A terrible, painful, endless hunger that claws at your soul, or what is left of it. No matter how much you eat the best you can hope for is a fleeting respite, and the only thing that staves it off is the flesh of the dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh you can try to resist it, but in time it will overtake you: you will kill, and you will eat, either until someone puts you in the ground for good or there is nothing left. So, what will you do? Indulge recklessly to satisfy your gluttonous urges, or try to redeem yourself by eating the other monsters that infest the world. The world is your oyster. Or, rather, buffet. Dig in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the mummy playbook this is actually two pdf documents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One is a &amp;quot;digest-sized&amp;quot; book laid out like the Dungeon World book. It includes fictional explanations behind some of the moves, clarifications, potential hard move examples, and also some new items like corpses and jarred brains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other is the actual two-page character sheet, which includes custom fields to track your hunger and frenzy. It is important to note that ghouls get hungry pretty quick; if you do not keep them well-fed you might soon find yourself on the menu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luckily dungeons are ripe for the picking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
