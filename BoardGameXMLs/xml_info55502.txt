			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;In Weekend Warriors, soldiers stranded at a remote New Mexico military research base face a zombie uprising. You either survived or didn&amp;rsquo;t, but either way most of you probably didn&amp;rsquo;t play past that single adventure. But did you ever wonder just what happened to Camp Trepidation after the initial zombie attack? Jerry, the original author, sure did. Fire in the Hole is his answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fire in the Hole picks up with the US Army setting up perimeter around Camp Trepidation and sending in a recon team (that would be you) on foot to investigate. This time you&amp;rsquo;ll have the resources of the US military (within reason) at your disposal, but don&amp;rsquo;t count on it being a cakewalk. Something has gained a toehold in Camp Trepidation, and it has no intention of leaving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the recon mission, Fire in the Hole features an adventure generator, mission profiles, and more! Use Fire in the Hole as a one-night military horror adventure, or just the beginning of a months-long military campaign against the evil that threatens to overwhelm the entire world. We give you the tools, you choose how they are used.&lt;br/&gt;    * 12 new fully-statted creatures.&lt;br/&gt;    * New weaponry and high-tech enhancements&lt;br/&gt;    * 11 page campaign kickoff adventure Fire in the Hole.&lt;br/&gt;    * A mission generator for keeping the action going.&lt;br/&gt;    * 20 mission seeds.&lt;br/&gt;    * Printer-friendly version also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still not convinced? Read a review from RPG Resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Want to ratchet up the action yet another notch? Check out Flatlands: Fire for Effect, a set of tiles and tokens designed for use with Fire in the Hole. With Fire for Effect, you get a set of soldier tokens, all the creature tokens, and a set of tiles designed just for Fire in the Hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
