			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We're fit, we're alive but we're not back home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out chopper tailed-out after taking a hit.... the pilot won't be leaving the ground again. Now I have to lead my weary platoon back to our lines through the jungles and paddy fields. I know Charlie knows we're here - maybe we can surprise him - maybe not. Jeez, will this stupid war never end!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;June 7th, 1966; A U.S. Helicopter returning troops from a period of R 'n' R in Saigon crashes in the remote central highlands of Vietnam. Now the seven survivors of that crash face a nightmare trek across 57 miles of harsh terrain that is infested with booby traps and enemy soldiers. The journey to Do Hoc, the nearest U.S. base, would test the most able of teams - but with little food or ammunition their chances of making it home are less than slim, their mission is now your mission - are you a survivor?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You take the part of Sgt. Weaver, the only officer left to take charge of the remaining crew. It is important that you learn the individual characters of your team, as completing the mission may hinge upon their reactions to your decisions. Also, during your encounters with the Vietnamese people (Montagnards in the mountain areas) show restraint and caution - all may not be as it seems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the only known rule of Jungle Warfare during those early years was &amp;quot;The Night Belongs to the V.C.....&amp;quot;, the rest is for you to discover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Facebook page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/AstrosProductions&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/AstrosProductions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
