			<description>Board With Life: The Metagame (The Microgame) is a 2-5 player card game representing a single game being played by the Board With Life crew. Each of the 5 main characters is represented by a suit/color, and each has an identical set of 5 action cards, with corresponding power that will help that character win the (fictional) game in question:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Eliminate (1) - removes another card from the game&lt;br/&gt;- Defend (2) - protects previously played cards&lt;br/&gt;- Swap (3) - swaps cards between players&lt;br/&gt;- Strategize (4) - adds to the power of any other card&lt;br/&gt;- Gloat (5) - does nothing really, but has the most power&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with a quick draft so each player can develop their own strategy, but each turn of the game consists of a player playing a single card. You execute its action, and the card remains in front of you as power towards winning that character. Players are vying to have the highest total power in each character, but player with the highest only scores points equal to the power his opponents control. And since there are five different characters, there are five opportunities to score, so players want to have the highest strength in each character, but only by a slight margin and in as many characters as you can for maximum points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
