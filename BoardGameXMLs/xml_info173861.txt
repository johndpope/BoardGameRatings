			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The true wonders of Arcana are explored in the monthly journals. Each issue focuses on a hex within the game world, offering rumors, hidden lore, and detailed descriptions of all the important sites and people of that area. Full color maps (also offered in print-easy black and white) are provided on the hex itself, plus all sites of worthwhile note, such as towns and major adventure sites. Floor plans of castles and other location are also offered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to this detailed write-up of the hex, each issue will also focus on other aspects of the game world, its history, important people, the Magi and gaming classes. When you add it all up, these journals take the mundane and make it magical. It is through the journals that the Arcana game world will grow, expand, and become a living place of adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue of the Journal will cover the following aspects of the game world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    House Foxlight&lt;br/&gt;    School of Mystisim&lt;br/&gt;    Dress of the Elves&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
