			<description>Can your fleet of numbered bees infiltrate the enemy hive and &amp;quot;buzz&amp;quot; the Queen Bee?&lt;br/&gt;Higher numbered bees outrank lower ones. With a single &amp;quot;buzz,&amp;quot; or touch, they move remove lesser bees from the hive. At number zero, the Queen Bee is practically defenseless.&lt;br/&gt;Protect your Queen Bee from attack!&lt;br/&gt;Steer clear of the dreaded fungus!&lt;br/&gt;Watch out for the deadly Killer Bee!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Math skills covered: inequalities (greater than, less than), fractions, decimals, negative numbers, and place value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is meant for use in grade 2 mathematics classrooms and beyond. The game is to be played by two players at a time. Players try to protect their queen bee from attack; steer clear of the black fungus; and avoid the deadly killer bee. Each player has nine worker bees with a whole number, fraction, or decimal value, one queen bee, and one killer bee. Players attack other bees of unknown value, and the bee with the higher value survives. Whoever captures their opponent's queen bee wins. Mathematics skills covered include inequalities; fractions; decimals; negative numbers; and place value. The game contains a game board, bee value cards, and playing piece stands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
