			<description>Author's blurb from website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tech Noir originally started out as a conversion of Cyberpunk 2020 to the D20 system. As time progressed, I realized that 1) I think I've got a pretty good idea here and 2) D&amp;amp;D 3e wasn't what I was going for. So, it's become OGL (not D20 licensed), and many significant changes have been made to the core system since I started work on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last &amp;quot;finished&amp;quot; version I have done is Version 2.5. Features of this version:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* mid20 core die mechanic&lt;br/&gt;    * 5 core classes&lt;br/&gt;    * reworked stat/HP system&lt;br/&gt;    * grim 'n' gritty combat and firearms rules (thanks Ken Hood)&lt;br/&gt;    * reworked karma/XP system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, I'm rewriting it mostly from scratch again. I'm not sure I'll ever be happy with it, but here's what I have in store for version 3.0:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* classless character creation and progression&lt;br/&gt;    * Traveller D20 style lifepath character creation&lt;br/&gt;    * actually finished cyberware system&lt;br/&gt;    * actually finished netrunning system&lt;br/&gt;          o I never got around to finishing these before the last Great Rewrite&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
