			<description>&amp;quot;The Game of Space Tag&amp;quot;  This is a nuclear/space themed version of Battleship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules .....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blasto is a battle between two space fleets.  Regular Blasto is played by two players.  Three may play, however, if two game boxes are used.  See note under variations at the end.  The object of the game is for each player to locate and destroy his opponents' fleet.  The player who accomplishes this first is the winner.  Occasionally there will be a tie game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
