			<description>Football Manager 2010 (abbreviated to Football Manager 10 or FM10) is a football manager simulation video game. It was released on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and PlayStation Portable on 30 October 2009. It is also available for digital download on Steam and iOS.The game demo was released on 14 October 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first release in the series to be sold under the Football Manager name throughout the world. Previous North American (i.e., USA/Canada) versions were sold as Worldwide Soccer Manager.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's developers have expanded on the 3D match engine first introduced in Football Manager 2009, with more animations, stadia, and even pitch degradation. There will be the ability to &amp;quot;shout&amp;quot; from the touchline to change tactics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The database editor has also received an upgrade, the stand-out feature of which is the option to add new divisions to existing leagues or to add entirely new leagues to a game database. Users can then, for example, make the English league system fully playable right down to its lowest tier (up to level 20), making it the first football management game capable of doing so, or they could make a league for a nation whose league is not normally playable, or even make their own entirely new league, such as a &amp;quot;super league&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Football Manager 2010&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
