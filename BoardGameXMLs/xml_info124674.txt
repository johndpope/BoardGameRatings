			<description>The land is undiscovered...but pioneers will put roots down, and form outposts in areas with rich resources. But outposts are limited by the local resources they have available to them, and so, the railways begin to connect the outposts to trade with each other. Soon, outposts become towns, and then cities. How will your country develop?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A surprisingly simple game of country building, city connecting, and pick-up-and-delivering for one. The player places domino-like cards to create a map. Land cards indicate both natural resources and railways links. Outpost cards have both resource production abilities and resource demands. When placing outpost cards, gains resource cubes based the outpost's ability to produce a resource that matches the natural resources of neighboring land cards. If another outpost becomes linked to a another outpost via a connecte railway, and one outpost hHas a resource demand while the other has a matching production cube, then that resource can be delivered, increasing the recieving outpost to a town. A second delivery increases it to a city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for the 2012 print-and-play Solitaire Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
