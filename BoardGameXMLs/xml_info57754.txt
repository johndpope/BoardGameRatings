			<description>Bulla Exchange helps the players to have an appreciation of emissions trading or an ETS in its simplest form. Each player is randomly allocated household permits (based on house and household size) and a disposable income (in chameleon dollars).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting with a randomly allocated chamsuite (i.e all the 8 different appliances) each, players strive to achieve household consumptions in kilowatts-hour that are within their given permits. There are 10 extra cards, change-of-fortune cards, added to the 32 cards that will enable players to acquire more permits. Players will also be able to use financial derivatives, such as futures contracts and put/call options contracts to either buy or sell more permits over a period of time. Our website provides information that will enable players to use any of these derivatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner will have a chamsuite with a total energy efficiency covered by his/her permits, and more money (from the remaining permits that are converted to cash based on the spot price of carbon at the time the game is stopped).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
