			<description>The objective of the game is to get as many points as possible answering questions. Every correct answer is awarded one point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every question (1920 in total) is accompanied by a picture. Cards with pictures and questions are put into a specially designed folder that allows you to only see the questions on one side and the answers on the backside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The person or team that has the most points after finishing the 3 folders with random questions, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Source: inside box)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
