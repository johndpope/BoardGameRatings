							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Random Scribbles to Bamboozle Players to Find on Pieces of Paper</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some players will often insist on searching through every piece of paper looking for clues and helpful information. This list, which is primarily aimed at a 20th century or later Earth setting, provides them with 100 different random scribbles for them to find, scribbles that look important, or to hold hidden meaning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;None of them have any use (unless the GM decides otherwise). Although many do have meaning, and this meaning is explained, in the context of the adventure all of them are red herrings. They are simply the random jottings people make for their own use. Some pieces are simply random gibberish. Players may waste time trying to discern the hidden meaning of these scribbles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chq. 142 239.26 18th (Cheque no 142 for 239.26 posted on the 18th)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
