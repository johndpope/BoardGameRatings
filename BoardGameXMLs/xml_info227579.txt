			<description>Abstract Board Game for 2 players named after the Roman Goddess of Mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A standard chessboard is used with a set of 36 tiles numbered from 1 to 36.  To start the 36 tiles are placed, face-up on the middle 36 spaces of the Board.  Once completed the central 4 tiles are removed an placed, randomly, on the four corners of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to move tiles around the board in order to make a recognized mathematical pattern of 4 tiles - a Trope.  &lt;br/&gt;A Trope can be orthogonal or diagonal and the tiles within a Trope must form a connected line of adjacent tiles.  In an orthogonal Trope tiles will share a side. In a diagonal Trope tiles will share a corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The numbers within a Trope must be in line in ascending or descending Order so for instance you could have 1, 2, 3, 4 or 4, 3, 2, 1 but not 2, 3, 1, 4 or 4, 2, 1, 3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Types of Trope are:&lt;br/&gt;Consecutive Run --- (Four Consecutive Numbers) - Example: 1, 2, 3, 4 or 8, 9, 10, 11&lt;br/&gt;Multiples Run --- Example: 3, 6, 9, 12 or 8, 12, 16,20&lt;br/&gt;Irregular Repeating Run--- Example: 4, 7, 10, 13 or 13, 17, 21,2 5&lt;br/&gt;Plus 1 Plus 2 Plus 3 Run--- Example: 16, 17, 19, 22&lt;br/&gt;Prime Number Run--- (Must be consecutive Primes) - Example: 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7, 11, 13, 17 or 23, 29, 31, 33&lt;br/&gt;Power Run--- Example: 1, 2, 4, 8 or 4, 8, 16, 32 or 1, 3, 9, 27&lt;br/&gt;Squares Run--- Example: 1, 4, 9, 16 or 9, 16, 25, 36&lt;br/&gt;Triangular Run--- Example: 1, 3, 6, 10 or 6, 10, 15, 21 or 15, 21, 28, 36&lt;br/&gt;Fibonacci Run--- Example: 1, 2, 3, 5 or 3, 5, 8, 13 or 8, 13, 21, 34&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns to play. &lt;br/&gt;On your turn you may move 1 tile.  A tile may be moved like a queen in Chess, it may also jump other tiles like in Checkers. &lt;br/&gt;When Jumping, there may be any number of jumps and they may be in any direction, forwards and backwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you make a Trope on your turn remove it from the board and place it in a pile next to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect 3 Tropes wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
