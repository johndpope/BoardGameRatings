			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MasterMind is a computer version of the board game, MasterMind, in which the player works over a series of rounds to discern the four-colour pattern that is hidden at the top of the board.  More points are awarded for the player's quick deduction as well as having the opponent take longer to solve their puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;In MasterMind, there is the human player and the CPU, who also solves a sequence for points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
