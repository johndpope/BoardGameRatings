			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first player to collect and fill up his or her Farm Card with 19 Farm Items to win the game.  The lucky farmer gets to wear the ORGANIC FARMER OF THE YEAR button - at least until the next game!  During the game, farmers will discover various strategies they can employ - fair and square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Note - this is a Monopoly-styled game with plenty of education features and a booklet about organic farming).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
