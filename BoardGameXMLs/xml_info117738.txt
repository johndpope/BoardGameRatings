							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Firefighter F.D.18</name>
									
			<description>Firefighter F.D.18 is an action game that revolves around Dean McGregor, a highly-skilled firefighter. The plot is supposedly taken from the film Backdraft, and this is backed by the fact that many similarities can be found, such as the locations of the fires, the company number, and the cinematic sequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, players become firefighters. Their goal is to clear areas where fire has broken out and rescue civilians and fight fire &amp;quot;bosses&amp;quot; at the end. Players have an axe, a fire hose, and a fire extinguisher to break down doors and put out fires as they rescue survivors. Stages are timed. Obstacles, such as falling beams, and chemicals, hinder progress and must be cleared before the player can progress further. There are several stages. They are: 1. An underground tunnel. 2. A computer research facility. 3. A ship. 4. A chemical plant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Firefighter F.D. 18&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
