							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spellfire: Booster Pack, Set 1</name>
									
			<description>June 1994 - These boosters were also released with the first edition double decks.  They had 14 cards that could be found with standard decks, plus every pack had one of 25 chase cards.  These chase were the first AD&amp;amp;D champions. It also had 6 cards names for people at TSR: Gib Ekim (#4), Gib Evets (#11), Gib Htimsen (#13), Dori the Barbarian (#12), Red Zeb (#19), and Fejyelsae (#7).  This tradition would continue for many boosters to follow.  This is also where we found the first &amp;quot;instant defeat&amp;quot; champions: Lovely Colleen (#22), and Gloriana (#3).  Now, that seems to be all you see in tourney decks.  This too continues throughout Spellfire's History.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
