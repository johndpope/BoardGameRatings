			<description>Dunkerque is a totally new game design, based on Dana Lombardy's original 1972 Dunkerque: 1940 game, which featured big hexes, large counters with no combat factors and hidden movement, and a unit comparison table instead of dice for combat resolution. This division-level game explores possibilities in the 1940 campaign in France, including: Could German panzers cut off and destroy the British Expeditionary Force? Were the extended panzer columns vulnerable to an Allied counter stroke?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game&amp;rsquo;s core content is strongly derived from Dunkerque 1940, the game system and visual approach are totally new. This new graphic approach ties in with 3D components and revised game mechanics to provide a robust, realistic, yet streamlined game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dunkerque&amp;rsquo;s primary new design features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Block system hidden movement&lt;br/&gt;     Color codes for unit quality and movement&lt;br/&gt;     Combat resolution using custom six-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;     Actual terrain map&lt;br/&gt;     Cards in place of air and naval units&lt;br/&gt;     Cards to help determine attacks, defense, random events, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the demise of Last Stand Games, it is unclear when the game would be released and under which publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
