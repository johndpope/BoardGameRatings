			<description>Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja 5, known in Japan as, Naruto Shippuden: Narutimate Accel 2 (ＮＡＲＵＴＯ－ナルト－ 疾風伝 ナルティメットアクセル２ Naruto Shippuden: Narutimetto Akuseru 2), is the fifth installment in the Ultimate Ninja series. The game continues the Naruto Shippuden storyline, going up to the first meeting between Naruto and Sasuke in the anime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the new gameplay additions is the introduction of assist characters. Assist characters are chosen during character selection, and can be called in during a match to deal extra damage. Certain combinations of characters create unique jutsus in a match; these combinations reflect the associations of those characters in the anime and manga. Many of the character's jutsus from the previous game were updated. There are many updated ultimate jutsus, including the aforementioned assist-specific ones. Summons have been removed from the game. The assist characters cannot be turned off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes an RPG mode where players can roam sections of the village and interact with the surroundings of the story and villagers. Also the game includes an extra arc which Tsunade assigns Team Kakashi to re-investigate Orochimaru's hideout in the Hidden Grass village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Naruto: Ultimate Ninja&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
