							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rector Zhaar</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leader of the Pact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As various alien races gathered the fragments of Xenos, they formed a religious faction dedicated to the rebirth of the living planet. This faction is known as the Pact, which is led by a group of individuals called Rectory. Zhaar is the Rectory&amp;rsquo;s most prominent member.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zhaar found fame among his people as an expert pilot. During a test flight using a strange crystal, the craft exploded, and the alien crystal -- actually a chunk of Xenos -- imbedded itself into Zhaar&amp;rsquo;s hand. Thanks to the power of Xenos, Zhaar survived the starship&amp;rsquo;s explosion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zhaar has gone to great lengths to manipulate the image of the Pact in the eyes of the galactic community. While many still see the Pact as a dangerous cult, Zhaar attempts to present them as a group devoted to peace and unity; as he thinks all living beings will live in unity by accepting Xenos into their minds... and Xenos&amp;rsquo; fragments into their bodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powered Legends. Because sometimes what you need is a character everyone will recognize, even if they&amp;rsquo;ve never met her before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
