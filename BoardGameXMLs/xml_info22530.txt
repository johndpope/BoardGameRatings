							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jibi: Who&#039;s the Ace Reporter</name>
									
			<description>To file the best scoop with the morning paper: the player who puts together the best story without getting scooped is declared the ace reporter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jibi is a family game. This action-adventure game is built around the concept of creating photo stories. The players have to move their pieces around the labyrinthine island of Jibos to collect photos to compile and complete their stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, cards representing people and places on the island of Jibos are picked or taken from other players. The object is to collect pairs and sets of photo cards. Special Jibi cards set the pace of the action from start to finish of each game. Although Jibi is a game of strategy, luck also comes into play from time to time &amp;amp;#8211; for better or worse!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHO WILL BE THE ACE REPORTER?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
