							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ancient Empire of the Troglodytes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages ago, when humans lived in caves and stared in wonder up at the glistening night sky, the ancient troglodyte empire of Ssar&amp;rsquo;targontha thrived and prospered in the deep places of the world. For thousands of years, from atop their gloom-shrouded ziggurats set at the very centre of the canal-ringed cities, the empire&amp;rsquo;s high priests used the life-essences of enslaved and sacrificed elementals to build monuments to their demonic overlord and crush their enemies. But nothing is forever. Rebellion and civil wars wracked the empire and precipitated its long, but inevitable, fall into ruin and decay. Now, nothing remains of Ssar&amp;rsquo;targontha but ruined cities squatting in immense caverns, discarded treasures and near-forgotten knowledge of an elder time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ancient Empires gives you, the busy GM, the tools to set exciting, flavoursome adventures amid the ruins of ancient civilisations long fallen into decay and darkness. Within these pages you'll find information on elder sites of power, their traps and guardians, treasures both magic and mundane as well as a selection of adventure hooks. You'll also get notes on integrating the ancient empire into your world's history as well as player options designed to enable them to harness the powers of the fallen, elder folk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
