							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Changeling: A Print-and-Play Pony Game</name>
									
			<description>Changeling is a hidden-identity game in which a small team of Changelings has infiltrated Ponyville to prepare the way for the invasion of Queen Chrysalis. The Pony team attempts to keep Ponyville intact through 5 Episodes, using teamwork, while the Changeling team wins by causing disasters and sowing 10 tokens worth of Mistrust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Changeling's twist on other mafia-style games is the use of Character cards, which serve as both pass/fail votes and as special abilities. Players can call upon more than 60 of My Little Pony's most well-loved characters to aid them during negotiations. Even outed Changelings can swing the outcome of the game if they can use these powers to cause chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
