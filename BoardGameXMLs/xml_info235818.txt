			<description>Kumite is a miniature game that recreates KO fights between elite fighters from all over the world, who practice various martial arts and want to rise to victory to become the best fighter in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first thing you must do is to create your fighter, choosing its nationality, corpulence and style of martial arts; this will change its attributes and provide you with favorable and unfavorable actions. Then create your deck of cards with 40 of the techniques your fighter will use to attack or defend from the 108 available. After this, to the tatami!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game works with a system of successes in rolls of dice, throwing as many as it&amp;rsquo;s indicated in the value of the attribute to use, being successes 4, 5 and 6. The fighters move in a squared board using their techniques every round , having an active turn and a passive turn where both fighters can attack and defend themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will be won by the player who manages to reduce the opponent's Stamina attribute to 0, or after 15 rounds of play, the one that has subtracted more Stamina to his opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
