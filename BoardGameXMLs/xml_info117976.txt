			<description>In-Game Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome, brave German student...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must survive the dangers of the dungeon and retrieve the treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do this, you must perform various exercises with the German language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsters and traps are cleverly hidden in the dungeon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beware the dead ends--break down walls only when you must! You can only break a limited amount!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game you will receive a quiz of the questions you answered incorrectly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;German Dungeon is a German language quiz game set in a fantasy dungeon setting. The game may be played in three modes - translating verbs from German to English, from English to German (with or without gender), and a drill on perfect infinitives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two other options are selected by the player - skill level (difficulty) and dungeon levels (depth). Five difficulty levels are offered. The easiest level features no monsters or traps. The dungeon may be from two to eleven floors deep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game the player must descend to the bottom of the dungeon, retrieve the treasure, and return to the dungeon exit on the top floor. The random dungeon floors are graphically displayed in a top-down view. The player must correctly answer the German language quiz questions in order to open doors, avoid traps, break down walls and battle monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three stats are displayed at the end of the game: the elapsed time, the number of questions missed in the dungeon, and the number of questions missed in the post-game quiz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
