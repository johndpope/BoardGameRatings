			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oops!  That six-hour marathon game session started 15 minutes ago, and you have already killed a player character (PC)!  He was decapitated while being consumed in dragon fire, and his corpse fell into a sphere of annihilation.  Your prediction for recovery is &amp;ldquo;not likely.&amp;rdquo;  You built pre-generated characters for this campaign six months and four character levels ago!  You don&amp;rsquo;t want your player to sit and read the newspaper for the next 5.75 hours.  You need a comparable-level character sheet quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OR&amp;hellip; A new player has just shown up to your table willing to learn to sling dice.  You found out he or she was coming thirty minutes before game time.  Your regular crew of miscreants has already killed off all the spare pre-generated characters you rolled up with gleeful abandon, while cackling wildly and uttering something about &amp;ldquo;drive &amp;lsquo;em like you stole &amp;lsquo;em.&amp;rdquo;  You want this first gaming experience to be fun and memorable, so you don&amp;rsquo;t want to completely wing it.  You need a character sheet, right now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Instant Character!  Just add a player, and go!  In this product, you will discover twenty complete stat blocks for a single PC, level 1 through 20, adhering to the Pathfinder&amp;reg; Roleplaying Game rules.  The core format adheres to the standard non-player character (NPC) stat block most GMs are already familiar with minus the Tactics section.  This makes it easier for the GM to assist with finding information and also prepares the player for the day he or she is running games!  The Special Abilities section includes more detailed write-ups of feats and character abilities than a standard NPC stat block to facilitate faster play.  Sources for spells, races, classes, archetypes, and prestige classes from sources other than the Pathfinder&amp;reg; Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook&amp;trade; (PZO1110) are listed in the Sources section and can be referenced in the Pathfinder&amp;reg; Roleplaying Game Reference Document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of this document is a sheet of character and spell tokens including a token for this character and assorted Non-Player Characters (NPCs) and spell effects.  For best results, print the token page and laminate the entire sheet.  Initially cut out into squares.  To improve ability to move and pick up the laminated tokens, trim off the gray corners to make an octagonal shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snapshot Statement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zuriel is a neutral good male elf with druid levels using the treesinger archetype who fills the roles of healer, combat caster, and ranged combatant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
