							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Don&#039;t Bug Me!</name>
									
			<description>The big ol' hungry Bug is out to ruin your picnic!  The player who defends his/her food the longest, by blocking him from their corner of the picnic blanket, is the WINNER!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a large, fast, battery powered bug that moves around the game board erratically, while players use a plastic hand piece to block the bug from hitting their pie.  The hand piece re-directs the bug towards their fellow picnickers and away from their own food.  The bug moves back and forth around the board until a player fails to block it.  When all 4 food pieces are knocked out of position for a player, they are out of the game.  Play proceeds until there is only one player left with any food untouched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
