							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hampshire</name>
									
			<description>Hampshire is a word game made in Littleton, New Hampshire (USA) - hence the name.  The game comes with four dice (red, blue, green, purple), two player letter charts (in color), rules, and a pad of score sheets (which contain simply 25 blank squares in a 5x5 grid).  The whole thing fits in a box 3&amp;quot; x 3&amp;quot; x 2&amp;quot; (7.5 cm x 7.5 cm x 5 cm) and so is touted as being &amp;quot;for home or travel.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you roll all four dice and consult the letter chart.  The chart shows a result from 1-5 for each of the four colors.  The twenty spaces contain the twenty consonants (all except &amp;quot;Y&amp;quot;).  So a roll of 4 on the blue die gives a &amp;quot;T&amp;quot; result, for example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player rolls no 6s, he must choose one of the consonants rolled and enter it anywhere he wants in the 5x5 score sheet.  If he rolled at least one 6, he may also enter a vowel (or &amp;quot;Y&amp;quot;) of his choice.  If the red and green dice = 7, he may use the purple and blue dice as normal (choose one consonant from the blue and purple rows) but may then add a second consonant of his choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The letter(s) chosen must be entered onto the score sheet - there is only one score sheet for both players, passed back and forth each turn.  Basic Scrabble rules are followed in the mini 5x5 board.  Every letter placed must be alone or make a word.  You score one point for each word you make.  First player to nine points wins.  When the score sheet is full or unusable, if no one has reached nine points, start a new score sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
