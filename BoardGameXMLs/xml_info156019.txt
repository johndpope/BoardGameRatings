			<description>Superpowerful Bonanza is a handmade cardboard/spruce-wood multilevel three-dimensional board game developed by You Tube's Homemade Game Guru. The game features a new line of comic book superheroes competing to save their city from five super villain bosses. Each hero character has an origin story and mission to complete (explained in an accompanying one-shot comic book). The game play was inspired by classic side-scrolling video games like Double Dragon and Contra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each hero and villain has a main game card that lists their 1)strength, 2)speed and 3)intelligence points. Each hero must add to their strength, speed and intelligence points by collecting cards based on weapons, health, powers and superpowers. Cards are collected by moving along playing spaces in each level. Game cards accumulated not only provide point levels for strength, speed and intelligence, but they also give specific instructions on their limitations and extra abilities. Some cards can be kept and others are one-time use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete to gain as many points as possible before taking on each level's villainous boss. Each boss has a complete deck of cards to fuel their strength, speed and intelligence points. Once a boss is reached, a player must duel card-to-card and hope they have the right combination of points to win. Even before players reach the level boss, they must combat minor enemies and deal with civilians (which can help or hinder the mission). Each of the 5 levels plays slightly different from the rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
