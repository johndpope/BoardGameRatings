							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bastion</name>
									
			<description>Bastion is an action role-playing video game produced by independent developer Supergiant Games and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The game's visual style is inspired by anime and its narrative style takes the form of a dynamic voice-over. Bastion was released on July 20, 2011 for Xbox Live Arcade and will be released later in 2011 for digital download on PC.&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in the aftermath of the Calamity, a catastrophic event that suddenly fractured the world as people knew it into many pieces and led to an infestation of hostile creatures. Players take control of the Kid, a silent protagonist who awakens on one of the few remaining pieces of the old world and sets off for the titular Bastion, where everyone agreed to go in troubled times. He finds almost nothing left upon arrival, but is told by a wise old man that together, they could build something special. The Kid then embarks on a quest to reconstruct the world the way it used to be, while the old man narrates his adventure and provides details on what exactly has happened.&lt;br/&gt;Bastion is an action RPG with a level structure. As a hero known as the Kid, the player moves through fantasy-themed environments that form paths on the fly. In order to progress, the Kid must defeat enemies using a variety of melee and ranged weaponry, collecting items and levelling up his attributes with experience points along the way. Between levels, the Kid visits the Bastion, where he can use the money he has accrued to install new buildings. Here, he can utilise establishments, such as a shrine, an armory and a distillery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game incorporates a unique feature called 'dynamic narration'. Rucks, the old wise man (voiced by Logan Cunningham), serves as the game's narrator. As well as delivering story exposition, he will constantly give different commentary based on the player's actions and style of play - for example, he might remark upon the player's affinity for a certain weapon if said weapon is used frequently during battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bastion (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
