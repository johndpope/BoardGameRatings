							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Confrontation (2012)</name>
									
			<description>The game is set in the fantasy universe of Aarklash, a continent riven by an unending war. The player follows a party of Akkylannian fighters in their quest to seek out and destroy the source of the latest threat posed by the Alchemists of Dirz. Their journey will take them through numerous settings with rich decors where they will encounter other races which populate the continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Confrontation aims to reproduce the tactical combat of heroic fantasy classics as Baldur's Gate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party is made up of 4 characters, chosen by the player amongst 12 available classes. Various synergies are possible and any combination could work to succeed a mission. However, it is far more challenging with an unbalanced party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In combat, the player can pause the game to issue more sophisticated commands to his characters.&amp;quot;. The key is to analyse both opponents and environment before deciding on the strategy best-suited to the situation; especially if the most threatening spells are to be avoided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Confrontation (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
