			<description>'Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the most exciting, most underhanded, and most expensive art auction of the century! This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so get those pocketbooks ready - where else can you purchase a Monet, a Van Gogh, or even a Da Vinci? Do I hear 80 million?'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Gallerist, you and the other players are agents representing the world's top galleries, all vying to acquire exquisite works of classic art. Your opponents are armed with hefty bankrolls and deceptive smiles, so you had best be shrewd if you want to amass the most valuable collection of all. Just don't waste your money on a forgery - it's a strict 'no returns' policy on those.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the famous mathematical model by Merrill M. Flood (Haven't heard of him? Neither have we! Famous indeed.), the Gallerist takes moments to learn and teach your friends, before you all get stuck into the fast-paced fun of out-bidding, out-bluffing, and out-wheeling-and-dealing each other. &lt;br/&gt;Let the auction begin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
