							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hex Go</name>
									
			<description>This game is based on the game of Go that was developed in ancient China and adopted in Japan as the national pastime. Hex Go is played on a hexagonal grid rather than the traditional rectangular grid. The rules of play are identical to those of Go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the Game is to build boundaries of stones that surround the largest number of vacant intersections. Each vacant intersection represents one point. The player with the highest point count wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
