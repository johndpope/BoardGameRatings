			<description>From the publisher's page:&lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;Age of Cthulhu 8:&lt;br/&gt;Starfall Over the Plateau of Leng&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An investigation into the whereabouts of a missing artist becomes a manhunt for her suspected murderer. The trail leads to the impossible, deep into the mystical realm of sleep, The Dreamlands. The investigators must journey to the very heart of the Plateau of Leng, to the fabled Pharos of Leng, if they are to find their quarry, but it may all be for naught, as a giant falling star threatens to destroy both The Waking World and The Dreamlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set throughout the globe and torn from the pages of the hidden history of the world, Age of Cthulhu adventures bring new secrets and mind-bending horrors to your 1920&amp;rsquo;s Call of Cthulhu game. Each adventure comes with copious player handouts, detailed maps, and pre-generated investigators ready to risk their lives and their sanity to confront the horrors of an uncaring universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Age of Cthulhu adventures include many of the classic elements of Call of Cthulhu: action, investigation, and a forbidding sense of horror. Though the adventures utilize real locations and historical events, Age of Cthulhu is first and foremost dedicated to exploring the horrors of the Cthulhu Mythos, and to bringing the excitement of heroic pulp-themed adventure to your gaming table. So dim the lights, load your trusty sidearm, and prepare to venture into the unknown...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;the hardcover version is&lt;br/&gt;48 pages of adventure, 5 pages of npc writeups, 7 pages of handouts, 3 pages of advertising and a sheet of perforated business cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
