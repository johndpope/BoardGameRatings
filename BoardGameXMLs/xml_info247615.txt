							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lion and the Fox: Political Intrigue, Crime, Armed Conflict and Supernatural Threats</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure follows different groups from the state of Cordelliana, which is currently invaded by the Guardi&amp;aacute;n republic. PCs handle political leaders that may enter into agreements with an aggressive Empire, must defend their city and send secret agents, and find out a murderer. Players will find out at the end that events were set in motion by a supernatural creature who desires to conduct a ritual to break the walls between the material plane and the Feywild, and will have to reach the latter plane themselves through portal-temples of Esmeraldian natives, acquiring Lycanthropic powers by the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
