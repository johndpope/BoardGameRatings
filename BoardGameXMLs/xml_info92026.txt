			<description>When you get the urge to fish but can't launch the boat.... Here's the solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anglin' Action is a game that involves matching fish with their correct location and lures. This allows a player to 'catch' the fish. All of the fish are assigned different values. &lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the most 'fish points' at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the Game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal five action cards to each player.&lt;br/&gt;Pile the remaining Action Cards, Lure Cards and Location Cards at the side of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three simple phases that make up a player's turn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Draw Phase: Draw one card from the game deck&lt;br/&gt;Action Phase: You may play an Action Card if you want. Simply follow th einstructions on the Action Card. Limit one per turn.&lt;br/&gt;Fish Phase: On this phase a player may do ONE of three things:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Move to a location- Take a location card and place in front of you.&lt;br/&gt;Put on a lure- Take a lure card from your tackle box and place in front of you.&lt;br/&gt;Catch a fish- Take a fish from your hand that matches the correct lure and correct location you are in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Afteryour fishing phase is over the next player goes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when any player has caught their limit of ten fish. At this point the winner is determined by the player with the most points. Therefore the player who caught ten fish may not necessarily be the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
