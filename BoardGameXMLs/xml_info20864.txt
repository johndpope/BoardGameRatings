			<description>In Build! You have to play the role of a pitiless businessman who wants to build up as many construction projects as he can, regardless of their nature and without caring about the damages they can deliver to the environment and to public health. To achieve your goal, you can use different kinds of Cards: Land Cards, on which you can build up constructions; Construction Cards, representing the different buildings you can put on your land; Actions Cards (Attack &amp;amp; Defense), which have the objective of damaging the enemy and/or defending yourself from enemy attacks; Catastrophes, which are terrible events that could happen and damage all the players in the game (Eg. Earthquakes, Volcanic Eruptions, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;All the card illustrations are very funny, the rules are easy and the playtime is about 15-20 minutes, but you can add some strategy to the game, using all the rules included in the game, so that playing time is increased to 30 minutes. &lt;br/&gt;The game box includes two card decks, (each of 55 cards) and the rules. &lt;br/&gt;The size of the card is 8,7 x 6,3 cm.&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed for 2-8 people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
