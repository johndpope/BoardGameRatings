							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Neon in the Dark: The Strange Heroes of the Black Tokyo Campaign Setting</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyone can be a hero.&lt;br/&gt;Anything can be a weapon.&lt;br/&gt;The Black Tokyo Campaign Setting is built upon equal measures of anime homage, hentai in-jokes and traditional Japanese folklore and the dangerous world&amp;rsquo;s heroes are some of the most diverse in gaming. Daring catgirl ninjas walk the shadows with the half-alive children of vampires or the mournful ghosts of women who died during childbirth. The seductive school-girl corpses of suicide might team up with hulking Oni to battle other dimensional horrors, or to challenge a local Yakuza gang for dominance of the back alleys. Minor goddesses might pilot transforming mecha into battle against (or alongside) lithe monks whose bodies are covered in 108 all-seeing eyes. Filth-licking ghouls and heavy industrial robots share the urban night with enslaved catgirls and glamorous sex androids whose origins are far more magical then their assemblers like to admit.&lt;br/&gt;Neon in the Dark: The Strange Heroes of the Black Tokyo Campaign Setting is the definitive guide to building characters for the Black Tokyo Campaign Setting. Inside you&amp;rsquo;ll find details on the myriad races native to the setting. Unlike other campaign worlds, the heroes of Black Tokyo will likely be monstrous and strange. There are several Outsider and Undead races to choose from, as well as an assortment of created races created by occult techno-magic or supernatural engineering. Unique powers such as shapechanging, flight and innate magical talents are common.&lt;br/&gt;After you meet the player races available in this setting, you&amp;rsquo;ll discover an assortment of unique traits and feats for Black Tokyo&amp;rsquo;s heroes. Learning the right talents will let Black Tokyo&amp;rsquo;s heroes shapeshift into fairy-like animal forms, transform their bodies into sexual weapons of war, slip between worlds and more effectively battle the myriad horrors unique to the setting.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, Neon in the Dark closes with an assortment of unique cultural templates. Adding one of these templates can turn an ordinary hero (if there is such a thing) into an internationally acclaimed Idol, a resolute Samurai, or even a hapless (but cute) Love Magnet, or more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
