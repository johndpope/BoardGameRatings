			<description>&amp;quot;The exciting game of Itsy Bitsy Spider's adventure!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Itsy Bitsy Spider Game is a children's game for two to four players Ages 4 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main board of the game is a spiderweb angled at 45 degrees with a tap (faucet) at the top which, when turned, releases a small blue ball. Playing pieces are small spiders which slot into the board. Movement is determined by a twister-style spinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin, each player takes one of the spiders and, in turn, spins the spinner. The player may spin up:&lt;br/&gt;- 2,3,4 or 5: the spider moves that number of spaces up the board; &lt;br/&gt;- &amp;quot;switch spiders&amp;quot;: the player may change places with another spider higher up on the board; or&lt;br/&gt;- &amp;quot;turn the tap&amp;quot;: the player turns the tap at the top of the spiderweb, releasing one of the blue balls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to move your spider up the spiderweb to the top. During the game, the tap may be turned, the ball released has a fairly good chance of hitting some of the spider playing pieces and knocking them off the spiderweb. Spiders which are knocked off have to start again at the bottom. The winner is the first player to reach the top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
