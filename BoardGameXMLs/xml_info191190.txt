It represents the chain (the Dutch word &amp;quot;keten&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;chain&amp;quot;) of organizations and how the inter operate with each other to get criminals convicted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Naturally, it is a simplification of reality. It only has the main portion of the process to show the general working.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in order to help the general public understand the working of the Dutch Justice Department better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from a custom playing board, there 55 &amp;quot;strategy&amp;quot; cards and fifty-five &amp;quot;question and answer&amp;quot; cards, a custom six-sided die and twenty pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pawns are in four colors, one for each player. Each color has five symbols, representing the five &amp;quot;chains&amp;quot; in the game, namely (1) civil law, (2) juvenile law, (3) criminal law, (4) administrative law and (5) immigration law.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fifty-five &amp;quot;strategy&amp;quot; cards are similar to &amp;quot;Chance&amp;quot; cards in the Monopoly game, the are &amp;quot;events&amp;quot;, things that happen either in favor of the current player or in favor of other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fifty-five &amp;quot;question and answer&amp;quot; cards are use in a Trivial Pursuit style. Every throw the player is asked a question on one of the cards. If the answer is correct he / she may move the pawn (according to the number on the die) and choose to throw again. If the answer is incorrect, he or she ends his / her turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The single six-sided die has only three possibilities. There are three sides with a single dot, two sides with two dots and one side with a capital &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; on it. If the player throws either a single dot or two dots, he / she has to answer a question. When the player throws the &amp;quot;S&amp;quot;, he or she gets to draw a &amp;quot;strategy&amp;quot; card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main target of the game is to educate people about the working of the Dutch Justice Department. The way to win the game, is to have your five pawns move along their respective paths and complete them first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
