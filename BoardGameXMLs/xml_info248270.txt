							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Snow Storm</name>
									
			<description>At the time of the Event, the Tyrant December made a desperate gamble to take control of His Vessel, Rasputina. This attempt failed when she redirected His power to one of the Silent Ones, a woman named Snow. The Tyrant's power manifested in the form of a massive wendigo bound to Snow, which later was named Storm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first, the relationship between the two was fractured and hostile. Neither the wendigo nor the Silent One wanted this symbiotic relationship, but Fate is rarely inclined to offer a true choice. As time has moved on, they have developed a respect for each other, moving from animosity to the kinship of pack siblings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They no longer interact much with the Cult, preferring their own company. While they answer to Rasputina, it is a strained relationship compared to the rest of the Silent Ones. Storm's nature has driven Snow more towards independence, and she is more willful as a result. For now, the two are joined with the Cult's cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
