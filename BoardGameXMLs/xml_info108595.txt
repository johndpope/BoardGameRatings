							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fighter&#039;s History</name>
									
			<description>The original Fighter's History was first released as an arcade game in 1993. The game uses a six-button control configuration similar to Street Fighter II and its iterations, as well as an alternate version of the first Street Fighter, with three punch buttons and three kick buttons, each for different strength levels (light, medium, and heavy). There are a total of nine playable characters, as well as two non-playable boss characters at the end of the single-player tournament. The final boss and sponsor of the tournament is revealed to be Karnov, the protagonist of the Data East action game of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this installment hitting an opponent's weak point will not only stun the opponent, it will also cause the opponent to sustain greater damage when the weak point is repeatedly struck afterward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was ported to the Super Famicom in Japan on May 27, 1994, and for its American counterpart, the Super NES, on August of the same year. The two boss characters, Karnov and Clown, are both playable in the home version through the use of a code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Fighter's History&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
