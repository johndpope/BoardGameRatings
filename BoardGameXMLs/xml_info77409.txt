			<description>&amp;quot;From the back of the box.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Real-time strategy game that concerns itself specifically with the events that occurred between 1836 and 1920. Four successive campaigns let you play as one of many Great Powers on the world stage, but you can also take the helm of other nations, like Beroda, Annam, Kutch, or the Ionian Islands. It's certainly possible with a little personal help to move the likes of Argentina or Japan closer to the center of the 19th century world stage. Victoria is played on a 2D world map, with four zooming levels. If you feel the need to jump to an unseen portion of the globe, you can always use the handy mini-map. Victoria allows you to combine a mix of locally harvested resources such as grain, lumber, or coal, with others you can purchase from an entity known as the World Market. In addition to three economic classes, there are also 10 population types that represent your civil and military forces to consider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Victoria, players control their nation from the early 19th century to the dawn of the 20th century, and try to progress into an industrialized power by building up their military, industry, and national prestige. Gameplay focuses on diplomacy, warfare, economy &amp;amp; industrialization, colonization, technological Development and political maneuvering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Take sides in the American Civil War, crush the Zulus, or force open the Dardanelles in the Crimean War.&lt;br/&gt;     Send explorers to map out the inner parts of Africa and the Americas, and bring prestige to your Empire.&lt;br/&gt;     Revolutionary simulation of the Industrialization of the World, with a full economical system.&lt;br/&gt;     Political system simulating the change from absolute Monarchism to the Parliamentarian democracy of the modern world.&lt;br/&gt;     Let ironclads rule the seas while you develop Gatling guns and repeater rifles for land troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
