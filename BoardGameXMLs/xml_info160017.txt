			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Squeeze Box, you are a convict armed with a pistol trying to shoot out walls to make your escape while they are closing in on you.  If the walls touch you, you lose!  Lose 3 times, then it is game over and you will be greeted by the devil!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Squeeze Box has 6 variations to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 1 - There are 6 colored sections of wall closing in on you on both sides of the screen.  Shooting walls gets you points, but do not wait too long to escape as the walls get faster and faster!  As you progress to different rooms, they will also start at a faster speed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 2 - In this variation, the walls only close in on you from one side.  Your goal here is to shoot down every wall back to turn them white.  Do that to all 6 sections and then you'll move on to the next room!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 3 - The walls still rapidly come in from the same side as Game 2, but the other side also slowly grows in, as well.  You may only shoot the walls coming in from the left.  A colored section will occasionally flash.  Shooting a flashing bar gets you more points than normal.  Blast a hole in the wall sections to make your escape!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 4 - This is identical to Game 1, except there are now 12 sections of wall instead of 6.  The sections are also thinner and harder to shoot with your pistol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 5 - This is identical to Game 2, except there are 12 sections of wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 6 - This is identical to Game 3, except there are 12 sections of wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
