							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Reaper Game</name>
									
			<description>The Grim Reaper is calling it quits! Humans are dying at alarming rates, and he just can't keep up. He's challenged a few individuals to take the burden from his bony shoulders, promising that the most efficient reaper will take a place beside him to become the next big boss. To test themselves, the reapers &amp;mdash; each with their own powers and secret missions &amp;mdash; embark on six different locations and times to capture dying victims, but these potential victims will put up a fight, then bargain for their life, offering valuable help in exchange for mercy. The reapers must decide which victims deserve to die and which are indispensable sidekicks &amp;mdash; well, indispensable until plans change since in the end the Grim Reaper will accept only corpses as proof of your work, so the clock, as always, is ticking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Reaper Game is a dice-rolling game with strong set collection and press-your-luck elements. During the game, players roll their dice, then try to fulfill the requirements of the available victims to capture them. In turn, those victims will grant the players unique abilities, such as extra dice or dice manipulation, to help them capture even better victims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each victim belongs to a specific location, and at the start of the game players receive three secret objectives that require specific victims in order to grant extra victory points. During the game, the Grim Reaper itself tries to sabotage the tasks of these chosen souls by taking one location out of play, and once a location has been visited three times, it's removed from play completely. After the second location has been removed, the game ends. The Grim Reaper also has special powers, one of each triggers at the start of each round, causing chaos and heartache to the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Reaper Game features an introductory mode suited for new players and for those looking for an easier and even faster experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
