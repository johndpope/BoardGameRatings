			<description>In Synchropipes players are building a pipes network trying to fit every tile in their boards and connecting the most outer pipes possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of a game each player receives an identical set of 32 tiles. One player is chosen to be the leader. The leader takes 8 of his tiles at random and put them to the box. They will not be used in the game. Every other player now place all the tiles in a visible manner so that every specific tile can be found and taken easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round the leader takes one of his tiles at random and annouces the tile to the other players. Now each other player look for and take the identical tile from their sets. Now all players including the leader have to place that tile on their board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every tile features two kind of pipes. Thin and thick. A thin pipe has two be connected with other thin pipes and thick with other thick. However the central starting pipe and the outer pipes are universal, they can be connected with every pipe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players has to start placing tile from the central pipe and so on to the one already placed. If a player cannot make a legal move she has to place a tile face-down. That tile will score -1 point at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to connect as much outer pipes as possible and have the least possible amount of face-down tiles. Each outer pipe features bonus points that are granted for connection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after 24th turn when all players have their board full of tiles. The player who scored most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
