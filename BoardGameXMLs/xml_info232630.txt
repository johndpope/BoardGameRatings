			<description>Two scenarios and 30 counters for Wing Leader: Victories1940-1942, included in C3i Magazine, Issue #29.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scen&amp;aacute;rio 1 - Cry Havoc, Tunisia, 21 March 1943.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: As Patton's II Corps began to push out of the passes through the Atlas mountains and descend on the Axis flanks, low-level raids were launched against Mezzouna and motor transport columns behind enemy lines, II/JG 51 was the spine of the air defence, but also had the task of covering close air support attacks on the American spearheads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fierce fights began to break out near Maknassy, with American raids colliding with German Raids travelling in the opposite direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scen&amp;aacute;rio 2 - Supercharge, Egypt, 4 November 1942.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: The second day of Operation Supercharge saw a general breaktrough on the ground. 51st Division and 4th Indian Division cleared the anti-tank screen, allowing 1st Armoured Division to get through. Abandoning the Italian divisions in the South, Rommel ordered a withdrawal to Fuka. Throughout the day the Western Desert Air Force mantained a continual bombardment and strafing of the mass of vehicles retreating along the coast road. The hairpins climbing the scarpment at Fuka and Mersa Matruh proved a deathtrap for the Axis. German and Italian fighters were thrown in to stem the tide of Allied bombing. Small clashes developed all over the sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
