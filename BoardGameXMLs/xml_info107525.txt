			<description>The object is to accrue the most money of all the players. This is done by buying and selling RinkWorks features as their prices fluctuate. The one with the most money at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;The prices of the features change almost every day. The prices are set based mostly on how many hits each site received the day before. If the site received more hits on one day than on the previous day, its price will probably go up. If it received fewer, it will probably go down. I say &amp;quot;probably&amp;quot; because prices are determined based on the features' hits with respect to the total. So if the traffic on all features increases or decreases in proportion, the prices will not be affected, but if one feature gains or loses while the others stay the same, the prices will be adjusted accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;Only traffic to the main page of each feature is counted. Although most features contain many pages, the prices in the site market are only affected by hits to the main pages of each feature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
