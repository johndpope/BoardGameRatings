			<description>&amp;ldquo;Board &amp;amp; card game for 2 players. Battle between Jedi knights &amp;amp; Federation allies on Genosis. Takes place in the Star Wars Universe (Episode II). Each figure represents a Hero, Jedi, Creature or Unit of Troops. Victory: The game ends after you go through the deck twice when Yoda and the clone trooper gunships arrive. The player who has killed the most opposing units wins.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chessboard or any other 8x8 grid. Miniatures or counters are used to represent the combat units. There are ten Jedi units, twenty-two Federation units, and three Creature units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A custom deck of cards is central to the play of the game. The players draw a hand of cards from a common deck. Card play determines when units may move, attack, or defend. The Creatures in the arena are not allied with the Jedi or Federation. Either player may cause Creatures to Move or Attack by playing Creature Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
