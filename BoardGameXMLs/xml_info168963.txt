			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This release is part of the Saturday Morning Spycraft series, which explores your favorite 80s cartoon properties using the Spycraft 2.0 system. In this release you can...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soar against the moon and stalk among the shadows of the night! The Stone Sentinels are gargoyles, a species that has potentially been with the earth since the dawn of time, or may be freakish and unexpected branches of wild evolution. They might become invaders, a dominant species, a &amp;ldquo;monster&amp;rdquo; to be hunted and killed, or part of a diverse network of species in your world. So many possibilities open up for your Spycraft 2.0 game when you introduce these remarkable creatures...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Play as a gargoyle or a human inducted or indoctrinated into their ranks (or perhaps as a human hunting them down)&lt;br/&gt;    Rise to power as a Legendary Gargoyle exhibiting the ultimate power of your race&lt;br/&gt;    Embrace cunning PsyOps and strike terror into your foes&lt;br/&gt;    Beat the odds with Uncertainty feats and customize your gargoyle with oh so many Species feats&lt;br/&gt;    Tailor your campaign to your specific play style, and even incorporate the stone sentinels and their allies and enemies into your existing Spycraft campaign&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
