							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Charmbrewer Witch Archetype</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While many witches revel in the powers granted them by their patron, some find the notion of using power with an unknown source to be rather disconcerting. These witches elect to use the connection to their patron as a source of knowledge from which they can distill power that functions without the patron's further influence. This knowledge comes in many forms, but the most common is that of the production of charms and other spells held within the liquid matrix of an elixir. Through this choice, a charmbrewer becomes bound to her cauldron in exchange for a slight weakening of the bond to her patron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Class Expansions: The Charmbrewer Witch Archetype introduces the Charmbrewer witch archetype. Giving up the vast majority of her Hex powers, the Charmbrewer instead focuses on the production of thaumaturgic elixirs. Through the use of strange rules of consent that make her part con-artist, part voodoo shaman, the Charmbrewer's elixirs do not require saving throws if she tells her victims precisely what they're in for, but completely and utterly fail to do anything if forced upon the victim. Half measures, such as sneaking the elixirs into food, or not telling the whole truth about the function of an elixir, are covered in this supplement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included with the archetype is a list of 21 elixirs that cause nightmares, turn creatures into statues of solid fool's gold, cause the victim to become assaulted by phantasmal poison, cause one individual to die to allow somebody else to rise from the dead, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
