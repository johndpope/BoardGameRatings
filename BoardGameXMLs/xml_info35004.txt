			<description>(from publisher's website)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Iranian push toward the Azeri capital of Baku has to go thru the border city of Salyan. As the Azeris and Iranians battle it out, the Russians and Americans both make cameos. Lots of open tank country surrounding a city that hugs a river, and makes for some challenging maneuver&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asian Thunder covers the opening battles of a hypothetical war between Iran and Azerbaijan.  On their march north, the Iranians must subdue the border city of Salyan, but the Azeris are defending on their home turf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A challenging map has a swath or urban terrain along the river, with wide-open flanks.  Forces include Iranian and Azeri infantry, armor, recon, and attack helicopters.  Local insurgents, Russian paratroopers, and a company of American infantry also make appearances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Warfighter series brings modern maneuver combat to the tabletop at the tactical level.  Units are platoons and sections, with some individual vehicles and leaders. Counters are a robust 7/8&amp;quot; square, with values for firepower, armor, range, and movement, plus the occasional frontal armor of zone of control.  Maps are designed to correspond to US military maps, replacing 1000m grid squares with large hexes.  Scenarios are written as 5-paragraph-style Operations Orders, which are kept under wraps so neither player knows his opponents' exact mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
