							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gravity Force 2</name>
									
			<description>In 1994, Jens Andersson and Jan Kronqvist released Gravity Force 2 in both freeware and registered shareware versions. Innovative split-screen and serial-cable multiplayer modes resulted in a fast-paced dogfight mode and great replayability value. In 1995, the games magazine, Amiga Power, declared Gravity Force 2 the second best Amiga game of all time (behind Sensible Soccer) which resulted in great exposure for a freeware/shareware title. Amiga Power then commissioned Gravity Power, a slightly enhanced version of Gravity Force 2 which was given away on the coverdisk of issue 50. In 1996, Gravity Power was subsequently declared the second best game of all time. Gravity Force 2 and Gravity Power are both now freeware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On September 21, 2008 the developers of Gravity Force 2 released the source code for &amp;quot;nostalgic interest&amp;quot; without specified license.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A planned sequel to Gravity Force 2 to be called gf2k was being developed by the original authors but was never completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Force%23Gravity_Force_2 Gravity Force]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
