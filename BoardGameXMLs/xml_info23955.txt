			<description>Just because all the players share the same chocolate factory, it doesn't mean that they aren't out to gain their own sweet rewards.  The factory produces six different chocolaty products.  Players bid for shares to control the sales of the different goods.  Then, they take turns placing workers along the production line to determine what goods will be produced.  Once four products are ready to ship, the sale is made, and the players see who has earned the biggest chunk of change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
