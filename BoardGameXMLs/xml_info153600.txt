			<description>Braddock&amp;rsquo;s Defeat is a low complexity conflict simulation of the French and Indian War battle that ended the British expedition to capture French Fort Duquesne. Not an ambush, as is popularly thought, the battle was actually a meeting engagement. The French in Fort Duquesne, told by scouts that a large British force with guns was approaching, sent elements of the Duquesne garrison on a preemptive strike. The French force met the British vanguard column before they could set up an ambush.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Braddock&amp;rsquo;s Defeat is a two player game with each player taking the side of either the French or the British. Both players have allies to control: the British side American colonial and Indian units, the French side Canadian militia and Indian units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Braddock&amp;rsquo;s Defeat also is highly suitable for solitaire play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was issued as a separate game as a gift to Gold donors for the 2014 Consimworld Donation Drive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
