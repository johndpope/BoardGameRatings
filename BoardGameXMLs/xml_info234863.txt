							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Feasting Hall: Tales From Valhalla</name>
									
			<description>In this hilarious party game, players are transported to Valhalla, were they play as both gods and mortals. In the feasting hall, the mortals try to impress the gods with their tales of battle, wits and folly!&lt;br/&gt; Each round, one player is a Norse god, and the rest of the players are mortals trying to get the god to choose their tale over the others. The tales are a combination of an Action card, the feat they performed, and a Challenge card, the obstacle they faced. Players guess the type of tale that god would want to hear most and lay the cards before them. The god will read the tales and choose one they wish to hear told aloud. That mortal wins the favor of the god and gets to tell their tale. The player who impresses the gods the most wins! What's your tale?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
