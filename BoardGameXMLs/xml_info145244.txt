			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone has to live somewhere and PCs are no exception. Given free rein, characters usually adopt nomadic lifestyles, staying in inns and carrying their possessions on their backs. This is a rootless, expensive lifestyle that real people would adopt only in dire necessity. If only to give PCs one more headache, GMs should encourage them to establish households, somewhere to hang their sword and helm after a long hard bout of adventuring, a place to call their own. This article describes the different types of land ownership; markets, towns, and charters; and buying, renting, or leasing. It provides details for finding a home in urban and rural settings and enumerates the various things PC landlords must deal with. This article was originally published in 1992 as part of Hârnlore 10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
