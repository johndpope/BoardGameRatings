			<description>The game is simple. the goal is to be the first player to get from start to &amp;quot;finished&amp;quot;. Each player rolls the die, moves their game piece and follows what the space on the board tells them to do. The space can say anything from &amp;quot;take a drink&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;give away a drink&amp;quot; or draw an individual or social card &amp;ndash; and this is where things get interesting. Cards may instruct an individual to complete an activity, answer a question, or interact with other players in a specific way.  The goal being to get to know the players around you OR simply be entertained by your friends in new and hilarious ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
