			<description>&amp;ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen! It&amp;rsquo;s time for the Main Event of the Evening!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very simple game, composed of a wrestling ring (printed on the inside of the cover) a few cardboard stand-up wrestlers to cut apart and the rulebook itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game suggests several types of matches to play (1-on-1, 2-on-2, or free for all) but in reality any form of pro-wrestling you can think of could be played out with the game, and fairly quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action flows like this: at the beginning of the round, wrestlers roll for initiative, then in order each wrestler takes two actions, then the round ends.  Actions range from the mundane (move, stand-up, block, defend) to the slightly more interesting (grab/hold, flying leap, body slam, bouncing ram, cheap shot.) Rules for referees, pinning and foreign objects are also included for completeness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The real meat of the game is in the campaigning.  Each match may take only 20 minutes to play out, but the game features a complete character creation system, as well as rules for continuing a character through a series of matches, with the usual stat-building, etc.  An interesting addition to this is popularity, which is increased by different things depending on whether your character is &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; and as one could expect side-switching between matches is always a possibility&amp;hellip; Characters can be further fleshed out by creating a manager for them as well as a signature move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
