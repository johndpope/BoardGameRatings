							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Farmageddon!</name>
									
			<description>Since Vor wasn't invited to this year's Annual Picnic of the Gods, he was understandably perturbed.  In fact, he was so annoyed that he was just about to crash the party and give the rest of the gods a piece of his mind when he realized that he couldn't.  The other gods had barred his access to the Demi-Plane of Picnics!  That really made Vor angry, very very angry.  How angry was he?  Vor was so angry that he decided that if he couldn't enjoy the picnic then NO ONE ever would.  He selected &amp;quot;volunteers&amp;quot; from the ranks of his only devoted followers, Kobolds, and charged them with a simple mission.  Destroy the Demi-Plane of Picnics or else!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Farmageddon is an adventure for Kobolds Ate My Baby! 3rd edition (some other companies like to call them modules, but at 9th Level we like to call a spade a spade).  It contains a full adventure with a map and enough random mayhem ot make it playable and, dare we say, even fun to play numerous times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
