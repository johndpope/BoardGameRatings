							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Troubled Waters</name>
									
			<description>Patrol troubled waters in search of enemy forces in this Harpoon Series supplement. Troubled Waters covers the turbulent Middle East since 1973 and showcases the introduction of antiship missiles as a dominant factor in modern naval combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern antiship missiles allow fearsome striking power to be carried in tiny vessels.  As commander of one of these &amp;quot;eggshells armed with sledgehammers&amp;quot;, it will be your task to strike first and strike hard at the enemies of your nation, whether they come in the form of fast, vicious craft like your own, or as a huge carrier battlegroup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As commander of a carrier battlegroup, you must contend with tense, portentous confrontations short of war.  A nerve-wracking game of cat-and-mouse, full of posturings, threats and test of intent, must be played before the order can be given: &amp;quot;Weapons free&amp;quot;.  To assist you in your mission, Troubled Waters contains:&lt;br/&gt;- 40 new Ship Data Forms, from tiny patrol boats to a venerable aircraft carrier.&lt;br/&gt;- 10 new Aircraft Data Forms, from special operations helos to Mach 2 interceptors.&lt;br/&gt;- Missile and radar data for Soviet exported SA-2, SA-3, and SA-5 SAM systems.&lt;br/&gt;- Detailed carrier air wing compositions for 1986-1991 operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to recreate the dramatic events of this period, Troubled Waters presents 10 new scenarios covering Middle East naval clashes from 1973 to the present day:&lt;br/&gt;- 1973 Arab-Israeli War&lt;br/&gt;- Iran-Iraq War, 1980&lt;br/&gt;- Persian Gulf Tanker War, 1984-88&lt;br/&gt;- &amp;quot;Line of Death,&amp;quot; 1986&lt;br/&gt;- US reprisals against Iran, 1988&lt;br/&gt;- Operation Desert Storm, 1991&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, six scenario generators allow players to create and fight hypothetical battles with accurate forces from the coast of North Africa to the Strait of Hormuz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Harpoon and Troubled Waters, the possibilities of the last 18 violent years of Middle East history are laid before you.  The risks are yours to confront.  The decisions are yours to make.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
