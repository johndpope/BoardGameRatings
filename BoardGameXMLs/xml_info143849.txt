							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Send in the Clowns</name>
									
			<description>'Send in the Clowns' is a quick-playing card management game in which you take on the role of a circus impresario. Your troupe of clowns have entered the Best Dressed Clown competition and are trying to assemble costumes (made up of four garments - hats, shirts, trousers, and shoes) that match in colour (red, yellow, green, blue, purple, or pink) and pattern (stripes, checks, spirals, or stars).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But just as fast as your three clowns gather their matching clothes, so your rival troupes swap clothes in your wardrobe with clothes from their wardrobe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each clown can wear accessories (red noses and blue buckets) to enhance its score, which is based on the longest run in each category (colour, pattern, and accessories): 1, 4, 9, 16 VPs. Each game, one colour and one pattern scores one step higher than the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also add balloons, unicycles, tightropes, and juggling balls to extend your scoring!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player turn involves 3 main actions: 1) draw a card; 2) draw another card -or- swap a card -or- play a card; 3) play a card. You can only play cards if one of their characteristics matches the adjacent card. And you can only swap a card it it matches the one you are swapping it for. An optional extra action at the end of your turn allows you to discard a card to claim an accessory (nose or bucket).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
