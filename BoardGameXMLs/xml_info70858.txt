			<description>&amp;quot;SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Fireteam Bravo 2 is a video game for the PlayStation Portable handheld and the sequel to SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Fireteam Bravo. The game was released in North America on November 7, 2006. Fireteam Bravo 2 features an entirely new campaign, multiplayer maps, and new features such as Command Equity (CE) and Local Influence (LI) (see below). Fireteam Bravo 2's campaign mode offers 14 story missions, a variety of partners including the sniper LONESTAR, and two partners codenamed BRONCO and WRAITH, a support gunner and stealth/CQC specialist, from SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs: Mobile Recon which was only available for cell phones, and an innumerable number of dynamically generated instant action missions. Rather than spanning multiple countries like past games in the series, the game takes place solely in the fictional country of Adjikistan. The country is supposedly situated somewhere in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region of Central Asia and features a number of environment and climate zones, allowing for the game to feature a wide variety of landscapes and settings while working within one large, connected story. The main adversaries throughout the game are mercenaries, often abbreviated as &amp;quot;mercs.&amp;quot; This game is also able to sync with the PlayStation 2 game SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Combined Assault in order to unlock bonus features.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Fireteam_bravo_2,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
