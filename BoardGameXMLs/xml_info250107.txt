							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Urban Places of Business, Set 2</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you&amp;rsquo;ve been drawing up a big modern style city and suddenly you need to quickly figure out what sort of places of business exist in all the miscellaneous buildings... and the gaming group will be over in an hour to play? Have no fear.. Just grab this chart and start rolling. 100 Urban Places Of Business is a handy list that offers 100 different types of modern setting businesses. Though immediately useful for a super heroes or crime/detective style game, this list is also good for a cyberpunk city setting. It is also extremely handy for post apocalyptic romps in devastated cities full of abandoned (or not so abandoned) buildings of all sorts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
