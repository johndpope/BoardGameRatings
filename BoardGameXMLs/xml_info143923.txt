							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Foul Passage of Progress</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder/3.5E Compatible Adventure for 4-6 PCs of levels 6-8&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As sometimes happens in the world, blind luck places the PCs in a position where they are the only people who can help. Jyrkannelaki has a problem, and the town council&amp;rsquo;s attempt to deal with it seems to have made matters worse. Trade has halted and that means money is drying up, so how will people live? Plus the problem is in the way of the PCs&amp;rsquo; progress; surely they can do something about the mysterious disappearances of the members of the Cleaners and Shapers Guild, the people that keep the access stairway to the sea passable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A request to find out what has happened leads to an offer of assistance and a chance to help a lot of people out. All that is required is that the players descend the stairway and rescue the missing townsfolk, although they have been missing a week, which isn&amp;rsquo;t a good sign. Oh, don&amp;rsquo;t forget that the stairway is trapped, gets slick with algae and sea water and is used to dump all manner of waste. What could possibly be off-putting about any of that to experienced adventurers?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included in &amp;ldquo;The Foul Passage of Progress&amp;rdquo;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Maps and Illustrations by 3x ENnie Award winning Cartographer Todd Gamble&lt;br/&gt;     A new monster type, the Toxic Sludge Creature, with guidance on the effects of different types and mixes of toxic waste&lt;br/&gt;     A new monster, the Kelp Guardian, a huge aquatic plant that aggressively defends a territory&lt;br/&gt;     A range of new traps, including exploding balls of toxic waste&lt;br/&gt;     A new spell, livekelp, for aquatic druids&lt;br/&gt;     Randomised encounters to ensure the adventure never plays the same way twice&lt;br/&gt;     Helpful print-out pages for GMs to track events and outcomes during the adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
