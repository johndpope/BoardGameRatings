			<description>Rummy Roots is an educational rummy variant where players create melds by matching words with their Greek and Latin roots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It contains rules for four different game variants using the set of cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Pre-Rummy Roots: This is essentially a &amp;quot;Go Fish&amp;quot; game, where the roots are paired with their English equivalents.  Whichever card the player has he/she needs to ask for the alternative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Rummy Roots I:  In this game the players are each given seven cards.  On their turns, the players may either play a card from their hands, or draw a card.  They must try to match one of their cards with the last card played, stating the English words associated with the root combination.  The game ends when a player runs out of cards or when the draw pile runs out.  The winner is the player with the highest number of points at the end of the game.  More difficult cards are worth more points, and cards left in your hand are counted against you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  Rummy Roots II:  This game is essential the same as Rummy Roots I, but now matches can be made with any card on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.  Rummy Roots III:  This is the game that most resembles a traditional rummy game.  The players each draw a card, make a &amp;quot;meld&amp;quot; from their hands, then discard.  Melds consist of roots put together in groups of two or three to from English word.  Small melds can be stolen if another player can make a larger word from them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
