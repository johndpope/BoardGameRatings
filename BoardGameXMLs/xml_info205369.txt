							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pinball Arcade DLC 35: Addams Family</name>
									
			<description>The Addams Family&amp;reg; (1992): is considered by many to be the best pinball table of all time, which is backed up by the fact that it broke all previous sales records for flipper games. Based on the movie of the same name released in 1991, this is a brilliant design from Pat Lawlor and Larry DeMar. All of the memorable characters and themes from the film are perfectly integrated into an incredible gameplay experience. Notable features include the first ever optical target bank, ball affecting magnets under the playfield and the 'Thing' hand that comes out of its box to magnetically grab the ball! The 'Thing Flips' is an exclusive Williams&amp;reg; / Bally&amp;reg; innovation. Using advanced artificial intelligence systems, the game learns to shoot the ball into the Swamp from the upper left flipper. 20,270 units of this table were produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
