			<description>Game description from the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;NFL Power Sweep is a game of both offense and defense. A player cannot win by concentrating on one phase of the game and neglecting the other. While advancing on an opponent's goal, he must also protect his goal. A player should be particularly aware of the position of both his and his opponent's backs at all times. They are the &amp;quot;power men.&amp;quot; Their versatility provides the offensive thrust of the game, and the need for good defensive planning.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically, this is a game of Chess with football players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
