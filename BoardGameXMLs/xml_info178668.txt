			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More Machine than Man! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blurring the lines between living and machine, cybernetics grasps at the ever-complicated task of retaining humanity in the subject even as she continues to use biomechanics to alter and perfect the mortal form into which she was born. Cybernetics can be applied on a limited basis, and characters of any race or class can potentially benefit from cybertech, as described in the official Pathfinder Roleplaying Game guide to using advanced technology in a campaign. However, this book presents a brand-new class that has devoted its entire existence to selective surgery, myometric manipulation, and an almost obsessive fixation with transhumanoid evolution to become more than nature ever intended: the cyborg. Perfect for crossover campaigns where magic and technology collide, this class offers an integrated system of two dozen cybernetic modifications that combine elements of robotics and nanotechnology to stand on its own while integrating with the standard Pathfinder Roleplaying Game rules. In addition to the base class itself, you'll find rules for pseudomagical tweaks, cybernetic feats, and four new archetypes to expand your cybernetic options: the cybermancer, hunter-killer, mechlancer, and techrager!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are looking for terrific characters where sci-fi meets fantasy, download this 26-page product today and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
