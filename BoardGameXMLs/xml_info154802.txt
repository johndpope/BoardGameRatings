							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gems of Agartha</name>
									
			<description>You and your fellow explorers have discovered the underground city of Agartha!...and its fabulous gems!  Unfortunately, removing the gems has disrupted the integrity of the area, and now the whole city threatens to collapse around you!  Your only hope is to work your way through the city and figure out which gems act as the keys to stop the collapse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But be careful!  The more you move throughout the city, the faster it weakens, and the sooner it will collapse...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...and if that wasn't enough!  The gems are all cursed!  If the you're skilled enough to survive, be sure you have the least cursed gems...or else the consequences will be swift and painful!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use deductive reasoning to establish which gems were removed from play at the beginning of the game.  This is accomplished by strategically moving along a play area composed of tiles that the players may rotate, push, and move between.  Rotating and pushing tiles speeds up the end of the game, so it's best to be judicious in how often you do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cooperative game, if the hidden gems are not identified by game's end, then there is no winner.  However, if the group does solve the mystery, then the player in possession of the least cursed gems is victorious!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
