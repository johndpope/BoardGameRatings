			<description>Have you ever felt like someone was calling you but nobody was there? A voice deep within the crevices of your mind that you typically give little attention. You felt that voice this morning, but this time, it was clear - it was calling you! The voice became loud enough to gnaw at your sanity yet it&amp;rsquo;s manageable enough that you&amp;rsquo;ve been able to bury it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time seemed to move in slow-motion, mostly due to the eerie voice. What is it saying? It can&amp;rsquo;t be real. Frustrated, you keep working. Even with the lingering storm clouds ready to unleash a torrent of rain and thunder over the land, you fight that possibility and continue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Towards the end of the day you hit a breaking point. You need to clear your head. The storm clouds are passing, it looks like a great time for a walk to the countryside. You run to your home and grab your satchel, which contains some odds and ends. As you start moving west towards the setting sun, you turn around to face your home, possibly for the last time. You don&amp;rsquo;t care. The need to escape is too much. The need to escape the voice is even greater. Yet, the need to follow the voice is consuming! You&amp;rsquo;re ready for an adventure. You&amp;rsquo;re ready for the unknown. Little do you realize, you may end up alone. Welcome to&amp;hellip;THE ABANDONS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Abandons is a press-your-luck game of exploration meant to be played alone. You will traverse the twists and turns of the labyrinth in the hopes of making it out alive. Be careful, your next turn may be your last - and you shall forever be abandoned!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of The Abandons is to make it out of the maze alive by reaching the exit before you've reached too many dead ends and have no way out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
