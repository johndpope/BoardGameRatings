							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Spooky Marble Maze Game</name>
									
			<description>Casper's cousin Spooky, the tuff little ghost, haunts this simple marble maze game. The Maze is made of cardboard with cardboard tabs that are pressed down to form bumpers for the marbles to dodge. The top of the box is placed under one end of the box bottom so the maze is angled down. Game comes with five marbles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turn, players take and play ALL of the marbles by dropping them into one of the holes at the top of the maze. The marbles must be held one inch above the hole when dropped. The player receives points as the marble lands in one of the slots at the bottom of the maze. If a player gets a marble in each of the slots at the bottom of the maze on one turn, they get a 10 point bonus. If a player gets all the marbles stacked into one slot at the bottom of the maze, they get a 10 point bonus. First player to 100 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
