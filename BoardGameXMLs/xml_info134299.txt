			<description>The first game of the series. It was originally released for PC, then was later ported to Game Boy Color. Regarded as a classic by fans, this is one of the few games to actually display Sarge and his squad as merely pawns in a bigger battle. Two features that make this game almost unique in the series are its storytelling (Black and white spoofs of World War II-style newsreels), and the fact that it often depicts fighting that doesn't involve the main characters. Many fans of the series as well as reviewers rate this game the highest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Army Men&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
