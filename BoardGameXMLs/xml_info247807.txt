			<description>During design week, Milan becomes a chaotic city where hundreds of events take place at the same time; will you be able to visit them all? Study the best strategy to collect those that will make you gain the highest score. Choose the best daily route and collect design objects before anyone else, but remember you just have six days for that! Every false step could make you miss the most important events; every mistake in planning your itinerary could make you be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The winner is the player who best moves around the city finding the most important places and events according to the time of the day, just like it happens in real life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview of the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the box we find a board summarizing the 68 Fuorisalone key locations of these past few years: La Triennale di Milano to Bar Basso, from BASE to the hidden historic buildings of the city of Milan. A dashboard/timetable subdivides the design week into three main phases: morning, afternoon and evening. Each time of the day will propose four events taking place at the same time in different locations: the objective of each player is to join at least one event to gain the corresponding card. Every location card represents a design icon-object; with more than one object you will be able to reach the targets that will allow you to achieve more points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
