							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Ship&#039;s Cargo</name>
									
			<description>This is an interesting 19th Century card game in which players take turns offering one of their goods for auction.  The other players then secretly bid for the card, with all bids revealed simultaneously.  The winner pays for the card, and then starts the next auction.  Each player starts with 12 bidding tokens, and the goal is to collect two sets of cards.  If, by the end of the game, no player has collected two sets, the player who is closest wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;F.G. &amp; Co. published a reprint of the game in 2004 with the subtitle A Nineteenth Century Game of Commerce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
