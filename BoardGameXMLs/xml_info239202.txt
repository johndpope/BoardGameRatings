							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Halkon&#039;s Treasure</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Titan is a fearsomely inhospitable place, with a well-known reputation among spacefaring adventurers.  Temperatures here fluctuate daily between freezing and boiling, and the hostile population of intelligent spiders makes it spectacularly unpopular as a travel destination. In other words, it&amp;rsquo;s an ideal place to hide things no one&amp;rsquo;s supposed to find.  That was the realization of a legendary character named Orion Halkon, also known as &amp;ldquo;Halkon the Pirate&amp;rdquo;, who is said to have been the only person ever to have mapped the entirety of Titan&amp;rsquo;s Inferno Range.  According to one version of the legend, he hid his amassed treasure somewhere within this hostile territory &amp;ndash; some say within the fabled Cavern of the Living Dead, but no one knows for sure. When Halkon was killed in an explosive arms stand-off with planetary security forces, the secret location of his treasure died with him &amp;hellip; Or did it?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs will travel to Titan and find themselves in a position to answer that question &amp;ndash; if giant spiders and a gang of murderous rivals don&amp;rsquo;t kill them first!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HALKON'S TREASURE is a DayTrippers Adventure from the GOLDEN AGE ADVENTURES anthology.  If you have that book, you don't need this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DayTrippers uses a descriptive scale which can easily be converted to other game systems.  Conversions are included for 2-12, 1-20, PbtA and percentage-based systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
