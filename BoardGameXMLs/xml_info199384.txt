			<description>In a war torn land, you find yourself trying to start over, but war seems to follow you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world has been all but destroyed by war. You are the leader of your people, looking for untouched land that hasn't been destroyed by war. After a long journey you find this new land and you start to build a new home for your people. Other Leaders have the same idea, and the new land breaks out in war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War Torn is a resource management game with Drafting and Building of your new city. Each player starts with a limited amount of resources to start their new home. Craft your City to match your play style, and be the first player to gain enough Victory Points to claim the land as your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as unique characters like a Lava Ape - The Fire King, or a Necromancer Crow that raises the dead. In this 2-4 player game you will find yourself building, fighting and deceiving other players to claim the victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
