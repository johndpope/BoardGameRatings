			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the first netbook for the GAMMA WORLD&amp;reg; game, Secrets of the Ancients!  This book was compiled for all those fans out there that enjoy the apocalyptic world known as Gamma Terra and refuse to allow GAMMA WORLD&amp;reg; to die.  It contains both never before seen game information and revised, previously-released information from the Internet.  All of the information found here is based on the 4th edition of the GAMMA WORLD&amp;reg; game, although most is also compatible with other versions of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I began this project, I was unsure whether I would actually finish it or if it would end up saved on my computer in some little-used directory; therefore, I decided to base it on the information already posted on my web page and save myself some time.  Based on my own opinions and the opinions of a few other GAMMA WORLD&amp;reg; fans, I selected some submissions and began the creation process.  I contacted the authors and asked for any revisions or new ideas. Using the information they provided, I produced this compilation.  Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kerry Jordan &lt;br/&gt;Editor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
