			<description>Similar to Liar's Dice and also known as Poker Menteur, the game is played with a standard poker deck of 52 cards, with jokers as wildcards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player is dealt five cards, and names a poker hand that can be formed with it (eg. &amp;quot;pair of kings&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;royal flush&amp;quot;). They may lie. The next player chooses to challenge or accept - if they challenge, the hand is revealed and the loser of the challenge take a penalty point. If they accept, they take the hand, discard 0-4 cards and draw replacements, and then make a call as previously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until a player reaches a pre-agreed number of penalty points, at which point they are declared the loser and the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
