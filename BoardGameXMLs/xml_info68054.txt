							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wreyland Serpent</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instant Adventure for 4-6 characters levels 12-15&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I am Princess Athanake&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The woman who stands before you is young and beautiful, attired in gowns of the finest green velvet, and bearing with calm grace a circlet of gold upon her brow.  She captures, in the slightest gesture and inflection, a porcelain perfection that you can once believed to exist only in storybooks and myth.  She is a princess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I wish that it were under happier circumstances and calmer skies that I welcomed you to Anach, so that we might prepare a royal feast and listen to your tales in better company.  Unfortunately, that is not to be, at least for now.  Instead of telling tales, I fear that I must ask you to make new ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Three days ago Royal Miners discovered the hidden lair of the Wreyland Serpent, a black dragon who has ravaged our lands for as long as memory allows.  All but one of the men who worked there were savagely butchered by the creature.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She delicately extends a hand to one side, and a waiting courtier immediately steps forward and places a scroll within her grasp.  The princess, in turn, extends it to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is a royal decree, sealed less than a quarter hour ago, giving you whatever lawful authority is necessary to prosecute our interests in this matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I beg you.  Deliver my people from this beast.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
