			<description>'User Summary:'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;Maiden Island&amp;quot;, players are tasked with keeping up the spirits of several love struck young ladies, while working to escape the island you're all trapped on.  Survive for one week and everyone escapes via a raft.  If any of the young ladies become too upset before then, they'll violently lash out at others or even themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of three phases that repeated over the course of (at most) 7 rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Event Phase - Shuffle the eight tiles and place them in a 3x3 grid.  The last space in the bottom right is left open.  Tiles are then moved around like a slide puzzle and activate various effects.  Some provide food, but most only lead to members of the group becoming upset.  Get the three components of the raft in either one row or column and the phase ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dinner Phase - Three food are consumed by the entire group.  If you come up short, all of the available food is still consumed and every young lady becomes dissatisfied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Date &amp;amp; Kill Phase - Players may choose to go on a date with one of the young ladies.  Her dissatisfaction is then spread to the other members of the group.  Finally, a check is made to see if any one in the group has become emotionally overwhelmed.  If so, they kill another member of the group or take their own life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
