			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;DICE WIDE SHUT is a roll-and-write game that includes erasable markers and game boards. Try to fill the columns with checkmarks to score without bursting any rows!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game for 2-5 players, you'll use 3-6 red dice and 3-6 blue dice along with a single purple die no matter the player count. Each player has their own erasable game board with a red grid of dice faces at the top of it (with the red faces reading 1-5 as you go across a row) and a blue grid of dice faces at the bottom (with the blue faces reading 1-5 as you go down a column). On the right-hand side of each grid is a column of 6s; the 6s are grayed out and not considered to be part of the red or blue grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start a round, one player rolls the dice. The starting player then chooses either red or blue, then chooses two dice numbered 1-5 or a single die numbered six in the named color. The purple die can be picked up whether you choose red or blue. After you take the die or dice, you check off empty die faces in that half of your player board that match the numbers taken. One exception: When you take a 6, you can check off a 6 in either the top or bottom of your board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you create a row of five horizontal checkmarks in the red or blue grid, then you must place a line through all of these checked die faces. Boom! Bad news! If, however, you have a checked 6 in that same row, you can choose to cross out the checkmark instead of placing the final check in the row and blowing it up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all the dice have been claimed, then the next player in clockwise order from the starting player becomes the new starting player and begins a new round. As soon as one player has three filled columns in either the red or the blue grid, each other player takes one final turn (assuming enough dice remain), then the game ends. Players then score points for each column depending on the number of continuous check marks in that column; three separate checkmarks in a column in the red grid is worth 3 points (1 point for each check) while three continuous checkmarks is worth 6 points. An empty space or a crossed-out line breaks the continuity. Whoever has the highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's summary&lt;br/&gt;DICE WIDE SHUT is a dice game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, you have two 5x5 squeare grids. Each round, the first player rolls certain number of dice. During your turn, you take one or two of them. For each die taken, you check a space of the same number of pips in one of your square grids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, you score points according to how long vertical lines of coninuous checks you made in your grids. However, if you were forced to complete a horizontal line of five checks, all vertical lines on that grid are considered to be split by the horizontal line, resulting fewer points scored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are simple, but because of the split-line rule, sometimes you will find it difficult to make decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;「DICE WIDE SHUT」は、(1)ダイスを選び、(2)ボードの対応する部分にチェックを入れるだけの、簡単なルールのゲームです。&lt;br/&gt;各列ごとに得点を計算し、ゲーム終了時に得点の高いプレイヤーが勝利します。&lt;br/&gt;縦方向にチェックが連続すると得点が高くなります。しかし、横方向にチェックがつながると失点につながるルールがあなたを苦しめるでしょう。&lt;br/&gt;多くの誘惑と疑念が立ちふさがり、ダイスの選択は決して容易ではありません。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
