This is a fully cooperative fight, in which the players win as a group if they manage to kill the Dragon and they lose if too many parts of the city have been destroyed, or if the Dragon kills Heroes so much that they can&amp;rsquo;t find the resolve to continue the fight. In this ultimate showdown, the Dragon is controlled by a special set of Dragon Turn cards that will trigger special attacks and movements from the Poison Dragon. Players will need to make tough choices in the face of the Dragon's actions, deciding as a group where to focus their efforts (and who to sacrifice).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1 dragon figure&lt;br/&gt;    1 double-sided tile&lt;br/&gt;    24 level 6 upgrade cards&lt;br/&gt;    2 relic cards&lt;br/&gt;    14 dragonstone cards&lt;br/&gt;    24 dragon turn cards&lt;br/&gt;    20 poison tokens&lt;br/&gt;    2 dragon monster cards&lt;br/&gt;    1 rulebook/campaign booklet&lt;br/&gt;    1 dragon power card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Poison Dragon turns the streets of Arcadia into a hazy gauntlet of deadly fumes, weakening heroes as he snuffs all life in the city. This expansion will bring an entire new epic showdown against this poisonous wyrm, featuring cooperative play between players through two scenarios where you have to ground the dragon, and prevent it from poisoning the entire city!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
