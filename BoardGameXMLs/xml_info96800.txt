			<description>In this game, two spacecraft armies fight each other as they try to reach the earth first and conquer it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each army is composed by 6 combat modules, each one representing one of the signs of the zodiac, and a mothership. The motherships are able to shoot &amp;quot;disc missiles&amp;quot; but only only can move laterally along the gameboard's central circle, while the combat modules can move forward and feature an spring-based system that makes them &amp;quot;explode&amp;quot; in case one disc missile hits it's front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each combat module is placed over it's correspondent sign in the circle, and the motherships are placed in each side of the gameboard. The starting player moves one of his modules one square forward and then shoots his mothership. If he hits and destroys one of the other player's modules, he can advance one of his again, until he fails, ending his turn. The first to move one of his modules over the central square (The earth) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
