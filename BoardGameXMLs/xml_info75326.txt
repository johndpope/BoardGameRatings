			<description>Gef&amp;auml;hrlich Ehrlich (engl. Precariously honest) is a communication and party game. &lt;br/&gt;The players move their pawns long a trail froms start to goal, answering questions. Their pace of movement is determinend by how well they have solved the last question. Die kind of question is determined by the field their pawn is standing on. There are three different categories:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extreme! : All players vote which one of two contrary characteristics on a Extreme!card fits most to the character of the active player. The two characteristics are either both negative or both positive, so everybody is forced to give a honest vote for the more fitting characteristic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hey, that&amp;acute;s You!: All players point at each other simultaneously, voting who at the game table fits most to a given attribute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Top or Flop: A situation is described on a card. The active player has to describe how he/she would solve it. The other players vote (by showing thumb up/down simultaneously) if they think his answer is honest and fits to his character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a very important aspect of the game, players act a lot with their hands while playing: swinging the fists, counting aloud, pointing fingers on other player, showing thumbs up/down and declaring counting-out rhymes together. So there is always action at the game table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gef&amp;auml;hrlich Ehrlich is not just a fun game but also a kind of tool to find out more about how other people look at you and what kind of character they think you are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
