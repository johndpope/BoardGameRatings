			<description>The flip side of the tiles from the game Down Under. This is a simple connection game for 2 players only (though the rules say 2 to 4).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Try to connect your two sides of the board using the tiles with various curved paths on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has two phases. In the first phase, players take turns laying tiles with just two curves on them. These are either Y shaped forks, or two bends around opposite corners. If you let your opponent complete their path in this phase, you're doing very badly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second phase, players start over-laying the 2 curve tiles with 3 curve tiles. This makes it much easier to complete a path. When one player does so, the other still has a chance to lay a 3 curve to disrupt the path. But 3 curves only go onto 2 curves. So by clever placement, you can force yourself into a path with two solutions, so your opponent cannot block both at once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a remarkably simple design, but seems wide open with possible techniques. Tiles can always be placed in any orientation. The clever part is that a valid path cannot follow an oblique turn. You go round bends like a train on tracks. So by placing a fork in the correct way, I can improve my path but block yours. But when you get to lay 3 curves, you can undo the damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
