							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Silent Memories</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A roleplaying game about finding out who you are before you die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You awaken from a cryogenic sleep aboard a spaceship with no knowledge of who you are or how you came to be here. You have no knowledge of your mission, or even where you are going. All that remains is your training, and the impending sense that something is very wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a science fiction/horror role playing game about trying to survive as you begin to piece your memories back together. As the dangers increase, so too do the recollections of your past. Unfortunately what you recall may affect your trust of the people around you or even trust in yourself. Ultimately, one may be revealed to be something evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
