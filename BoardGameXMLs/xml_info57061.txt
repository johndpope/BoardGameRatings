			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is 1997. You are a soldier of the United States Space Command, a member of the warrior elite. Backed by the most powerful nation on earth, your job is to protect our interests in space.&lt;br/&gt;But tragedy strikes. During a rescue mission at the space station America, a freak explosion tears you from your Shuttle and plunges you through a time warp.&lt;br/&gt;Stranded in the future, a future where our great nation fell to the enemy over two hundred years ago, you and your surviving crew vow to continue your fight for freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to Amerika, comrade ...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Roleplaying Game of Amerika in 2197 C.E.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player Handout&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 4-page Player Handout propells a novice into adventure easily and clearly. It explains, in plain English, the concept of roleplaying, advises the gamemaster (referee) where to go from here, offers an example of play, and even includes Kickstart rules&amp;mdash; everything a new player needs to jump right into action!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 48-page Training Manual breathes life into your character. From initial creation right down to sophisticated combat gear, the rules are carefully sculpted to turn soldiers into fighting machines &amp;mdash; forces to be reckoned with. The weapons and armor a space soldier employs are detailed, as well as the military Shuttle itself.&lt;br/&gt;Along with a character's ability to preserve life or bestow death, the rules reinforce the human aspect. Emotions, personal history and personality are as much a part of a character as his or her combat ability.&lt;br/&gt;In Year of the Phoenix, characters learn and grow, gaining power realistically, and teachers can learn from students!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Guide&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 80-page Adventure Guide shatters this idyllic splendor, hurling the characters into nightmare. Unique in the role-playing experience, players are as shocked and unprepared as their characters when this tragedy hits.&lt;br/&gt;Year of the Phoenix encourages characters to explore and rediscover this familiar, yet alien land, through a series of adventures included in the game.&lt;br/&gt;There is advice on campaign design as well as detailed information about the Resistance groups, Baronies and Zoviet Provinces battling for control of the wilderness that is Amerika.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus&lt;br/&gt;- 6 pregenerated characters&lt;br/&gt;- 3-panel Gamemaster Screen containing all charts and tables needed for play&lt;br/&gt;- 2-pages of full color cut-apart cardstock vehicle counters for use on the Combat grid&lt;br/&gt;- 1 7&amp;quot; x 22&amp;quot; Combat grid plus Map of Amerika&lt;br/&gt;- Master Character Sheet suitable for photocopying&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
