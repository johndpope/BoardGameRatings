			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a set of Advanced Playbooks for the Dungeon World system. An Advanced Playbooks is essentially a second playbook you apply on top of your basic playbook to create a more complicated character. Unlike a basic playbook, you cannot play as these playbooks by themselves. Unlike a Compendium Class, you can start the game as one of these playbooks, and you don't need to level up to gain one, you just need to meet the requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's time to get spooky. Did you have a bad run-in with some Vampires? Well, now your Dungeon World character can become afflicted with Vampirism as a result, with all the power and fear of sunlight that brings you! Werewolves and werebears and wererabbit bites can come with similar consequences. Even death's embrace won't stop your hero if you still have unfinished business, not when you can become The Wraith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set of playbooks brings the power of becoming something else to your game. Your players can become a Vampire, a Werewolf, or even a Wraith, and even start the game already afflicted as such, if they want. These playbooks consume some of what you once were, replacing some of their Moves with new ones that give them just the right set of monstrous powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Vampire is a cunning and deadly hunter, with a variety of customization available to them. All vampires require Blood to power their supernatural strength, but what they do with it can vary greatly. The Vampire can excel as a fighter, a sneak, or a charmer, and you can focus on your vampiric power as much or as little as you'd like.&lt;br/&gt;    The Werewolf is a powerful, transforming beast. The playbook isn't necessarily a wolf - it will do just as well to portray the plight of Dr. Jekyll or The Incredible Hulk, or you can be any other kind of were-creature, like a Werebear or a Werebat. But no matter what you are, this playbook is all about reckless and uncontrollable power, and your curse will leave devastation in your wake.&lt;br/&gt;    The Wraith has unfinished business. This playbook is the easiest of these Advanced Playbooks to enter - all you need to do is die with unfinished business you refuse to leave unfinished. This playbook sees you become a ghost - you become incorporeal, you can fly, and you gain telekinetic powers. None of your gear works anymore, but it isn't like you need it. You're basically untouchable now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
