			<description>Ever thought of becoming president? Now you can! Give interviews, bribe, foment protests, play good and evil to become the most popular politician ever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plebiscitum is a card game, based on a contemporary international politics theme. It is played in teams called parties, fighting to win the elections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to win the elections the player must fulfill both of the following two requirements:&lt;br/&gt;- The player&amp;rsquo;s party must be the most popular.&lt;br/&gt;- The player must be the most popular within his/her party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The backbone of Plebiscitum is the idea that players should try to make their own party win, and at the same time beat their own party members in order to get elected. To do so, players can play cards both against other parties&amp;rsquo; members or against their own party members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
