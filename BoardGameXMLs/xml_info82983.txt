			<description>As admitted on the box cover, Selection is a Yathzee-inspired card game which uses an 80-card 5&amp;deg;Dimension Playing Card deck.  Over 11 rounds, players build of seven cards.  Draw-poker style, players can exchange cards twice or thrice, depending on the current turn.  From their final hand of seven cards, they must select five to use in scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring is done by matching five cards in a player's hand to one (and only one) scoring combination.  There are eleven combinations, following familiar poker hands (such as full house, straight, flush, etc).  Each scoring combination can be selected once by each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after 11 rounds, with the player accumulating the highest score winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
