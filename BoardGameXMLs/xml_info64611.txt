			<description>Contents:&lt;br/&gt;Jail base and 4 jail walls&lt;br/&gt;24 prisoners (3 of each in 8 different colors)&lt;br/&gt;6 prison guards&lt;br/&gt;1 spade&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prisoners and guards are placed in the jail cell and in turn, each player manipulates the spade underneath the cell and through slats in the floor of the cell in an attempt to flick out prisoners of different colors.  Don't free a prison guard, or you're busted!&lt;br/&gt;This game has a push-your luck component (players may stop flicking at any time and keep their freed prisoners, but if a prison guard is flicked out, all freed prisoners are returned and that player's turn is over) and a set collection mechanic (collect 3 prisoners of any individual color for double points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can be played as a stand-alone game, or can be combined with any Monopoly game as an alternative to rolling doubles to get out of jail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
