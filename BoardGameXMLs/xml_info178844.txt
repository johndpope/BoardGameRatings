							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Netherworld&#039;s Edge: Keystone</name>
									
			<description>Set deep in the enchanted forests of the Netherwood, the inhabitants of the mouse kingdom wage a constant war against their adversaries, both from the vermin outside their guarded borders and the secretive conspirators within. This first adventure within the Netherwood explores the mouse rangers of the Northern Waywatch Chapters. Hailing from within the slate walls of the Keystone Fortress, they maintain eternal vigil over their sacred wardens. The legendary hero of the Watch, Chaptermaster Gorix Stormfeather, is preparing plans in the candlelit chambers of his fortress for the defense of his realm. His brave rangers patrol the borders, bracing for a clash that will inevitably come. The fist tightening its grip around their way of life is that of the Shadow King himself, the pale rat Vermithrang, and his legion of rodent warriors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shieldbash system narrows its vision towards the small-scale conflicts of 5-15 fighters per side, involved in Skirmishes depicting a particular encounter between warbands. These encounters may be isolated or part of a Tale, a linked series of encounters where characters and conditions carry over from one fight to the next. Bash can be played on a battlefield as small as 2&amp;rsquo;x2&amp;rsquo;. A fighter is usually a single warrior on a 20mm (or 40mm) base, but it can also be a beast or group of lesser warriors. Defined by a few, simple attributes and abilities, each fighter is uniquely suited to his role on the battlefield, without bogging down the commander with unnecessary complication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a Round of battle each player will take turns as the active commander. His opponent will draw a Stone for him on his turn, allowing him to assign Surges to his fighters. These Surges allow the fighters to perform actions, which include moving about the battlefield, attacking enemy fighters, or other tasks performed in pursuit of victory. In addition, each commander has access to the resource Mischief. Mischief allows a commander to perform extra movement, modify a die roll, or execute other minor actions that enable him to bend the rules to his favor. However, the active commander&amp;rsquo;s opponent must agree upon the expenditure of Mischief, creating a dynamic of haggling and compromise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
