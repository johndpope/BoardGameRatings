							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kids Rule!</name>
									
			<description>It&amp;rsquo;s the first game where kids get to be parents! Kids, if you&amp;rsquo;re tired of hearing &amp;ldquo;Because I said so&amp;rdquo; as the answer to your questions, here&amp;rsquo;s your chance to turn the tables. Each question is a scenario that most parents must face at some point while raising their children. Your son comes home with blue hair on the night of your brother&amp;rsquo;s wedding. What do you do? But the answer isn&amp;rsquo;t what the parents want, it&amp;rsquo;s what the kids want, because in this game &amp;ndash; Kids Rule! The game questions were written by parents, and the answers were selected entirely by 8-14 year old children at the San Francisco School in San Francisco, CA. Everyone will have fun trying to guess how kids would behave if they were in charge. It&amp;rsquo;s a great way for parents and children to bond, understand one another, and discuss the myriad of issues that they will both face as the youngsters grow from kids to adults. (The kids&amp;rsquo; answer, by the way, is to make the son wear a scarf or tie that matches the hair!) Game comes with 216 question cards, 4 playing pieces, game board, and instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
