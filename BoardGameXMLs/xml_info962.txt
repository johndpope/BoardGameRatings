			<description>CONTANGO &amp;ldquo;The Ultimate Stock Market Game&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wanna try Day trading?  Insider trading?  Or are you more comfortable with a long term buy and hold strategy?  CONTANGO is a brand new board game that teaches you about the stock market and is also incredibly fun to play!  The word &amp;ldquo;CONTANGO&amp;rdquo; is used in trading futures and means rising prices are expected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of the innovative game design, the game is a fun learning experience for people with no prior investment or stock market knowledge.  Players of age 10 can share in the adventure with players of age 60.  At the easiest level, the object of the game is to &amp;ldquo;buy low, sell high&amp;rdquo; and be the first to make $10 million.  More advanced players have the option to short sell, buy puts or calls, margin trade, and take advantage of market volatility.  Other concepts you&amp;rsquo;ll learn include market and limit orders, electronic stock exchanges, portfolio diversification, Index funds, the Superbowl Effect, insider trading, paper gains and losses, Random Walk Theory, and many more exciting, real life concepts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTANGO features 12 industry sectors and 24 companies, each with its own risk, long term return, stock certificates, and what the guru&amp;rsquo;s (analysts) say.  And since the Stock Market is just one investment avenue, Other Investment opportunities are included like money market funds, mutual funds, Treasury Bills, savings accounts, CD&amp;rsquo;s and futures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTANGO was designed with busy lifestyles in mind.
