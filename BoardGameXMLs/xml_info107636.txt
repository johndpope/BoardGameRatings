			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A quick &amp;quot;outguess the others&amp;quot; card game for 3&amp;ndash;5 players.&lt;br/&gt;On the game table there are five rows, labeled A to E, of treasure cards with numbers 2, 3, 4, 7 or &amp;ndash;4. Each round, one treasure card is added to each row, and players secretly choose one of the rows and reveal their choices simultaneously. If two or more players choose the same row, they get nothing and the row is untouched. Players who are alone in their choice get all the treasure cards in that row. No player can choose the same row two rounds in a row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game lasts for 12 rounds, and at the end of the game, having three cards of the same value earns the player that many points. The player with the most points at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translated box back&lt;br/&gt;You are thieves specializing in jewelry, and each night, you announce in beforehand which shop you are aiming at. But beware, only one thief can enter each shop per night. If another thief has chosen the same place, your pride won't allow you to share. And while others thieves are staring at each other, you have your chance next night&amp;hellip; but don't forget that that's what everybody else thinks, too&amp;hellip;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
