			<description>Raggedy Ann is a junior game for little children.  It's fun-filled with brightly colored pictures of Raggedy Ann and her friends.  Players build pictures of Raggedy Ann and Witch Wiggle, using cards obtained by matching the spin of the spinner with characters on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1954 &amp;quot;yellow&amp;quot; version of the game contains 32 cards: 24 Raggedy Ann cards (four sets of six cards, each set making a complete picture of Raggedy Ann) and eight cards with the head of Uncle Clem on them. As players complete their pictures of Raggedy Ann, extra cards (duplicate Raggedy Ann cards and Uncle Clem cards) are kept in their hand. Players can choose, on their turn, to draw from other players' hands instead of spinning the dial or if the pile he spins to is empty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
