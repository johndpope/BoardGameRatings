			<description>Cash and assets such as classic cars and oil paintings are traded with markets rising and falling constantly through the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The length of the game is predetermined by the players who can also decide whether to play haggle in its simplest form or amend and vary the rules in any way they can agree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Everything is negotiable...even the rules&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
