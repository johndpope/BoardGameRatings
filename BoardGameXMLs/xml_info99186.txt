			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Token is a simple roleplaying system that you can use to explore fantastic fictional worlds. In order to play a game using Token, you will need some paper, pencils, and lots of six-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a player wants their character to accomplish something, they state exactly what it is that they want their character to accomplish (the more specific, the better) and then roll some six-sided dice. Players may roll up to eight dice from their Pool, so long as this does not exceed their current Pool total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the dice have been rolled, the player counts all results of five and six. Each such result is counted as a 'success' &amp;ndash; the more successes that a player rolls, the more likely their character is to accomplish whatever it was that they set out to do. The only thing in the way of success is the difficulty of the undertaking itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a character wants to accomplish something, the Referee assigns a target difficulty to the undertaking, based upon exactly how difficult they perceive accomplishing said undertaking will be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
