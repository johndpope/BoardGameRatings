							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Odin&#039;s Rune Chess</name>
									
			<description>From the author's introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;To create the game I used an approach similar to that used by Carl Jung when he philosophized about the I Ching and the concept of synchronicity... To put myself in the right frame of mind for creating the rune game I first concentrated on Odin and Chess.  In Nordic mythology Odin is a wise god who brought the runes to mankind, something akin to Prometheus bringing fire to men.  I then thoroughly shuffled and mixed a set of rune cards and randomly selected six... I was surprised by the results...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 10x10 chess variant takes inspiration from its theme and converts some of the standard chesspieces into their Norse equivalents. All the non-royal pieces retain their moves and capturing abilities. The queen becomes a valkyrie, with the additional power of transporting a king to safety by taking its place on the board. Knights become Forest oxen, with great horns that can kill in a neighboring square. Pawns become minor pieces, giving up their promotion ability to do so. And kings must &amp;quot;consult&amp;quot; before doing anything. The king moves and captures like any friendly piece it starts the turn next to. Each player has 2 of each type of piece, including kings, and 10 pawns. The game is won by capturing both enemy kings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
