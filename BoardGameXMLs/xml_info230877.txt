			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2437 AD: Humanity has created a polluted world, stripped of resources. And yet, technology has advanced beyond control. Iquot City is one of the last great strongholds in North America. Outside its walls lies a mysterious place, where humans fear to tread&amp;mdash;the Borderlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A race of synthetic beings known as Syms has evolved to look and act human. Many have been programmed to think they&amp;rsquo;re human. No one knows what their goals are, but it won&amp;rsquo;t be long before no one can tell humans from Syms. Their civilization is built from the recycled remains of humanity&amp;rsquo;s waste. They&amp;rsquo;ve developed manufacturing centers, recycling vehicles, mines and refineries&amp;hellip; all of which bodes poorly for humankind. Is there a way to stop the Syms from taking over the world? And if there is, at what price?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
