			<description>Gunship Crew is a Game where you are a Commander of a Helicopter Gunship in a Helicopter Assault Company in Viet Nam. Your Goal is to manage your aircraft and crew and Complete a Campaign consisting of a series of Missions and score as many Victory Points (VP) as possible to assist the war efforts. Campaigns can be Short (8 Missions), Moderate (12 Missions), or Long (16 Missions). If the Player takes too many losses before their Campaign is complete, the Enemy will gain the initiative and win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Missions include rescuing downed crews, helicopter assaults, convoy escorts, river patrols, hunter-killer and general fire support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Combat system is similar to the one used in Patton's Best by Avalon Hill. This method best captures the feeling of flying a single Helicopter and resolving combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GUNSHIP CREW can be found at the following URL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.berserkergames.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.berserkergames.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
