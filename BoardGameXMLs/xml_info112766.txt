							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Critical Miss (Issue 2 - Spring 1999)</name>
									
			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the second issue of Critical Miss: the magazine for dysfunctional roleplayers. We've published this a little later than we had planned, due mainly to a combination of employment pressures and general apathy. Sorry for the wait.&lt;br/&gt;      I've heard it said that for a rock group the second album is always the hardest, and I think the same is true for a magazine like this. In your first issue you use up every idea you've had over the last five years of thinking: &amp;quot;Wouldn't it be great to do a roleplaying magazine...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;      Then when you sit down to do issue 2, all you can think is: &amp;quot;Now what the **** are we supposed to do?&amp;quot; But we did it, and here it is. People seemed to quite like issue 1, so we've tried to pretty much keep to the same style for its successor. Hope you like it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
