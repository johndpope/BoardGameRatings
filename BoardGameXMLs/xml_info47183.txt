			<description>Working in an office with people that the only thing you have in common with is the carpet you walk on for 40 hours a week. It can be hard, can be stressful, but it can also be rewarding. When the current office manager retires, 6 co-workers have a shot at becoming the next boss. Do you have what it takes to impress the department heads so they give their recommendation to corporate? Do you have what it takes to install a virus on a co-workers machine so they don't?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have what it takes, to Get That Job?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
