			<description>This traditional children's card game is a game of very few decisions (none of which are meaningful).  Players are each dealt 10 face down cards which are arranged in spots from #1-10 to begin.  One player then draws a card from the top of the stock of remaining cards and uses it to replace a face-down card in the appropriately numbered spot if possible.  His turn continues until he draws a card that matches a card number already flipped or draws a Queen or King which cannot be placed in his array.  He discards the unusable card and his opponent can then choose to pick up that card and begin his turn by placing it into the appropriate spot in his array.  Jacks are considered wild and can be replaced by the appropriate number if they are already placed in one's array.  The first person to fill all of his spots with face-up cards wins the round and will play the next round with one less spot (so after round 1, for example, he will only use 9 cards).  The game continues until one person has no spots remaining at the beginning of his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
