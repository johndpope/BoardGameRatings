							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Classic BattleTech: Technical Readout 3075</name>
									
			<description>In November 3067 the Second Star League disbanded. The Word of Blake - a splinter group of ComStar - had been on the verge of joining in fulfillment of ancient prophecies. Denied their dream, the Blakists sought to preserve the Star League against the follies of the Houses, but its fanaticism manifested this noble goal as the Jihad: a horrific war that has pitted every faction against each other and even themselves. Against such an anvil, new cutting edge machines of war are marched into the fire. The discovery of an ancient Hegemony Memory Core graphically showcases the desperation of the conflict, as primitive 'Mechs not seen on a battlefield since the dawn of 'Mech production over half a millennia ago once again appear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Classic BattleTech Technical Readout: 3075 provides a comprehensive look at the latest machines of war debuting during the Jihad: from 'Mechs to battle armor, Support Vehicles to DropShips and more. In addition, a complete &amp;quot;Age of War&amp;quot; section covers the Terran Hegemony and each of the five Great Houses during the Age of War, including the very first BattleMechs produced by each faction and how such machines are starting to appear once more. Each military vehicle is illustrated in detail, accompanied by a description of its history, capabilities, game stats, and some of the unit's most famous pilots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
