			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Game Fantasy Football is a departure from some of the mind-jarring, &amp;quot;stat-freak&amp;quot; versions of what has become the nation's most popular armchair sport. It contains what is perhaps the simplest method of fantasy sports play yet devised. No calculators! No computers! No headaches! It actually leaves you time to enjoy watching football.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three easy steps: 1)Hold a simple draft - instead of drafting individual players, you will draft team positions. 2)Draft only 6 positions - QB, RB, WR, K, Team Score, &amp;amp; Team Defense. 3)Game on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains 100 team score sheets, 50 draft selection sheets, 16 draft pick cards, past performances charts and player rosters for the 1992, 1993, and 1994 seasons, 2 book marks, 1 game board, 1 game play book, 1 set of league forms, and 1 pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
