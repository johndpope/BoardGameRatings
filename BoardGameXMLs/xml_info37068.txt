							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Porky Pies</name>
									
			<description>With something like 500 questions included, Porky Pies is a game that comes with enough material to keep you going for quite some time although you only need to print off a few pages each time you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How the game works: You get given an old or unusual phrase (many originate from the UK in the 16th to 19th century) and have to decide which of the three explanations provided is correct. Everybody plays at once and the person who picks the most correct explanations during the course of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.amherstlodge.com/dirtycheats/fbg/downloads/games/porkypies.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.amherstlodge.com/dirtycheats/fbg/downloads/games/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
