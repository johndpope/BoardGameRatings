							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ríastradh</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His mouth foamed as he tore the shirt from his back, and as he rushed forward to meet the mass of Sea Devils that had attacked us, he started to grow, taller than a house, wider than three bulls. His skin bubbled from within like tar bursting from the earth, and his muscles stretched into dimensions unnatural to humans. His right arm grew to the size of a thick oak tree trunk, and with every swing he slashed three Fomorians in half. His hair stood on end like a halo of spears, and from each tip burst a mist of blood and rage that choked any who came too close to him. One hundred Fomorian died that afternoon at the hands of Bran, the warped one, hero of Daingean, and I was never able to look at my foster brother the same way again.&lt;br/&gt;- From the journal of Amergin &amp;Oacute; M&amp;iacute;l&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bardic Lore: Riastradh introduces the fantastic and terrifying heroic feat of the warp spasm to your d20 Fantasy game. Included are rules for creating a warped hero, the rules of the riastradh, new feats and the warped one paragon class, along with a fully-stated NPC and Bardic Lore information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
