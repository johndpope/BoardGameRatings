			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trius are a race of near humans from the cold mountainous world of Yandell. Yandell is a perilous world, and to survive, the Trius have evolved a unique defense mechanism. Through an innate psionic gift, the Trius can manifest energy duplicates of themselves - short lived twin clones with thoughts and emotions of their own. A lone Trius is never alone. With the help of their two clones, a single Trius can scale the tallest mountain, or face down the most fearsome native xenopredator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking advantage of their natural talent for &amp;quot;triplication&amp;quot; the Trius have developed some of the most innovative forms of unarmed combat in the known galaxy. Trius martial artists are sought out by students of unarmed combat from across the galaxy, and thousands of lonely, mountain-peak dojos can be found scattered across Yandell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trius are confident and have a thirst for adventure, only reinforced by their culture-wide practice of marital arts. Even the meekest, most timid Trius enjoys facing new challenges and seeing new horizons. After facing the deadly perils of their craggy homeworld, there is little that can scare or startle a Trius. Many serve on Galaxy Command vessels, usually as space marines, combat training instructors, MPs or boarding experts. There's no one in the galaxy better than a Trius martial artist in a brawl, and Galaxy Command knows it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free20: Three-Way is a free Otherverse Games product, suitable for inclusion in any pulp sci-fi D20 Future Campaign, though this PDF is specifically designed to supplement Otherverse Game&amp;rsquo;s newest release: Galaxy Command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
