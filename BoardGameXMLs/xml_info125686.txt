							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mastery: A Game of Enlightenment</name>
									
			<description>Mastery is played in two phases. In the first phase, players roll a die to move around a wheel trying to get rid of hand cards which symbolize the negative qualities of hate, anger, deceit, greed, and attachment. They can get rid of their cards by landing on appropriate spaces; this may involve giving the cards to other players or discussing a time they used that quality in a situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has gotten rid of all hadga cards and crossed the Rainbow Bridge, the second phase of the game begins for that player. Now the player rolls the die to move around the Mastery Oval, which contains the letters of the word mastery. Each turn, the player has the chance to earn a letter of the word mastery by answering a trivia question. The first person to receive all seven letters of mastery wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
