			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the ancient time of Java, there was once a prosperous kingdom called Mataram. The nature was extremely generous, yet dangerous. And their technology was so advance they began to trade with foreign nations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As one of Rakai (noble), you are entrusted by The King to build Candi or Temple (a mega structure to worship Gods and Nature) and establish profitable trading with foreign nations. The most successful Rakai is entitled as the successor of The King. But beware of Megatsunami and Ultravulcanian Eruption for those great disasters can easily wipe the entire civilization of Mataram out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Candrageni, you play as Rakai. Your ultimate goal is to be the first Rakai who collects 15 victory points. You collect points by building temples or trading with foreign nations. Once this goal is achieved, the game is over. Or, in case one of two final disasters occur (Megatsunami and Ultravulcanian Eruption), the game is over and (unfortunately) no one is winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
