							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tithe</name>
									
			<description>In feudal times, the different taxes levied upon the citizens were essential to maintain the prosperity of the kingdom and to overthrow other lords who taxed to much. Tithe is a fun card game in which four different kings struggle to raise more gold and to take power in the kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tithe is a quick and easy game designed by Pablo Bella, for 2-4 players ages 8, lasting about 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players have hidden identities, and try to gain the power of the crown for their families. There are four kings in the game that make a deck of kings, and determine the predominant color in the course of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the kings deck, there is a character deck. Players draw cards from this deck, and each round players will play character card to try to win the trick. Each character has a color (of the family), a strength value to measure victories in trick that are played and a value in gold (victory points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When everybody plays one card strength and families are compared to determine which player wins the trick. This continues until all character cards from the deck have been played. But beware! It is not the player who wins the most tricks that wins the game, but the player that accumulates the most gold!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tithe is a very quick and simple game, available in Spanish and English version and totally free for all Dizemo fans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
