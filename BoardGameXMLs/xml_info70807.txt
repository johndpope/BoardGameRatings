			<description>Skaters maneuver their players and puck on board to an advantageous shooting position, the best being one of the 18 circled spaces in front of the goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a board game involving pawns and a board of circles, Pass and Score is remarkably faithful to good hockey play. Each player gets three moves in sequence, which can be a combination of moving a pawn one space, passing the puck from one pawn to another along any clear line, and of course shooting on goal. Passes must not violate standard offside rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any given pawn can only move two spaces in a turn, but the board includes &amp;quot;slide&amp;quot; lines that allow bursts of speed on offence or defence. One player takes the puck away from the other by moving a pawn onto the same space as the puck carrier (the pawns have a peg to hold them on top of the puck), &amp;quot;checking&amp;quot; his opponent into an adjacent circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most challenging of all for all players: a penalty is called when either team fails to complete its three-element move within 15 seconds! Going over the limit means you lose one of your pawns for the next three turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While intended to be played for fun, it includes a significant teaching component, including dotted lines on the board showing the areas of responsibility for different positions, and a set of 18 Hockey Tips listed inside the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
