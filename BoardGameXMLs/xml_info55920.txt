			<description>The Core of Corruption is the sixth adventure in the Dawn of Defiance campaign, which will take heroes from 1st level all the way through 20th level in a continuous storyline designed to give both players and Gamemasters a complete Star Wars Roleplaying Game Saga Edition experience. This adventure takes the heroes straight into the heart of the Empire and the Sarlacc Project. They should advance to 13th level by the conclusion of the adventure. During the course of this adventure, the heroes pursue the Sarlacc Project to the Imperial capital world of Coruscant, now known as Imperial Center. While searching for the source of the project, the heroes learn the realities of life at the center of the Empire, while pursuing leads under the glare of Imperial security, the likes of which they have not encountered before. Ultimately, the heroes manage to locate the source of the Sarlacc Project, though it may not be exactly what they expect. (From Adventure Introduction)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
