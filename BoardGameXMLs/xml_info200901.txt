							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Path of Villainy</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Become a Master of Evil!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While it&amp;rsquo;s true that anyone can be evil, to truly be a master of all things nefarious and wicked requires dedication, and this is even more true at the highest echelons of power. Nothing stops mythic characters of the archmage, champion, or trickster paths from being evil and villainous, but the worst of the worst deserve a dedicated path that provides them with all the tools and tricks that are the villain&amp;rsquo;s bread and butter. Quick escapes, mocking monologues, and dastardly schemes, these are the tools of those who choose the villain mythic path, and they allow nothing to stand in the way of their dark desires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents a new mythic path for mythic characters, the villain. With over 30 mythic powers to choose from, your villainous characters, whether player characters in an evil campaign, or villainous NPCs, will have plenty of options available, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Several powers that specifically interfere with the mythic abilities of others.&lt;br/&gt;    Accessible necromancy and fiend summoning, even for characters otherwise incapable of casting spells.&lt;br/&gt;    A secret lair that is difficult to find via magic.&lt;br/&gt;    Access to powerful technology and the ability to replicate it.&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;hellip;and much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
