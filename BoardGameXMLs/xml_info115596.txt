			<description>&amp;quot;This is a game about an avenger Van Connor who witnessed his mother&amp;rsquo;s death and his country&amp;rsquo;s ruin as a child. After he lost his mother and his home, he turned to a life of violence to take on the zombies and to avenge the death of his mother. In a world filled with an onslaught of zombies and little protection, the survival of Van Connor is critical to helping the world recover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect wooden boxes to trigger prolific special skills like blaze, freeze and squall and plow through the horde of starving zombies with these newfound abilities. Watch out for the maces and magmas on your chopping road because they will send you to your doom!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
