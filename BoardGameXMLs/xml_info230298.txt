			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to &amp;quot;100 Oddities for an Enchanted Forest,&amp;quot; the eighth entry in Skirmisher Publishing&amp;rsquo;s popular &amp;quot;Oddities&amp;quot; series! This publication includes 100 unique things characters might encounter in a sylvan setting and includes guidelines for introducing the Wild Hunt into your game sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your players are traveling from one region to another, such as from the keep they call home to a distant ruin, a frontier outpost, a battlefield, or the like. Making their way through the forest that lies between their point of origin and destination can be a simple matter of a couple of nights camping out and an encounter with a wandering monster ... or it could be so much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oddities are intended to aid GM creativity, turning possibly bland areas or gaming episodes into something more, and the goal of this publication is to make things more fun and to take your imagination in directions it might not otherwise have gone. They fill in the corners of a bookshelf, a room, a level, a scenario, with all the sorts of things that add interest but take loads of time to come up with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
