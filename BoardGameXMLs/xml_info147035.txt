			<description>In the card and dice game Double Up, you set the challenge. Do you play it safe and choose a challenge that&amp;rsquo;s easy for both you and your opponents? Or do you raise the bar and pick a tough one, betting your friends will fail where you&amp;rsquo;ll succeed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting player attempts to match a pattern on a card using a specified number of dice and a hand of roll modifying cards. The player has a fixed number of attempts and dice, as indicated on the card, to successfully complete the challenge. If successful, the rest of the players must attempt the same challenge card and beat it in as many or fewer attempts than the original player. If the player fails to beat the challenge, whoever set the challenge gains a point; if the challenge is a Double Up card, however, they gain two points. The challenge is over once each player has made an attempt. The next player starts a new challenge and the game continues until one person reaches an agreed upon number of points. Double Up your opponents often to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
