							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reverse Charades Junior Edition</name>
									
			<description>Reverse Charades is a hilarious twist on a classic game where the entire team has 60 seconds to act out as many words as one team member can guess. It&amp;rsquo;s a fast-paced, fiercely fun team competition that&amp;rsquo;s an absolute riot with families, work teams, school groups, party-goers or among a few close friends. But be warned&amp;hellip;you&amp;rsquo;re in for big and dangerous doses of fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reverse Charades Junior Edition is the family friendly version of Reverse Charades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains:&lt;br/&gt;360 double sided word cards&lt;br/&gt;sand timer&lt;br/&gt;instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic rules (from the publisher):&lt;br/&gt;1. Split into teams of three or more. Decide on a number of rounds or a point target to win.&lt;br/&gt;2. 1 word guessed correctly = 1 point. Each team has one minute to guess as many words as possible.&lt;br/&gt;3. Each team selects a guesser (everyone gets a turn) and the rest of the team acts out the words.&lt;br/&gt;4. Shhh! Not a peep among the team members.&lt;br/&gt;5. Ready, set, go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;720 words, for 6+ players ages 6 and up, geared towards Kids &amp;amp; Family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
