			<description>User comment:&lt;br/&gt;An examination of role-playing as a performing art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher lurb:&lt;br/&gt;Performance is a major part of role-playing, and role-playing games as a performing art is the subject of this book, which attempts to introduce an appreciation for the performance aesthetics of such games. The author provides the framework for a critical model useful in understanding the art--especially in terms of aesthetics--of role-playing games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book also serves as a contribution to the beginnings of a body of criticism, theory, and aesthetics analysis of a mostly unrecognized and newly developing art form. There are four parts: the cultural structure, the extent to which the game relates to outside cultural elements; the formal structure, or the rules of the game; the social structure, which encompasses the degree and quality of social interaction among players; and the aesthetic structure, concerned with the emergence of role-playing as an art form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
