							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Nebula From Hell</name>
									
			<description>The Nebula From Hell is a party game for people who enjoy laughing at and being laughed at by others.  It is meant to be played with crazy, sarcastic people who enjoy making fun of other people. This game has it all. Nebulas, dragons, canoes, bombs, wizards, stars, action cards, bonus cards, physical challenges, and boats. What more could you want from a game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game actually hates you.  Most games try to entertain you.  This game wants to crush your skull. Just when you think you're winning, you'll be sucked into the Nebula and spit out with nothing.  Game over. Go home, loser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who is this game for? For those who prey on the weak and laugh and jeer as they kick them while they're down. If you have any emotional response at all in life, this game probably isn't for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy to play. Hard to win. On your turn, drawn an action card.  Read it out loud. Do what it says. That's it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
