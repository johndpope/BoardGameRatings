							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Castles</name>
									
			<description>Castles involves the construction of a series of castles on the western coast of England during the 11th century. Castles was quickly followed by an expansion, Castles: The Northern Campaign, and a sequel, Castles II: Siege and Conquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game combines several genres of gameplay including resource management, a text-based multiple-choice storyline and a simple combat mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Castles, the player constructs up to eight castles, one after the other, in various regions in western England and Wales. Each scenario starts in the castle building mode with a flat, empty map of the region. The map has such features as trees and water, but is largely devoid of manageable terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Castles (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
