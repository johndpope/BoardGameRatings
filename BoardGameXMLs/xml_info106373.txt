							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bismarck: The North Sea Chase</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Germany's massive dreadnaught, Bismarck, sent Her Majesty's Ship Hood to the bottom of the icy Atlantic on the evening of 24 May 1941.  Of the Hood's 1,415 crewmen, only 3 survived.  Bismarck's guns are powerful enough to hurl automobile-sized shells for miles.  With such awesome firepower, can she invincibly prowl the sea lanes?  Can Britain stop her?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bismarck - The North Sea Chase is a taut, multi-level game featuring full joystick control; real-time action; and variable speed and difficulty levels.  You're in charge of an exciting array of technical controls: Main Screen Map, Air Reconnaissance Screen, Weather Forecasting, Radar Search, Bridge Command and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And when it's time for action, you direct the anti-aircraft and heavy guns; launch torpedo attacks; and manage damage control!  If you tire of command from the bridge, you can pilot a Fairey Swordfish torpedo plane off a carrier flight deck.  Hunt Bismarck from the air via this exciting, cockpit-perfect flight simulator.  With options to control either The Royal Navy or the infamous German battleship, Bismarck - The North Sea Chase provides and abundance of intriguing, sharp-edged game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
