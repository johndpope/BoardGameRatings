							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">P P P Penguin Race Game</name>
									
			<description>Be the first to get all your penguins, or the most penguins, to the finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 3 penguins and 5 icebergs, places them all on the start space and chooses one of the 4 coloured trails to race along.  A player moves his penguins and icebergs along his chosen trail by the throw of the two dice in any combination.  Penguins hop from iceberg to iceberg by exact dice throw.  If a 6 is rolled, the player may take any unoccupied iceberg from any other player and place it anywhere on his own trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple children's racing game that teaches how to plan ahead as only one penguin can occupy each iceberg at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains 12 black &amp;amp; white wooden penguins, 30 small cardboard icebergs and 2 standard dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
