							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warrock&#039;s Farm</name>
									
			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warrock&amp;rsquo;s Farm begins with the discovery of a burned-out wagon, followed later in the day by news of a Troll raid on an outlying farm.  Two children are taken.  Now, it is a race to find to find the children before something bad happens.  The raiders are moving about the area, so Adventurers have to track and guess well, as well as have a little luck.  The opponents are challenging, though a lower-level group can prevail by employing good tactics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure takes place across an area of 25 square miles, with a small town, two small rivers, three hills, a forested area, a fen, a ruin, and five small caves.  The small town of Ash Mill is described, along with some of its inhabitants.  Several farms are found in the area, some already visited by the Trolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure has 12 pages plus an additional nine pre-generated characters of L1 to L4.  The adventure is written for the Portal to Adventure rule set, and is usable essentially as-is with AD&amp;amp;D and similar rules (extensive Game Master rework may be required for use with D&amp;amp;D 3.x and D&amp;amp;D 4, or any similar rule set).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
