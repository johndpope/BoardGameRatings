			<description>This map is an unofficial fan made expansion. Symbols &amp;amp; Graphics Copyright &amp;copy; 2004-2015 Days of Wonder, Inc. Produced with permission of Days of Wonder, for non-commercial use only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This follows the principles of the basic Ticket to Ride Rails and Sails game on a special board with special cards and rules. The object of the game is to gain the most points by travelling various routes and outwitting other players. You will need all the train and ship pieces, the train and ship cards and the rules from the base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an extra set of Explorer cards for the cities, each with a value to be earned by visiting that city. These cards are dealt/picked up alongwith tickets in the same quantity and with the same 'keep/dispose' rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also Challenger cards which may help or hinder you. The 9 bonuses and the secret city card give you extra points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many new options in the rules such as 'exchange all your cards at the start but keep all the new ones' and 'discard 5 cards and pick up 5 new ones'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
