			<description>After the 1848 Revolution, Hungary became a modern democratic country. However, as part of the Austrian Empire and consisting of numerous ethnical groups, the transformation caused serious political and social conflicts as well. These led ultimately to internal revolts, then a full-scale war with Austria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1848-1849: Hungary Fights for Freedom is a solitaire (one-player) game in which you, the player, represent the government of Hungary &amp;ndash; centred around the person of Lajos Kossuth &amp;ndash; during the 1848-49 War of Independence. Your goal is to defend revolutionary Hungary against the enemies approaching from different directions, who are controlled by the rules of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into three Seasons: Winter, Spring and Summer. At the start of each turn you must flip a new Event card, apply its effects and move the enemy armies printed on it. Then you have a number of Action Points (also printed on the card) that you may use for different Actions. You can choose from five possible Actions: Attack, Siege, Strategic Redeployment, Raise Morale and Inspire the Army. At the end of the turn, you must do some Administration, e.g. modify the Morale, check for victory or defeat, do recruitment and redeployment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game aims to recapture the political, social and economical side of the conflict as well as the military one, in a format that is easily playable in under 1 hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1848-1849: Hungary Fights for Freedom was inspired by Victory Point Games&amp;rsquo; popular States of Siege series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1 map&lt;br/&gt;     27 Event cards&lt;br/&gt;     50 counters (Hungarian and enemy generals, army strengths, divisions, Morale stc.)&lt;br/&gt;     1 rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Print-and-Play game, which means all components are freely downloadable!
