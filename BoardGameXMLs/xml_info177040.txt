							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Village on the Lake</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 40 x 40 inch, full color battlemap of a Village on a Lake .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just an unimportant fishing village? Ha! Its very isolation makes the village an inviting area for smugglers and fugitives alike.  I want that village searched.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Chief Constable Gerald&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Village on the Lake is a single exterior map of a village situated on top of a body of water by means of a multi-tiered wooden platform surrounded by a flotilla of small ships. The interiors of the village buildings are also displayed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Village on the Lake is intended for use in fantasy settings, but may also be of use in modern settings for a society still using primitive wooden ships. Its isolated nature makes it an ideal location for horror settings as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fleeing from Justice: Chief Constable Gerald&amp;rsquo;s reputation for capturing every criminal he hunts precedes him. Recently, a man went mad and slaughtered his entire family in a small village along the coast of a lake. After having questioned the gate guards, he deduces he did not flee by land. The constable suspects that the murderer has fled to an isolated village on the lake via ship to avoid pursuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player Characters may be constables working for Gerald, own a ship willing to travel to the village on the lake to take Gerald there, or may be hired as mercenaries for additional security by Gerald.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The village on the lake is purported to be more than a mere fishing village. There are rumors of the place being a den of smugglers, pirates, and even criminals that have fled the mainland rather than simple fishermen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Gerald to get his suspect the group might have to fight their way through pirates on the way to the island (or back to the coast with the fugitive), not to mention negotiate with the deeply xenophobic villagers to enter the village let alone search their houses. Why do these people dislike foreigners so much and what do they have to hide?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
