							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Red Riots</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is designed to be an action/intrigue module for &amp;quot;The Babylon Project&amp;quot; role playing system. The main thrust of the module is the infiltration of the underground movement on Mars that is organising the populace into militant action groups. This will eventually lead to the Mars Food Riots of 2251. How badly Mars is disrupted and how long the riots last depend on the actions of the Player Characters. This adventure requires a group that:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Would be hired by Earth Force for undercover work &amp;ndash; perhaps one of the group members had previously carried out such work for Earth Force and was very successful.&lt;br/&gt;     Can use lethal force if a situation proves it necessary.&lt;br/&gt;     Can successfully blend in with the seedy underbelly of the Mars colony.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These points are important as they allow the adventure to run smoothly: a group of Centauri ministers would not be hired by Earth Force to conduct an undercover operation that is important to Earth colony security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
