							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Panzer PaK 5: British Drive to the Rhine</name>
									
			<description>The decisive battles around Arracourt commenced on 15 September 1944 when elements of the German 15th Panzer Grenadier Division clashed with the reconnaissance units of the USA 2nd Cavalry Group. After initially withdrawing, the Germans again advanced near the town of Luneville, with the 111th Panzer Brigade committed as reinforcements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Caen was the objective of the British 3rd Infantry Division on D-Day due to its position on the Orne River and its roll as a road hub for the area. Many famous units saw action in the conflict including the British 7th Armored Division (the &amp;ldquo;Desert Rats&amp;rdquo;) and the German Panzer Lehr and 12th SS Panzer Divisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panzer PaK 5 is an expansion to Panzer Miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Full-color illustrated booklet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Scenarios: Six historical scenarios focusing on the action near Caen including two on the famous Villers-Bocage battle that may be linked into a mini-campaign &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed British and Commonwealth Army TO&amp;amp;E: General organizations from 1944 through 1945 &amp;mdash; Armored Divisions, Infantry Division, and Airborne Division to the individual vehicle, gun and squad level &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Optional Rules: Limited Hull Down, Hidden movement rules for Panzer &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Unit Data Cards: 40 new unit data cards &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Hidden Movement Cards: Two hidden movement play cards &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Panzer Miniatures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
