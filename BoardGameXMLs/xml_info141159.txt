			<description>iAssociate&amp;trade; 2 is a word association game, where players have to figure out which words or phrases are associated to each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;iAssociate 2 offers brand new, never before seen, levels for you to enjoy. You will get to figure out what some of the most powerful forces on mother earth are, food in all different forms and tastes, go treasure hunting knowing that X marks the spot and LOTS more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the new levels iAssociate 2 also offers lots of new features to help you progress in the game. You can now get hints for all of those words which you get stuck with, but beware, there is only a limited amount of hints for you to use so use them wisely. If the Hints aren't enough then you can now also quickly ask for help on Facebook, in seconds you'll have your help requests published on Facebook allowing everyone else to aid you in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If these features aren't enough then there's now a new chance for you to prove your worth by competing against all other players. By completing your levels faster than others you'll now have a chance to earn speed medals, which can help you unlock more levels faster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
