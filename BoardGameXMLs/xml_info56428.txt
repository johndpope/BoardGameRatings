							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rummino</name>
									
			<description>Rummino is a variation of a rummy game that although has a simple concept of matching requires strategy and forethought. The game comes with 92 tiles with 5 suits (clubs, hearts, diamonds, spades and stars)and 5 ranks (9, 10, jack, Queen, King, Ace). Each player starts with 7 tiles which are used to score the most points by creating sets and runs. If players are able to finish off a run or set, that player receives double or triple the points for that round. Rummino is a unique rummy game that is easy to learn yet strategically challenging to even the most advanced gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
