							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NFL Blitz Pro</name>
									
			<description>NFL Blitz Pro is the ninth installment of the NFL Blitz series of unrealistic American football themed video games. After this game, and following the loss of the NFL license in 2005, the Blitz series was relaunched as Blitz: The League.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With NFL Blitz Pro, the number of playable characters was increased from eight to eleven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was such a commercial failure, that Midway did not release a Blitz series game in 2004 for the first time since the series began. Blitz Pro was thought to be the last NFL Blitz game, until Blitz: The League came out in 2005 with fictional players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;NFL Blitz&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
