							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Land Plots: Oak Meadows</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While gold and silver is nice there are other rewards of more useful value. Land, for example, is quite a tempting reward for the party of adventurers who are finding their selves in need of a fortification if not just a place to park their excess gear. This first installment of Land Plots focuses on a nice tract of land located in a small, rural area simply known as Oak Meadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Covering a total of 90 acres, the land plot offers the adventuring party a combination of farm ready meadows, rolling hills, and timber rich woodlands. There is also a limestone cave&lt;br/&gt;and a creek of pure, clear water that the characters might find to be useful. Whether available for purchase or intended to be used as a means of rewarding the characters for saving the day (and perhaps the village) the land plot is worth 5600 gold coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
