Annihilus comes through the gateway to Earth looking for his cosmic control rod.  The Fantastic Four must defeat him and send him back to the negative zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the adventure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cosmic Control Rod Trilogy continues as the FANTASTIC FOUR ventures into the Negative Zone to face off against ANNIHILUS, the Rod's creator.
