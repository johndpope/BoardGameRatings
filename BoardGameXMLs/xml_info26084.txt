			<description>This cycling game appeared somewhere in the 1970's in East Germany. The game has very original mechanics as the movement of the plastic cyclists on the oval indoor track on the gameboard is not done by cards or by dice but by a speedometer, a device that looks a bit like a spinner. That only makes this game a collectors item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not to be confused with 6-Tage Rennen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
