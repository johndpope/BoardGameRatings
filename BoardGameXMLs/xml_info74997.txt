			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Banjo-Kazooie is a platform and action-adventure video game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo as the inaugural game in the Banjo-Kazooie series. It was released in 1998 for the Nintendo 64 and later re-released in 2008 for the Xbox Live Arcade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in the fictional location of Spiral Mountain where a bear named Banjo and a bird named Kazooie live. Gruntilda the witch kidnaps Banjo's sister, Tooty, to steal her beauty via a transformation device. Banjo and Kazooie set out on a dangerous adventure to rescue Tooty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was announced at Microsoft's E3 2008 press conference that Banjo-Kazooie would be made available for download on Xbox Live Arcade in the future. This version would feature increased screen resolution and minor graphical refinements. Properties of Nintendo have been removed throughout the game. For example, the animated Nintendo 64 logo is absent from the opening sequence, while the Nintendo company logo on Mumbo's xylophone in the introduction was replaced by the Microsoft Game Studios logo. The Game Boy that Banjo plays in the file select menu remains, but the Game Boy start up sound heard when the file is highlighted is removed. Characters who have appeared in other Nintendo-published games are unchanged, including Bubblegloop Swamp's Tiptup and Click Clock Wood's Gnawty the Beaver. On its website, Rare revealed that the port would be handled by 4J Studios. The game was released on Xbox Live Arcade on 3 December 2008 for 1,200 Microsoft Points. It was also released as a preorder bonus for Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp;amp; Bolts on 12 November 2008.&lt;br/&gt;Among new adjustments made to the game is the ability to permanently collect musical notes. Individual notes are saved on collection, whereas the original Banjo-Kazooie only saved the highest score. Bottle's hidden jigsaw puzzle game features sequences showing areas from different levels. On the game's release, if the player completed a puzzle showing notes from a level, a glitch occurred where those notes were permanently removed from the level before they could be collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
