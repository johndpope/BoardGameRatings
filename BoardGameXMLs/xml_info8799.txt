							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Andersonville</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Andersonville is a very simple card game for three or four players. Its theme is based on life in the notorious Andersonville prison camp that operated in Georgia during the American Civil War. Originally designed to hold 10,000 men, the 26 acre camp would end up holding 33,000 prisoners during its busiest month of operation. Between the months of February 1864 and April 1865, 13,000 Union prisoners died there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Andersonville is to finish with the most Survival points. To achieve this end, players will need to use strategy, bluff, and some diplomacy.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panzerschreck Magazine, Issue 7, Winter 2001-02.&lt;br/&gt;This card game has four Player Card decks (numbered 1-10) and a 46 numbered Action cards, Survival chits, and Health markers. Special rules are given for solitaire and two-player versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
