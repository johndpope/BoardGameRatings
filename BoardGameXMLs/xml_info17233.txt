			<description>Turn or Burn is a print-and-play game of space fighter combat for 2 to 8 players.  To start a game, players design their fighters from a deck of system cards.  Each turn, players plot a single action by playing a system or maneuver card face down.  After everyone has played a card, the actions are revealed.  Movement is governed by Newtonian mechanics in 2 dimensions.  Combat is resolved by pulling cards from a hand made up of the target fighter&amp;rsquo;s system cards plus a number of &amp;ldquo;miss&amp;rdquo; cards based on range and other factors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
