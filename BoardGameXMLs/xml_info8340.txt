							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Uncle Remus Game: Zip!</name>
									
			<description>Uncle Remus is a primitive pinball-type (Bagatelle) game based on the Walt Disney character of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marbles are launched into the playing area by use of a simple metal lever. The goal is to will your 7 marbles to land on top of one of several holes, each with a different point value. The game board rests at a slight angle so the marbles will gather near the bottom, in the Brier Patch, if they don't settle on a point value. After all of your marbles have been launched, you tally up your score to compare with others. There is also a ZIP! spot that allows you to relaunch a marble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name Zip! was likely incorporated as Uncle Remus was the character who sang the song &amp;quot;Zip-a-dee-doo-dah&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
