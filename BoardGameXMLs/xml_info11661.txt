			<description>Each player, in turn, spins the Spinner and places the number of Pelicans as indicated on the back of the Turtle.  Play continues until a player places a Pelican on the Turtle&amp;rsquo;s back which causes the Turtle to move under the Tree to get the Pelicans Off His Back.  That player is eliminated from the game.  The remaining players then reset the Turtle and the next round begins.  The game continues until only one player is left.  He is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
