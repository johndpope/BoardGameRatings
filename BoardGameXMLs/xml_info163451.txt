			<description>Rules for fighting Divisional level battles from the Spanish Civil War, using 15 mm figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a grid of offset squares or hexagons. These represent an area 500 yards across. For 15mm figures on 30mm bases use xx squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each area will normally hold a battalion sized unit, plus a support arm, such as an armour section or an artillery battery. A square can, however, contain two battalions if wanted. Squares may hold a maximum, of one artillery battery or tank squadron (unless parked up in reserve)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that all the units in a square are subject to the effect of the total hits on the square when casualties are determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
