			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City Hungers. Will You Feed It?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The streets bleed shadows as the supernatural politics of the city threaten to swallow you whole. Will you die a hero&amp;mdash;a savior for those who have never had enough&amp;mdash;or live long enough to become the villain? Will you fight the darkness...or give in for power?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The choice is yours. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Urban Shadows is an urban fantasy tabletop roleplaying game in which mortals and monsters vie for control of a modern-day city, a political battleground layered just under the reality we think we know. Vampires, faeries, hunters, and wizards fight to carve out a piece of the streets and skyscrapers, ready to make deals with all those who have something to offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;ll find inside this book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Ten unique character Archetypes spread across four supernatural Factions, each carefully tuned to put characters at the center of awesome stories.&lt;br/&gt;    Clearly-defined mechanics that push the fiction forward every time a player rolls the dice, advancing your group&amp;rsquo;s story at every turn.&lt;br/&gt;    Detailed instructions for the Master of Ceremonies, the player in charge of running the game and portraying the political machination of the powers-that-be.&lt;br/&gt;    Easy-to-follow rules for creating custom settings, cities, and mechanics to make your game of Urban Shadows all your own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Urban Shadows makes use of the same rules-light engine as Apocalypse World, Monsterhearts, and Dungeon World &amp;mdash; while drawing on fiction as diverse as The Wire, The Dresden Files, and The Shield &amp;mdash; to create a game of urban politics and supernatural drama. Packed with mechanics that create hard choices and meaningful fiction, this game is easy for new players to learn and complex enough to play again and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city is waiting for you. What will you make of its secrets and sins?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
