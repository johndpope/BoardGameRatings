			<description>This game uses a standard deck of cards. Each player gets 3, 4 or 5 cards in a deal, depending on the number of players. Any card can be played in any turn, the highest one wins the trick. A player winning two tricks wins the round and gets a point. The first one to achieve 5 points is the winner. At certain points players can &amp;quot;putt&amp;quot;, then opponents can give up or &amp;quot;see&amp;quot;, in that case the winner of that round wins the whole game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
