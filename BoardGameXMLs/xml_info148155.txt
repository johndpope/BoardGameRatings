							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bunker</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bunker is a full-color, 3 level, floor plan of a Bunker, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Bunker is sealed. The world outside is not safe for human life. If you break the seal, then you&amp;rsquo;ll kill us all! I will stop you if you try&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bunker is a three level map of a bunker&amp;rsquo;s exterior with four gates and turrets, the first basement level (1B) security area, and the second basement level (2B) living area all connected by a center lift.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bunker is intended for use in post apocalyptic or near or far future science fiction games. It could be used as a cutting edge bunker that was sealed in a modern game as well found later in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bunker was sealed to prevent radiation fallout from killing everyone in the facility. However, some of the residents panicked and broke the seal, killing the security guards in 1B (the three skeletons in 1B), turning off the automated security turrets, and used the lift to go to the surface and escape the bunker. Presumably, they tried to survive on the surface, either dying from radiation poisoning or undergoing mutations becoming mutants. The group is trying to survive on the surface of this planet after the radiation on the surface has fallen to safe levels. Mutants live on the surface and are chasing the group. The group finds the bunker with four offline turrets and four open gates. If they can seal the gates, they can keep out the mutants, and if they can turn the turrets on, they can drive them off by loading the turrets with the ammo crates. If they can drive off the mutants, they can try and raid the rest of the facility for supplies left behind such as food or medical supplies. Perhaps the cryo chambers hold some people in suspended animation and can be freed by the group who can explain the history of the bunker if they survive the unfreezing process. For example, perhaps the people in the living area were prisoners and the security guards upstairs were keeping them inside to save them all, but the prisoners were determined to break out no matter what.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
