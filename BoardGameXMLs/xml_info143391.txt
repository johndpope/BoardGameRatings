			<description>Board &amp;amp; Pieces&lt;br/&gt;FlipFlop is played between two opponents. There are two versions of the game: One is played on 3x3 board and another is on 5x5 square board. Each player has 3 (5 for 5 x 5 boards) pieces, which have two faces: The Bishop and the Rook. &lt;br/&gt; Movements&lt;br/&gt;All pieces start as Rook, arranged at the first row on each end. As in normal chess games, Rooks move in a straight line, horizontally or vertically and Bishops move in a straight diagonal line, as far as they want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each move, pieces are 'flipped' and promoted from Rook to Bishop, then from Bishop to Rook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces cannot be captured, except when they are either in your or opponent's goal square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt; You win when any of your pieces is placed in the middle square in the last row, your goal square for two consecutive turns, or when there is no legitimate moves left for your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
