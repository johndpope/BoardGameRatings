							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Haunted Hamlet of Raven&#039;s Hill</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Haunted Hamlet of Raven&amp;rsquo;s Hill brings you a set of horror-themed adventures suitable for any introductory campaign using the 5th edition of the world&amp;rsquo;s most famous roleplaying game. Whether run independently or in sequence, these adventures provide a decidedly creepy twist on the typical peaceful village home for beginning adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Fiddlerâ€™s Lament, music hath charms to soothe the savage breast, it&amp;rsquo;s true, but some music truly is the devil&amp;rsquo;s music. An orphan raised by gypsies, now full-grown but still lost and alone, must face once more the tragic curse that destroyed her past. Will her darkling music bring ruin to the village she now calls her home? Can the heroes earn the townsfolk&amp;rsquo;s trust, or must innocence be sacrificed for the heroes to save town from the mysterious hauntings that plague a village huddled in the shadow of an accursed ruin?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Murmuring Fountain takes the accursed influence in a rather different direction, though no less tragic.Sometimes a raven not just a raven, and those who have lost everything may do more than come a-gently tapping upon your chamber door. A missing pet, a ghostly girl, a madman in the woods; what is the strand that binds them all together at The Murmuring Fountain?  Can your heroes quell the ghostly emanations of a tragic haunting that threaten to sow madness and tragedy in Raven&amp;rsquo;s Hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
