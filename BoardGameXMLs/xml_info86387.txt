							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deck of Illusions</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck of illusions has served many purposes over the ages: distraction, entertainment, trap, and amusement. With each passing age, the deck has remained an obscure but much loved piece of adventuring equipment. This potent magic item has long been a favorite of bards and rogues, who have thought of a million different uses for the deck in a variety of dangerous and not-so-dangerous situations. Originally, the deck of illusions served a much simpler purpose to its creator; to keep him company when no others would.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Creator Of the Deck of Illusions&lt;br/&gt;     History Of the Deck of Illusions&lt;br/&gt;     New Magic Items: The Deck of Illusionary Locations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
