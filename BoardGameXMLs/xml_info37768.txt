							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dial-Gay for Murder</name>
									
			<description>Someone did not like Paul Pernicious, head operator at DIAL-GAY Answering Service. In fact, someone strangled him with the cord from his own headset, even as he worked at the switchboard. It's up to you and your guests to discover who murdered Paul Pernicious-- and why. This is a gay-themed &amp;quot;How to Host a Murder&amp;quot;-style game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
