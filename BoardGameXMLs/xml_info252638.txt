			<description>Ostle is an abstract strategy game for 2 or 4 players, played on a 5x5 square grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with five identical pawns placed each on a space on their side of the board. A &amp;quot;hole&amp;quot; pawn is placed in the center space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to push two of the opponent's pawns either off the board or in the hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, each player pushed one of their pawns by one space in any orthogonal direction. They can push as many of their own pawns as they want, but only one of the opponent's pawns can be pushed. Alternatively, a player can move the hole by one space, to a free space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
