			<description>This game challenges kids and parents with more than 200 trivia questions.&lt;br/&gt;Play the game to get some great advice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each question has a &amp;quot;BEEP-ed&amp;quot; word: the players take turns trying to find the missing word. The first player answering five correct questions wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are special cards where players should provide an ingredient of their choice to add in a given recipe and then, the Chef in charge for that turn will choose the winner based on his own taste.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also features some variants as the simultaneous possibility to answer: you need to be the first to catch an item in order to get the right to answer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game presents four different levels of difficulty: at the beginning of the game, the players may choose to play a specific level or a mix of all four.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
