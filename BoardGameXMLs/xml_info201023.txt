							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Camp Nightmare</name>
									
			<description>A cooperative game about a camping adventure where everything goes horribly wrong. 1-6 players work together to gather wood, cook food, and play equipment while surviving bears, rain, broken gear, and endless other disasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Camp Nightmare is a great game for parties because players can be added in or subtracted partway through without wrecking the game.  It is a strategy game with lots of thought, but the rules are simple enough that an eight year old can play along.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to cope with all the disasters that occur while having as much fun as possible by roasting marshmallows, setting off fireworks, and sitting around a campfire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
