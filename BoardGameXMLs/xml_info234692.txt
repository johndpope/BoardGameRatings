							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chants of the Fallen: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With your archeological team, you have found the remains of an ancient civilization which was so far unknown to humanity. Players walk through the remains of an archeological site and move energy tokens to play new cards or benefit of elemental and/or cosmic powers every turn. The player who achieved the highest score after twelve game rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has two sides and, according to what side is used to play, there will be slightly different options for the players according to which one is used to play. Also, four special squares that trigger elemental power struggles with considerable vicotry point rewards will be revealed randomly at the beginning of the game. This forces the players to rethink their progression on the board every time the game is played again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was designed by the recording artist and game designer Sebastian Portillo as a part of a musical album with original tracks. Therefore, the game includes original music which plays as the game progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be played in 60 to 90 minutes by 2 to 5 players and is suitable for teenagers and adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
