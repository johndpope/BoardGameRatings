							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Strange Creature Deck</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;100 Strange, scary, dangerous, and just plain weird creatures from the Shoals of Earth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build encounters quickly and easily, or create them randomly on the fly. Then give your players a look at their foes before plunging into combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Strange Creature Deck contains 100 of the most commonly encountered creatures from the shoals of Earth, drawn from both The Strange corebook and The Strange Bestiary. When you need to build an encounter (either when prepping your game or at the gaming table), simply draw a card from this deck. You&amp;rsquo;ve got basic stats (with a reference to the corebook, for full stats and info) on one side, and an image to share with your players on the reverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Strange Creature Deck saves oodles of time when prepping for your game sessions, and even more time when you need to create and run an encounter on the fly. And who couldn't use a bit more time for the actual gaming?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creatures from The Strange Creature Deck (and other Strange sources, such as The Strange Bestiary) are compatible for use with Numenera. This deck is available as a self-print option, or as a physical deck, printed to your order on high-quality playing card stock and shipped directly to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
