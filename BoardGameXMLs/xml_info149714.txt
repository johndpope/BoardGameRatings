			<description>Robot rebellions should be quelled by the best of the best.  When the best of the best are killed... it's up to you.  Subdue the uprising in time, or your corporate overlords nuke the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bionic Dues is a tactical, turn-based roguelite with mech customization. Guide multiple classes of Exos through a variety of missions filled with enemy robots that are as buggy as they are angry.  This is at least as bad as it sounds.  Explore for loot, destroy key robotic facilities, and brace yourself for the final attack by your enemies... just as soon as they can pull it together&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Robots are uprising they are building an army to attack your HQ in 50 days. You have that much time to accomplish various missions (23 different types) to improve your Exos(or Mechs)squad and face their final onslaught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build your squad of 4 Exos from 6 different classes, Assault, Siege, Science, Sniper, Ninja and Brawler. Then select 1 pilot from 6 possible choices each having a poweful special power.&lt;br/&gt;Exos have various rating including, Power (Weight), Shield, Computer, Stealth, Sensor, Propulsion. Plus various weapons and improvement slots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, the game is all about fulfilling missions to get loots to improve and customize your squad. Basically each mission take one day and bring you closer to the final battle. At the end of each day the robot factories produce some more bots  However a very few missions count for 5 days and allows you to trigger the final battle sooner. Some others missions target robots factories which slow down a little their productions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During each mission you control only one of your 4 Exos at a time, you can change which one you control depending on the tactical situation. The game is played in turn on a square tiles. Each turn you can do one action, Move, Attack, Change Exos, Hacking,Special...then all activated robots take one action each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is very tactical and sometimes almost puzzle like, as there is no luck in combat. There are a number of hazards on the ground, both helpful and harmful. And you can identify enemy robots from a distance depending on your sensors. Then it is a matter of finding the best course of actions to avoid attacks and possible chain reactions and to hack the locked door to find loots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
