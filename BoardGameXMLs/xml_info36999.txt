							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Humpty Dumpty Sat On A Wall</name>
									
			<description>A vintage, early twentieth century dexterity game. Each player has a small Humpty Dumpty figure which hangs from a suspended string. The players compete to maneuver their Humpty Dumpty onto a wall. Points are scored based on the facing and positioning of the Humpty Dumpty figure. For example, 20 points are scored for seating Humpty facing the player with both legs hanging over the side of the wall; but if only one leg is over the wall, the player scores 15 points. The winner is the first player to reach a predetermined number of points. An alternate race game is included where the players race to be the first to get their Humpty properly seated on the wall and detached from the string.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components include the box, an instruction sheet, three Humpty Dumpty figures with string, three walls, and three clips used to attach the lines of string to the game table. The box and instructions state &amp;quot;British Manufacture. Made in England.&amp;quot; No publisher is specified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
