							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fictive Hack 2012 Edition</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fictive Hack is designed to be low-prep, improvisational, reactive, cinematic, and fast-paced. Character advancement is based on the kind of game the players and DM want, and how they reward each other for playing in that style. (The game can be silly and over-the-top, or focused on tactics, or serious with emphasis on character development, etc.) Decide what is awesome, and that decision drives the game. A few interlocked systems (Awesome Point economy, weapons and arenas, armor, inherent abilities and talents) express a wide variety of action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
