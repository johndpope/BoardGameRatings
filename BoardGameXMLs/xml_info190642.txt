			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever found yourself...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not knowing what you're doing at the gym&lt;br/&gt;Being too drunk at a wedding&lt;br/&gt;Farting in yoga class&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just Four Kicks is a hilarious party game where anything can happen through creativity, quick thinking, and general debauchery. Watch your friends try to act out &amp;ldquo;being too drunk at a wedding&amp;rdquo; or use someone else&amp;rsquo;s body to depict &amp;ldquo;farting in yoga class.&amp;rdquo; Bring it to your next game night and it'll be guaranteed to bring your friends together through countless laughs and just a touch of embarrassment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;Do you like fun? Do you enjoy laughing? Are you interested in having an all around good time? If you answered yes to any of these questions (hopefully all) grab a copy of Just Four Kicks and prepare to have the time of your life. Inside jokes included in the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now I'm sure you're thinking, wow, this game sounds amazing, how is it played? Start by finding at least three friends (or strangers) and splitting into two equal teams. Just Four Kicks has four rounds of play that will get progressively more intense and hilarious, so choose your teammates wisely. Each player has 30 seconds to get their team to guess as many cards as possible by describing the topic, doing charades, or using someone else's body as a puppet. The team that guesses the most cards wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
