							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spaceman Adventure</name>
									
			<description>Spaceman Adventure is a strategy board game for 3-8 players with quick turns and deeply convoluted strategy. Players take on different roles round after round as they tactically move spacemen and aliens around the game board to maximize their rewards. Every round players choose from a panel of tactical actions and character cards, all of whom earn crystals in different ways. Your reward will depend on what you do, what your opponents do, what you think your opponents will do, what you think your opponents think you will do, etc. etc. At the end of 6 rounds, the player with the most crystals wins. The game has a retro sci-fi feel, simple gameplay and deeply complex strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
