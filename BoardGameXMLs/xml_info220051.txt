							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The JRPG Tabletop Adventure Game</name>
									
			<description>This takes the elements of a JRPG and puts them into an epic co-op tabletop adventure game. Players explore on a mini-map, grinding away as they search for the set-piece encounters - large battles that make or break the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set up in Acts, with each act being represented as a box of map tiles and encounters. Each act is meant to be played in a single sitting (1.5-2 hours), and then strung together into an epic 3-act story, concluding with a massive boss fight. That boss is defined by the earlier 3-acts and since the game features lots of different acts, there is lots of replay value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players use a bag of tokens that represents their characters &amp;quot;stats.&amp;quot; When players use various abilities, instead of rolling dice to check for success, they will draw tokens from their bag and check the various icons and runes to see if they succeed. As players level-up, they will swap in ever-more-impressive tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These token bags are also used by the heroes' enemies. Get set on fire? Put a fire token in your bag and you'll be on-fire until you draw it out. Get poisoned? Put 3 Poison tokens into your bag taking damage each time one comes out until you find a heal poison potion, etc...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game, players must battle through 3 acts and then a mega boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
