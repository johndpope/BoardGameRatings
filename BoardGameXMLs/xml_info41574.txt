			<description>This is a word card game that tried to be different from the others of its era, by focusing on only one word at a time, speeding up play and keeping everyone involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has a deck of 54 cards: 38 have a single letter; 10 have a 2-letter combination; and 2 each have 1, 2 or 3 stars, which are wild and stand for any letter (a word may not be all stars).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal 10 cards to each player, and turn up the top card of the reserve.  In a turn, a player does one of: &lt;br/&gt;1. Play a word of 3 or more letters from the hand to the table.  If there is already a word, the old word is discarded to the bottom of the reserve. &lt;br/&gt;2. Add 1 or more cards from the hand to the word on the table, making a new word. &lt;br/&gt;3. Draw the top of the reserve pile.&lt;br/&gt;4. Draw the turn-up card, turning up the top reserve to replace it. &lt;br/&gt;Note that there is no discarding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a word is played or added to, the player scores 1 point per letter in the word.  The hand ends when a player plays out all the letters in his hand, at which point all the others subtract 1 point for each letter in their hand.  Play until each player has dealt the same number of times, and the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
