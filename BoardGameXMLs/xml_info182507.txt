			<description>Somewhere in our galaxy, a small, starless planet wanders aimlessly inside of a vast nebula.  Highly advanced satellites that the inhabitants think of as gods - &amp;ldquo;Lorestars&amp;rdquo; - orbit this world, periodically irradiating the surface in an endless cycle of long-abandoned experiments.  The native lifeforms and human settlers live a primitive state of violence because of the volatile effects that the satellites have had on their genetics over the centuries.  When specific satellites are in certain parts of their orbits, the bursts of radiation even cause some inhabitants to change into alien monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this part of the Lorestar story, you play as one of five unique characters that turn into savage creatures when their satellite god passes through the right constellation.  Vying for survival in the wild outskirts of small towns, some of these characters, like the planet they live on, are confused wanderers, while others take advantage of their abilites to ruthlessly hold power over weaker people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control the position of the Lorestar icons by outsmarting your opponents in a simultaneous card draw that spins the central game board.  Once your character has turned into a monster by aligning the Lorestars in the inner board to the constellations on the outer board, play attack cards and use your monster abilities to continue to foil your opponents and dwindle their health until you're the last monster standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survive this battle and unlock the next chapter of Lorestar!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
