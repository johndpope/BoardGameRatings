			<description>An abstract strategy game for 2 players that adds a twist to the classic black vs. white setup: grey pieces that belong equally to both players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game mechanism revolves around enclosure (either partial or full) of other, single pieces on a square grid board.  Surrounded pieces can be either removed from play, replaced with upgraded pieces, or can cause extra turns or even a win, depending on the degree of enclosure (i.e. being surrounded by either 6, 7, or 8 pieces belonging to the player) and also the color of central piece being enclosed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A turn consists of a player either placing or moving a piece, and then acting out consequences if their move results in one or more enclosure situations.  In standard game play, the color of the piece to be played (either the player's own color or grey) is decided by the flip of a fair coin, but the game can also be played without that element of chance by simply alternating between the two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends either when a player causes a piece to be entirely enclosed with pieces belonging to them filling all 8 surrounding squares (in which case they are the winner), or in the event that no open spaces remain on the board (in which case the player with the most pieces of their specific color is the winner.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is both fun for beginners and yet dynamic enough to also engage experienced strategists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
