							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spider and Fly</name>
									
			<description>The square gameboard resting inside the box lid represents a spider's web. The little wooden tops that players spin are the spiders. The numbered holes on the gameboard represent flies the spiders want to capture and eat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the box lid:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player, in turn, takes the two wooden spinners and spins them one at a time in the center of the &amp;quot;web&amp;quot;. For each top which rests in a numbered compartment with the sphere end down, the player scores the amount printed under it. If the spinner rests in a compartment with the peg end down, the player scores double. A game consists of 100 points, and the first player who scores that amount is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
