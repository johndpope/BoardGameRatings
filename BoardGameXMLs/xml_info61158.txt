							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Torch</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next piece of essential gear covered in the &amp;quot;Adventurer Essentials&amp;quot; line is the humble Torch. In this PDF we take a brief look at the history of the Torch, the various woods used in Torch construction and the benefits of each including a special wood not native to this plane from which Masterwork Torches are made. A brief discussion of improvised Torches is also presented, as well as several magical torches including the Orc Pillage Flame, the Detonation Torch, Pelnor's Powder Packs (a collection of magical powders designed to unleash their magic when thrown on an open flame), and three new spells. Written by Bret Boyd, the same author that brought you the popular &amp;quot;Behind the Spells&amp;quot; series from Ronin Arts. Don't leave for your next adventure without the essentials!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
