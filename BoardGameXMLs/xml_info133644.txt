			<description>From the Inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Repton Infinity is the ultimate Repton program. You can completely redesign all of the game characters and game screens. But more than this, you can now also create a wide range of diversely different games by using a special game-creating language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let your imagination run riot as you devise new games. Select your own sound effects and visual effects. Decide how many opponents you wish to have. Perhaps include a river inhabited by piranha-fish or a battlefield with daring commandos. Maybe design a timid adversary who runs away from you. How about some friendly creatures who will help you in some way?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You control the behaviour of the creatures ... You determine the rules of the game ... You create the whole scenario!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This entry in the Repton series was unusual in that it is primarily a level editor. This went much further than the editor included in Repton 3 which only allowed changes to graphics and level layout. Infinity allowed entirely different types of games to be created through the use of a sophisticated programming language Reptol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infinity is made up of four programs:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Land Scape - The Level Designer&lt;br/&gt;Blue Print - The Game Creator&lt;br/&gt;Film Strip - The Character Designer&lt;br/&gt;File Link - The Linker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infinity comes with four example games built with the tool:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Repton 3 - Take 2' - This is a remake of Repton 3 using the Repton Infinity tool. The most substantial difference from the original is the removal of the time limit for each level.&lt;br/&gt;'Repton 4' - A new game in the Repton series featuring new objects and puzzles. &lt;br/&gt;'Robbo' - A puzzle game where the user plays a robot placed in a &amp;quot;time-space puzzle vortex&amp;quot;. The object is to collect flashing orbs and solve other puzzles for bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;'Trakker' - As a driver for &amp;quot;J.A.F.F.A.&amp;quot; - the &amp;quot;Jagga Annihilation and Fruit Flinging Associates&amp;quot; your responsibility is to dispose of all the Hideous Jaggas and other pests that have invaded the land. In this game the user drives a bulldozer and uses dynamite and &amp;quot;top-of-the-range Killafruit&amp;quot; to clear each screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only Repton 3 received a standalone release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Authors: David Lawrence &amp;amp; David Acton&lt;br/&gt;Game Screens: Matthew Atkinson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
