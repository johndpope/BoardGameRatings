			<description>The players collect cuddly toys to present on their shelves. The first player to fill his or her shelf (a separate board for each player) completely is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;The main board represents the stores and is covered with face-down toy cards. Players roll a die and move through the stores accordingly (in any direction). Then they have a look at the card on the store they reached - if they want to buy it, they pay one Mark and put the card in front of them (not on their shelf yet!) and refill the store with a new card; if not, they put it back. Once in a while they should go to their home base to put the collected animals on their shelf, because the die also contains a side marked &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;: A player rolling a B loses all the toys in front of him/her (but not those in their shelves); these are then put into a large toy box. A player who rolls a B without having any cards in front of him/her, gets all the toys from the box. There are some special cards which can be found in the stores; these give the players extra money or buying options. Players reaching the same store are also allowed to trade cards as they see fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
