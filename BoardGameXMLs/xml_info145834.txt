			<description>&amp;ldquo;Great stir in camp this evening. General Lyon has issued an order that this night shall decide the fate of Southern Missouri&amp;hellip;We are going to march on them tonight.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;--August 9th, 1861 Diary entry by William Branson, Iowan of the Muscatine Volunteer Infantry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will gladly give up my life for victory.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;--General Nathaniel Lyon, around 1:00 AM, August 10th, 1861.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Monstrous Fuss is a simulation of the battle fought on August 10th, 1861 at Wilson&amp;rsquo;s Creek between the Union Army under General Nathaniel Lyon and the Confederate forces led by Generals Benjamin Mcculloch and Sterling Price.  The Union force, badly outnumbered, launched a bold attack that caught the Rebels still encamped. Both sides armies&amp;rsquo; were made up of militia and volunteers who were in combat for the first time. The intensity and casualties sustained in this day&amp;rsquo;s battle surprised many of the officers and further reinforced that this Civil War would not be settled quickly or cheaply. Can you do better?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrain scale is about 250 yards per hex, while the infantry and cavalry units are mostly regiments, artillery units are batteries of 4-6 guns. Each turn is about 30 minutes.  Each strength point represents 250 men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each copy of A Monstrous Fuss is composed of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Four 11 by 17 inch map sections&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    280 single-sided, unmounted counters&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    1 Player&amp;rsquo;s Aid Sheet&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    2 Order Roster Sheets&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    One set of rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Players will have to supply one ten sided die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
