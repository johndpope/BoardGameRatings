			<description>Portfolio is a card game designed to capture the ebb and flow of trading on the stock market condensed into 45 minutes. You'll buy and sell shares of public companies, represented by the cards, based on your limited knowledge of the upcoming trends of the four market sectors. After 9 to 12 rounds, the game ends and the player with the most valuable portfolio wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the game begins, players will secretly contribute cards to a market deck, which governs how well the four sectors of stocks perform in each round. Players will thus have partial knowledge of how the markets will improve or degrade. Then they must fill the gaps in their knowledge by keenly observing how their opponents play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, he or she may buy stocks from their hand to add to their portfolio, sell stocks for some liquid cash, work to increase the value of a stock (by discarding similar stocks from hand), play a headline card to enact an event, or pass. They will want to be careful, though-- There are multiples of each stock card, and each card of a given company will gain and lose value identically throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So look out before adding value to your share in Manitoba Maple; your opponent may own a share in the same company and directly benefit from your action!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
