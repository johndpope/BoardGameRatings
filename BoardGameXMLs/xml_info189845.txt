							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Redneck Invasion</name>
									
			<description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all thought about it. What would we build if we could create our perfect city? The only problem is the hipsters, preppies, soccer parents, and rednecks all want in. In Redneck Invasion, you control one of these factions and compete for cultural influence over the town. Build businesses and cultural institutions, secure city council seats, and watch your pile of cash and cultural influence grow over time. Strike deals with other players to launch joint projects one moment, like a Trucker Hat Store for the Hipsters and Rednecks or Swimming Pool for the Preppies and the Soccer Parents. In the next moment, use event cards to send lawsuits and campaign attack ads to undermine your opponents&amp;rsquo; best laid plans. After all, only one group of invaders will end up with the city of their dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board has four sectors: Downtown, Midtown, Suburbs, and Boondocks. Buildings Downtown deliver greater returns, but they also cost more to build. Players build both Businesses and Cultural Institutions. You can choose to build alone or in conjunction with other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Businesses generate Cash, and Cultural Institutions generate Mojo. You'll need both to acquire City Council seats, which are how you get building permits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the way, you'll also acquire Event Cards that will help you build or upgrade your Businesses and Cultural Institutions, impair those of your opponents, or influence the City Council and Building Permits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the city's population reaches 1,000,000, the player with the most Mojo wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
