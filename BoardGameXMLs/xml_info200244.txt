							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Have You Seen the Yellow Sign?</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;La Vista Shopping Mall is a nightmarish paradise. Its shining walkways and elevators surround a dark central lake. Through gleaming windows, you glimpse impossible luxury and beautiful, happy people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet nothing here seems natural. The geometries seem wrong: how can this size 10 dress fit you, when you haven&amp;rsquo;t been to the gym in weeks? The mathematics seem strange: how can they sell three pairs of shoes for twenty dollars?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And, in every store, you see The Yellow Sign. Shaped like a starfish, with a central smiling face, it dances in the periphery of your vision. It signifies something of immense portent: the best quality, for the best prices, for one weekend only!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, that is worth investigating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game does not require a game master, but can be played differently by utilizing one (the rules offer this option).  The game uses d6 pools of specific colors; if those colors are not available others could be substituted (but color is significant).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
