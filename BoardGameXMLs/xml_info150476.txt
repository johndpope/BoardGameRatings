			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though the Order&amp;rsquo;s strength is greatest in northern Europe, its power and influence stretch far beyond the walls of the Mont St. Michel and the borders of France. Across the Holy Roman Empire and the kingdoms of the Mediterranean it maintains priories from which its members may pursue their struggle against the enemies of Christendom. Beyond these, in storied Egypt and mysterious Cyprus, lone outposts guard against the depredations of sorcery and blasphemies of the infidel, for monsters in the night never sleep, and there are but few who can stand against them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sanctuaries is a supplement that outlines four of the Order&amp;rsquo;s outposts to which guardian priests might travel in pursuit of a mission &amp;ndash; or fall back to in times of need. Each is unique, offering the chance to encounter new supernatural threats and explore an unfamiliar region and culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All four sections are packed with information that Games Masters and players alike can use to enrich their Deus Vult campaign. This includes new creatures, equipment and Preternatural Gifts, information on the local history, inhabitants and culture, and two complete adventures that explore the unique mythology of the local region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take up your sword, your shield, and your crucifix, and march grimly into the night&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
