							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gearmageddon: The Turbo-Charged Vehicle Combat Game</name>
									
			<description>In Gearmageddon players represent drivers in the arenas of death established by the wealthiest princes of Dubai. Each running cars through a series of moves, shooting attacks, ramming actions, and special maneuvers, the players struggle to be the best of the best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- Description from the back cover of the Gearmageddon Core Rules Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gearmageddon was designed to be a game, plain and simple. We wanted to make something fast and fun that could be played within a hour to an hour-and-a-half with minimal brainwave expenditure. Gearmageddon is kind of a zero-calorie asphalt death match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- From the Introduction of the Gearmageddon Core Rules Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Gearmageddon, there are three basic actions: move, shoot, and ram. Movement is determined by a player setting the speed of a vehicle and selecting maneuvers. Combat is performed using a target number system. Collision damage is calculated based on speeds and structures of vehicles. Driver Cards provide opportunities for rule-breaking events that can instantly change the tide of battle. Weapon and Upgrade Cards are used for quick reference during games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to rules for arena combat, Gearmageddon has rules for combat races based on the 2008 movie Death Race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Core Rules includes rules for cars, motorcycles and tractor-trailers. Gearmageddon was designed to be used with 1/64 scale vehicle miniatures and 3D components. The game's simple rule of erring on the side of a rules decision that causes maximum damage accelerates gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2011, Exploding Goat Games, LLC started the Worldwide Arena Series, a tournament that ranks Gearmageddon players according to their performance in each game played. Standings are posted weekly on the Exploding Goat Games, LLC Web site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
