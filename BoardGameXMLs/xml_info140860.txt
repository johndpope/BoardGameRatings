			<description>This game is one of a series of games which uses a dreidel in lieu of a d4 and is themed for the Jewish holiday of Pesach or Passover. Each move taken and resource cards added to or taken from a common pool for any spin are related to the traditional Dreidel game. Movement can be modified by use of desert cards. That movement is round the six points of a star or magen David, and an action is associated with each space on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time a player completes a cycle round the board, a plague is turned over which  restricts actions in the game, and the game lasts until all ten plagues-- based on the traditional Jewish view of the plagues described in Shemot or Exodus-- have been played out. During the coarse of the game, players free slaves, but they also have to make matza with which to feed the freed slaves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player at the end of the gave who has the most freed slaves who also have a corresponding matza.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
