			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;What can you spot in ten seconds? Turn the timer over and try and memorise as many pictures and words as you can. After ten seconds, pass the card to another player who asks a quick-fire question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History How many things can you spot in ten seconds? Turn the timer over and try to memorise as many of the pictures and words appearing on the beautifully-illustrated cards. After ten seconds, turn the card over, roll the die and answer a quick-fire question to win the card. The player with the most cards after 10 minutes wins. A fun way to learn history, from Stonehenge to the Channel Tunnel. Age 8 and above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
