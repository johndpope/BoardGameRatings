			<description>pblisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: You open the large double door to see that the room beyond houses some kind of shrine. There are the rotting remains of offerings on the floor in frount of the statue of a beautiful woman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: I search the room for any clues as to who this goddess might be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It happens to every game master - the players are exploring a ruin and find a temple or are facing down a clut. Suddenly, you are in need of a new god or goddess for your world. Well, never fear - your friends here at Healing Fireball have just the thing to help solve your deific woes with our latest offering in our Two Bit Tables line. Within its pages you will find a collection of tables to allow you to quickly generate a variety of distinct gods and goddesses. From tables for the most powerful major gods to tables for the many minor and trivial godds - they are all here at your disposal. So never be lost for a suitable deity again, and it's only a mere $0.50.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
