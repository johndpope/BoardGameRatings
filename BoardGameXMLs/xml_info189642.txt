			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thomas Kern was everyone&amp;rsquo;s best friend. Handsome. Likeable. Honest. Generous. All-American everything. He had that perfect face and deportment that everyone wished for. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t know him, he&amp;rsquo;d be your best friend 15 minutes after meeting him. But Thomas Kern is dead now. Buried somewhere in the woods, he was killed by his roommates and left under a mound of dirt. No one will ever find him. Not unless they know where to look&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What would drive a group of friends to murder their roommate? What led to this tragic conclusion that no other resolution was possible? And what will happen now that the guilt of the most horrendous crime starts to weigh on those responsible?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Protocol One-Sheet Series do not include rules, only charts. Each game requires players to own at least one game in the Protocol series, or Protocol Prime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
