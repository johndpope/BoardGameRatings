			<description>Inspired by the classic scene from Pulp Fiction, Say What Again is a push your luck card game where the dealer asks the players their name. If they answer &amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; they get a card. Players want to avoid face cards and bank their cards before it's too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually the dealer may ask them to &amp;quot;Say What Again&amp;quot; to raise the stakes a little bit. The player will get more cards, but if they bust, the dealer gets the cards and will score the points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played until all players have been the dealer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
