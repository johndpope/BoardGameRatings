			<description>This game is played with a standard deck of cards. With four players, the game consist of four deals, but cards are actually dealt only at the beginning. After each round players have 13 cards and use them in the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tricks are played and the highest card in the suit led wins; the value of the trick is the smallest card in that suit. However, winner of the trick can either keep it, or give it to anyone else. Everybode can get at most three tricks, this way they have 12 cards after 12 tricks. The winner of the last trick scores for it, but every player keeps the last card. Then a new round starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player leads the first trick once in the four round. However, a game ends in an earlier &amp;quot;sudden death&amp;quot; win if one side has reached 60 at the end of the first hand, 120 at the end of the second, or 180 at the end of the third.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
