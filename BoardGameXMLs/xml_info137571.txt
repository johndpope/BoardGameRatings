			<description>Do you learn the Dutch language? Spelling has no secrets for you anymore? Whether you are a player who just have to have the tactical moves? 'Quartaal' is a tactical language game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Quartaal' is a language game that can be played on multiple levels. On every question card are questions from different levels (level 2nd to 6th grade). Players get at the beginning of the game one or more game cards, depending on the number of game boards that they play. It can be played with 1 game board for the first time, making the game easier, but it can be extended to 4 game boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to complete their tasks as well as possible to earn points. They answer every 'language-question' which is asked by another player and earn blocks. These blocks must be placed on a game board. It is important to play tactically, score many points and make opponents to lose points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is very well organized. By using multiple game boards, the game becomes harder and more tactical. Unfortunately, there are few (60) double-sided question cards for the second through the sixth grade. Although they are printed on both sides, but it still gives only 120 orders per year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
