			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever wondered what kinds of adventures the characters in a console or computer RPG have once the game is over?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Console is a game that lets you play out the adventures of characters based on some of the more popular RPGs from the Sony PlayStation, Nintendo and SNES, and Sega Genesis. It has been inspired partly by those games and partly by the web-comics based on them. With two such different influences (the serious games and their silly parodies), you&amp;rsquo;ll find Console to have a very tongue-in-cheek style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Console is not the first of its kind - the first real, organized effort at a console-based tabletop RPG was the FFRPG (and now its descendant, the Returner FFRPG, currently working on their 3rd edition). Our only connection to them is our source material. However, they deserve recognition for leading the way and for generating such an immense amount of material. It&amp;rsquo;s not easy to write that much!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
