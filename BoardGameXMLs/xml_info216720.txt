			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You know what they say about the best-laid plans&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adventure Havens series of gaming supplements provides game masters and storytellers with a collection of ready-made NPCs and associated locations that can be used to flesh out your current campaign setting or simply fill in the gaps when the players decide to go off in an unintended direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Havens: Apothecaries and Alchemists, seeks to provide a versatile collection of apothecary shops that can be used in almost any fantasy setting. Each of the twelve shops highlighted in this supplement provide an interesting collection of NPCs with fully-developed backstories and story seeds to add depth and flavor to your campaign. Like all of the Adventure Haven supplements, the NPCs are all creating using standard races and monsters that should easily fit into any fantasy setting without worrying about game balance or breaking immersion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides presenting over 50 NPCs from level 1 through 18 and 12 unique shops, this supplement also includes an expanded list of alchemy items to make the Craft (Alchemy) skill more versatile, expanded rules for the Heal skill to include performing Heroic Surgery and Reconstructive Surgery, new rules for crafting custom poisons, patent medicines, medicinal teas, and more. Finally, apothecary shops can serve a genuine purpose in your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
