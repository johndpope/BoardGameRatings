			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine this: You're a juggler. You've practiced long and hard to become a very good juggler. You can juggle rubber balls, fragile plates, even razor-sharp daggers. Now you're ready for the ultimate test--the Fireball Competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The situation: You've done well in the early matches of the International Tournament of Jugglers. Most of the competitors have been eliminated. You've survived. Now it's down to the final event: the Fireball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your objective: Catch the blazing Fireball and hurl it back at the wall of blocks. Rack up points by smashing blocks and clearing the screen. And prove your skill as a juggler by keeping a number of Fireballs in the air. First one, then two, three, four...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have five tries, just in case the Fireball becomes a little too hot to handle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
