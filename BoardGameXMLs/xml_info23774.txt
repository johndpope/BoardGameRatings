			<description>IDEAL's treatment of tic-tac-toe enclosed in a large 18&amp;quot; square box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The large plastic gameboard consists of four gently sloping ramps which extend upward from each side of a tic-tac-toe grid.  There is a circular hole in the center of each grid segment to accept players' discs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given eight plastic discs of their chosen color and a device to release the discs (basically a circular piece of plastic with a raised slit) down their particular ramp.  A turn consists of aiming a disc and releasing it down the ramp.  Discs that fail to come to rest completely within a hole are removed from the board and used later if required.  Only the top disc showing in any given hole counts in gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to land three of their discs in holes so that they form a straight row in any direction is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
