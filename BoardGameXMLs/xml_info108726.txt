			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;TV Action developed out of my desire to run a game that explicitly replicated the structure of a television show but had a traditional player-GM structure. Previous experience in a long-running game, &amp;ldquo;Slayers East&amp;rdquo;, had shown that this was no simple task. The television format and the player-GM structure continually pulled against each other, often in unexpected ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TV Action is a hack of the Time Lord rules system by Ian Marsh, available free of charge at a number on online locations. The engine is souped up by ideas from all over, particularly Screen Presence (from Matt Wilson&amp;rsquo;s Primetime Adventures) and Kickers (from Ron Edwards&amp;rsquo; Sorcerer).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
