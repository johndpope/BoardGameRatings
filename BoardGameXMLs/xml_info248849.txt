							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rex Ib√©ricus</name>
									
			<description>During the Middle Ages (711-1492) Spain was divided into several kingdoms, Christians (in the North) and Muslims (in the South). For almost eight centuries, these two cultures went through periods of war and peace, intolerance and coexistence, and the fragile alliances between one kingdom and another changed overnight depending on the political interests of each sovereign. (Christians against Muslims, Christians against Christians, Muslims against Muslims), with the Jews as an economic force acting as a hinge. Likewise, foreign powers such as the Papacy or the Caliphate also played their cards in the peninsular war. In &amp;quot;Rex Ib&amp;eacute;ricus&amp;quot; you will have to take control of one of the main six medieval Iberian kingdoms: three Christians (Castilla, Navarra and Arag&amp;oacute;n) and three Muslims (C&amp;oacute;rdoba, Granada and Murcia). Through political intrigue, diplomacy and war, as well as economic and cultural development, you must fight to get your kingdom to become the most powerful in the Peninsula, and to be named &amp;quot;Rex Ib&amp;eacute;ricus&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do this, you will have the opportunity to occupy villages, castles and walled cities, and then build farms, palaces, churches, mosques, synagogues, lighthouses, libraries and astronomical observatories, which will enhance your kingdom. Equally, you must recruit armies and build fleets to defend yourself from your dangerous neighbors, and in no case you could afford to neglect the basic food needs of your subjects, since you could face brutal peasant revolts with unpredictable consequences. You must also ensure the defense of your coasts, since the fearsome Viking warriors could disembark in them and wipe out all the riches of your prosperous State. To help you face such challenges, you will have four historical leaders from each kingdom (Isabel, Fernando, El Cid, Sancho, Abderraman, Boabdil, El Rey Lobo ...), each one of them with special skills depending on the position you asignes (king, counselor, ambassador, emir, vizier ...), and you can also use them to seal alliances with other kingdoms through marriage links, which will make you join forces to protect yourself from more warlike third parties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the same way, using your political influence and the support of your allies, you will have the opportunity to reach the top of the Iberian Court (common to all peninsular kingdoms), which will allow you to control powerful elite units. Neither should you belittle the power of the conspiracy, which will allow you to conduct espionage missions, instigate internal revolts and even murder rival monarchs. Finally, you can undertake exciting sea trips to the East (Rome, Baghdad, Jerusalem, China ...) in search of external support to implement your political structures and deal with your enemies, although long journeys will never be free of danger. Are you ready to travel to the Middle Ages and enter an exciting world of castles, swords, religious conflicts and palace conjuring?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
