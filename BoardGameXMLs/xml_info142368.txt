			<description>Regati is a sailing race game...a board game of skill, luck and strategy. Up to 10 players can all race a ship against each other around the board. Line up ready for the start, cross the starting line, sail around the buoys and Windy Point, to be the first to cross the finishing line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, you can only sail a maximum speed according to the wind direction, and the wind direction changes...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each move, you either move your ship OR you decide to change the wind direction. A wind direction change affects all players equally...and it may even result in a play direction switch. Sailing moves have realistic speeds, with six points of sail to the wind. So, for example, reaching across the wind is your fastest course, as is tacking to take you upwind. Your ship may block other ships...and watch out for the wind shadows from other ships or from the land! A person at the back of the race can influence all other ships by changing the wind direction. It is seldom the case that the first person around the first buoy stays in front...tactical sailing is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also sail as teams, whereby your tactics are determined with other sailors in mind. You can also organise a regatta (multiple sail races), so the best sailor of a few races is the winner. The point scoring method for these are described in the instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
