			<description>A two player game played on an 18x24 board. Players each place two 2x6&amp;quot;mountains&amp;quot; on the board and then each place 54 soldiers(25mm plastic figures) on the 3 rows nearest them. Each player secretly selects a restricted set of 5 squares on his opponents rear row. &lt;br/&gt;  The winner is the first player to get his own soldiers on all five of these squares.&lt;br/&gt; On his turn a plyer takes a card and follows its instructions. He then rolls two dice, one die number represents the number of units he will move and the other die represnts the number of squares units move. He then moves his units and executes capture by replacement, some decided by die roll.&lt;br/&gt; As far as I can tell all the &amp;quot;Action&amp;quot; A-Toys are the same game on the same board but with different figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
