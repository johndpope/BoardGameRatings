			<description>DungeonRaid is a new fantasy deck-building game designed to capture the charm and atmosphere of the console RPGs of days long gone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with a small card draft to determine starting equipment. Then, in a classic Deck-building fashion, players purchase weapons, armor, and spells in turn and use them to fight monsters and bosses; all of which come into the supply randomly. Used equipment cycles back through the deck as it needs to be repaired and the player's goal is to collect the most wealth from the Dungeon while at the same time trying not to be the first to get killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Staged&amp;quot; levels of difficulty increase the challenge at regular intervals and also introduce improved Treasure to the supply. This aspect also makes the game highly expandable, and gives it immense replay value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Tentatively) Recommended for 2-5 players, but solitaire play will be an option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[This game is still in development, and development is currently on hold. Release date is yet unknown.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
