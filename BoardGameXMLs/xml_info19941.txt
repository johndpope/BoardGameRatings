			<description>A Lamb Between Two Lions is a game for 2-6 players that attempts to represent some of the action of Buzkashi games held at festivals in northern Afghanistan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In summary, the sport of Buzkashi involves skilled horsemen who attempt to pick up a carcass (called the Boz) from the ground and then ride free of the other horsemen without allowing the Boz be taken away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: A circular board (made up of concentric circles which are in turn divided into rectangles to form the spaces); six playing pieces for each player (consisting of four attendants, one Chapandazan - a champion Buzkashi rider, and one Khan - the Chapandazan's sponsor); a pair of six-sided dice for each player; and a supply of poker chips or other markers used to track each player's score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to move your Chapadazan to the Boz to take possession of it (grabbing it away from another Chapadazan if necessary) and get free from the rest of the riders or move off the playing board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was an entry in the 2005 Buzkashi Game Design Contest held here on BoardGameGeek.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
