							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Die verr√ºckte Acht</name>
									
			<description>Each player has a set of 4 meeples that start in his or her corner of the board. The goal is to move the meeples around the board to the &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; section. Movement is controlled by a die. All players may capture each others meeples. Captured meeples are returned to their player's corner and must start their journey over. The winner is the first player to move all meeples &amp;quot;home&amp;quot;. Since the board is outlayed like an &amp;quot;8&amp;quot;, the middle space is the most dangerous!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a variant of Pachisi and was published in the 1930s or 1940s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
