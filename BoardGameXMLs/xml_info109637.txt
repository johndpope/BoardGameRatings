			<description>subtitled:&lt;br/&gt;Rules For The Least Obscure Fantasy Roleplaying Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;excerpted from the Foreword:&lt;br/&gt;This is the culmination of at least half a dozen abortive attempts to rewrite the original and most popular set of fantasy roleplaying game rules. It attempts to remain true to the core principles of the original design while modernizing and imposing some structure on them...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are simple enough to please those interested in story and narrative, direct enough to be played like a board game, tactical enough to please those interested in strategic challenges, and focused enough to please those who are unfamiliar with roleplaying games...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is, if you will, the kernel of the rules rather than a particularly basic or introductory set. It is intended as a structure on which to implement optional rules and house rules...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This entire document is open source material and freely available for whatever use you&lt;br/&gt;may wish to put it, so long as the author and illustrator is credited as such.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
