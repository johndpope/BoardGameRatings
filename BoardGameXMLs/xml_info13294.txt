			<description>Based on the 1976-77 game show, the twenty cards for the game are numbered and placed on the board in a five-by-four grid. The player wins cards by choosing the right answer and avoiding the bluff. A player wins by winning any three matching prizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During each game, two players compete while one acts as game master. The players play three games, and whoever has the most money after those games wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
