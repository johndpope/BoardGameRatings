			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;elebrate Halloween all year long with this latest installment for Mystical: Kingdom of Monsters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year, the people of the Kingdom of Monsters hold a seven day celebration known as Haunted Eve. During this holiday, children in every city and town dress up as heroes, villains, and monsters as they travel to the homes of friends and family seeking candy and small toys. Meanwhile, monster trainers converge on the Scribe&amp;rsquo;s Marsh in search of rare monsters that only appear when the land dries up during the celebration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Haunted Eve Monsters Only Pack is a collection of monsters found during the holiday for trainers to capture. 22 brand new monsters are joined by 20 higher and lower level versions of existing monsters and 2 new templates to bring a little more spooky variety to your character. Each of these monsters boasts a list of spells only available to those captured during the holiday or modified with the help of a monster breeder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So join your fellow trainers in the Scribe&amp;rsquo;s Marsh for some holiday fun with the tricks and treats presented here. Happy Hunting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
