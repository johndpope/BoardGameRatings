Each player takes five cards each. Roll the dice to see who starts.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting player rolls the dice and depending on the outcome the serve is aimed at the forehand or backhand of the other player, or even an ace. Then it is up to the other player to return the ball by using a card from the hand which matches the forehand or backhand serve and lay it down on the table. Then the server plays a card to match the returning ball the same way.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played this way until no player has a card on hand that can return the ball.&lt;br/&gt;For each card a player lays down the player draws a new card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;63 Cards&lt;br/&gt;1 d10&lt;br/&gt;1 Scoringprotocol&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
