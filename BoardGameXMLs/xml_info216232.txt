			<description>In this cooperative game, one player will play the role of Braincat, while the rest of the players will be her potential Family. Braincat will try to make the Family guess its &amp;quot;Mystery-Card&amp;quot;, at least 2 times on 3 possible rounds.&lt;br/&gt;Braincat will initially draw 5 cards, the first one will be its Mystery-Cards and others are wild good chases. The Mystery-Card and the 4 wild good chases are Braincat's &amp;quot;Mastercards&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;The Family goal is to retrieve the 4 wild good chase without eliminating the Mystery-Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the game starts, 2 random Mastercards will be revealed, as well as 2 random hint cards. &lt;br/&gt;Braincat will use its foot to indicate the most relevant hint between the 2 hints. Afterwards, the Family will have to eliminate one of the 2 Mastercards or asking a new hint with another foot.&lt;br/&gt;Each time Family asks a new hint, the new one is put next another one, and Braincat must compare the last 2 hints on table, and choose the more relevant relative to its Mystery-Card.&lt;br/&gt;But Braincat can only play 4 foot on 1 round, and 10 foot for the 3 rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If Family eliminate the Mystery-Card, the game is lost for everyone. Otherwise, 1 new Mastercard is revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features several themed decks with 60 cards each, &amp;quot;dive bar philosophy&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;jobs and small villages&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Dating classified&amp;quot;, ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
