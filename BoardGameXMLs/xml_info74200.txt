							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Phantasia Zoologica I: Dogs</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dogs are more than just pets. They can serve as hunters, guards, warriors, and mounts. They have personalities all their own, from stoic and proud to bouncy and affectionate. Above all, they are loyal companions to their masters, and the relationship between a man and his dog can easily rival the feelings he has for his closest friend among his own race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If dogs are so important, why would one want to gloss over the details of their stats, their temperament, or their appearance? Wouldn't you want to describe a dog in as much detail as you would a player character or an NPC?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Phantasia Zoologica I: Dogs, you can do just that. Inside you'll find 40 new dog breeds - including 3 undead varieties - to be used as friends or foes. Full stat blocks are provided for each breed, along with appearance, their history, what they do best (hunt, guard, herd, etc.), and their disposition. There is also a selection of new equipment especially for dogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Give that puppy all the love she deserves with Phantasia Zoologica I: Dogs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introducing 40 new types of dog, including 37 mundane and magical breeds and three undead varieties! Also includes new equipment and magic items for dogs, price lists for buying or selling, and information on using the new dogs as familiars or animal companions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     37 new mundane and magical breeds of dogs!&lt;br/&gt;     3 new types of undead dogs!&lt;br/&gt;     New equipment and magic items for dogs!&lt;br/&gt;     Dogs as familiars or animal companions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
