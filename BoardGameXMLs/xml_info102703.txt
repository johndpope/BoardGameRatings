			<description>Dexterity game for two (or more) players. The board is a kind of &amp;quot;uneven hexagon&amp;quot;, with goal zones at two ends. Each player holds a &amp;quot;shooter&amp;quot;, a small wooden device that holds marbles with a magnet. The marbles can be shot out to hit a wooden disk - the goal of the game is to edge the disk into the opponent's goal zone. Play proceeds simultaneously, there is no turn order. The first player to score an agreed number of goals is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(user summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
