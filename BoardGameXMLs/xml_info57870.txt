							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Realms of Norrath: Dagnor&#039;s Cauldron</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Greatest Mortal Wizard is Mortal No More!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proud Erudite wizard Al'Kabor admits no mortal to be his equal in the ways of spellcraft and magical power. Though few would dare dissent from Al'Kabor's opinion, there are those who whisper behind his back that his claim may be true, but only because the one who was the greatest of mortal wizards is no longer mortal. The conflict &amp;mdash; some say, contest &amp;mdash; between the Erudites and the kedge is legend, but the battle has died down since the great kedge sorcerer Phinigel Autropos was trapped in his underwater keep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or, rather, it's believed he's trapped. If he isn't, as some suggest, might not his designs for the surface world begin in the lands surrounding his home, in the wilderness near Dagnor's Cauldron?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;100% compatible with 3.5 edition Fantasy role-playing rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook details the past and present of this dynamic region, which saw the birth of three races (elves, dwarves, and kedge) and the near-annihilation of two of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dwarven city of Kaladim and much of western Faydwer are described in detail herein, as well as two complete locations for adventures: the haunted Estate of Unrest, where the undead battle one another for the right to leave those accursed lands; and the home of the last of the kedge, Phinigel Autropos &amp;mdash; Kedge Keep itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
