							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Traveller: Psionics Institutes</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The official Traveller setting has two basic approaches to psionic powers: the Third Imperium and its allied client states officially suppress them, but secretly support psionic training institutes and the undercover use of psions. The Zhodani Consulate and its allied clients embrace psi powers, and promote psions to the highest levels of their government. Psionics Institutes enables Traveller players and gamemasters to explore both approaches in their games, in greater detail than ever before. The book covers the institutes and types of institutional training available in both the Consulate and Imperium, as well as character templates and character creation information. It gives several sample institutes, as well as psi-using corporations, mercenary units, and psi-friendly societies, worlds, and government agencies.&lt;br/&gt;Underground pro-psi societies (both within and outside the Imperium) are detailed. Using Psionics Institutes, players and game masters can add a sixth sense to their campaign.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
