			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;May you live in interesting times&amp;quot; is a paraphrasing of an ancient curse. Unfortunately it seems to hold more weight in the modern age than ever. Over the last few decades, countries have fallen and economies collapsed. Multiple disasters, both natural and man-made, rocked the very foundation of numerous societies. Cowards of all sorts try to impose their beliefs on others through terror and intimidation. These things and more have left the average citizen wondering how safe and secure they really are at any given moment. In some cases, this has led many to shore up their defenses in the quest for peace of mind. The problem with this lies in the delicate balancing act of freedom versus safety. When exactly does the need for security begin to trample over liberty?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was the root of the problem that initially faced the humble inhabitants of the small German town, Wolfsheim. This town long ago sold its independence to an iron-fisted tyrant in exchange for his horrific protection. Wolfsheim literally traded one evil for another, one that had disguised itself behind a veneer of civility and order. This town has become a tragic example of a population giving into those fears and of the price they must pay for doing so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Wolfsheim, the citizens are literally caught in the middle of a supernatural turf war between the fae monsters known as goblins and the Titan-serving werewolves of one Werner Krieger (originally seen in Scion: Demigod, pp. 288-289, though he is reprinted within for convenience). For untold years the citizens were forced by the goblins to participate in a yearly ritual, a macabre version of trick or treat called Kindernacht. When Werner Krieger came to the town&amp;rsquo;s mayor with the promise to end the goblin&amp;rsquo;s reign of terror in exchange for exclusive mining and industrial rights to the rich ore deposits nearby, it seemed the perfect solution. What the mayor (or the townsfolk) did not expect was to be dealing with yet another supernatural threat in the form of werewolves. The werewolves partially upheld their promise, only to steal the Kindernacht ritual and twist it into a yearly hunt of the children of Wolfsheim. Now the two inhuman forces fight each other for control of the town and its people, not caring who gets in their way. The story of Wolfsheim can be utilized as a side adventure in a long-running cycle, or as a stand-alone undertaking that can easily be modified from a modern setting to a WWII-era period piece (as detailed in &amp;quot;The World at War&amp;quot; section of the Scion Companion).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
