			<description>Unnatural Selections&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight or flight: the choice is yours! This month's issue of Pyramid -- the PDF magazine for roleplayers -- is devoted to monsters . . . as well as those who fight them. Our creature features are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Inhuman Options,&amp;quot; an expansion for GURPS Monster Hunters that adds templates and possibilities for inhuman heroes. Written by that series' architect, Jason &amp;quot;PK&amp;quot; Levine, these four templates are well-suited for any campaign that would welcome PC ghosts, changelings, and more.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;The Sad Lost God,&amp;quot; by GURPS Locations: Hellsgate author Matt Riggsby. Discover what a fallen deity will do to regain the followers he needs to rise once again. It includes GURPS stats for the titular titan.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Zombie Predators,&amp;quot; perhaps the most flavorful Eidetic Memory offering we've ever received, from GURPS Fourth Edition co-author David Pulver. What don't &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; want you to know about contrails, public-water fluoridation, and other secrets -- and how do those plans fit in with an attempt to stop a zombie apocalypse? It includes sinister GURPS stats for something innocuously named a &amp;quot;mutant necrophage.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Half Alive,&amp;quot; a look at one man's intersection of horror and tragedy. Written by Michele Armellini (author of GURPS WWII: Grim Legions), this GURPS creature is suitable for any fantastic setting where magic can go terribly wrong.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;The Formation,&amp;quot; a systemless article that describes a most unusual breed of crystalline parasite from outer space. It includes ideas for using them in a modern horror, atomic horror, steampunk, or fantasy setting.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;The Wild Hunt,&amp;quot; a look at the forces of the dark fae. Especially suitable for a Monster Hunters campaign (and building on the foundation of this issue's &amp;quot;Inhuman Options&amp;quot;), these timeless terrors are also suitable for any GURPS campaign where ogres, unseelie, and more can terrorize young and old alike.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;A Corrupt System,&amp;quot; a most unusual threat that may cause the world to end without the heroes even being aware of it. This systemless threat is suitable for any modern setting -- especially those where the heroes need to find the truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue also includes Steven Marsh's look at how to tweak the quantity and quality of evil, plus some Odds and Ends that don't fit elsewhere. Knowledge is power; with this month's Pyramid you'll confront your fears like never before!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
