			<description>Plunder! is a fast-paced card game with a lot of &amp;quot;take that&amp;quot; action. Your goal is to steal treasures and pirate crew members from your fellow pirates by playing cards to attack other players and to defend yourself from attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a simple card-playing mechanic at its core, but outside of your turn you can play reaction cards. These influence cards played by other players. Play them at the right time, so you can benefit from the other pirates' actions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
