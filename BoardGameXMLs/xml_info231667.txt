			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The local dog shelter has too many animals on hand due to a puppy explosion, and many of these are puppies which require treatment for various health issues. You take on the role of a veterinarian, and your goal is to cure the most puppies of the most maladies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to amass the most victory points (VPs) by curing puppies, which appear at the start of and during the game. Each puppy will have a certain number of (fixed and random) maladies and a VP rating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have a hand of cards which are used to cure the puppies' ailments. At the start of a player's turn s/he draws a card and may cure a puppy if willing and able to do so, taking the card and its VPs. A card may need to be discarded into a face-up discard pile, from which the next player may draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few special cards offer unique choices to the lucky player who draws one. The game plays quickly, has surprisingly tough choices, and can end in three ways. The vet with the most VPs wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN COMING SOON!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
