			<description>They looked for love and understanding. We had none. They asked for mutual benefit. We didn&amp;rsquo;t plan to share. Now they&amp;rsquo;re trying to take back their solar system. You won&amp;rsquo;t let them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harvest: Massive Encounter is an award-winning real-time strategy game for Mac OS X and Windows with battles of epic proportions and a unique style of resource management and exploration. In this 2D fantasy you take on the role as the base commander of a space colony far, far away, and must use five building types in a creative way to efficiently expand and defend it. Build power plants, mineral harvesters and defense towers and make sure they have sufficient energy to fend off endless hordes of evil aliens. The game offers a vast array of possible strategies with these simple rules, and will compel you to try new and better base designs every time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental gameplay action of Harvest: Massive Encounter is to place buildings that cost credits and energy. Credits are gained by harvesting minerals from mineral fields, and energy is produced by power plants. What makes the game unique and interesting is how you get the energy to the building that requires it. Energy moves from the power plants to other locations by jumping between energy links that you place, and you can improve the energy network by setting waypoints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You also need to build defenses. Lots of defenses! The aliens are out to get you! They must be stopped with Laser Towers, Missile Turrets and over-charged bombs that you place and power up with energy. The laser towers can be linked together to improve their range and damage, and the missile turrets can be upgraded for different purposes. These defenses are needed, because the aliens are equipped with ten distinct units, each that require different priorities and counter-measures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your objective is to try to stay alive for as long as possible. Compete on the extensive online high-score lists, form player groups that battle against other groups, or simply try to beat your own record on each of the game&amp;rsquo;s planets. With two scores to beat, three planets to explore and four high-score enabled game modes, you will have a lot to do!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
