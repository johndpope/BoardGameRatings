							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Corrotto</name>
									
			<description>Corrotto is a crime/politics themed market game played with a standard deck of cards. Separate the deck into 3 decks, the draw deck A/2/3/4, the Market Deck 5/6/7/8/9 and the board set up 10/Jokers/J/Q/K. Set up all KQJ10s in four rows of same suits placing Jokers on the tens and randomly draw four face up cards from the market deck below the tens. KQs are the Royal Council and the Jacks separate the council from the marketplace. The draw deck is where you legally earn money by drawing cards, the market deck gets drawn into the marketplace when cards are reserved or purchased. Purchase cards with cards of the same color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When cards are discarded or spent they go face up into the appropriate decks discard section where market cards become the black market and draw cards become heists. To do illegal actions such as purchasing from the Black Market or perform a heist you must bribe a face card by placing a card higher than previous card of the same suit on the card taking lower bribe into your hand. Anyone can bribe a Jack but you must pay off a Royal for there loyalty. Pay off Queens first which cost 25 Of its suit minus the Jack bribe, same for king but also minus the Queen bribe, place a player marker on Royal. Royal bribes are always scored as end points but the game ends and scores differently in ways of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 different variants of Corrotto: Ladies First, Hot Potato and Rat Race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
