			<description>Second compilation of ten games with three classics (f.e. Hangman) and seven other &amp;quot;unpublished&amp;quot; games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Boutamot:&lt;br/&gt;An original word game, where a coil is formed of words that begin with the end of the previous word. The more we make big words, the more we encroach on the previous word, the more you score points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tower &lt;br/&gt;Word game with anagrams. At first we wrote a letter, then two, then three and so on. There is a phase five letters and six letters in which he must find a new word, changing only one letter. The first player who can not find the next word loses the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snake Apple :&lt;br/&gt;Tactical game inspired by the game of the Worms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rides:&lt;br/&gt;Car race on a circuit of hexagons. As in car racing on paper, you can change gears at every turn respecting a + or - 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beach &lt;br/&gt;Mysterious interesting deduction game inspired by the naval battle. Five traps and three treasures are on a beach. We need to find the treasures in less than 100 blows. After each trip, the encoder indicates whether objects are nearby ... or if you jumped on a trap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
