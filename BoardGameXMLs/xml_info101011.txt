			<description>Solecismic Software's Flagship Sports Management Simulation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Publisher's Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sixth installment of our signature product, Front Office Football 2007, was released on October 27, 2006. It is only available through electronic download. Please visit our web store for a link to the order page. The most recent version is 6.4, released in October 2010 with the 2010 rosters and schedule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Front Office Football is designed to represent a snapshot of professional football as it exists under the current salary cap system. You play the role of the general manager of a team. In order to succeed in Front Office Football, you need to perform as well as possible in four different areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Performance. On the field, your primary goal is winning the coveted Front Office Bowl. Your fans, players and staff all want to see that championship banner raised to a new position in the ring of honor surrounding your stadium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Front Office Football&lt;br/&gt;    Financial Performance. Off the field, your team needs to show a profit, or the owner will become angry and threaten your job. You need to control salary and staff costs while balancing the need to spend money to build and upgrade your stadium against the risk of facing stagnant ticket revenue with an aging arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roster Value. You need to negotiate contracts, sign free agents, make wise decisions in the amateur draft and outsmart opposing general managers in trade. Building a strong, capable roster means everything in Front Office Football.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Franchise Value. The bottom line is that a happy owner has a franchise that's the envy of professional football. Nothing means more to the owners than seeing their franchise on the top of the list of most valuable franchises. You help put your team on that list by excelling in the three other categories, but the best general managers look for opportunities to move the team in order to find a home town with a strong economy that will support your team like none other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each season, Herb the Referee evaluates your performance in these four categories, and presents your grades on his chalkboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
