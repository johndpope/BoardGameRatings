			<description>In Time Dice, you represent an independent group bent on setting history right! You seed history with events and then correct those events for the betterment of humanity. But remember: time marches on and the future can be fickle! You must use your resources to change the past and protect the future while not causing too many paradoxes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to manipulate the past and present to secure objectives. Each game has 11 objectives you can satisfy. The player with the most satisfied objectives and fewest paradoxes creates the most stable timeline and is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over six rounds, each consisting of rolling five dice - keep four to use as your Alteration Values to change history and one to seed as your next event in the timeline. Be careful! The ripples caused by certain Alteration Values can affect more than just the present! Can you master the past to perfect the future and secure all of your objectives?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
