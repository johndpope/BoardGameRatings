							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Light Cutter</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 48 x 30 inch, two level, full color floorplan of a Light Cutter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It comes with Square, Hex and No Ovelays and includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Light Cutter is a redesign of The Raven Airship as a water ship model. The Light Cutter includes the remodeled upper deck for sea travel and a lower slave pen deck for transporting slaves recycled from The Raven Airship. By redesigning the upper deck with a lower page count and removing the lower cargo deck, this reduces the cost of a print on demand version of this product (which will be available after proofing). If you need a print on demand merchant ship with a cargo hold, River Barge can suit your needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Light Cutter is intended for use in blackpowder fantasy and pirate settings as it is armed with four cannons. The slave pen lower deck is used to transport slaves or criminals making it a target for pirates who may or may not know slaves are on board, figuring it to be a cargo vessel, liberators who believe in freedom for all men and pushed by conscience to act on their beliefs, or criminals trying to free their friends from the law.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cutting across the Ocean:  The light cutter is running slaves across the ocean in dangerous shipping lanes full of pirates. The group can be hired as guards on the ship who need to fend off these pirates. If they didn&amp;rsquo;t know the &amp;ldquo;cargo&amp;rdquo; was slaves they may even plan to mutiny against the merchant that hired them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When pirates attack the ship, the adventurers need to decide whether to abide by the contract they signed with the merchant and protect the ship or parley with the pirates and attempt to switch sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group could also be playing as the pirates instead, expecting a cargo hold full of trade goods and find out the &amp;ldquo;cargo&amp;rdquo; is slaves. They could also be liberators trying to free the slaves or criminals trying to bust their friends out of incarceration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the slaves are freed, they could be criminals who then try to take over the ship. They could play nice instead and be dropped off on shore by their liberators. Then the group hears rumors of escaped convicts committing atrocious crimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventurers may even be hired to investigate these crimes and then come face-to-face with the people that they freed, monsters that they let loose upon the world a second time. The criminals recognize them and tell them that they will let them go without harm, a favor for a past favor. The group can slink away or they can choose to put a stop to these criminals and return them to their original fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
