			<description>In this card game, based on the &amp;quot;Doug&amp;quot; TV show, players try to collect all six cards of the same color. Players are dealt 6 cards and must first bid for the color they want to collect by playing the lowest number color (character) card in their hand. If you don't have a lowest card in a suit you must wait until your next turn to try and claim a color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you draw cards to bring your hand to 6, and then either play a color card onto the table in front of you, or a special card onto the discard pile. Special cards allow you to look at another player's hand and/or steal cards from it, draw from the discard pile, or stop a player from stealing your own cards. The first player to collect one card of each number (1 through 6) in the same color has brought together Doug's circle of friends and wins. Rules for a simple matching game using the cards are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
