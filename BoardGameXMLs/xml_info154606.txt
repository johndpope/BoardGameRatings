			<description>On a magnetic game board, players in Space Station take turns building cities, stations and spaceships; invading the stations owned by opponents, and expanding their cities and stations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up, players place a predetermined number of their pieces on the game board, based on the number of players; pieces come in three sizes: cities (large), stations (medium) and spaceships (small). On a turn, you take one of the following actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Build a city, station or spaceship &amp;mdash; Take one of these tokens from your reserve and place it next to a friendly token of the same size or larger already on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Invade an opponent's city or station &amp;mdash; If one of your pieces touches an opponent's, you can place one of your smaller tokens on top of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Establish a spaceship base &amp;mdash; If you have a token on top of an opponent's city or station, you can place one of your spaceships next to this invaded piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Expand to a city or station &amp;mdash; If you have two spaceships or a spaceship and station close to one another, you can place one of your stations or cities so that it touches both of these pieces. You can expand with pieces that have invaded opponents, and if you're set up right, you can both expand and invade at the same time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players keep placing pieces until everyone has passed in turn because no space remains on the game board. Players score two points for each uninvaded station of their color on the game board, then lose one point for each station not placed. Whoever has the highest score wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
