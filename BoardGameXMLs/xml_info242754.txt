			<description>MADE IN USA!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;78 Cards: Poker size 2.5&amp;quot;X 3.5&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;300gsm Linen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Custom Tuck Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shrink Wrapped box and cards inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have ever played the game &amp;quot;PIT,&amp;quot; and you have ANY interest whatsoever in cryptocurrency, you will LOVE this game!  It is an adaptation of the well known game &amp;quot;Pit,&amp;quot; but instead of commodities like wheat, soybeans, corn... it uses the HOTTEST cryptos on the market!  Each card has must know facts about the coin itself and the game comes loaded with must know facts before investing.  Cryptocurrency is the biggest game changer since the invention of the internet, YET fewer than 1 in 4000 people even own a bitcoin!  Whether you are a serious investor or just want to have a fun time, this is the game for you!  Get ahead of the curve and have a blast!  Become familiar with crypto while playing the funnest game in your closet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bitcoin the Card Game is fun for ages 7+ and for 3-8 Players. Multiple decks can be used for larger groups! 78 cards per deck; 8 suits (coins) of 9 identical cards, a hacker card, a miner card, an instruction card, 2 must know bitcoin facts cards, and a future of bitcoin card.  Only the coins and the hacker and miner cards are used in game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the first crypto trader to score a total of 5000 points.  As soon as the dealer yells, &amp;quot;BITCOIN,&amp;quot; you become a crypto coin trader trying to &amp;quot;own the marker&amp;quot; of one of the following 8 coins: Bitcoin, Ethereal, Litecoin, Monero, Bitcoin Cash, NEM, Dash, or Coinye West.  You &amp;quot;own&amp;quot; that particular coin when you have in your hand all 9 cards of the same coin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SET UP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Select a dealer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Prepare a score sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Use one complete 9 card suit per each player in the game plus the hacker and miner cards.  Leave all other cards out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. The dealer shuffles the deck and deals out all the cards in play face down.  Each player should have 9 and the players with the miner and hacker cards should have 10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. Pick up the cards and arrange them by suit.  Don't let anyone else see them.  Decide which coin you want to own.  Hint: pick the coin you have the most of in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. When everyone has sorted their cards the dealer says, &amp;quot;Bitcoin&amp;quot; and the trading begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as the dealer said, &amp;quot;bitcoin!&amp;quot; everyone starts trading.  To trade, select 1-4 cards from your hand of the same suit that you do not want to own and say, &amp;quot;one! one!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;two! two!&amp;quot; depending on how many cards you want to trade.  You may trade with any opponent who is calling out the same number.  Sometimes a particular opponent will want to trade fewer cards than you do.  In this case you can lower your bid and trade the smaller number.  you CANNOT look at the cards you are trading for until the trade is complete, NOT can you reveal which cards you are trading.  It is a race to see who can collect all 9 the quickest.  The first player to call out the coin they have once they own the coin wins the number of points associated with that particular coin.  No one else wins any points that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WILD CARDS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If someone goes out and you hold the miner and/or hacker cards you lose 200 points per wild card in your hand.  If you have 8 cards of a singer coin and the miner card, you may lay down all 9 (8 coins plus the miner card) and shout out &amp;quot;DOUBLE BITCOIN, DOUBLE MONERO! etc..) In his case you win double the points on the card.  If you have the hacker card in your hand you may not lay down your cards until you have gotten rid of it.  You jay trade both cards together or separately or with another coin but you CANNOT trade more than 4 cards at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COINYE WEST&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This coin is worth much less than the other coins but if someone collects all 9 everyone else loses points.  Double Coinye means everyone also loses double as well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WINNING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played several times until a player has a total of 5000 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
