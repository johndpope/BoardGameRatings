			<description>The story is of sword and sorcery type in which the player takes on the role of Grondoval, a knight in service of his homeland Stazhia. He has been just chosen by his master, Lord Verkapheron, to travel to the forbidding Island of Char, now known as Witchaven, domain of the powerful wicked witch named Illwhyrin, responsible for plunging Stahzia into never-ending darkness. In her lair hidden in a massive subterranean maze, Illwhyrin is casting evil spells, consorting with demons, keeping monsters as pets, and, as more than a few unlucky Stazhians learned, performing human sacrifice. For years adventurers from across the Prime Realms have journeyed into those dark depths seeking glory and wealth, but a few have returned; those who did come back, though, told tales of a horrifying evil. Now the rumour has reached Stazhia that the witch seeks to lift a dimensional barrier known as the Veil, which separates the game's universe from chaotic Nether Reaches, and each day brings her closer to creating a permanent portal through the Veil to allow the demon lord to traverse into the Prime Realms and rule the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Witchaven&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
