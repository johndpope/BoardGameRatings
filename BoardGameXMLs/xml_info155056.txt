			<description>Sungem Run! is part of the Rise of the Occulites Saga of games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sungem Run! is a 2-8 player hidden role game that utilises dice, your natural sneakiness and skills of misdirection. It takes place directly after Dawn &amp;ndash; Rise of the Occulites and has you representing an Occulite Tribe that didn&amp;rsquo;t quite collect enough Sungems for the Long Dark. You do not need to have played Dawn previously or be aware of the Rise of the Occulites setting, but knowing the setting obviously helps with understanding the theme of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the only Tribe that is undiscovered at the end of a Round. The player with the most wins after three Rounds wins. Draws go to the player who has the most Sungems in total after those three rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On average games/rounds take 10-15 minutes depending on the number of players. Games of Sungem Run! are tense and exciting as you try and find out who the other player&amp;rsquo;s Tribe is and then how to expose them without exposing yourself. A game of sneakiness, misdirection and deduction, Sungem Run! is a blast to play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
