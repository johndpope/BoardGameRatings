			<description>&amp;quot;Maximo vs. Army of Zin (魔界英雄記 マキシモ ～マシンモンスターの野望, Makai Eiyūki Makishimo: Mashin Monsutā no Yabō) is an action-adventure game developed and published by Capcom in 2003 for the PlayStation 2 video game console. This title is a sequel to the first episode, Maximo: Ghosts to Glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maximo's gameplay is characterized by hack and slash combat and platforming, as well as an armour system where damage is reflected by loss of armour. Maximo begins the game with two levels of armour (full armour sans helmet), and can upgrade to three and four (with helmet and golden armour, respectively). Level one has Maximo reduced to boxer shorts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another element of gameplay is the Grim transformation, allowing the player to turn into a Grim Reaper for short periods of time, with the souls gathered from the Army of Zin. Grim is invulnerable, powerful, and a touch faster than Maximo. However, the time spent in this form is limited but can be extended through upgrades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maximo also receives bonuses from villagers that he saves from enemies in the game, and these rewards are anything from new armour to a word of advice.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Maximo vs. Army of Zin,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
