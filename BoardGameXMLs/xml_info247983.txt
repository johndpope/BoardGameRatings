			<description>An Introduction to the Tales of Gunslingers, Samurai, Gangsters, Barbarians, and Steampunk in a Post-Apocalyptic World of Qi Warriors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Plains Samurai: Legends provides a one-shot experience to this storytelling RPG of epic exploits against a post-apocalyptic, high fantasy setting. Acting as both a preview for the upcoming High Plains Samurai Roleplaying Game and a stand-alone version, players will have a chance to tell their own versions of three storylines using condensed rules and pre-generated lead characters. Master the political intrigue and dangers of Yung Zhi while bringing in the gunrunner, Dollface, in Showdown In Yung Zhi; survive another day on the Salvation as it races through the Wastes in To Catch A Train; and discover the vengeance and sheer power of the legendary figure known only as Black Scorpion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A perfect way to bring HPS to your favourite convention or as an introduction to your friends before the release of the HPS core rulebook (currently slated for late Summer/early Fall 2018).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Legends are only the beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features: Complete rules; 3 adventures; 4 pre-generated characters; scene notes; table of contents; bookmarks; hyperlinks; multiple layers for printing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
