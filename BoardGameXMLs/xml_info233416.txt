							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Renegade X</name>
									
			<description>Renegade X is a free Tactical Shooter that brings the Command and Conquer FPS experience to Unreal Engine 3. Renegade X is developed by Totem Arts, an independent group of Command and Conquer fans from around the world dedicated to bringing the world of C&amp;amp;C to you, up close and personal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will be able to join up to 40 players and fight for two unique teams - the Global Defense Initiative (GDI), a UN international military force committed to world order and peacekeeping, and the Brotherhood of Nod, a messianic international terrorist network that aims to push humanity into the next stage of human evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally set to be remake of Westwood Studios' Command and Conquer: Renegade, Renegade X has evolved into the spiritual successor to the 2002 classic. Renegade X recreates and modernizes the game's unmatched multiplayer mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to destroy your enemy's base while protecting your own. Players will be able to manage their own economies, choose from over 30 weapons, 15 vehicles, and call in Nuclear Strikes, Ion Cannons, Airstrikes, and much more. Each team will have a base of operations that composes of several key structures. Each structure has its own purpose, and when a structure is destroyed, the affiliated team loses the benefits it once granted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We believe that this game mode - Command &amp;amp; Conquer Mode - can potentially revolutionize the FPS genre. It is the gem that went unnoticed for many years. Now is the time to uncover it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
