			<description>Welcome to the biggest Media Circus in the world! You have chosen to throw your hat in the ring hoping to become the most powerful person in the world, the leader of the free world, the President of the United States. But to get there you must fight all the others who want the same prize. The fight is guaranteed to be dirty with all the Media Frenzy surrounding it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this lighthearted dig at American presidential politics players take on the role of candidates like Congressman Daddy&amp;rsquo;s Boy or Senator Green with attributes like Tree Hugger, Veteran, Fat Cat, Religious, etc. and compete to win the delegates from twenty-one groups of states or Regions like Hurricane Landfall (the Carolinas), Extra Shipping (Hawaii &amp;amp; Alaska), and Second Biggest (Texas).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what politics and elections are about? The candidates definitely do&amp;hellip; and so they start with a war chest of funds ranging from $4 million to $10 million. Once used, the funds are gone till the next round of seven regions. So candidates must choose where to use how much carefully. They can also choose to stay out of the race in a region and instead use the funds to Dig for Dirt on the competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the regions have their preferences for what kind of candidates they like, so if your attributes match that of a region, your funds go further, and vice versa. But once the campaign funds are spent the outcome is not guaranteed for the leader in spending. That&amp;rsquo;s when the Media Frenzy begins! Candidates can now play to the Media and either bring-out Support or Protest Rallies, they can use the dirt they collected and expose Scandals about the competition. Each media event can make your spending go further or not so much.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Candidates must be careful not to indulge the media too much, because if more than one person is spending at the same level, the fickle crowd tunes them out, and the highest unique spender win the delegates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope you have the support of your base, you have the fortitude to let a few protests roll off your back, and you don&amp;rsquo;t have too many scandals in your past. If you do&amp;hellip; you might just be the next Commander in Chief!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
