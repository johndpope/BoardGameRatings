			<description>Shadow Land, known in Japan as Yōkai Dōchūki (妖怪道中記 lit. &amp;quot;Phantom Travel Journal&amp;quot;?), is an arcade game that was released by Namco in 1987. It runs on Namco System 1 hardware. This game was not released in the United States, likely because of its questionable (by U.S. standards) content. However, an English-language version of the game, titled Shadowland, exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a boy named Tarosuke who travels through &amp;quot;Jigoku&amp;quot; (the Japanese concept of Hell) fighting &amp;quot;yokai&amp;quot; (mythical Japanese monsters) on his way to his final fate, as determined by Buddha. He destroys his enemies by firing small Ki bullets, which can be charged to increase their power, though if overcharged, he is left unable to move or fight for a few seconds. During boss battles, Tarosuke kneels at a shrine to Buddha and prays, summoning &amp;quot;Monmotaro&amp;quot; (not to be confused with &amp;quot;Momotarō&amp;quot;) a spirit which floats in the air and drops energy balls on the boss and any lackeys he has.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like Dragon Buster, and Wonder Momo, Tarosuke has a life meter (labeled as &amp;quot;POWER&amp;quot;), but only one life; if the meter is empty, the game is over (unless he has a certain item). There is no score counter, but the game utilizes currency (only referred to as &amp;quot;MONEY&amp;quot;), which is used to buy items, among other things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Shadow Land (arcade game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
