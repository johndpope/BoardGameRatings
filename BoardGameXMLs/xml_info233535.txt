			<description>Armed &amp;amp; Delirious (released in Israel as GrannyX, in Germany as Granny and in other European countries as Dementia) is a 1997 adventure game for Microsoft Windows. It was written and created by Benny Davidovich &amp;amp; Makh-Shevet Ltd., and published by Sir-Tech. The player is a delirious grandmother who tries to save her family. Her family, who were cruel to animals, are imprisoned by the Great Rabbit. It is notable for very surreal gameplay and nonsensical puzzles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_%26_Delirious&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_%26_Delirious&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
