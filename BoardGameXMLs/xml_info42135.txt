			<description>A children's game about colors.  The deck has 34 play cards and 2 rules cards.  There are solid-color cards for the primary and secondary colors (yellow, orange, red, purple, blue, green), and wild cards with 6 color stripes; there are 5 each except 4 for purple. Two games are described:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game I: Rummy-like.  Deal 5 each, and turn up the top of the draw pile.  In a turn, a player draws from the draw or discard pile.  If they can, they lay down a Color Bunch -- either 3 of a kind, or 4 different colors -- discarding one after.  (Presumably you don't discard if you don't lay down.)  The first to empty his hand wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game II: Like Memory/Concentration.  Lay all the cards face down in a rectangle.  In a turn a player exposes 2 cards; if they match he keeps them and turns over 2 more, etc,; if the don't match they go back down and his turn ends.  When all possible matches are made, the player with the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
