			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medical Bay Three is a science fiction medical drama game, for three to five players plus one gamemaster. The game is divided up into individual episodes, like a serialized television drama. Each episode will take a few hours to play out, maybe two to four. At the start of each episode, players will add details to their player characters by drafting some cards. For the first episode, you will create the character entirely. In later episodes, you&amp;rsquo;ll add a few details to your character, as we come to know them better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is distributed as four PDF documents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        3-page Player Guide&lt;br/&gt;        10-page Game Master's Guide (includes scenario)&lt;br/&gt;        7-page print-and-play Cards (54 cards total)&lt;br/&gt;        1-page print-and-play Quade diagram&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
