			<description>Form the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yearbooks in Disgrace is a role-playing game about teenagers and the pain, joy, and growth that teenagers experience. It is meant to evoke such films as Easy A or The Fault in Our Stars and television shows such as Everybody Hates Chris or Freaks and Geeks. In Yearbooks in Disgrace, most of your group will consist of players, each of whom has a teenage character with talent both actual and potential and some real problems too. One of you will be the game master, the person who will create and run scenarios for your characters that let those talents shine and develop (or not) and test and overcome the problems (or not).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During early development this game was titled Yearbook: The RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
