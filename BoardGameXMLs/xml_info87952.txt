			<description>Seduxion - The game of dice that melts the Ice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with 8 differnt dice and a scoring pad along with a small rule sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the dice have one face with Lips, Serpents, Apples, fig leaves and Cupids on them. The 6th face contains one letter of the word SEDUXION. 5 of the dice are black the 3 red dice which have the letters S,E,X on it are red. (This combination scores a special bonus)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turn each player throws all 8 dice and may leave down any, none, or all the dice thrown. Up to 3 rolls are permitted per turn. You get points for more than 3 of the same symbols or have more than 7 differnt faces shown and for making words with at least 3 letters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example: After 3 rolls you got: 4 Cupids and D, I, E, X. This counts 5 points for the 4 Cupids and 10 points for the word DIE, a total of 15 points. The word SEX gots a special bonus of 30 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every field on the score sheet can be used only once, like in Yatzee. You have to cross out the field on the score sheet. After ten turns one column is finished and the points are calculated together. The games ends here or goes up for 2 other columns on the same score sheet. The winner of a column gets a 50 point bonus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Should you get SEDUXION at any time this will ends the game and you win the game. In a 3 column game the winner takes a 100 point bonus and all other lose their point on that column.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(from the rules and user summary)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
