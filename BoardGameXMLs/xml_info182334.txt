							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Driller</name>
									
			<description>Driller is a hybrid, quick, family card game. Players have to devise a strategy to score the best score with cards given. There is no pile, no drawing, you get all cards at the beginning and have to deal with them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Driller uses a mobile device to scan the cards, visualise the drilling and control points, player turns and drill temperature. The device is placed on the game box and players place the cards beneath it, so the app can scan them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck consist of 44 cards - 4 different ground types, each with 10 cards with values 1-10 and one EndDrilling card. The number on a card indicates the speed of the drill. Players can score points for speeding up the drill, using EndDrilling card or matching the card ground type with the ground, currently being drilled through. But if the players drill too fast for too long, the drill may overheat and break! Be aware that other players may want to destroy the drill on purpose to stop you from scoring!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
