							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Superior Synergy: Fantasy PFRPG Edition</name>
									
			<description>[Taken from the Introduction.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2005, Misfit Studios released the original Superior Synergy: Fantasy for the 3.5 OGL rules. The product quickly became one of our best, most consistent sellers. Customers voiced their enjoyment of how the product took the concept of Skill Synergy and made it more dynamic and expansive, allowing for benefits that went well beyond a mere +2 bonus. Customers also responded well to the seemingly logical extension of Skill Synerg by permitting feats to work together in a similar manner in the new game mechanic, Feat Synergy. With the decline of the 3.5 rules and rising popularity of The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game&amp;rsquo;s mechanics, which dropped Skill Synergy entirely as something that imbalanced gameplay, it seemed there was an ideal opportunity to revisit the product and see what could be done with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than merely change the effect names from the original product to match the changes made in The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game rules, a process that would not have addressed the latter&amp;rsquo;s concerns about Skill Synergy&amp;rsquo;s influence on game balance, Skill Synergy has instead been wholly redesigned. This new approach has been carried out in a way that better accommodaes game balance while acknowledging the changes made to the skill mechanics. It takes a fresh approach that improve upon the original concept while also expanding the material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
