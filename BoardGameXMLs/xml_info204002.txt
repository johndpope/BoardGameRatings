							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Avalon Spell Book 7</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avalon takes a common spell and provides you with a number of alterations and additions to add excitement and useful options for your next adventure.  Each issue of Avalon Spell Books will focus on a new spell, discussing different versions of the spell, providing different components that can be used to alter the way the spell works, and even adding feats and new magical items linked to the spell in question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chaotic Blast of Multicolored Hues&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lawful divine spellcasters have long been suspicious of enthropic shields. The spell has &amp;ldquo;enthopic&amp;rdquo; word in it, it creates a &amp;ldquo;chaotic blast of multicolored hues&amp;rdquo; - and yet it does not register as a chaotic spell. Any explanations based on this spell being a minor version of higher level &amp;ldquo;prismatic&amp;rdquo; spells do not seem to be feasible, since arcane spellcasters seem to have no access at all to this kind of magic, except for sorcerers with protean bloodline. So why gods of all alignments seem to be reconciled with this spell, so obviously using wild chaotic energies?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One simple answer is that most spellcasters are using a limited version of the spell, providing only the most obvious and unaligned concealment bonus. When a spellcaster chooses to delve abit deeper into the spell's energies, enthropic shield offers some new choices and uses. The most eminent of such uses is the spell's ability to end preliminarily in certain cases, releasing its energy to fuel some other chaotic effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This and much more is discussed in this issue of Spell Books!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
