			<description>A trivia game about Iceland. There are six categories of questions: History, culture, nature, geography, sports and miscellaneous. Collect a token from each category to win. The players roll a die to move and then they must answer a question from the category they land on. If they answer correctly they get a token and when they've gathered tokens in every colour, they can head to the capital (center). First they need to get to a corner of the board where they answer a question of their own choosing. Then there are two coloured spaces from the corner to the center. When the players get to the center they answer a question of the other player(s) choosing. A correct answer in the center means victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
