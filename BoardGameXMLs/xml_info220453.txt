			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE JOURNEY NEVER ENDS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles won. Homes saved. Mysteries revealed.&lt;br/&gt;Now things get really interesting! ~ Sean Patrick Fannon,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of Shaintar's heroes have humble beginnings within the Southern Kingdoms - those who have chosen to stand together in the light  and stand strong against the forces of evil; whether they be Darkness, Flame or Tempest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the fist anthology to be released and it contains a wealth of detail about the most iconic places in all Shaintar. Contained within this tome are the following guidebooks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Dwarven Clanhomes - these massive underground cavern seem to show the very mountain's favor upon this stocky race. Their smith's are without equal and their miners can sniff gems out that are hidden to all others. Yet, there's more to the dwarves - a society rich with lore &amp;amp; tradition as much as metal &amp;amp; jewels.&lt;br/&gt;    Elvish Nation: The beutiful fae are the artistic ones; their architecture exhibits a deep love of nature. These are the scholars, mages and druids of the land. After all, their long lives allow generations of study. Learn about the Life Bond, a spiritual connection and The Becoming, the greatest punishment of the nation.&lt;br/&gt;    Galea: A beacon of equality and created from a desire to flee the horros of the Kal-A-Nar Empire, this country is ruled by a king both strong and fair. Many brave heroes have come from the noble houses - as have many great quests.&lt;br/&gt;    Mindoth's Tower &amp; Archanaya - The Druids &amp;amp; Church of Light have little in common, yet work in concert towards many goals. Each stands in the light and understands that learning and the exchange of ideas are the path to growth.&lt;br/&gt;    Olara - Tough, stroung warriors of the north: these dowr soldiers hide souls of great beauty. Ever vigilant, they keep close eyes upon the nations of Shaya'Nor and Kal-A-Nar. These folk are the broad shoulders upon which the strength of the Southern Kingdoms rests.&lt;br/&gt;    Serenity - The City of Secrets is at a crossrods in the Wildlands and is a place of intrigue and politics with a dash of religion and trade thrown together. There's something here for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;    The Freelands - The true experiement in personal choice. Each person, group, town &amp;amp; city chooses its own laws in this area and they somehow manage to get along and work together. Guarded by the Freelords of Lone Keep, they remain protected and have a place to look to to defend all their laws.&lt;br/&gt;    The Wildlands - There are few settlements, a duchy or two and Kithros: home of the Rangers. The rest of the wildlands contains sparse towns, farmsteads and lots &amp;amp; lots of land to base an adventure in whether you're looking for swamp, plains, mountains or forest; there's a bit here for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
