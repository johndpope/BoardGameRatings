			<description>Action game. The board consists of a length of baize, which is around 6 feet long. One player rolls a ball at the stumps (nice stumps and bails included)whilst the other player tries to hit the ball with his bat. The rules do not say how many runs are scored after the ball has been hit, you can decide for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box suggests a date of around 1925 and it illustrates the game mechanic quite well. Note that the game is trying to appeal to adults (no children playing on the box image).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
