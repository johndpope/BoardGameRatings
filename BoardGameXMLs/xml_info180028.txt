							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thunder Hamsters and the Temple of Cheese</name>
									
			<description>In Thunder Hamsters and the Temple of Cheese, players take on the role of one of the legendary Thunder Hamsters while they delve into the fabled Temple of Cheese. Players have several paths to choose from and will encounter large wheels of cheese, traps, guards, items of all sorts, and many other wonders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has story-telling at the heart of it. As each encountered item is revealed, the player must make up a story to indicate how to pick up/ward off/handle the situation. Once the story is told, a judge is picked from the other players at the table and the story is ranked on a scale of likelihood. The player then must make a die role to determine the attempt's success or failure for that encounter. Other players may also toss in a coin to challenge the original story and a roll-off ensues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules guide the players in basic mechanics such as movement, but the story-telling aspect opens up the game to nearly limitless possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
