			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 hours left...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Christian looks at his equally stressed colleague: &amp;quot;You know they actually have DNA material, fingerprints, dental labels and email addresses, yeah?&amp;quot;. Michael looks back and nods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 hours left...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kirk Detekt is one of the few companies that have benefited from the dilution of detective agencies in the City. Here, nobody wants the little detectives. So, the company is performing professionally and professionally. Ivan Kirk has found a balance between what is, on the one hand, tangible tasks in the city and, on the other hand, well paid consultancy work for companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 hours left...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Christian once again emphasizes his point of view: &amp;quot;You also know that in a short while, none of this will matter?  We won't be able to use it for anything.&amp;quot; Michael rolls his eyes: &amp;quot;Rikard is currently opening a fire door at the Zanzibar Disco, and in about thirty seconds, J&amp;oslash;rn needs someone to direct him. AV channel 5, make sure to coordinate with Rikard.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 hour left...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigations deadline is approaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is distributed as a 62-page PDF scenario and a ZIP archive containing extensive print-and-play components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
