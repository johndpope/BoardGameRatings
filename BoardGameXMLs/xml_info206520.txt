			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wacky Golf Board Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOOLF is a family friendly game where each player tries to score the best round of golf they can on nine unique holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, a player spins a club to take their shot.  That player then moves the amount of spaces as described by their spin.  To influence their odds at getting the correct shot, players can chose between four clubs (A driver, Mid-Iron, a Short Iron, and a Putter) with differing values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players tally down a mark after each spin.  Players continue to spin on their turns until they land exactly in the hole.  After all nine holes have been finished, play ends and the tally marks are totaled. The player with the lowest total amount of these marks is declared the winner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
