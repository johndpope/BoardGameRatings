							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hot Wheels: Body Worx!</name>
									
			<description>from Amazon&lt;br/&gt;Now is your chance to build the custom Hot Wheels car you've dreamed of! Packed in a clever and portable lunch box, Body WorX has you put together parts of Hot Wheels cars printed on cards. The player who puts together the most cars wins the game. Box measures about 5-inches tall x 5 1/2-inches wide x 2 1/4-inches deep. Ages 4 and up, 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have a hand of cards. They are attempting to complete a Hot Wheels set: one &amp;quot;tires&amp;quot; card, one &amp;quot;chasis&amp;quot;, one interior, one exterior. The cards have to be collected and played in order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a drafting mechanic not unlike Uno. Players may draw from the top of the deck blindly or select the top discard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is some &amp;quot;take-that&amp;quot; where players can slow down their opponent's progress by giving them a &amp;quot;flat tire&amp;quot; card or some other setback card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
