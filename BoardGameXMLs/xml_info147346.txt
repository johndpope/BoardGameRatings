			<description>Bug Too! is the sequel to Bug!, a Sega Saturn game that was also ported to Windows. Bug Too! is a third person platform/adventure game, and has lots of console-style play mechanics. The player can play as Bug and/or his 2 new sidekicks, Maggot Dog and Super Fly. The player goes through several new 3D worlds, all of which are parodies of movies. The player must defeat the themed villains through all of the environments to make Bug's homeland safe once again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bug Too!&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
