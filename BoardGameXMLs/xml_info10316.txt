			<description>Before you can scale Mount Everest or stroll the Champs Elysees you have to know where in the world they are.  So get your bags packed and your travel documents in order.  You are about to embark on a journey that could take you anywhere from Beijing to Santiago.  And all you need is your passport.

Be the first to collect all your passport stamps, and you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
