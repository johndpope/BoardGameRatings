			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to eliminate all the territories that your opponents control, thus removing them from the game. The game itself plays like a simplified version of Advanced Wars for the Nintendo DS, but with a territorial control aspect that feels like Risk. Using a hex grid for our maps, we created a set of module pieces so that players set up the board before hand, creating a unique game every time it is played. The game comes with 32 separate board pieces for the players to place, though to use all in a single game is not suggested unless the players have a long time to play. Clockwork Crusade is made for 2-6 players and with the modular pieces the board can be made as small or as large as it is needed for the amount of players. Players will manage resources, create units and use strategy to outwit or outsmart their opponents and obtain victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
