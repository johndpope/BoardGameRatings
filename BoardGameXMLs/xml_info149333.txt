							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warfare 1917</name>
									
			<description> User Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warfare: 1917 is a strategy war game where you can lead either the British or the German forces through a series of intense trench battles. Use the trenches to your advantage as they provide both defensive and offensive bonuses to your squads. Support weapons can be used to deal with entrenched enemy squads so use them wisely as well. Morale is highly important! Broken enemy morale leads to an easy victory so take control of the trenches and bombard your foes into submission. Field experience translates into upgrade points which can be used to buy all sorts of useful bonuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
