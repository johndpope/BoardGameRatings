			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set Sail for Adventure with Eight Spectacular Sailors and Scallywags!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nautical Heroes is our fifth set of 8 ready-to-play pregenerated 1st level characters created specifically to shine in a Pirate Adventure Path but ideal for any campaign venturing into the beautiful briny blue! Ideal for use as allies, cohorts, long-running NPCs, or replacement player characters, superstar author Neil Spicer brings you amazingly detailed and lushly developed characters including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Aethan Calder, human swashbuckler&lt;br/&gt;    Cathran Tyvirian, half-elf cleric of the Goddess of Luck, Travelers, Stars, and Dreams&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;quot;Fairweather&amp;quot; Lumis Prindle, halfling sea singer bard&lt;br/&gt;    Miriel &amp;quot;Miri&amp;quot; Kalantee, elf sea witch&lt;br/&gt;    Ondirra Shirahz, undine flowing monk&lt;br/&gt;    Silvio Devaulis, human oracle of the Pirate Queen&lt;br/&gt;    Tarren Torrenato, human gunslinger buccaner&lt;br/&gt;    and last but not least, the deadly &amp;quot;Rookrost&amp;quot; Evon Bloodbeak, tengu swashbuckler rogue&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built according to Pathfinder RPG organized play specifications, using the 20-point-buy method and with scaling notes for 15-point builds, these characters are not just piles of statistics. Each one is as much about story as combat, with robust links built in to each other as well as the official Pirate Adventure Path, though every one easily stands on its own in any seagoing setting. The crunch for every character more than measures up to its incredible flavor text, though, and when it&amp;rsquo;s time to throw down in combat none of these Nautical Heroes will be stepping to the sidelines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character includes a detailed backstory, roleplaying tips, special equipment, and links to the published campaign, including a campaign trait selection from the Pirate Adventure Path player&amp;rsquo;s guide. Each also lists detailed level advancement information for their first few levels, with further suggestions for developing the character's long-term mechanical build. We haven't even mentioned the fantastic character portraits courtesy of Bob Greyvenstein, or the included foldable paper miniatures for every character! Print and PDF versions of this product are available, as well as HeroLab portfolios available soon for every character!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
