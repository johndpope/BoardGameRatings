			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to SqueakQuest, a slightly odd game about squeak toys on an epic quest across a mystical (yet oddly familiar) landscape.  There have been a number of games that have utilized toys as playing pieces in the past.  Where SqueakQuest differs is that it toes a slightly darker, more serious line than those other games.  You&amp;rsquo;re a grown-up who plays with toys; your toys should have more grown-up adventures.  Which is not to say that this is some dreary, &amp;ldquo;mature&amp;rdquo;, angst-ridden exercise in nihilism.  They&amp;rsquo;re still toys after all and there&amp;rsquo;s a great deal of humor to be found herein.  What&amp;rsquo;s important is that despite the humor, it&amp;rsquo;s all very deadly serious to your toy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember playing with toys as a kid?  You may not have had the deepest plots or most intricate storylines, but whatever your toy did, it mattered.  Whether it was GI Joe wiping out Cobra or Barbie going out on a date, or pirate adventures with your rubber duckie, the point is that you were really identifying with the toy and the things it was doing.  Your imagination made the stories come to life and they were just as important as anything that you were doing on the playground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to try and use this game to recapture some of that &amp;ldquo;play intensity&amp;rdquo; and along the way, don&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if some rather odd, but rewarding storytelling comes out of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
