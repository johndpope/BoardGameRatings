			<description>A Hack`N`Slash Feast&lt;br/&gt;Guardians of Ember is a unique combination of Hack'n'Slash and traditional MMORPG with a focus on action oriented combat in PVE and PVP as well as endless character optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is developed by the hardcore gamers of Runewaker who have a proven track record for high quality online games (Runes of Magic, Dragon's Prophet).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reclaim the Holy Ember&lt;br/&gt;The Human Empire is allied with the Elves, Naia and Dwarves, but they are surrounded by more sinister lifeforms which are worshipping the dark gods, celebrating chaos and death. &lt;br/&gt;Peace was always fragile, and it was only a question of time until war broke out again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was in the First Shadow War when the Guardians of Ember stood up against the evil forces for the first time. &lt;br/&gt;But now the dark forces arrived again and the Human Empire had lost half of its lands. Now there is only one hope: &lt;br/&gt;The Ember itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Become an Immortal Guardian&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Era of the Holy War&amp;rdquo; has only just begun. As a Guardian of Ember it is your and your fellow members duty to search for the Ember, defeat the dark menace and to end the war in Olyndale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
