			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 40 x 40 inch, full color battlemap of a Beacon in a Maze .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with No Overlay and the Virtual Tabletop Map (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I need a group of bold adventurers that are willing to investigate a nearby spiral maze and touch the statue in its center. I offer you a priceless gift in exchange for your help. This&amp;hellip;ahem&amp;hellip;magic wand&amp;hellip;can shoot&amp;hellip;uh&amp;hellip;lightning&amp;hellip; to strike down your foes from afar. I will give it to you as payment for your help although it has a limited...herm&amp;hellip;magical charges.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Pale Man in a Large-Brimmed Black Hat, Cloak, Gloves, and Boots&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beacon is a single level exterior and interior map of a circular maze with a statue in its center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beacon is intended for use in a fantasy games with the center statue emitting a magical light. It can also be used in science fiction games with the center statue as a piece of technology that emits an electric flare instead, perhaps sealed in the maze by a superstitious local populace afraid of a curse after the initial discoverer dropped dead from a heart attack after activating the beacon. The Beacon could also be of use in horror games as an object that emits a light into another dimension and draws entities through a portal into our reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spinning Spiral Maze: The player characters are hired by a pallid man in a dark tavern or inn at night to get to the center of a labyrinth (see quote). The first thing they notice is something very strange as they approach, a bird flying directly over the maze that comes crashing down like a comet with a splat. The maze itself also slowly seems to rotate making mapping difficult as well as giving people inside the maze vertigo and nausea. Who knows what traps, monsters, and other obstacles lurk inside the maze to prevent them from reaching the center?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
