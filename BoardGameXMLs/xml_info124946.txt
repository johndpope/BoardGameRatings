			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, what do elves and dwarves eat anyway? Presented below are suggested dining habits for each of the core races, which can spark a GM's imagination, and help her create a unique culture for her players to visit. Whether it's a desperate chase scene through the swinging carcasses in an orc smoke house, a visit to a gnomish village to dine on candied crickets during a street fair, or hunting fat owlbears during an early elven winter, the ideas here provide the hooks of innumerable adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
