			<description>Game Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HODJ 'N' PODJ is a rambunctious collection of your favorite games with all new twists and none of the old drawbacks... like missing pieces and annoying opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Prince Hodj or Podj, you'll play 19 wacky mini-games in a fantasty land called Po-Porree. Here you must rescue Princesses Mish and Mosh from that creepy Prime Minister Salmigundee. Or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have a ball playing games you know and love like Battlefish, Maze o' Doom, Barbershop Quintet or Poker all on their own. Or, if you're feeling generous, play them as a way to save the Princessess in a sly fairy tale adventure where winning is only half the fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played alone or with family and friends, HODJ 'N' PODJ lets you spend less time rummaging through drawers looking for those dingy dice and more time just having fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two hours of digital audio means you'll enjoy witty running commentary and unsolicited heckling from the Peanut Gallery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A gleefully animated, cleverly-told introductory fairy tale starts you on your adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play with family and friends or an especially mischievous computer opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Customize your games to be long or short, easy or hard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;19 arcade, card, word, casino, and classic board games that can be played individually or as part of a bigger game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Steve Meretzky, the award-winning creator of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Planetfall computer software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
