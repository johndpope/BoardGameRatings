							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Seeker: Seeker-class Exploration Vessel</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These starship deckplans cover four decks of the Seeker-class Exploration Vessel. All areas of the spaceship are mapped in detail with descriptions of equipment, systems, and internal spaces (rooms, airlocks, and corridors), and, along with the deckplans, there are tactical maps of each room and corridor. The tactical maps are full-color, to a scale of 1m per square and represent areas such as; crew cabin, droid storage locker, bridge, ready room, sick bay, shuttle bay, observation deck, main airlock, etc, etc, etc.. These tactical maps are intended for use with the Seeker-class spaceship, but they can be used to represent an almost infinite number of similar spaceships, just like dungeon tiles. Full and detailed stats are provided for the Extreme Future game, with notes, allowing the spaceship to be easily converted for use in many other Sci-Fi games, of either space opera, or hard science types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These deckplans include.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Spaceship statistics&lt;br/&gt;     Area descriptions&lt;br/&gt;     Colour deckplans with legend and key&lt;br/&gt;     Tactical maps of all rooms, airlocks, and corridors, so that boarding actions and other combats can be played anywhere in the starship interior.&lt;br/&gt;     Background sections on builders, operators and typical use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
