							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mammoth Lord/Mammoth Rider</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This release contains two similar builds for the Mammoth Lord prestige class. We call one the mammoth lord and one the mammoth rider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the inhospitable arctic wastes of the far north comes the mighty mammoth lord&amp;mdash;a fearsome warrior who has trained one of the great beasts that wander the chilly wilds to serve as his faithful steed. Toughened by their harsh environment, mammoth lords tame their surroundings through tenacious determination and sheer force of will, fighting alongside their bestial companions to take down huge game and carve out a hard existence in the icy north.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prestige Class: Mammoth Rider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role: Mammoth lords bring their steeds everywhere they go, and most refuse to take even one step further. Dominant in the open, they become more timid if forced indoors or into cramped areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mammoth rider is a friend of the huge beasts of his homeland. Using his wilderness skills and the power of his ferocious steed, he is a terror to any soft southerners who invades his territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prestige Class: Mammoth Rider.&lt;br/&gt;Build Classes: Ranger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role: Mammoth riders can fight either mounted and on foot, always in concert with their steed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
