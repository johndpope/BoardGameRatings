			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darwin&amp;rsquo;s Dice is a simple, fast-paced trump card game, where two dice set the conditions of every turn. You&amp;rsquo;ll need both a tactical approach as well as a fair amount of luck. Two to four players meet in this game for a struggle of sheer survival. Only the player who&amp;rsquo;s best prepared and whose cards match the conditions can obtain the opponents&amp;rsquo; cards and collect points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before each turn a player &amp;ndash; the Darwin &amp;ndash; rolls the dice. The combination of number (1 to 8) and colour (blue, green and yellow) determine which card becomes the trump during this turn. Additionally, one die (with + and -) specifies if high or low numbers have an advantage.&lt;br/&gt;Each player then plays a card upside down and then flip them over simultaneously. The player of the strongest card wins, becomes the new Darwin and rolls the dice for the next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strongest card is either the trump or &amp;ndash; of no trump has been played &amp;ndash; the highest or the lowest card. If it comes to a draw, the size of the animal is of the essence (+ for big / - for small). But there are three special cards as well:&lt;br/&gt;The red cards (1 to 8), if they should win a turn, although they are not able of becoming the trump and will always lose in a draw, they can destroy the collected cards of the player with the second best card.&lt;br/&gt;The grey cards (0 and 9) are always the highest or lowest numbers. They can only be beaten by the trump.&lt;br/&gt;The brown cards (4.5) are the worst cards, because they are neither the highest nor the lowest cards - they are right in the middle. But if the trump has been played, they are the only ones able to beat it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game consists of several rounds, each consisting of individual turns. Each turn consists of rolling the dice and playing one card. A round is over when all the hand cards have been played. The game is over when the card deck is used up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each round &amp;ndash; after all the hand cards have been played &amp;ndash; the points of the cards, according to the number of symbols in the corner, are counted and written down. These points are safe and cannot be destroyed. &lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game &amp;ndash; when the card deck is used up &amp;ndash; the player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
