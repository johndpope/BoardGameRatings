							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Denver: The City of Shadows</name>
									
			<description>From cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to the Front Range Free Zone. (That's Denver for you outta-sync jokers.) It's a subdivided, drek-infested, dead-dry tinderbox waiting for some political pyromaniac with slippery fingers to drop a match. It's the center of the black market for most of North America and the crossroads of six nations: Aztlan, CAS, Pueblo, Siux, Ute, and UCAS. They get along with each other about as well as the rest of us do, all jandering for position and a slightly bigger piece of the turf. It's the home of the Nexus, the Denver Data Haven, repository of more black information than Maria Mercurial's diary (maybe).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's all waiting for you, chummer. Can you handle it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Denver is a boxed campaign set for Shadowrun, Second Edition. It contains a players guidebook full of public and shadow information about the city and its surroundings, and a gamemaster sourcebook that describes the locations, local folk, secrets, and surprises of the Treaty City as well as offering rules and suggestions for making Denver as dangerous as it gets. The campaign set also includes a poster-size color map of the Front Range Free Zone and a pair of security/travel passes for two of the city's six sectors. Which will you get, chummer? Aztlan, CAS, Pueblo, Sioux, Ute, or UCAS? There's only one way to find out...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
