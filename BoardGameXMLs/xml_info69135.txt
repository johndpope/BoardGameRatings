			<description>This is basically a board game version of Charades, but it does outlaw spelling out words.  You break into two teams, and use basic charades style play to act out the card clues.  The time or round limit is set for the game by consensus. There's an electronic timer, and a briefing on basic mime signs.  There's an electronic timer, and a die, along with the box of cards with 3 subjects each on them.  The die is used prior to drawing a card of subjects.  Roll a 6, and you get to pick any of the five subjects.  Score is based on having the shortest times - recorded times are totaled. Penalties are assessed for using illegal means of communication, adding 30 seconds (points) for each violation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
