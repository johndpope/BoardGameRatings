							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Escape the... Asylum</name>
									
			<description>Escape the... Asylum.  Bound, trapped, sedated... you awake within a deserted institute for the criminally insane... will you be the first to escape the Twilight Zone clutches of the Asylum?  Crazed in-mates, sadistic staff members and luckless visitors... all desperately searching for useful items maybe a Key from the Orderlies Station, or that Fire-Axe from the Boiler House.  Whatever you decide, don't forget your 'Medications', you wouldn't want another of your 'episodes' would you?  Is it your mind playing tricks, or has reality really begun to twist and buckle?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asylum features a unique 'shifting reality' board and only by adapting the balance of your mind will you be able to thwart the plans of others and forge a path to freedom.  So don't hold back... embrace your insanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note from Designers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is not published, and as of yet has not been accepted by a publisher - thus no release date has been set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WotevaGames did not post this game here, and would like to point out that numerous tags / descriptives are incorrect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 'Beta release', print 'n' play version of &amp;quot;Asylum&amp;quot; has been introduced to extend play-testing.  &lt;br/&gt;This was distributed (free of charge) within the Frothers:Unite-UK customer base, and no copies will be distributed beyond this group (sorry).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any news of possible release will be posted here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
