							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Towers of Illusion</name>
									
			<description>Look!... Now Look Again! What you see (or don't see) determines your path to the top! Science Art magic and philosophy are intertwined in the &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot; of visual illusions. Towers of Illusion examines perception through dozens of visual oddities. The accompanying text carefully explains the dynamic of each illusion, so players are entertained and educated. With more than one way to play, this game delights children and adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Mechanics:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll the die and move your Jester accordingly. If you land on a step with a path symbol on it, take a card and read the question on the front of the card out loud. Answer the question. Depending upon what you see in the optical illusion at that moment, turn the card over and follow the directions based upon what you saw. Do the game when landing on a step with a key symbol. When you reach the top of the tower, you obtain a treasure coin. Obtain three treasure coins (one each of the three types of treasure coins) and win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General Information:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It appears that the game was sold through the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, MA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three Towers, Six Jester Player Pieces, One Die, 18 Treasure Coins, 198 Optical Illusion Cards and on the back side of these cards are the Key Cards (66) and Path Cards (132), 18 Lose a Turn Cards, 18 Extra Turn Cards, Eight Clips to Hold the Towers Together&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
