							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Huggermugger Jr.</name>
									
			<description>A Huggermugger game for a younger audience (9 and up). Players try to discover a &amp;quot;Mystery Word&amp;quot; (like Hangman). To move around the board they must correctly answer questions from the following categories: Scrambled Words, Spelling, Definition, and Luck of the Draw. Players learn the letters of the &amp;quot;Mystery Word&amp;quot; one at a time by reaching the &amp;quot;scoring arena&amp;quot; for that letter. Players may guess the word at any time, but an incorrect guess means that player is out of the game. First player to correctly guess the word wins.&lt;br/&gt;Huggermugger Jr. has two sets of questions for two levels of difficulty. It has optional rules for playing along with some adults playing the regular Huggermugger game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
