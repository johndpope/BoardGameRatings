			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Daring Tales of Adventure: Compendium 4 contains four two-fisted pulp adventures for the award-winning Savage Worlds roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A ship crashing into Boston Harbor and a botched attempt by the Nazis to kidnap a Romanian scholar embroil the heroes in a sinister plot which could have serious repercussions for the whole world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hitler has dispatched his minions to hunt down an ancient relic, the chalice Dracula used to become an immortal vampire! The stakes are high as the hunt begins for The Devil&amp;rsquo;s Chalice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Jimmy wins a competition to work on an archaeological dig in a Crusader castle in the Holy Land it seems like an ideal time for a vacation, but nothing ever runs smoothly when the heroes are involved! The discovery of a secret chamber embarks them on a quest to locate the fabled sword of King Arthur - Excalibur!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes are on a desperate quest to retrieve the relic before Nazis, but are they the only villains seeking The Sword of Avalon?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Japan has invaded Manchuria, forcing the Chinese government to ransack ancient tombs before the invaders can loot them. Our heroes have been hired to help clear one such tomb. But the characters aren&amp;rsquo;t the only interested party - a rogue Japanese general hell bent on restoring his family to glory is also on the hunt!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The race is on, but will The Muramasa Curse strike before the characters can complete their goal!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guarding a starlet on a movie set isn&amp;rsquo;t really heroic work, but the pay is good and it&amp;rsquo;s a free vacation. But what begins as a babysitting gig soon turns into something far more sinister, as villains equipped with weird science devices attack the starlet. Is her Egyptian style necklace the reason?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strap yourselves in for the final Daring Tale ride - Empire of the Black Pharaoh!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
