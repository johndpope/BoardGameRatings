							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Last Earth: Pangaea Ultima</name>
									
			<description>Scientists predicted that in a quarter of a billion years from now, Earth&amp;rsquo;s landmass would merge into a single contiguous continent, the Pangaea Ultima. The effect would be gradual, they thought, and people would have millions of years to prepare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more deadly wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2029, a massive explosion on the Sun&amp;rsquo;s surface, forced Earth&amp;rsquo;s continents to move violently against each other and by 2031 the Pangaea Ultima scenario had become a gruesome reality. About 99,7% of the world&amp;rsquo;s population is dead, cities have been razed to the ground and all infrastructure is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But still, hope is not lost. Out of the ruins of the old world, the few survivors emerge strong and determined to rebuild what was undone. Among them, you and your team of survivors will try to re-establish civilization in the brutal and hostile world that is now called the Last Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last Earth is a post-apocalyptic tile placement, resource management exploration game for 2-5 players packed with enough action and strategic choices to keep you on the edge for game after game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
