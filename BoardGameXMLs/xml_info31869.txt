			<description>Mfg suggested Ages 7 - 9&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 36 domino tiles.&lt;br/&gt;One half of the tile contains a digit between 1 and 9 and the other part a picture of a number of fruits, animals or objects that are well known to every child.&lt;br/&gt;The tiles are shuffled and dealt. The aim is to play the tiles one by one and then trying to match the digit and the number of objects of the already played tiles on the table.&lt;br/&gt;The tiles are color coded to make it easier for the youngest children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
