							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War of the Void</name>
									
			<description>Two galactic forces, the Imperium and the Union, meet at New Mars for a discussion of peace.  The Union sends their most brilliant leaders, ready to hammer out a contract that will mean tranquility and prosperity for years to come.  But as the meetings are about to commence, the Imperium fleet arrives and bombards New Mars to a fine powder, evacuating Imperium leaders just before the destruction.  War immediately erupts in star systems far and near, and the Imperium circles the chaos like a vulture, snatching up planets and enticing new allies to join them.  The Union quickly gathers its forces as princes and vice-presidents take the helm in the sudden power vacuum left from the attack at New Mars. Will they be able to stand against the growing storm that the Imperium commands?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War of the Void pits two teams of players against each other in a struggle to control the galaxy through conquest or diplomacy.  Each player controls his own alien empire, building up a deck of cards unique to his alien faction to perform actions.  Players on the same team complete their turns simultaneously, resulting in action-packed, quick gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must work together to dominate systems by taking control of planets.  Planets can either be conquered, which will increase a player&amp;rsquo;s income, or befriended, which will give the player a special ability.  Players must build up a fleet of ships to defend and attack, choosing from many ship types with unique abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War of the Void is a thematic sequel to Empires of the Void.  It in an entirely new game set in the same universe. The game is for 2-4 players and takes about 90-120 minutes to play. A planned expansion will add components for a 5th and 6th player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
