			<description>The latest game from MM Board Games is now available FREE to Print and Play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a Night-club DJ under orders from the Club Manager to keep the clubbers happy. The Club has many rooms (one per player), each playing a different genre of music. Each player has a board that depicts their &amp;lsquo;room&amp;rsquo;, which is split into 3 main areas; Bar Area, Dancefloor and Stage. Also on a player&amp;rsquo;s board are 2 record decks on either side of a sound mixer.&lt;br/&gt;Players have a selection of records and must decide which to play at what time. At the start of the game the DJ must entice clubbers on to the Dancefloor (from the Bar Area), then, as the night progresses, on to the Stage. &lt;br/&gt;The manager will visit your room from time to time and you will receive points for clubbers on the Dancefloor and for those on the Stage.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the night the DJ with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To acquire the game visit the site below;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://mmboardgames.page.tl/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://mmboardgames.page.tl/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
