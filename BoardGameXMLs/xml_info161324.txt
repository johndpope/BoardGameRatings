			<description>Druglord is a thematic war-game based on the history of Cartel's wars, with a strong commitment pro-legalization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4-6 Players will impersonate and control the most powerful and dangerous Cartels in the world: Mafia, Yakuza, Triads, the Cartel of Medell&amp;iacute;n, the National Crime Syndicate and the Bratva (Russian Mafia). They'll have to distribute their forces all over the world, conquer the production places of drugs (for example: Colombia or Afghanistan) and the markets (cities like Los Angeles, Amsterdam or Tokio), organizing the flow of 4 kinds of substances that have different perks. This way players will gain soldiers that can be used to attack or defend; cooperation is acceptable, regulated and sometimes very useful. There are also cards to be drawn at each turn, inspired by historical or fictitious events related to the criminal world. They can have good or bad effects, and often there are choices to be made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is known at the beginning of the game, when each player draws a goal card (all different but balanced) that has to remain secret until the conditions of victory are fulfilled. There's also a semi-randomized countdown towards legalization: an event that in our point of view (and according to the ideas of many economists) would terminate the business of Cartels. When this happens (after 2-3 hours, according to the players' choices) the game is over and victory is assigned by points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
