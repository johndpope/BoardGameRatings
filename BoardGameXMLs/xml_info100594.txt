			<description>Sentient is a first-person adventure developed by Psygnosis and released on the PlayStation in 1997. It was also released for the PC the same year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has been a breakout of radiation sickness on Space Station Icarus, the player has been sent to investigate. After arriving at the station, it becomes apparent that radiation is only one of many problems; the Captain is dead and a power struggle has ensued. To make matters worse, Icarus is on a collision course with the Sun and nobody is able to correct the station's course. Sentient takes place in real-time, the player's actions in the early part of the game determine which path they will travel through later on. Which members of the crew are spoken to and what they are told plays a strong part in the plot's development. The player's performance through the game determines which of the nine endings they receive&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was developed by Psygnosis' external Chester Studio over 1996 and 1997. The characters in the game were based on facial scans of staff at the studio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sentient (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
