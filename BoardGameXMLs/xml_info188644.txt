			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have recently being staying in the village of Lorwen, a small village situated near a huge forest, rumoured to be infested with faerie folk. Wanting to return to civilisation, but not looking forward to the trek alone, you approach a merchant, Talas, who is ordering his gang to load up their gear. Talas is transporting timber to Deepbridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each adventure book for Legend of the Wayfarer presents a solitaire adventure for use with the game.  These proceed, typically, by presenting a paragraph or so of text followed by a test or decision which leads to another page.  Each adventure book also has a page of random numbers in case the player is in a location that does not facilitate die rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
