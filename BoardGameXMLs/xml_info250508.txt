							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Return to Senag Island: The Wizard&#039;s War</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome back to Senag Island. Previously home to a clan of Minotaur Pirates led by Muolo Thundereye, this island has been left abandoned and the structures built here have largely fallen into ruin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something stirs on the island, however, a Wizard calling himself Malrakath, often known as Malrakath the Mad, has constructed his tower upon the island and has been abducting adventurers and other creatures in order to fight a Battle Royale for his personal amusement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new adventure on Senag Island is intended to be run as a one-shot, and is highly customisable to suit your party's level. It can, however, be played as a part of a broader campaign, and can be linked to the events of the previous adventure on Senag Island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will your party be able to fight their way to the heart of Malrakath The Mad's island, overcome the other 96 combatants on the island, and claim their prize? Or will they fall to the Maelstrom while hunting for the weapons they need to survive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A loose sequel to The Pirates of Senag Island&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
