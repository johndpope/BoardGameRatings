			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A &amp;quot;Great Dalmuti&amp;quot; type card game featuring characters of Shrine Maiden fame. The card deck consists of cards numbered 1&amp;ndash;15 and a special power. Each player gets 7 cards. The first player may play 1 or more cards (several cards of the same number or a straight), and the players who follow must play as many or more cards as the previous player and the total value must also be higher. Each time one or several card(s) are played, the effect of one of the played card is executed. Players who cannot play must pass. Once everyone around the table has passed, the played cards are discarded and the current players begins anew with playing one or several cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get rid of his hand wins the round. The game is played for several rounds, with the winner of the previous round getting an advantage for the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
