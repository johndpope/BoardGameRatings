							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rocket Race</name>
									
			<description>A vintage game titled as &amp;quot;An exciting Space-ship race around the Solar System&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to 8 can play. After you have punched out a rocket ship for each player (and the artwork on the playing pieces is awful), everyone has to start at Earth. You have to assemble the Spinner - oops! the Space Compass - and when it is ready, the game can start. Spin the Space Compass and move along the track towards Venus (marked with an A) the amount of spaces that you spun. There are 12 spaces in total with a letter next to them. If you land exactly on one, you must obey the instructions. The first to get back to Earth, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
