			<description>A satirical science fiction card game created for the February Design contest; the game revolves around creating positive feedback loops formed out of individual cards, each of which must connect to the previous card. There are three 'suits' that the cards convert between, and three possible values. Players use pawns to perform various actions over the course of a turn, and can either work cooperatively by building card systems jointly or competitively by taking over systems. Thematically, players take the roles of members of the Society of Learned, Orderly, and Beneficent Beings, a society of aliens devoted to bringing about cosmic unity as they attempt to harmonize a planet with three species locked in warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
