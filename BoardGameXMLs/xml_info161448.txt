			<description>Ecks vs. Sever is a first-person shooter (FPS) video game for the Game Boy Advance handheld game console. It was developed by Crawfish Interactive. Based on an early script of the film Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever, it is the first video game developed and released before the film it is based on had begun production. It is followed by the sequel Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever, which having been released after the film, follows it more closely than the first game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ecks vs. Sever&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
