							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pocahontas: Peace in the Forest Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The year is 1607. The place, Virginia. The Indians &amp;amp; the English settlers have been at odds ever since the villainous John Ratcliffe &amp;amp; his men arrived to search for gold. Chief Powhatan's daughter Pocahontas &amp;amp; the English Captain Jon Smith want you to bring together all their Powhatan &amp;amp; English friends. Gramdmother Willow will help as yo gather Meeko &amp;amp; Flit, Powhatan &amp;amp; Nakoma, &amp;amp; Thomas, Wiggins &amp;amp; Lon. The first player to overcome John Ratcliffe (&amp;amp; his pampered pooch Percy) &amp;amp; collect all the friends will bring peace to the forest - &amp;amp; win the game.&lt;br/&gt;Ages 5 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins the game with a Pocahontas card and a John Smith card. On your turn, draw a card and if it is one of Pocahontas' friends or John's friends, place the card face up below that character. If you already have one of those friends, place the card in the Friends Discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;Special cards include John Ratcliffe, Percy and Grandmother Willow. &lt;br/&gt;If Ratcliffe is drawn, you must turn John or Pocahontas face down. When turned face down, one of their friends must be placed in the Friends Discard pile and any friends drawn while they are face down are also discarded.&lt;br/&gt;If Percy is drawn, you play him on an opponent and they must turn over their Pocahontas or John card.&lt;br/&gt;If Grandmother Willow is drawn all face down John Smith and/or Pocahontas get turned face up again.&lt;br/&gt;The first person to get a complete set of the two Friends groups is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
