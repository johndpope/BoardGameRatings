			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the ultimate race to build a bunny society on planet Earth, Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey pits players against each other as they struggle to gain Civilization Points, by building cities and increasing their bunny populations. Players gain points by developing their own civilizations or by using zany weapons and hilarious scenarios to destroy their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Yellow deck has a Land based theme which also includes deserts, forests and remarkable cards such as Crossroads which dictates bunny attacks and Urban Plague which can empty your opponent&amp;rsquo;s cities immediately!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
