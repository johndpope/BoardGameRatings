			<description>Fast shot is an action/dexterity game for 2 players. Each player receives a disc and you win when you are the first one to shoot your disc in the goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But before you can score, you must complete your mission. There are 2 types of missions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     You have to hit 3 wooden cylinders. When the 3 cylinders in your color have fallen, you can try to score.&lt;br/&gt;     You have to follow a certain path indicated by the wooden cylinders. As soon as you have completed the path you can try to score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players take turns shooting the disc in their color. You are allowed to hit the disc of the opponent and you can even hit the goal so it is moved on the table. This will also make it possible to hinder your opponent when he has a possibility to score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with different missions of each type and additional missions are available for download.&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
