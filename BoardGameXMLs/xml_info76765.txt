			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We Ski allows players to explore a skiing resort,  ski down 14 different slopes with different levels of challenge as well as compete in various ski related competitions.  Players can choose to ski at night or during the day in a variety of changing weather conditions.  As you complete a slope, you are given a rank for the quality of your run (S+,S,A,B,C,D) in four different categories (Time, Turning, Balance and Speed).  Completing all 14 slopes with S+ requires perfect runs and exceptional skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We Ski is notable as being the first 3rd party game released that makes use of the Wii Balance Board (and the second after Wii Fit).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
