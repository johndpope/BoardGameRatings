			<description>Melty Blood: Actress Again, is the third game in the Melty Blood fighting game series. Compared to the second game in the series, Act Cadenza, this game features three entirely new playable characters, as well as several new alternate versions of existing characters in the PS2 version. All characters now feature three different fighting styles known as Full Moon Style, Crescent Moon Style (most similar to Act Cadenza) and Half Moon Style, which changes not only the way in which life and Magic Circuit meters function but also each characters' basic and special attacks. Actress Again was first announced in the December 2007 issue of Arcadia, a Japanese consumer arcade game magazine published by Enterbrain; most available information to date is derived from translations of the article in this issue.   Additional new artwork and a description of the three styles were introduced in the January 2008 issue of Tougeki Damashii magazine. Also in early 2008, Ecole launched the official Actress Again website. Actress Again has been ported to the PS2 as of August 20 of 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code is presumed to be an arcade port of the PS2 version. The game underwent location testing in Akihabara from December 19&amp;ndash;20, 2009.  The game runs on Sega's RingWide arcade system, as opposed to NAOMI like Act Cadenza and the original Actress Again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An upgrade for Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code was launched in 18 May 2011, branded as Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code Ver. 1.05 with new changes in Gameplay and add 2 new characters in game, Powered Ciel (Ciel's Executioner Version of Melty Blood ReACT) with her own Story Mode and ending, along with new moves and sprites for her. The new changes also added Ryougi Shiki as an official playable character (she was a hidden secret unplayable boss in the original Actress Again[citation needed]) with her own Story Mode and a fixed up moveset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A final upgrade for Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code was launched in 14 October 2011, named Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code Ver. 1.07. It includes a complete version of Arche-Type Earth (princess version of Arcueid Brunestud) with new sprites and moves for her and also her own Story Mode and ending. Also added were Story Modes and endings for the Neco &amp;amp; Mech and Kohaku &amp;amp; Mech teams. Riesbyfe Stridberg (as happened with Neco-Arc in the Playstation 2 version of Melty Blood Actress Again) can gain a new route in Story Mode, showing her as living her new life with Sion Eltnam Atlasia and Satsuki Yumizuka as a member of the Back-Alley Alliance (after the endings of Sion and Satsuki).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Melty Blood&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
