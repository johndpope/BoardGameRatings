							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Listening lotto: Sounds at Home</name>
									
			<description>In this educational children's game, players match sounds produced in the home (e.g. Hair dryer, faucet) to images depicting those items. To play, players listen to the sounds on the CD and place tokens on the images on their game cards that match what they hear.  Players win by matching the most images correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game set includes 12 game cards with 8 photos per card, 120 game tokens, an audio CD, and directions in English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
