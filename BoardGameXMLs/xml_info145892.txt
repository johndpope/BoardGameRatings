							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dwarves and Dragon</name>
									
			<description>Dragon's gold is the best gold! The Dwarves know that, and so, when asked to make a golden dornik for the Trollgod, they set out to get some gold from Arngaxx the Dragon. Dragons hate to give up their gold, and they rather enjoy eating dwarves. There is no way the two sides can come to a mutually satisfying agreement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dwarf player moves his three dwarf pieces into the dragon's lair, using checkers like movement on a gridded map of the dragon's lair, and tries to carry off pieces of the dragon's gold. Meanwhile the dragon player moves the dragon, using checkers-like movement, in an attempt to eat the dwarves. The dwarf player wins if he gets three pieces of gold out of the dragon's lair. The dragon wins if he kills all three of the dwarves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
