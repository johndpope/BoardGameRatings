			<description>From the product page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Never be at a loss again with these thirty tables of random Medieval Fantasy events and findings in urban, rural, and underground locations. Each thirty entry table is divided into three ten entry categories, some with additional sub-options, making for nearly one thousand random results including the fun and fantastical. Use these pages to help flesh out locations during prep or to perk up a flagging game session. This invaluable resource is system-free and ready to help with any fantasy roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A brief word before the content, please. With this book, you can use a 30-sided die to generate a random events in many environments. Each table is further divided into three tailored categories, so you can also use a 10-sided die or a 20-sided die to make use of only one or two of the categories. Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to have a six-sided die on hand as some options even have three sub-options. As with all things random, if a result doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit, roll again or choose from those available. Where an option states man or woman, male or female, it need not be human. GMs are encouraged to be flexible when trying to  implement a result. So, grab some dice and let&amp;rsquo;s get rolling!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
