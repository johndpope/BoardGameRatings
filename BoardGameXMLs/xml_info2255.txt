			<description>This is proposed as 16 Chess games in 1. They are all variations on Chess using cards to augment the game. All are for 2 players. Many of the games are pure strategy with no randomness, just like Chess itself; many of them have an element of luck; and many of them introduce other game elements into Chess, including bluffing, hand management, resource management, gambling, push-your-luck, trick-taking, auctions, etc. There is something here for everyone--including the serious Chess player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In every game, a player's possible moves are determined, to varying extents, by the cards available to that player. Sometimes, a king will appear to be threatened, but will actually be safe, if the attacking piece is unable to move. As such, check and checkmate have been removed from these games entirely; a player may willingly enter or stay &amp;quot;in check.&amp;quot; The goal of every game is simply to capture the opposing king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
