							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arcadia Quest: Hassan</name>
									
			<description>A strange prince, from a distant land. Hassan's combat prowess might only be rated as 'adequate' if not for his astonishing luck.  He credits his forward thinking battle strategies and the mystic Dagger of Rhee-Do. Enemies that would surely have struck him a fatal blow find themselves outmaneuvered and bleeding from dozens of tiny wounds (and with sand rubbed in them no less!) As a prince  of a desert kingdom, Hassan began his journey not long after eternal night fell. For, while relief from the desert heat was relieving at the time, things have gotten a good bit colder, and firewood is notoriously hard to come by in the dunes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
