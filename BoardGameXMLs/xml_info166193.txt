			<description>Designer blurb: from 1km1kt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Secret Lives of Serial Killers was written for the February 2011 Ronnies, based on the ingredients of &amp;ldquo;Murder&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Morning.&amp;rdquo; It is a horrible, brutal game, that no one should ever play, based on the concepts of &amp;ldquo;abusive game design.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Secret Lives of Serial Killers, two players deceive a third player into thinking they are playing a game called &amp;ldquo;Sunshine Boulevard,&amp;rdquo; a feel-good structured freeform game about quirky recluses in love. In fact, they are setting up the third player as the serial killer&amp;rsquo;s victim, to be killed in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
