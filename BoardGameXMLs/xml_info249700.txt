							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Siron II</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mysteries of the Red Planet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second planet in the Siron system, Siron II is a small and inhospitable planet that is largely devoid of organic life. Wracked by frequent seismic activity and covered with volcanoes, visiting the planet is highly dangerous; however, Siron II is rich in rare and valuable minerals, which has resulted in various mining operations throughout the years, both legal and illegal. Although it doesn&amp;rsquo;t drive nearly as many people to Siron II as mining does, the planet&amp;rsquo;s unique tectonic activity, as well as a few ruins from what appear to be an extinct indigenous population, also bring a variety of scientists and archaeologists to the planet in search of new discoveries, as well as to study the planet&amp;rsquo;s infamous killer crystals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
