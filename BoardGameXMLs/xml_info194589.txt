			<description>Loki was a clever and crafty god and when he played games with some of the other gods in Asgard  he made up rules for his own games.  This made sure that the game was confusing and different every time so he was the only one who could win. The other gods really wanted to be better than Loki so they tried their best to beat him. So it became a tradition to gather around one of Loki&amp;rsquo;s games. This festive tradition got the name Ramasjang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gather your friends for a fun fast changing card game! It&amp;rsquo;s fun and easy to shape like Loki the shapeshifter himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now each player is dealt seven cards. The cards have different rules which you generate every hand. The person who sits left to the dealer starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card laid on top of the discard pile has to match the suit or the number unless a rule says otherwise. If you can&amp;rsquo;t lay a card you must pick a card from the deck. After picking up the card you have the possibility to lay it if possible and if you still can&amp;rsquo;t go it&amp;rsquo;s the next players turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From here you can add new rules to the cards without any limits.  The idea as Loki changed the rules to win, here each of the player takes it in turn either during play or between hands to add to the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player wins, in a singled hand game by getting rid of all his cards despite the rule changes.  In a longer point scoring game a player wins when they have the least points when an opponent hits a value agreed at the start of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
