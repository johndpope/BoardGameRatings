			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;As a knight who has learned to master his inner soul and project it through his sword, the Fire Knight is a master of battle who cuts down his foes with his fiery blade and his blazing abilities. They are found in the front lines of battle due to their combat prowess and generally fiery natures.
