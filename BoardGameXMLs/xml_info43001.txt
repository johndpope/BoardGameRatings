			<description>Players have three little sticks and take between none and all of them into their closed fist. They then take turns guessing how many sticks are in all hands combined, marking their guess on a kind of circular scoring device (&amp;quot;Zahlenkranz&amp;quot;). No guess can be duplicated. Whoever has most right guesses at the end of the game, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
