			<description>Close Counts is the party game where the best guesstimate wins! How many Coco-Cola products are sold every day? What did the world's most expensive painting cost? How many DeLorean sports cars were manufactured? How many pennies would it take to circle the world? Don't know!?!? It doesn't matter!!! You don't need to know the answer, you just have to be closer than everyone else - now that's what counts! There are six categories of statistical fun: Time Traveller, Numbers and Nature, Dollars and Cents, Records and Feats, What Year Was That? and No Way! New 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
