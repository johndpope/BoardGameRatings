							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rostov &#039;41: Race to the Don</name>
									
			<description>Rostov &amp;lsquo;41 is a Standard Combat Series (SCS) game covering the bold&amp;mdash;some would say &amp;ldquo;foolhardy&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;dash by Army Group South to take Rostov in the late fall of 1941. Amazingly, the attack succeeded, resulting, however, in the Germans being isolated at the end of a logistical shoestring. The regrouping Red Army, stung from a long series of defeats, saw this as the perfect opportunity to launch its first coordinated attack of the war, thus paving the way for the Moscow Counteroffensive just a few weeks later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rostov &amp;lsquo;41 covers all this swirling mobile action in turns representing 3 to 6 days and at a map scale of 2.5 miles per hex. Units are battalions to divisions. Low counter density and a wide-open map bring all the action and possibilities to light in some wild gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players will find themselves under the gun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The German player must use his limited and overstretched forces to pull off a brilliant coup. Playing it safe won&amp;rsquo;t cut it; speed is all-important. With a lot of skill and a bit of luck, Rostov will be yours. Then you&amp;rsquo;ll have to pay the piper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Russian player must conserve his forces as the German rapier expends its energy. While the capture of Rostov requires a lot of skill and some luck on the German part, don&amp;rsquo;t begin to think your job is easy. Derailing that German drive can easily consume precious forces needed for your main effort: turning the tables on the Germans and taking back great swaths of the Motherland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rostov &amp;rsquo;41 components:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Standard Combat Series (SCS) rulebook (version 1.8) &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Rostov &amp;lsquo;41 game-specific rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; one full color 22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; map&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 280 counters&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 4 scenarios:&lt;br/&gt;Fritz on the Don (Campaign), 14 Turns&lt;br/&gt;Fritz on the Mius, 4 turns&lt;br/&gt;Fritz Grabs Rostov, 7 turns&lt;br/&gt;Soviet Counterpunch, 4 turns&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; box and dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
