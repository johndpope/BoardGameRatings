			<description>Emprise is a multi-player fast-paced, real-time card game where players race through dungeons looking for treasure and glory. While only one player can hold the top spot, they must rely on their teammates in order to succeed or all will fail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Emprise is to have the most experience points after a series of levels, culminating with a boss battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a deck of cards with their own crest on the back to play plus their character cards which represent individual powers they can use while playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of each round, the players flip over a new level, read the appropriate rules (if any), and deal out the indicated number of monsters for the start of the round. The players then deal out there focus pile and stamina cards, leaving the remainder of their cards as their luck deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To clear your focus deck, players simultaneously play with four zones gaining experience points and treasure. These zones are the level (where the monsters are milling about, ready to fight along with the level cards), their focus, stamina, and luck decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a players focus deck has been cleared, unless otherwise noted by the level, the round ends. Players count up the cards played into the field, subtract any remaining focus, and take their hidden treasure which is revealed at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most experience points at the end of the game, including their hidden treasure, gains bragging rights until the next time the adventures play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
