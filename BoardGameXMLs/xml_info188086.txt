			<description>Flaptacular is a Disney Fairies themed card game, played with  a deck of 36 cards numbered 1 to 9.  Cards are dealt evenly to all players.  Each player then places four cards face-down in a row in front of him- or herself. Remaining cards are kept face-down as a draw pile.  Each player turns the top card of his or her draw-pile face up and places it in the center of the table.  When the dealer says &amp;quot;go,&amp;quot; players turn over the four cards in a row and try to place these number cards on any of the number cards placed in the center of the table. Cards must be placed in numerical sequence, either higher or lower. 1 and 9 can be played on one another. When a card is played, another card may be turned up from the draw pile and placed in the face-up row, so players may always have four cards face-up to play. If no player can play a card, each player turns another draw pile card face up onto the stacks of cards already played. The first player to play all the cards onto the middle stacks wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
