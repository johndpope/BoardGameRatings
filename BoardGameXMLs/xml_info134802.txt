							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Mr. Tannen</name>
									
			<description>From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;Walking the floors of the Honeypot, Mr. Tannen invites himself to a chat with the patrons. Suddenly, their winning streaks turn sour, and piles of chips disappear bet by bet. Mr. Tannen is very good at debuffing the enemy crew. He can reduce the enemy hand size by removing Arcane Reservoir, stopping models from drawing cards, or using Equalize Fate to reduce the opponent's hand size to the same size as his controller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mobility&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Tannen has 4 Wk, and no charge. Shambling helps him get through severe terrain. His Immune to Influence prevents him being lured, obeyed or pushed by his companion Mr. Graves however.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Offense&lt;br/&gt;Melee&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Tannen's melee option is his Pocket Knife. It has a mid Cb, and no triggers.&lt;br/&gt;Ranged&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Tannen has no ranged attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resilience&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Tannen is Immune to Influence and Pitiful, making it harder to pick him as a target.&lt;br/&gt;Due to Cooler, enemy models trying to cheat fate within 5&amp;quot; of him must discard a control card before cheating fate. This can make your opponent burn resources to ensure their actions occur near Mr. Tannen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tips and Tricks&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Tannen has several abilities that affect enemy models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luck's Turning&lt;br/&gt;This spell is Mr. Tannen's only (0) action, so there isn't a huge reason not to use it. If successful, the targeted model cannot cheat with a card higher than it's opponent used in a Duel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bore to Tears&lt;br/&gt;With this spell, Mr. Tannen can reduce the movement of an enemy model. This spell has a trigger that can also make the target lose Use Soulstone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
