			<description>Correspo! is a game for young children. In the box you&amp;rsquo;ll find 54 large square colorful, lavishly hand-illustrated picture cards , plus 54 large number cards. The number cards are for more advanced games school-age children can play.&lt;br/&gt;Each Correspo! box contains not one, but five games! Five games for five different age groups from 18 months to 7 years old. Numerous variations make it possible for parents to modify the five basic games for more players, for a child to play alone, for parent/child or child/child games, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some are memory games, while others of an educational nature exercise the player&amp;rsquo;s knowledge of words and numbers. Another game is built around children&amp;rsquo;s lively imaginations, while the last one simply requires luck and quick reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
