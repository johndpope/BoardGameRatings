							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wasteland Fury: Post Apocalyptic Martial Arts</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wasteland Fury combines two of RPGObjects' most successful and critically acclaimed products: Darwin's World (2nd Edition) and Blood and Fists. Grim, determined pit gladiators fight for money and fame, Brethren assassins stalk the night, and seekers into the past discover fighting styles ancient at the time of the Fall. Wasteland Fury brings all this to your Darwin&amp;rsquo;s World game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what you will find in Wasteland Fury:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced Classes&lt;br/&gt;The Initiate, a devoted master of one style; the Pit Gladiator, a brutal bloodsport champion; the Weapon Master, seeking perfection in his bond with one chosen weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Martial Arts Styles&lt;br/&gt;The Fall brought an end to the Ancients&amp;rsquo; civilization. However, the new societies that have arisen from the ashes of the Twisted Earth have developed their own bizarre and brutal fighting styles. Some, like Ancients&amp;rsquo; Legacy and the Rangers&amp;rsquo; Lone Star are descended from the techniques of the ancients themselves. Others, such as Gemini, which imitates the fighting style of the two-headed bear, are products of the Brave New World wrought by the Fall. Still others, such as Ground Zero, are secret fighting styles of the factions, taught to loyal members to help protect the faithful and convert the dubious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the new styles in Wasteland Fury are done in the fashion Blood and Fists fans are familiar with, including Mastery and Bonus Feat lists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maneuvers and Signature Maneuvers&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the basics of martial arts styles are the maneuvers, and Wasteland Fury contains over 30 maneuvers and signature maneuvers to represent advanced techniques of combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So whether you are a Blood and Fists fan looking for martial arts from a dark, brutal future, or a Darwin&amp;rsquo;s World fan looking to add depth and realistic combat to your post-fall games, Wasteland Fury has something for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
