							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flipping Pennies</name>
									
			<description>A children's game in which the two players each flip pennies, or some other coin, at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take turns calling &amp;quot;odd&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;even&amp;quot;, then both players reveal their coin simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heads/Tails or Tails/Heads is odd&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heads/Heads or Tails/Tails is even.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This isn't much of a game, and there are ways to cheat!! But if done fairly it is a perfect example of an &amp;quot;Dice Rolling&amp;quot;. The coins are randomizers. d2 or d6 doesn't matter!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the game would play just the same if the two players rolled d6 dice and noted if the sum of the dice was &amp;quot;Odd or Even.&amp;quot; Since this is a gambling game too, the players would have to each bet a stake of 1 penny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
