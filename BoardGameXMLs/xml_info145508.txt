			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on harpies. These bird-women of greek mythology have long been antagonistic figures, but only gained their association with ugliness after a Roman author confused them with sirens. This book presents three alternative takes on the harpy, the first of which is the miniature harpy (CR 2), which is more bird than woman, and which has a proclivity for stealing small objects. The second is the hag harpy (CR 7), a particularly ugly and vile creature whose very appearance is sickening, and whose voice can leave men deaf and disoriented. Finally, there is the abyssal harpy (CR 10), which takes after the harpies described in greek myth and Dante&amp;rsquo;s Inferno, in that it spends its time torturing the souls of the damned. These creatures have terrible, disemboweling talons and can sing a song that causes even the most callous and cynical to tearfully confess his sins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
