			<description>People say it is better to knw what is hiding in the bag. It is better to know whether it is a cat or something else. Sarkany Samu would not want you to get dissappointed so this boardgame calls you to practice on the Funny Bag.&lt;br/&gt;The players pull out the cardboard characters, feeel them with their hands and  if they can guess which character they have in hand then they find the matching picture on the board and put their pawn  to its place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;- 9 two sided board&lt;br/&gt;- 27 pictures&lt;br/&gt;- 30 pawns&lt;br/&gt;- bag&lt;br/&gt;- rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
