			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Realism is an exciting board game of money and life that is great fun to play. Try to become a virtual millionaire by buying property, shares &amp;amp; other assets and learn about investment. Players have jobs; buy businesses and property; have mortgages, bank loans and credit cards and take out insurance. Opportunities allow a player to improve their assets and increase their income. Life Events affect an individual player and may be good or bad for their asset position. Market Events affect all players and could be good or bad. Luxuries cost the player money and don't earn any income. The length of the game is determined by the players but is typically around 90 minutes. The winner is the player with the most net assets at the end. &lt;br/&gt; Net worth is calculated as the sum of all cash and investments (shares, property, bank deposits, speculations etc. including half the value of any luxuries) less any borrowings from the bank (mortgages, bank loans and credit cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
