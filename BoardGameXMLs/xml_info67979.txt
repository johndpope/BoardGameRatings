			<description>Tempt is the 8th game in Small Box Games Pure Card Line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Tempt, players are powerful warlords vying for control of a splintering empire.  Players tempt powerful Cohorts to fight for their cause.  The fleeting Temptresses grant the players additional special abilities.  Tempt is a mix of strategy, tactics, and clever card play.  The player controlling the largest portion of the kingdom after the conflict ends, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tempt takes place over several rounds of play.  Each round, each player will receive 3 turns.  A round always begins with players secretly selecting 2 Temptress cards to aid them for the round.  The 3 facedown Cohort decks in the middle of the play area represent 3 areas of the kingdom, and each player controls a Column on his side of each area where he can Tempt powerful Cohorts, in attempts to gain and hold control of that area.  The player with the strongest Column has Primacy in that area and is awarded extra points and actions.  Cohorts may also be tempted as Chanters, granting the player additional abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the artwork on some of the cards, Tempt is not recommended for gamers under the age of 13.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
