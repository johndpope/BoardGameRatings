			<description>Mr. Richter is a children's game that has a head without features. On players turn, they start the timer, draw a card and quickly try to put the correct features on the face that match the face on the card. If they get all the features on, they can press the button &amp;amp; stop the timer. If they do not, the face explodes, releasing all the features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played cooperatively, with players quickly putting on a feature one at a time and the one holding a feature when the face explodes loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can also be played with each player trying to build the entire face on his turn. If the face explodes, that player is out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
