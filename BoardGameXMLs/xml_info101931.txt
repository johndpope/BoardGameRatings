			<description>From the Publisher's Web Store&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        The Boogeyman is still under the bed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Bloody Mary is still in the mirror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        All your childhood fears are alive and well, looking for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        And your only guardian... is Mister Whiskers.&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;        Cat: A Little Game about Little Heroes is a game about housecats protecting their owners from monsters they can't see. It is designed to be played by gamers of any age with a system simple enough for children and sophisticated enough for grown-ups.&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;        This new edition of the classic game includes streamlined rules and additional Narrator advice. It also includes advice for playing the game with smaller gamers and a new chapter on incorporating magic cats into your existing games--no matter what system you happen to be using.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in June, 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
