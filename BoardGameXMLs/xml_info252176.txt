							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Redrunner / Greenrunner</name>
									
			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greenrunner / Redrunner is essentially a bundle of two similar high-speed still screen shoot'em-ups, the latter being a sequel to the first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;Released back in 2006 at the Game Over(view) Freestyle Jam, Greenrunner literally blew the competition away with it's frantic arcade gameplay and amazing mix of sampled speech and high quality soundtrack. It's a game so hardcore and visually intense that it's probable that even Jeff Minter would beg for mercy at the thought of having to beat all 100 levels. Grab a friend (or take on the challenge solo), jump into your Cyanitizer and Yellowizer battle craft, buckle up and warm up the four-directional bug-blasting pesticide cannons. This is going to be one hell of a trip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One year on, the bugs are back, and this time they are in full colour! Improving on the high-res character based graphics of the original, 2007's Redrunner challenges the player with an all new and improved 100 waves of chaos. Lock 'n' load!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits&lt;br/&gt;Aleksi Eeben: Programming, graphics, music&lt;br/&gt;Twoflower: Greenrunner Logo&lt;br/&gt;Glenn Rune Gallefoss: Redrunner Title Music&lt;br/&gt;Elaine Walker: Voice in Greenrunner&lt;br/&gt;Antti Hukkanen: Voice in Redrunner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
