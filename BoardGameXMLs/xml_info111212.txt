			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set of tiles was designed to help the GM keep track of the different conditions of the characters and creatures in a scene. Like our other tile sets, the squares (with the exception of enlarged) are just under and inch on each side so they fit easily on 1&amp;quot; gridded maps. Use with our Monster Tile Set (make the %u201Cmonster tile set text a link to that page) or in conjunction with miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conditional Tiles are lightweight, store in very little space, durable, and quick to set up. When you're done, just scoop them into a box or bag and you're ready to go. Perfect for convention gaming!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set contains:&lt;br/&gt;Ability damaged, Energy drained, Knocked down, Ability drained, Enlarged, Mirror Image, Blind, Entangled, Nauseated, Blink, Exhausted, Paralyzed, Blown away, Fascinated, Petrified, Checked, Fatigued, Pinned, Confused, Flat-Footed, Prone, Cowering (2), Flying (2), Shaken, Dazed, Frightened, Sickened, Dazzled, Grappling, Stable, Dead, Hasted, Staggered, Deaf, Helpless, Stunned, Dying, Invisible (2), Turned, Displaced, Incorporeal, Unconscious&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
