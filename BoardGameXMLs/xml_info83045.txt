			<description>From Inside the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 unique cultures await your command as you take your clans through over 600 years of history. Starting in 843 AD when the first Scottish King, Kenneth McAlpin, united the Pict and Scot empires to become the Kingdom of Alba. 400 years later, Edward I, known as the &amp;quot;Hammer of the Scots&amp;quot;, engulfed the land in a great feud. It was not long before Edward I controlled most of Scotland. The Scots, led by William Wallace and Robert the Bruce, are left to fight what seems to be a futile war for freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Heroes: Each clan is led into battle by heroes with special talents including the ability to add power.&lt;br/&gt;     Real-Time Weather: Changes in season have a direct influence on game events and play a large part in game strategy. Units move slower across snow-covered land and some mountain passes are inaccessible during winter.&lt;br/&gt;     Master Craftsman System: Upgrade your peasants to make them experts at a particular task (farming, logging, mining, herding, or building). Master Craftsmen perform their particular task faster, while becoming slower at all other tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
