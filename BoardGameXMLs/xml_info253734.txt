							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Executive Order</name>
									
			<description>You're a fresh Commander-In-Chief spending your first day in The Oval Office. There are a million promises you need to keep that you made on the campaign trail, but there's one that echoes through those who've supported you: build the wall. The only problem is there are those who want to do it before you and take all your glory. But you can't let that happen, you're the greatest! Nobody is better than you.&lt;br/&gt; Executive Order is a game of quickness and trolling as you fight to complete your wall before your competitors. But will you go straight for the glory and complete your wall? Or will you instead make it as difficult as possible for your competitors to complete theirs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use cards to create strategic moves and shuffle things around. Don&amp;rsquo;t like your current hand? Play &amp;ldquo;Alternative Facts&amp;rdquo; and draw a new one. Somebody put down a Wall card before you? Play &amp;ldquo;Congress&amp;rdquo; to have it taken away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ideal for 2-7  players 13 and over. Gameplay averages 30 minutes or more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Executive Order, the goal for players is to be the first to have three active Wall cards in front of them on the table. Players take turns by playing a card from their hand, resolving its action, and then drawing back up to their hand size. Some cards that can be played include &amp;quot;Wall&amp;quot; cards, &amp;quot;Budget Cuts&amp;quot; (reduces a players hand size by one card), &amp;quot;Congress&amp;quot; (removes an active wall card from in front of a player), &amp;quot;Deport&amp;quot;  (cancels a players card and returns it to their hand), or &amp;quot;Umm, No!&amp;quot; (cancels a players turn). Players can even debate on the table by creating a stack of &amp;quot;Deports&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Ummm, Nos&amp;quot; until someone claims victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can also add  new rules by playing the &amp;quot;Executive Order&amp;quot; card. But be careful, a &amp;quot;Court Ruling&amp;quot; card can put your rule to a vote to see if it remains or a player can play &amp;quot;AltTwit@ExeOrder&amp;quot; to exempt themselves from the rule!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
