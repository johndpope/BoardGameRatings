							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spaceship Ping</name>
									
			<description>Spaceship Ping was once a thriving independent spaceport, now rival companies fight for control of the singular central robot control panel in an effort to arrange shipping containers and meet the demands of the struggling space colonies. The company that can earn the most money will also earn sole control of Spaceship Ping!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spaceship Ping offers a combination of worker placement, movement &lt;br/&gt;programming, trading and a brand  new 3 dimensional spatial puzzle &lt;br/&gt;element that will have gamers  thinking in new ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must compete for action spaces needed to rearrange their &lt;br/&gt;container stacks, while also being attentive to the cargo in the center stack and their opponents piles. The player who can find the patterns and ship the most valuable combinations will take the lead, but trade is important, so careful strategy is needed - after all no one likes to help a front runner increase their lead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
