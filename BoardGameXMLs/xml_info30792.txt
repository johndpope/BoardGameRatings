			<description>Adversaries was GDW's series of additional detailed game components (miniatures really) for the many titles under the Space:1889 Banner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Martian Cloudships (GDW 1801)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set of miniature plastic Martian cloudships. The box contains several additional sprues of the Martian Cloudships, identical to the single sprue contained in Sky Galleons of Mars. The true genius here was including kit bashing instructions so that avid players could convert these stock miniatures into other cloudships detailed in yet other Space: 1889 (Original edition) products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands: Sky Galleons of Mars and Ironclads and Ether Flyers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aerial Gunboats (GDW 1802)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A similar set of plastic British aerial gunboats. In this case, additional sprues of the British Gunboats from Sky Galleons of Mars with kit bashing instructions to create other gunboats detailed in Space: 1889 (Original edition).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands: Sky Galleons of Mars and Ironclads and Ether Flyers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victorian Adventurers (GDW 1821)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set of ten 25mm figures created by RAFM to replace the pawns in Temple of the Beastmen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intrepid Victorian adventurers penetrate the inner sanctum of a High Martian kraag, the mountain fortresses cut from the living stone of tall mesas by the savage winged High Martians.  Each adventurer strives to be the first to fight his way through to the heart of the kraag and discover the sinister Worm Priests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands: Temple of the Beastmen, Soldier's Companion, and Cloudships &amp; Gunboats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kraag Warriors (GDW 1843)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set of twenty 25mm figures (in 10 poses) created by RAFM for use with Temple of the Beastmen and the related role-playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands: Temple of the Beastmen, Soldier's Companion, and Cloudships &amp; Gunboats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soldiers of the Queen (GDW 1841)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set of eighteen 25mm figures (in 10 poses) created by RAFM for use with Soldier's Companion and the related role-playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands: Soldier's Companion and Cloudships &amp; Gunboats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legions of Mars (GDW 1842)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set of twenty 25mm figures (in 10 poses) created by RAFM for use with Soldier's Companion and the related role-playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands: Soldier's Companion and Cloudships &amp; Gunboats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
