			<description>Abandoned by your friends, you leave for the day to tear up a new part of the mountains on your quad bike. It feels good to be outdoors. The wind whipping past makes you feel alive. You weave between the sparse trees. Then, a harsh pain across your chest. There was a cable tied between those last two trees! The bike keeps going, but you are stopped mid-air. Then you fall into darkness. You wake up dazed. There is a woman outside digging...but digging what? It doesn't feel right. You have to get out of here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover the secrets of the town of Erusal, escape a horrible maniac, and get spooked by this epistolary horror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best experienced alone, in a dark room, and while wearing headphones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
