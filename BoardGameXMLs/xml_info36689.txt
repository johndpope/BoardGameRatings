			<description>Each player has an individual pad of paper with a 6x6 grid, with help areas around. This grid will be filled with letters, and all players will use the same set of letters. The aim is to create as many and as long words as possible, with big increases in points for longer words (number of points equals squared word length).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you roll 4 x d20 dice (custom ones, with letters + wildcard). You can pick three to roll again, then two out of those three to roll again, and finally a single one out of the last two for a final roll. Each die has a different distribution of letters on the sides (overview included), so if you need an &amp;quot;F&amp;quot; to complete a word, you need to roll the dice that have at least one side with &amp;quot;F&amp;quot;, but might keep a die with a letter you have use for in another spot. After rolling you choose one die, the letter on its top side must immediately be written by each player in their respective grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the grid is full (36 turns, all become full at the same time), calculate points. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some advanced rules with a timer are also included. The intention is to limit thinking time = waiting time to 30 seconds, and while doing so it adds an extra edge of stress to game. It can be used as much as the players like, from very aggressively for a speedy game to not at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.korso.se/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.korso.se/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
