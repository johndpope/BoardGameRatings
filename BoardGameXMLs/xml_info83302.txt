			<description>From the Book's Opening Paragraph:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to &amp;quot;Made Men,&amp;quot; the fifth installment of the Gloria Mundi chronicle for Mage: The Awakening. This story continues the characters' investigation of the Vice-spirits and puts them in perhaps the most physically precarious position they've been in thus far as one of the spirits sets them up to die. The characters also witness the power that these spirits can wield given time and opportunity, and the terrible fate that can befall even one of the powerful Awakened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from their quest to find and destroy the Vicespirits, the characters also gain a bit of insight into what happened to Adam, though not enough for them to find and aid him. They do, however, gain a great advantage over the spirits in the form a magical item Adam discovered before disappearing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
