							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Beginning</name>
									
			<description>The first main release of Game Production Workshop LLC's &amp;quot;Operational Combat Model System&amp;quot; (OCMS) series following the earlier release of the introductory game Auspicious Beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beginning is designed to allow players to examine and experiment with the military events and conditions in the Polish campaign and in the West from September 1939 through March of 1943. The players can play several scenarios, or play out the full time framed. &lt;br/&gt;The game system is focused at the operational level commander, but the use of many rules features brings a high level of &amp;lsquo;tactical&amp;rsquo; effects into consideration without creating a high level complexity for the players.&lt;br/&gt;The combat system especially is designed to reduce mathematics and speed play, both for ground forces, and with the &amp;lsquo;no die roll&amp;rsquo; air-to-air and antiaircraft system for the aviation actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OCMS is designed to be a constant rule, constant rating system that can link together all games in a series to allow for strategic levels of actions, this in effect is the linking of various theaters so the actions and outcomes in one  theater can show impact in others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OCMS does this by having a solid core of rules (24 pages) that is standard for all the games in each series. In the end, the World War II series will allow players to make transfers of forces not only inside theaters, but globally, for example divisions can be transferred from Europe to the Pacific (or in the other direction) as all units are consistently rated for movement, and combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
