			<description>Warcard: Afganistan is a two player card game. One player will play as Talibans, the other as a group of Polish soldiers who get ambushed by the Afghans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the game each player will pick several characters that will represent his forces. The goal of the game is to gain victory points by killing the opponents characters. Stronger characters will be of more use during the game but will also give the opponent more points once killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lasts four rounds and each round last three phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Straighten + draw phase&lt;br/&gt;Each player straightens his characters so he can use them in the new round. Also each player draws cards until they have four cards in hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Action phase&lt;br/&gt;In the action phase players can perform actions until both of them decide to pass. For an action they can play a card from their hand (events or attachments), use an ability of a character or shoot using one of their characters. Each character can shoot once per action phase. &lt;br/&gt;When a character shoots players form an &amp;quot;exchange fire&amp;quot; pool by adding into it two &amp;quot;miss&amp;quot; cards and as many &amp;quot;hit&amp;quot; cards as is indicated on the shooting characters card. Now players can manipulate the &amp;quot;exchange fire&amp;quot; pool by playing cards that add either &amp;quot;hit&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;miss&amp;quot; cards. When both players don't want to play anymore cards they randomly pick one card from the pool. If it is a &amp;quot;miss&amp;quot; nothing happens, if it is a &amp;quot;hit&amp;quot;  the shot character loses one life point. If his life points are reduced to 0 he dies and victory points are awarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Discard phase&lt;br/&gt;Each player may discard one card from his hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the fourth round the player with the most victory points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If players own more than one copy of Warcard: Afganistan they can build their own decks before the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
