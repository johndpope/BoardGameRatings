							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pizza To Go: The Pizza Pickin&#039; Card Game</name>
									
			<description>User summary: In each round of this card game, players simultaneously try to collect a set of four matching pizza-topping cards. Players start with four cards in their hand. The dealer takes a new card and discards any unwanted card from his hand to the player to his or her left. That player then discards to the left and play continues (the dealer continuing to pick up and discard) with the last player forming a discard pile in front of them. When a player collects a set of four, that player grabs a pizza box from the center of the table. There is always one fewer pizza boxes than there are players, so each round eliminates one player. Last player standing wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
