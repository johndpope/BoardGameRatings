							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Exeter: Tramp Freighter</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exeter is a family owned and operated tramp freighter that has been in service for more than 50 years. Designed by the same shipyards that produced the Clydesdale class gunboat, this vessel was built from the ground up to haul cargo and passengers efficiently throughout civilized space. It is far from luxurious but the service is decent and ship runs on time. It has developed a reputation for dependability and a no-questions-asked policy when it comes to custom charters to out of the way locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At 228 feet long, this PL-6 freighter has room for a crew of up to eight as well as twenty passengers in the default configuration. There are also freight-only and passenger-only variants, both of which can be represented using the standard map pages. Exeter comes with a 30 ton, five person skiff and a pair of handy robots to help with the more tedious jobs. Wherever you need to go, Exeter can take you there!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     19 page PDF file detailing the ship, interior locations, and personnel.&lt;br/&gt;     Open Game License stats provided for the vessel and crew, as well as the shuttle craft and an armed configuration.&lt;br/&gt;     Map Book&lt;br/&gt;         Full-color 25 page PDF file containing complete interior maps.&lt;br/&gt;         Includes miniature-scale maps for tactical combat.&lt;br/&gt;         Miniature-scale composite maps of the ship interior.&lt;br/&gt;         A 24x36 inch, 150 dpi, color JPEG image of the upper two decks.&lt;br/&gt;         A 24x36 inch, 150 dpi, color JPEG image of the lower two decks.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
