							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hi-Ho! Cherry-O VCR Game</name>
									
			<description>(from back of box)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Children will be charmed and challenged as they play this delightful counting game which combines live-action and animation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Puppet host Farmer Bing gives simple step-by-step directions, guiding children through three different picking sessions.  After setting up the game, little or no adult assistance is required.&lt;br/&gt;-10 of Farmer Bing's animal friends star in fun-filled animated sequences featuring the Farmer's toe-tapping theme song.&lt;br/&gt;-Every game is unique because random play elements assure that no two games will ever play exactly the same.&lt;br/&gt;-There's educational as well as entertainment value as children pick cherries, and are then shown how to count them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
