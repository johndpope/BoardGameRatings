			<description>Bejeweled 3 is a puzzle video game developed and published by PopCap Games. It is the fifth game of the multi-selling Bejeweled franchise yet the officially third title. The game was released as a digital download on December 7, 2010, featuring a variety of 4 new gameplay modes (plus 4 old ones from Bejeweled 2), high-definition graphics and sounds as well as all-new 65 badges to achieve in game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core objective of the game is essentially the same as the previous installments in the series. Players are supposed to swap one gem with an adjacent one to form a chain of three or more gems of the same color. When this occurs the gems disappear and a new bunch of gems which are randomly generated drop from above to fill up the empty space. When falling gems automatically line-up a chain reaction known as a cascade is caused. Unlike earlier versions, players can now matching other gems during a chain reaction. In addition to high-definition graphics, new sound effects and the ability to match more than one set of gems at one time (a key feature that debuted in Bejeweled Blitz). Bejeweled 3 also has a badge system, with some of the badges reserved for the most elite gem matchers.&lt;br/&gt; 8 modes of gameplay are available in the game including 4 new modes as well as 4 traditional modes from Bejeweled 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bejeweled 3&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
