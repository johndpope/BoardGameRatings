			<description>Sumio Mondo is a &amp;quot;searcher&amp;quot; who makes a living looking for people's lost things. He arrives on the Micronesian resort island of Lospass and takes a room at the Flower, Sun, and Rain hotel after being tasked with detecting and defusing a bomb, planted on a plane which is soon to leave the island's only airport. On the way to the airport however, Mondo encounters other hotel guests and island residents requesting his help with various problems, including searching for missing items. While Mondo is distracted by them, the airplane with the bomb on board takes off and explodes, crashing into the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next morning however, Mondo awakens in his hotel room and discovers that something strange has happened. He has not even departed for the airport yet, nor has the airplane explosion occurred. Mondo attempts to head to the airport to prevent the explosion, but again his sidetracking to help other guests leads to a repeat of the previous day's explosion. Mondo once again awakens in his hotel room before any of the day's events have taken place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was initially released for the PlayStation 2 in Japan on May 2, 2001. An enhanced Nintendo DS remake entitled Flower, Sun, and Rain: Murder and Mystery in Paradise was released on March 6, 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Flower, Sun, and Rain&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
