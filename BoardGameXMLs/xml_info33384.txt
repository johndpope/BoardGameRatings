			<description>Grand Slam by the Stoll Edwards Company is a card game that can be played by from 2 to 6 players. At the beginning of each hand trumps are selected by cutting the cards. The suits of this game are Stars, Circles, Diamonds and Squares. and each suit has cards numbered from 1 to 13. After the deal the dealer plays a card to the center of the table and each player follows in turn either playing a card of that suit or a trump card or a card of another suit. Highest card in the suit played wins the trick unless a trump is played and then the highest trump card wins the trick.   In this game the first 6 tricks are called 'Par'  which is similar to the first 6 tricks in Bridge being called 'Book' and do not score.  All tricks above 'Par&amp;quot; score 5 points each, A Small Slam (winning 12 tricks scores an additional 50 points while a Grand Slam scores and additional 100 points. Also  each #6 card won adds 5 points, each #10 card won adds 10 points and each #13  card won adds 15 points to your total.
