							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ship Plans Volume III - Primus</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This latest product in the new Ship Plans range for the B5 universe is a complete tour of one of the Centauri Republic's most feared warships: The awesome Primus-class battlecrusier in all its glory. The Primus became an instrument of terror as the resurgent Republic crushed the Narn and was then turned against the League of Non-Aligned Worlds. She would lead armies to victory and infamy, keep peace during the long twilight struggle of Drakh occupation and help champion the Republic's liberation and redemption in eyes of the galaxy. Through it all, the Primus would remain a symbol, and a reflection of, the Centauri Republic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primus Ship Plans takes you through every aspect of this figurehead of the Centauri fleet - every bulkhead, generator and weapon system. Painstaikingly researched from both the B5 canon universe and real-life naval and space vessels, every deck on the ship has a full, detailed and to-scale schematic, along with accompanying descriptions and explanations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
