							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Last Stand</name>
									
			<description>Last Stand is a cooperative board game in which players assume the role of action heroes holding their ground against a battalion of enemy forces.  Surrounded, the squad must work together in order to survive the onslaught and defeat the enemy forces' powerful general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game round, enemy Minions will randomly enter the board, surrounding the heroes. The heroes will then have the opportunity to retaliate from within their enclosed squad spaces.  Using a limited number of actions each round, the heroes must balance properly positioning themselves within the squad, and utilizing their unique, damaging character skills to take down their foes.  As the game progresses, powerful Lieutenants will join the fray, bolstering the enemy ranks with deadly abilities. If the heroes can hold out long enough and defeat all of the Lieutenants, the General will have no choice but to confront the heroes for a final showdown!  If the players can defeat the General before time runs out, victory will be theirs!&lt;br/&gt; With 6 different heroes to choose from, players will have many options at their disposal when dealing with each encounter. Should the Combat Medic blast an enemy into your Demolitionist's well-placed mine?  Maybe your Sharpshooter should use their 'Eagle Eye' skill to spot an enemy right in front of your close-quarters Brawler?  With dice driven combat, Last Stand is sure to challenge your inner tactician and keep you on the edge of your seat with every roll!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with over a dozen different Minions and Lieutenants, Last Stand includes several powerful Generals to test your wits against:  The Watcher, The Beast, and The Firestarter. Each General possesses special mechanics that will force you to alter your strategy and change the way you approach each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab your friends, assemble the team, and take a stand!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
