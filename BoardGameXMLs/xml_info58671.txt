			<description>Crossline is a mathematical game published in the october 2009 issue of Games Magazine. It's a pencil and paper game between two people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin by drawing a circle with ten dots evenly spaced around it (the spacing can be approximate).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player starts by drawing a straight line connecting any two dots that are not adjacent. After that, each player in turns draws a straight line that connects any two dots and that crosses exactly one (and only one) previously drawn line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who draws the last legal line is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
