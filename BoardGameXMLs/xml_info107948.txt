			<description>From the Beagle Bros Winter 1980-81 catalog:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four great magic tricks in one program--&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These four tricks, with a little help from you, will have them rolling on the rug. About the time they suspect that you (of all people) have something up your cuffs and have been pulling some fast ones with your Apple (which you have), you turn it over to the audience member and the computer still does the impossible!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four tricks are included--&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. PLENTY-QUESTIONS: Think of an object; the computer asks some key questions; the computer tells you what your object is. A real cage-rattler!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. CARD SCANNER: The computer reads cards through the TV screen. Just press any playing card against the screen and watch it work!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. NEXTWORD: Audience members test their wits on this one. Can they figure out what the Apple is up to? Most can't. Only you know its secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. 21 NUMBERS: An Apple switch on a mix-'em-up card trick that never fails!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
