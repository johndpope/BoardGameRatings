							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lorien Trust Guide To Rituals 2002</name>
									
			<description>User Summary: The magic system in the Lorien Trust Role-Playing game allows characters to cast instant spells or short rites fuelled by their individual power. But the possible effects that they can perform are limited by the spell lists that they have access to, and by the amount of power that they individually wield. Rituals are a more powerful type of magic that are not as limited in range and application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rituals are performed in a ritual circle: a special area that in character is a nexus of magical forces, and out of character is rigged with light, sound, and special effects systems. There is one circle at each of the large LT events run by Merlinroute Ltd, but not at any of the smaller events. Ritualists must book a slot in the circle in advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A ritual is led by one ritualist, and typically supported by a ritual team. Together they perform for ten to twenty minutes, and are then marked on their efforts. Scores are given for both entertainment value and for relevance to the effect that they are trying to produce. A combination of this score and the amount of power that the ritual team have brought to the circle determine how effective the ritual is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This guide was written for the second edition of Lorien Trust Role-Playing, to provide more detail on how to perform rituals. The core rulebook doesn't cover this topic at all, only giving the rules needed to allow a player to decide at character creation whether they can perform or support rituals. This rulebook is sufficiently generic that it is still valid for the third edition of the game system, and has not been superseded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The guide introduces the concept of rituals, and gives tips on how to perform them well. The rules are given from a player's point of view, so that they know what they generally need to do to succeed, but the underlying mechanics of exactly how the ritual score and power level determine the ritual effects are not disclosed. Thus experienced players that have performed many rituals are more likely to have a good idea of how to perform a successful ritual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also an example ritual in the guide, in the form of a complete script. This gives players a much better idea of how they work in practice, and a useful idea of what is realistic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
