							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Plunder</name>
									
			<description>Plunder is a vintage game with spiffy metal ships and metal coins, marred only by somewhat fuzzy rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the role of pirate ships and merchantmen in a race for the Treasure at the end of the board. Merchantmen pay tribute into the Treasure when they land on orange spaces; pirates pay when they land on green spaces. Players can take 5 Pieces of Eight as ransom out of the Treasure when they land on a Free Spot. They may also opt to pay any ship that passes them 3 Pieces of Eight or retreat their ship to the designated retreat point for that leg of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one player reaches the Treasure space by exact count, that player collects the Pieces of Eight and Doubloons amassed in the Treasure. One assumes that the game ends at this point and the player with the most value in coins is the winner, but the rules do not explicitly state this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
