							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tank Action in the Russian Civil War 1919</name>
									
			<description>(From the designer's website)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on the actual operational tank reports from the British Military Mission. This BMM provided the Whites under general Denikin some 57 MkV and 17 Whippet tanks, and a British manned DH9A bomber squadron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is very tactical with individual MkV, Whippet, Renault tanks, plus the Austin, Garford, Lanchester armour cars. DH9A aircraft,gunboats,weapons are also depicted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains one 11x17 map, 200+ counters and nine scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios depict the Russian 1st Tank Division in May 1919 thru March 1920, in action. It was because of the tanks that the Whites had made such rapid advances. Then, the Battle (Stalingrad) where British manned tanks and supported by DH9As captured the city in June.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
