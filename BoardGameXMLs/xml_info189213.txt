			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big Wheel challenges the skills, luck and determination of 1-8 players, pitting players against players and against the board itself!  The object of the game: to become a millionaire (or go broke) within the time allotted.  Easily understood directions.  Educational and fun for the entire family - year 'round!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big Wheel uses a patented movement which changes the economic conditions of the gameboard randomly among depression, recession, normal, inflation and super-inflation.  As a result players must change their strategy as the gameboard changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
