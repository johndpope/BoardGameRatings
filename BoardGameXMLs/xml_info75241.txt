			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiny Toon Adventures: Wacky Sports Challenge (or Tiny Toon Adventures: Wild &amp;amp; Wacky Sports in Europe and Tiny Toon Adventures: Dotabata Daiundoukai in Japan) is the second Tiny Toon Adventures-based game, released on the Super NES, released in 1994, and developed and published by Konami. It is known as Tiny Toon Adventures: Dotabata Daiundoukai in Japan. There is a Game Boy game that is also known by the same name, Tiny Toon Adventures: Wacky Sports Challenge. It's one of the few SNES Games to feature a SNES Multitap that can simultaneously play up to 4 Players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can choose to play as either Buster Bunny, Babs Bunny, Plucky Duck, or Dizzy Devil and participate in various Olympic-style events. There are four difficulty levels, each with about six to seven events each. Various events include bungee jumping, a chicken run, saucer throwing, and obstacle courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Boy Version (From Wikipedia)&lt;br/&gt;Tiny Toon Adventures: Wacky Sports Challenge was the third Tiny Toon Adventures-related game released on the Nintendo Game Boy. It was released in 1994 and was developed and published by Konami. There is a Super Nintendo game that is also known by the same name, Tiny Toon Adventures: Wacky Sports Challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Wacky Sports Challenge, you choose to play as either Buster Bunny or Babs Bunny and participate in your choice of sports activities, including baseball, soccer, or even tennis (but of course, with a toony twist.) As Buster, you can also play carnival games that characters like Shirley the Loon and Fifi Le Fume have set up, like a watergun gallery and beat the clock challenge featuring Elmyra Duff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Konami Code is used at the title screen, a level select feature becomes available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
