			<description>Score Game Points As The Swarm Surrounds You, Or Escape!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can travel down life through good deeds or bad deeds, but karma will follow you either way. In Swarm, your bestactic is to collect that bad karma now and swarm your opponents with karma crystals to get the win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 5th entry into the Karma Crystals game collection adds a zombie swarm type of game mechanic and a set of boards used to maneuver it against other players to win. You also get 10 new monster elemental cards for your collector&amp;rsquo;s deck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect elemental shards and karma crystals from the swarm, but be careful. You are limited on attacks against them. Use the swarm for your benefit, but don&amp;rsquo;t be caught by it as other players use it against you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you build your collection of elemental shards and karma crystals, you can trigger the end of the game, but be careful not to do this before you are sure of the win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the unique dice matching game mechanic, a unique auto player system is also used to facilitate up to EIGHT total players per game. The game also provides an easy way to track multiple game wins for playoffs in case you have more than 15 to 45 minutes to play depending on the number of players. No paper score cards and pencil needed. Your game score is determined by the number of elemental shards and karma crystals you score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
