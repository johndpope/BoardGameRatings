			<description>From website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witch Hunt is a Tabletop card game for 1-8 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a witch hunter, you make your way through the village of Ravenwicke discovering items, artifacts, and assistance in the most unexpected places. However, time is short. As ingredients are added to her cauldron, the witch gains power and tightens her grip on the village. Once all five of the ingredients have been added to the cauldron, the witch wins the game! So, it is of the utmost urgency that you find her before the last ingredient is added to her brew. Oh, and did we mention that one of you is actually the witch?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in the backdrop of the small village of Ravenwicke, Witch Hunt is a closed-deck (72+ cards) card game that features 3 modes of play. The Angry Mob mode for 3-8 players, a Player versus Player mode, and HERO mode for only the bravest of souls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The First Edition Deck is delivered in a sealed 3.5&amp;quot;x5&amp;quot; Telescoping Box and is our core deck of 72+ cards for playing Witch Hunt. The box also contains 8 oversized character cards, 2 six-sided dice, and 100 resource tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Family Edition brings a new dimension to hunting witches.
