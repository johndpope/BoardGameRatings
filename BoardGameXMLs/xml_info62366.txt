							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">True or False: skrapspel</name>
									
			<description>Solitary version based on the game True or False from 1994.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to correctly answer as many true/false statements as possible, so you can go as far as possible around the game board .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For every wrong answer you give you have to move closer to the center of the board. If you hit the center and you lose the game. On the other hand the track is shorter near the center. For each right answer, you may choose to move outwards as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version of the game is used after first play and can not be played again. &lt;br/&gt;To know if your answer is correct you have to scratch on the board and then the answer will appear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the back of the game you can compare your result to how the people from Europe have managed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
