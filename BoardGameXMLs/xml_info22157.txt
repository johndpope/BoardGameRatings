							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Namutoni</name>
									
			<description>On a board with 11 x 11 squares stands between the middle and one corner the fort NAMUTONI, built of 8 double-cube-sized cuboids: four corners/towers standing upright and four &amp;quot;walls&amp;quot; on the longer sides. So the fort has the size of a large 4 x 4 square enclosing 4 squares like a court.&lt;br/&gt;From the two sides of the boards opposing the fort two players start from given starting points with four &amp;ldquo;tourists&amp;rdquo; to reach the fort. &lt;br/&gt;The &amp;ldquo;tourists move in a kind of three-dimensional &amp;ldquo;knight-move&amp;rdquo;, so, after two steps on the same level it can jump one step vertically, or even after one step on the same level two steps vertically. This means that on the flat &amp;ldquo;desert&amp;rdquo; they have to cross first on their way to the fort, the figures are quite lame. For this there are four &amp;ldquo;helping stones&amp;rdquo;, which can be used as a stair. But you can not just put them wherever you want, but on the imaginary cross-points constituted by two movable strategic bars on the side of the board. Each of these bars contains three marks, so there are nine cross points where you can build &amp;ldquo;helping stones&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;In each turn a player can move one of his &amp;ldquo;tourists&amp;rdquo;, one &amp;ldquo;helping stone&amp;rdquo; or one bar to constitute new points.&lt;br/&gt;The player who first enters the fort with three of his figures, one of them on a tower, is winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
