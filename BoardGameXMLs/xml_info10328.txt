			<description>Think FAST. Run FASTER.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guard Duty is a squad-based, tactical survival game, designed for 2 to 5 players. The objective of the game is for each player to use a team of special forces Bodyguards that they draft to lead a VIP safely through the city to an escape, battling through a gauntlet of opposition and evading a relentless, invincible cybernetic hunter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All that you&amp;rsquo;ll need in order to play the game, other than this book, are a few simple decks of playing cards (1 for each player), the Jokers removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 39-page book contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Simple-to-learn mechanics for moving your squad of bodyguards through the city, and for combating those remorseless hordes of enemies (not to mention tossing a few of them in the way of your fellow competitors)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 15 fully fleshed-out, over-the-edge, play-balanced bodyguards (Like a cybernetically reconstructed Tyrannosaurus Rex with more gun mounts than a naval cruiser, or a living munitions depot for on-the-go arms distribution) for recruitment into each player&amp;rsquo;s 3-man squad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Easy-to-reference charts, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to stop to write anything down or flip back through the manual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 3 sheets of fully-colored counters, representing wounds, fatigue and in-game positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- An atmospheric setting chronology, in case you&amp;rsquo;re interested in what stakes are at hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game length averages from 1 to 2 and a half hours. Recommended for players 14 years of age or older.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
