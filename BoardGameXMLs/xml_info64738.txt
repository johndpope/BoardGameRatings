			<description>&amp;quot;Pur Week-End&amp;quot; is a French storytelling game in which players must discard cards to tell how awesome their week-end was, while trying to spoil their opponents' week-ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active player makes up a consistent story of his imaginary week-end by playing sets of 3 &amp;quot;Awesome Time&amp;quot; cards with matching symbols (for the time of the day). This could lead to surprising events : try to imagine a morning activity involving &amp;quot;Foam Bath&amp;quot; AND &amp;quot;Practical Joke&amp;quot; AND &amp;quot;Shared Secret&amp;quot;&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, the other players can play &amp;quot;Awful Time&amp;quot; cards to spoil their opponent's good time, as long as they manage to have it make sense with the story. The active player may then defend himself with a special card (&amp;quot;Magical Moment&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Wish Come True&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Heroic Action&amp;quot;), or even deflect the trouble back with &amp;quot;Revenge&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And if you can't live awesome times on your own, you can always crash other players' events !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player who plays a set of cards for each of the 4 times of the day : morning, afternoon, evening and night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 65 &amp;quot;Awesome Times&amp;quot;, 18 &amp;quot;Aweful Times&amp;quot;, 6 different &amp;quot;Magical Times&amp;quot; and a few special cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Translations of card names in this description are not official)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
