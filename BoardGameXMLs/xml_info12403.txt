			<description>Each player attempts to maneuver a colored marble up an incline using a curved slider.  The incline has plenty of holes in it allowing the marbles to fall through..  At the top of the tower is a platform which the marbles are stored.  The first player to get all five of his/her marbles in the cup is the winner.  As an extension, the publisher suggests continuing the game by getting each marble down the incline the same way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
