			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shadow sat awkwardly in the living room and looked at the father; it lurked in the corner of the daughter's room; it stood still in the shower, watching the mother dress. It leaned softly on the bed of the son and said, &amp;quot;Come to me, in the depths of the forest, and I will give you a happy life. Forget your anger, your sorrow, your hatred. In me is the beauty of the world that the artists forgot.&amp;quot;  The Shadow promised all this to the family, before they drove their red Subaru into the forest of suicides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aokigahara is about a Japanese family, living in a tent in the suicide forest of Aokigahara. Their souls are draw toward the shadow, even as they hunt for the truth about their lives - do they still have the will to live?  Or have they lost faith in life itself?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is brooding and dark, but holds the possibility that in the midst of the shadow, one can find faith in life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is distributed as two PDF files - a 36-page rules and scenario document, and an 8-page print-and-play character sheets document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
