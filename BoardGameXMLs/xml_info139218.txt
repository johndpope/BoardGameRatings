							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gold Hunt</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gold Hunt is an adventure game in which the player moves the character around a rectangular room collecting bags of gold.  A monster prowls the room constantly, so the character must stay out of sight by hiding behind blocks.  If the monster has a straight line of sight to the character, he's done for; the monster will rush in and kill him.&lt;br/&gt;Rooms are completed when all the bags of gold have been collected and the monster has been trapped in a place where it can no longer move even one space.  A doorway then appears to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
