							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Killer Bunnies Omega Series Cards</name>
									
			<description>Omega Cards are promotional cards distributed at conventions, bunny promotions and special bunny events. Some cards are distributed when you buy your game through Playroom Entertainment or from select retailers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omega Cards 1-12 are also included as part of Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot: Chocolate Booster, and are considered promotional cards for Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot.  Omega Cards 13 and onwards are considered promotional cards for Killer Bunnies and the Conquest of the Magic Carrot.  Omega Card 0 is considered a promotional card for both games, and comes with two different sets of artworks (one with a Quest back and one with a Conquest back).  This card was only available to Kickstarter backers of Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot Deluxe Limited Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See also: Killer Bunnies and the Conquest of the Magic Carrot: Promo Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Angry Nerds&lt;br/&gt;Omega 00: May be used once by a player to eliminate any one opponent's Bunny that forms a Bunny Triplet, including a Triple Speciality Bunny or a Triple Celebrity Bunny.
