			<description>From the introduction to the one-hour version:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first in a series of demonstration scenarios meant to introduce new players to the fun of Call of Cthulhu gaming. The scenario is designed to take approximately 45 to 60 minutes in total&amp;mdash;just long enough for a taster of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where necessary, specific examples of rules at various points in the story are referenced. . . . Advice on moving the story forward is also provided. The scenario is written to ensure that all players, no matter who is running the game, have a very consistent play experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While intended as a convention style taster game, you are free to use the story as a jumping off point for a longer game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction to the extended version:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an extended version of our popular one-hour demo scenario, designed to introduce new players to the fun of Call of Cthulhu gaming. The scenario&amp;rsquo;s normal one-hour time limit has been removed and up to six-players can be accommodated to provide everyone with a taster of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
