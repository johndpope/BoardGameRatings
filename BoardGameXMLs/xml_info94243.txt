			<description>Goal: Collecting all of those 8 remarkable qualities of a typical Swabian citizen - but none of them twice or more&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the eponymous book of the literary man 'Thadd&amp;auml;us Troll' you are deeply overwhelmed by the typical Swabian qualities like thriftiness, tidiness, sobriety, acquisitiveness, cleverness, agility, slyness, scorching criticism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collecting event-cards by rolling and moving (on a circle on the board) you are able to learn these qualities by studying their broad dialect, being confronted with -- sometimes weird -- subtle humour. If you picked up too many of those qualities,  -- which is going to happen -- you may get rid of them transferring those to your opponents who can't use them, too.&lt;br/&gt;These deals may increase the trouble  -- until the lucky one scores. &lt;br/&gt; It is recommended to consume a small portion of red wine during the game, called 'Viertele'; thus you may avoid loosing even your remaining 'confidence in mankind'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
