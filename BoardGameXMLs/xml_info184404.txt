							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">COSMOS: The Universal Role Playing System</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COSMOS - The Universal Role Playing System, is posted to the internet as a free download.  The document has no identification associated with it but the game is nonetheless a robust system.  It is intended to be a generic, universal roleplaying system adaptable to any genre.  It also supports multi-genre mashup campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are defined by Abilities, Races, Alignments, Levels, Ranks, and Skills.  Characters gain levels and &amp;quot;Character Points&amp;quot; by earning experience points.  Character Points are spent to purchase increased Ability scores or Skill ranks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have six Abilities, including:  Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.  Ability scores are randomly generated with 5d4 yielding 5-20.  The rules provide numerous derived game abilities based on specific Ability scores or ranges (for example, carrying capacity, attack bonus, defensive penalty, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters begin with 100-200 Character Points, randomly generated by 100+10d10 or 100+5d20.  Skills are then purchased, expending the Character Points pool.  Skills are limited by the GM based upon the genre desired for the campaign.  A character has a &amp;quot;Class&amp;quot;, but this is primarily descriptive text based upon character concept.  Alternately, the GM can link specific Skills to specific classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Race is selected by the character, limited only by the GM and the campaign.  Some races grant special access to innate racial skills or powers.  Alignment is also selected by the character, and follows the standard Lawful-Chaotic / Good-Evil dual-axis system, with the addition of &amp;quot;Amoral&amp;quot; (which is not available to characters).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters accumulate experience points based principally on combat or treasure.  Experience accumulates to certain discreet points at which time the character gains a Level, yielding Character Points which can immediately be spent on Skill ranks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Action Resolution system in the game uses a universal chart for everything.  A difficulty class, or Necessary Skill Roll, is determined and a character rolls percentile dice and adjust the roll by their Skill Rank.  Rolling under the target yield success.  Rules for automatic failure and automatic success, based on Level, are provided.  Character Resistance Rolls work much like Skill checks, but use a separate table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters gain Action Points which may be expended during combat to influence outcomes.  Characters purchase Damage Capacity which determine their ability to suffer wounds.  The rules also detail basic magic and psionic systems, with magic having numerous options and flavors.  Likewise, the rules detail a basic super power system with various options.  Finally, the rules have a miscellany of other areas to help flesh out a standard campaign game (for example, other plans, immortal beings, movement and time rules, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
