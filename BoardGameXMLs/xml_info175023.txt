			<description>&amp;quot;Sanzen-sekai no karasu wo koroshi, nushi to asane gam shitemitai&amp;quot; (translated as &amp;quot;I'd kill all the crows in the world to sleep with you in the morning&amp;quot;) is an old song sung at a red-light district in the mid-1800s by one guest: Takasugi Shinsaku, a central figure of the early Meiji Restoration who lived a turbulent life. The saying means, &amp;quot;When a crow cries, I must leave this place. Even if I must kill crows all over the world, I want to stay with you a little while longer.&amp;quot; The song expresses his longing for amorous time to be prolonged for even just a short while.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game Sanzen Sekai: I'd kill all the crows in the world to be with you a little longer, now titled Crows Overkill in its newest edition, players roleplay guests in a red-light district. Many birds gather in front of each player. The players must kill or move birds to prevent them from crying. If birds in front of a player cry, that player must leave the red-light district to go home (i.e. drop out of the game). The player who manages to stay in the red-light district for the longest time wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, players attempt to be the last one called away from the red-light district by the cry of crows, warblers, and roosters.  The game consists of two decks of cards &amp;mdash; birds and shamisen &amp;mdash; along with a time board. Each turn follows this sequence:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Cards are drawn from both decks. Birds are placed on the table in front of the current player, while shamisen cards go into their hand.&lt;br/&gt;    Shamisen cards are then played to eliminate birds.&lt;br/&gt;    A check is made against the time board to see whether the remaining birds cry and the current player is eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The turns continue until one player remains in the game and is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
