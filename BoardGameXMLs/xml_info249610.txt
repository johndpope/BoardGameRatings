							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goblin Warbands</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Few foes are as iconic a threat to the adventurer as the goblin, yet the monster manual contains but a measly two entries. In an attempt to rectify this blatant affront to goblinkind, presented herein are thirteen additional goblin threats to menace your party of adventurers. Inside, rather than unusual and obscure goblin builds, are what more formidable goblin foes are more likely to actually look like. There are no goblin monks or paladins here, but you will find several variants of goblin beastmasters, archers, sneaks, shaman, sorcerers, and brutes capable of presenting a challenge to a wide variety of parties.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Author Summary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
