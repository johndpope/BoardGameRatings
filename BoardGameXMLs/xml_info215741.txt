							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Imperii</name>
									
			<description>A fast-paced action filled strategy game where you as commander in chief should build a base to defend the last green park in the empire. The enemies will do all they can to breach your defence. Waves after waves of enemies will be thrown upon your walls. Will they last?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start the game with a green park and some gold. With the gold you should build a defense around the green park to defend it from monsters. The monsters will arrive at certain times in waves. By killing monsters, you get more gold to build further on your defense. Buildings can be upgraded for increased strength, range and shot speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Imperii you will meet 6 different kinds of monsters, and they all require special strategies to defeat. To defend, you can build 7 different kinds of turrets, from simple laser cannons to nova explosion triggers. You can also build barricades to force monsters walking into your defence. And energy cells to boost turrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
