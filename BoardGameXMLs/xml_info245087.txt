			<description>Game on! is a game released by Identity Games international as part of the Holland Casino Christmas bonus. It was given to all employees and special relations in the year of 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game combines trivia questions containing information on all sorts of subjects like sports, movies, history and many others, with a gambling mechanic in which players can bet on whether the other player gets the question right or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played in either teams or every player for themselves. On a players turn they spin the wheel selecting one of four categories: multiple choice, open question, versus question, or co-op question. They are rewarded with chips depending on whether they answered the question right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game inactive players can place bets, using their own accumulated chips, on whether the active player gets the question right or wrong (in the multiple choice and the open question categories) or which of the players (in the versus and co-op categories) gets the right answer. All bets are collected and payed out by the bank which one player will represent. The first player(s) to collect 50 chips is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
