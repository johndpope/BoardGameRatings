			<description>The village pond has frozen over and many people enjoy a lovely winter&amp;rsquo;s day, and so do the players. They slide across the ice and collect tiles for hot chocolate or gingerbread. If you have found three identical tiles you swap them at the corresponding booth for a golden victory point tile. In your turn you roll two dice and move in two different direction, but not to and fro, for each direction you use the result of one die. If you reach a tile and do not want to take it you turn it up, open tiles are covered again. If you take a tile you replace it with one from the bag, and your turn ends. Action tiles you pick up you can use in your next turn. When two booths are empty, you win with the highest score from your victory point tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
