			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greetings Earthens!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a time of opportunity. When the galaxy was oppressed by the Blood Empire, there was little room for anyone who operated on the &amp;ldquo;outside.&amp;rdquo; But when the Phol invaded, the imperial chains broke and every criminal worth their blaster came to pick the bones. Now the imperial tyranny is dead, but it&amp;rsquo;s the barbarian and the outlaw who rules this new age. But you aren&amp;rsquo;t the hero of this story, because there are no good guys warping in from across the system&amp;rsquo;s edge to save the day. You are a Skumbag, one of the myriad of desperados, brigands and rogues seeking fame, profit and thrills. The galaxy is waiting for the next bully ruthless enough to put their boot to its throat and all of it can be yours, so long as you are brave enough to take it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are you waiting for&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go get them, Skumbag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Core Edition features expansive rules and background for the fallen blood empire, including multiple modes of combat, a detailed list of species-creation and character-customization options, easy to use technology varations and a wide collection of other enhancements to your roleplay experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
