			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator's lot is not an easy one; here are a few more reasons why. From Golden Gate Park to an oil rig in the South China Sea, no place is safe from the insidious tendrils of the Cthulhu Mythos. Here are four opportunities to thwart the horror, and to right terrible wrongs inflicted upon the innocent. A tough job, but only you can do it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four scenarios and nearly 30 handouts create hours of gaming and puzzle solving as players travel across the globe to test their mettle against the worst the Mythos has to offer. Within these pages are confrontations with the dread Spider God, a Celtic legend come to life, and a woman obsessed with revenge - who may very well prove the most deadly of all! Also included is a brief bonus scenario that offers a new reason to be terrified of roller coasters...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
