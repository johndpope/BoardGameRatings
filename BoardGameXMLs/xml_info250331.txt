			<description>More Rapperdalja (More Balderdash) is a new Swedish variant of Balderdash and it was released only in Sweden by Casper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two changes in this version that differ from Balderdash. The game board is shorter with only ten squares and the dice has a symbol instead of number six. If the symbol is rolled then it is instead the answer that is being read and the players must enter the word that is searched for. Otherwise, it is the same rules as in Balderdash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
