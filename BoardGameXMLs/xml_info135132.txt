			<description>From Published Sources&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Supplement 2: Robot Adventures is a complete game supplement for the Traveller role-playing game. This supplement is suitable for adventures and background material for any version of Traveller, and can be used anywhere in the Traveller Universe. The robot statistics are Open Game Content that can be easily translated into any version of the Traveller system, while the rest of the supplement remains relatively system-free for ease of use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What good is a roleplaying game without adventures? Special Supplement 2: Robot Adventures is an Avenger supplement filled to the brim with robot-themed adventures. Within this exciting Avenger supplement, you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     16 Patron Encounters that explore the presence and use of robots within the Official Traveller Universe;&lt;br/&gt;     4 Mercenary Tickets, allowing Referees to pit their mercenary players against robotic opponents in battles in the Far Future;&lt;br/&gt;     2 Amber Zone adventures, for Referees that prefer a little more detail in their robotic-themed adventures;&lt;br/&gt;     And five new robots to add to your games, featured in the adventures found within this adrenaline-charged supplement, such as a Counselor/Companion Robot, a Hunter/Tracker-Bot, two Warbots, and an Armed Courier Robot. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robot Adventures is an exciting supplement designed to provide Referees and their Players with adventures for many an evening of fun and entertainment. It is the perfect compliment to its companion volume, Special Supplement 1: Robots of Charted Space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author Quote: &amp;quot;I wrote Robot Adventures because I know that Referees have lives, and I felt that a product filled with adventures and ideas would make game preparation easier for our busy Refs 'Behind The Screen'. Having new material is great, but providing a way to use the new material in-game makes it that much more valuable. I hope that this supplement provides gamers with more opportunities to have some fun and adventuring experiences, using scenarios that feel more like science fiction rather than dungeon crawling.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
