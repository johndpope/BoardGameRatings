			<description>Victory Under Sail (VUS) is a quick-playing miniatures game of fleet naval battle during the last century of the age of sailing warships.  It is designed for a small number of players to recreate the larger battles of this era in a reasonable time.  It is not an overly simple game, but it is designed to have simple and quick mechanics to speed play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each side has a fleet of ships (represented by counters or miniatures) subdivided into squadrons.  VUS is based on squadron maneuvers rather than individual ship movement, although each ship is individually moved within the requirements of the planned maneuver.  The movement system uses a true 12-direction movement system on a hex grid that is unique among games of this genre.  Squadron maneuver cards and random event cards recreate the challenges of command &amp;amp; control of a fleet of sailing warships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VUS uses a &amp;ldquo;Hordes o&amp;rsquo;Dice System&amp;rdquo; for combat that is based on the use of different types of dice to represent various types of cannon batteries.  The dice mimic the results of a traditional combat results table without the need to reference charts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes more than 30 scenarios from 3 wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
