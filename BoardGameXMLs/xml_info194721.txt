			<description>Miner Assault is a Space Marine themed, small-scale, medium strategy, hex and counter battle game designed to be played in under 2 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2525 and the space mining boom is a bloody race for riches.&lt;br/&gt;       &lt;br/&gt;Corporations send elite teams of armed miners to far off planets where they fight to the death for a chance to strike it rich mining pure Mercurine ore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;Miner Assault is a 2-4 player race to mine 6 Ore and bring them back to your base before your opponent(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turns consist of 2 rounds; Movement then Combat, and the order of play is decided by team size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving all (or as many as they wish) of their pieces, making sure not to move them too far.  Any piece that moves it's maximum distance becomes Fatigued and cannot attack during the combat round that turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once every player has had a chance to move their pieces/units, the combat round begins, continuing in the same turn order as the movement round.  A new turn order is decided at the end of every combat round by adding up the number of HP chips each player has on the board.  The player with the most chips moves first and play order moves in descending HP order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resources are now doled out designated by the surviving units and the tiles on which they did the surviving.  Play continues until only one player is left (not very likely) or a player successfully brings 6 Ore back to their base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
