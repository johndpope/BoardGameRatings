			<description>Subtitle: A Character Collection for HARP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Bring your campaign to life with Friends and Rivals: A Character Collection for HARP a compilation of twenty-four highly individual and comprehensively described characters. Each is revealed in terms of physical description, background, and possessions, both mundane and magical. Where appropriate, further notes detail special aspects of the character, such as spell sphere listings for clerics. Each writeup is also illustrated by a splendid black &amp;amp; white portrait.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All 24 characters have also been fully implemented as HARP characters, consistent with and fully compliant with the HARP rules as published in HARP (Revised), Martial Law, and College of Magics. Contributors used either the original Microsoft Excel or the Open Office version of Jonathan Dale's HARP character generation spreadsheet to create the characters. Each character is represented in statistical terms by ten spreadsheets, one for each level from 1st to 10th. Five characters (the Gryx Ranger, the Halfling Rogue, the Human Cleric (Combat), the Human Elementalist and the Human Warrior Mage) are in Open Office format; all others are in Excel format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GMs may use these characters as NPC allies or opponents to help or hinder the player-characters; alternatively GMs may allow players to use and/or adapt these characters into ready-to-run PCs for demo games, convention play, or even long-term campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
