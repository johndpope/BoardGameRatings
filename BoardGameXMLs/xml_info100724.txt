							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Counter: Real Time Miniature Combat</name>
									
			<description>Counter is a miniature game that lets you assemble a squad of troops that meets your requirements and then pit them against your opponents in real time.&lt;br/&gt;Played in 30 second rounds, players race their miniatures over the contested hot-spots of the battle field while targeting and throwing out cover fire as best they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But speed and reflex must be tempered with strategy and patience.&lt;br/&gt;Expend more resources than your opponents and they will get the drop on you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But perhaps your squad has an ace or two up it's sleeve?&lt;br/&gt;Did you bring more gunners than your opponent to likely win any fire fight? Or perhaps you opted to bring Heavies to devastate the battlefield and control the field of play? Or maybe you decided to unleash the kind of tactics and tricks that only your Ops can bring to a squad?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In any case, the battle will be fast a vicious, and leave you with plenty to consider and tinker with before the next battle begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play for Counter consists of 30 second rounds of frantic live action troop maneuvers performed by all players simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;Strategy and nerve must be used to lay out your action chips on the zones marked out in the battle field, as their placement will allow for different actions to take place:&lt;br/&gt;- place them down in a zone and you can then move a troop on top of them, provided you can get him there fast enough&lt;br/&gt;- place your chip on top of another players chip to lay down cover fire, preventing an enemy entering that zone.&lt;br/&gt;- use your chips to target the troops in a zone, then get your troops in range to finish them off.&lt;br/&gt;- reserve your chips to build up your intuitive and get the drop on other combatants, firing before they do. &lt;br/&gt;All of these actions and more take place fluidly, and then the action resolves in a snap when the timer chimes, then in a flash it continues on in subsequent rounds until the battle field is secured or left devastated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dynamic real time action system along with team construction and the various orders and tactics that players can field with Op cards ensures every game of Counter will demand thought and instinct of a high caliber from all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
