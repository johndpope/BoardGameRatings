			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this 3D game the player controls a bouncing ball. It bounces on one of the levels which are hanging above each other in open space. When the ball rolls off, one life is lost. On each platform, a puzzle had to be solved, before an automatic elevator will take the ball to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The puzzles are similar in concept. The player must deactivate two grey boxes set a distance apart from each other. Touching a box with the ball turns it white and deactivates it for a short length of time. &lt;br/&gt;To complete the puzzle, the player must get his ball over to the other grey box and turn this white also before the first block turns grey again. &lt;br/&gt;Besides the extremely short deactivation time limit, each puzzle has various antagonists, some animated some not. Some will try to bump the ball of the platform, others will shoot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a new game is started, a new set of puzzles/platform layouts is generated, so no two games are alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
