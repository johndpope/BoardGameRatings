							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Survival Terror</name>
									
			<description>Another free game from DaVinci games.  This game attempts to recreate the horror and tension from Romero's Living Dead movies in a tongue-in-cheek way.  Using hex maps, the player is put into a house, shopping mall or army base where they are fighting for their lives against zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not an actual game, but a humoristic take on zombie games hosted in a issue about funny games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was available in the free web magazine GiocAreA OnLine (former partner of daVinci Editrice) as a promotional tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
