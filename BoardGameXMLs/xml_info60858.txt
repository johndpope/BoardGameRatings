			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the War of a Thousand Battles, the merfolk and aquatic elves thought they'd completely exterminated the sahuagin menace from their cavernous homes on the Western Shelf. But a few of the sahuagin survived, and bred, and hated the merfolk and the elves for their attempt to exterminate their race. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now they've massed an army, and the roar of their underwater ballista rock the northern walls of the merfolk kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, get a ring from the king of the merfolk while all this is going on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War in the Deep is a 4-encounter D&amp;amp;D 4th Edition heroic tier adventure that's been designed so it can be scaled for 1th through 9th level adventurers. The climax can fit into part of a larger quest or campaign, or the story can be left as a one-shot adventure. It's designed to be highly flexible, easy to run, and exciting for players and DM alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each monster is presented in three variations, one for 1st level adventurers, one for 5th level, and one for 9th level. As a result, it's easy to tweak the monsters for any party from 1st to 9th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, each piece of dialogue is presented in two columns: a carefully-written piece of dialogue that you can read as &amp;ldquo;boxed text,&amp;rdquo; and a detailed summary that you can customize according to your preferred speech patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes both portrait (for easy printing) and landscape (for easy reading on a laptop) sections. The full-color artwork and maps have been carefully color-corrected to print perfectly on color and black-and-white printers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
