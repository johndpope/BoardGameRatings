			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hive is a game set in a world that has been taken over by mobs under the control of an alien mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometime in the late 1960s, London Transport undercovered an alien spacecraft while excavating an extension at the Hobs Lane underground station. There was a lot of publicity about the discovery of Martians in London. However, it ended when a force in the craft awakened. The force took over the minds of those nearby, and welded them into a mob dedicated to killing any who would not join them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mob had strange psychic powers that they grew as more joined them. Only a few were immune. The influence of the mobs grew, until no place on Earth was safe. Then, they set about rebuilding the Earth in the image of their masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few of the immune have survived.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
