			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join us on a voyage among the stars for Cosmic Odyssey: Pirates of the Starstream!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cosmic Odyssey is a line of Starfinder Roleplaying Game compatible products designed to give you, as both a player and as a gamemaster, all the tools you need to fully explore a classic motif of science fiction with new character options, equipment and vessels, as well as a location and NPCs. Designed to be dropped into your existing game, or to serve as a starting point for your adventures, each Cosmic Odyssey is ready-made for action. In Pirates of the Starstream we bring you to 8-Pieces Port, a safe haven to criminals that caters to the corsairs and buccaneers of the spaceways. Included in this book are new themes such as the brute and rogue, new drone options for mechanics, a new spell, new equipment for boarding and ramming, new sample starships like the gunboat, and several NPCs for you to drop into your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
