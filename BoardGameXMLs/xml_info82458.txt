			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moonbase Alpha is a game published by NASA that places the player in control of a futuristic permanent Moon settlement. The outpost has been damaged by a meteorite strike, and the player needs to repair the damaged equipment and restore oxygen supply to the base. The game includes both single-player and LAN or internet multiplayer options, and can be played with up to six people on a team.
