			<description>Return to the Sky is a side-scrolling platformer that has players attempting to escape the maw of an ever hungry beast. You play as Polaris, the north star, who has witnessed all of her fellow stars be ripped from their place in the sky by the civilization below, to be used as a new source of power. Eventually, the society below is forced to abandon their beloved city after it succumbs to pollution. Unable to stay in the sky, Polaris is torn from her home by the monster and now must escape it before it can consume her. Polaris must navigate the city's rooftops, collecting the other fallen stars so they too can Return to the Sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
