			<description>From the Back of the Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Japanese hentai bishoujo (adults only) game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I am Raidy, wandering this continent of Else far and wide as an adventurer. I can freely bend the power of thunder to my will, so people have taken to calling me the &amp;quot;Lightning Warrior&amp;quot;. Why am I standing here in front of this tower, you ask? The cause lies in the village of Saad that I visited recently. I got there to find it in decay, deserted and transformed almost completely into a ghost town...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Apparently it became that way due to the monsters living in this tower. They'd been stealing away all of the young maidens from the village, and none of the men who went to rescue them ever returned... a harsh and terrible tale. Being who I am I couldn't hear that story and stand by idle, so now I find myself here, facing the tower...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Lighting Warrior Raidy, you take the role of Raidy in this first person RPG dungeon crawl, aiding her on her quest to clear the Kyubast tower of the monsters that dwell within and liberate the village of Sadd. Featuring hours of classic 3D RPG-style game play, dozens of beautifully drawn monster girls from artist Kazuma Muramasa, and strong yuri (lesbian) themes for a unique erotic RPG adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
