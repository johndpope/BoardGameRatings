			<description>You are survivors of the town of Ember. The Djiran demons have&lt;br/&gt;opened a rift that begins to corrupt the land. You have fled to the&lt;br/&gt;town of Havenfall with the few items and treasures you salvaged&lt;br/&gt;from your home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this deck-building game each player starts with the same ten&lt;br/&gt;cards. Players use their cards to perform one of the following&lt;br/&gt;actions during their turn: buy cards, fight monsters, or trash cards.&lt;br/&gt;Each player builds their own unique deck with their purchases.&lt;br/&gt;When a player buys a card, it is placed in their discard pile. When&lt;br/&gt;a player no longer has a deck, the discard pile is shuffled and&lt;br/&gt;becomes the deck in which players&amp;rsquo; draw their hands. Purchased&lt;br/&gt;cards are more powerful than the ten starter cards and help players&lt;br/&gt;fight monsters. Players may choose to thin down their deck by&lt;br/&gt;trashing cards in order for more powerful cards to be drawn more&lt;br/&gt;frequently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have the option of gaining spells during their turn. Spells&lt;br/&gt;can be used at any point during the game to either aid a player&lt;br/&gt;during their turn or disrupt an opponent&amp;rsquo;s turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player fights and defeats a monster, the player gains a pixel&lt;br/&gt;related to the color of the monster. These pixels are a reusable&lt;br/&gt;resource that enhances players&amp;rsquo; cards. When a player defeats a&lt;br/&gt;boss, they also gain points based on the monster&amp;rsquo;s rank. These&lt;br/&gt;points move the player along on the scoreboard. The first player&lt;br/&gt;to reach ten points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
