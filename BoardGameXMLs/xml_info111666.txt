			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Agency may be dead, but its ghost continues to haunt the present. UNITAS is tracking down the organization&amp;rsquo;s resources that were &amp;ldquo;misplaced&amp;rdquo; after the schism that tore it apart. During a recovery operation of an abandoned data center in Alaska, the agents stumble upon hints of a highly secretive Intelligence Division project called Robbing Peter. Using fragments of the recovered data, the team tracks down a former Agency computer tech, Bootstrap, and persuades him to share his insights into the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discovering Robbing Peter is some sort of genetics experiment leads the team to a New Mexico lab. Although deserted, the lab is fully autonomous and everything is in full operation; as agents continue their investigation they discover something disturbing &amp;mdash; 3 world leaders and one of their own team members are alive in stasis! With none of them reported missing, are they clones? Who is the real team member? Computer records are&lt;br/&gt;missing and it is unclear who is real and who is a copy &amp;mdash; only the agents can decide on a course of action!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
