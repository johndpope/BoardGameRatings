			<description>What's Your Problem is a childrens' game about problem solving. Players move along a path through different areas on the board such as Sad Street, Frustrated Forest, and Surprise City with the ultimate goal of reaching Happy House. Players draw cards with an illustration of a problematic situation such as having to eat food you don't like or feeling ignored. Players then describe a possible solution (there are no wrong answers) and move the number of spaces indicated on the card. There are also special spaces on the board which feature an emoticon-style face which require the player to describe the emotion represented by the face to earn an extra turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
