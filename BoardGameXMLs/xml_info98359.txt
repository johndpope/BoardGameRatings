			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the roar of the crowd, and the playing of the Star Spangled Banner, get ready to coach your NFL Team through another championship game. Score touchdowns with passing or running plays from your own playbook. Carefully map out strategy for both defense and offense. And, watch out for &amp;quot;Mad Dog&amp;quot;--the linebacker who never quits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has two 4-minute halves. In the first half, the blue team starts on offense, beginning on the 20 yard line. Beginning the second half, the yellow team starts on offense. The time clock runs only when the ball is in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed to be played by 2 or 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2 player mode the game is played head-to-head. In 4 player mode the players pair off as teammates. When playing as teammates, on offense one player controls the quarterback and the other controls the tight end; on defense one controls the top (as displayed on screen) cornerback and the other controls the bottom cornerback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are ten offensive plays to choose from. In addition, punting and field goal kicks appear as options under the appropriate conditions. Plays are selected by the offense only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The defense has the option of either covering the receivers or &amp;quot;blitzing&amp;quot; the quarterback. Also, &amp;quot;Mad Dog,&amp;quot; the linebacker, waits a random length of time and then automatically rushes to wherever the ball is. The two cornerbacks are the only players with the ability to intercept the ball. (from the manual)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
