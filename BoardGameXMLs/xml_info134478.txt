							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Keepers of the Lantern</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the ages, the Temple of the Lantern has sat upon the hill. Within its marble walls, the sacred Keepers of the Lantern hold the Lantern of Day, which shines on the Path of the Dawn, which the Sun follows as it walks through the lands of Night on its way to the next day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now, in these final days, as it was foretold, Coyote has come among the people, seeking to sway the order and steal the Lantern to light his own house in the lands of Night. If he succeeds, then the Sun will be lost in the lands of Night, and the Dawn would never return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or...well, so go the legends. In fact, no one has ever really seen Coyote, and, really, no one is sure about those weird prophecies. I mean, has the Day ever really ceased? And that damn Lantern is just so heavy and irritating to hold, and, besides, do you know what Brother Khepris said about you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keepers of the Lantern is a light RPG in the tradition of hidden role games like Werewolf. In it, the players will portray priests of a largely irrelevant religious order who may or may not be protecting the world from a trickster spirit and eternal night but are definitely caught up in petty bickering and gossip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
