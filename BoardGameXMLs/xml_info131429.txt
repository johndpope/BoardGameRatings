							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nightmares &amp; Dreams Web Enhancement: Weedling</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A weedling looks like the humanoid version of a large dandelion or sunflower. Its orb-like head is surrounded by raggedy yellow petals. Its plain face is tan with a slit mouth and two expressionless black spheres for eyes. The weedling's upper body is green with sparse, stubbly hair. Its lower body is brown, and covered in root-like hair. The creature has long, thin arms that end in spindly and sharp fingers. The weedling's legs are relatively short and feature stubby feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In their spare time, weedlings enjoy tearing up healthy fields or gardens. Afterwards, they &amp;ldquo;plant&amp;rdquo; themselves from the waist down and draw nutrients from the well fertilized and irrigated soil. While planted, it is easy to mistake them for large, inanimate flowers. When they have drawn all they can from an area, they move on and repeat the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weedlings speak their own language and rarely learn the language of others. They are selfish creatures that live off the hard work of farmers and gardeners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note: A free version of the creature from Nightmares &amp; Dreams II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
