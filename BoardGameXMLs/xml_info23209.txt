			<description>According to the rules introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot; Strategic Golf is a lot like the real golf. Many of the rules are the same and the game is played much as it would be on a real golf course. It is also an exercise in strategy where each player must make decisions which may ultimately affect the game's outcome.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two-sided game board illustrate a 18 holes golf course. Your golf bag contains an assortment of 5 wooden dice, each one emulating a different golf club (different distance), including the putter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box include:&lt;br/&gt;- 1 two sided game board&lt;br/&gt;- 1 special brown die (move 1 to 3 squares)&lt;br/&gt;- 1 special yellow die (move 3 to 5 squares)&lt;br/&gt;- 1 special blue die (move 5 to 7 squares)&lt;br/&gt;- 1 special green die (for use on the putting greens)&lt;br/&gt;- 4 pawns&lt;br/&gt;- 4 reference cards&lt;br/&gt;- 1 score pad&lt;br/&gt;- 1 pencil&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
