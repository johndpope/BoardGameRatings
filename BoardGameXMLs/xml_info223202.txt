			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 20th century was marked by the largest wars in human history. World War I and World War II spanned the globe. While they might be remembered for the trenches in France, the Normandy landings and the battle for Iwo Jima, these wars spanned tens of countries and their effects endured long before their ending. Their beginnings are rooted in events that occurred years if not decades before the first shot was fired. These great wars are not isolated events, they&amp;rsquo;re the consequence of great powers struggling for world domination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is about the men and women that participated in these events, about what motivated them, their past and their dreams, their actions and the burden of the consequences. It is about your character and the role taken during the events of the 20th century. Is your character a front line soldier? A spy? A poet or writer? A leader of masses? An economist? A scientist? On what side does your character stand and in what way does it seek to alter the course of history and destiny in favor of its great nation?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
