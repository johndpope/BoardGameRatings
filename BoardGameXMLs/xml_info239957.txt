							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Close Encounters: Onyx Station</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to die here&amp;hellip; and no one will hear us scream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A derelict space station that disappeared fifty years ago has reappeared. Only a few of the original inhabitants remain, with the rest being mutated into hideous aberrations, transformed into undead beasts, or forcibly evolved into sentient plants. What&amp;rsquo;s more is that a few of the monsters now roaming the halls of Onyx Station weren't here, to begin with...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Close Encounters: Onyx Station introduces brand new rules for 12 of these creatures, from the soul-draining shadowsludge to the monstrous columns of flesh! Also included are 9 traps and hazards that can be found aboard the station, as well as 2 brand new ships! These rules are meant as a campaign toolkit for GMs handling players from levels 1 to 10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
