			<description>Also known as &amp;quot;The Little Goat Game&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is considered the children's version of Um El Bagara, and it originated in Africa, in the area now known as the Sudan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a 2x3 mancala board, and 3 stones are placed in each of the six playing wells. Players take turns moving stones by picking up all the stones in a well then dropping a stone in each well until they run out, moving either clockwise or counter-clockwise depending on the position of the well. A well with only a single stone cannot be moved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After your move, starting with the well you last placed a stone into, any wells that have exactly two stones may be placed in your scoring well. If there is a well that you cannot score (it has a number of stone other than two and cannot be your well), then any that come after it in sequence may not be scored either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when neither player can make a legal move. Any stones left on a players side of the board are added to those in his scoring well. Whoever has the most stones is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
