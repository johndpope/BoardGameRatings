			<description>From the back of the game case:&lt;br/&gt;Promised Land is set on a small island in the Pacific Northwest where the line between fantasy and reality is constantly shifting.  On the island, there are five worlds in which you can do such things as explore a brain, sail upon an ocean, become a guest on a talk show, save the world from asteroids or even abort a nuclear meltdown.  &lt;br/&gt;During the opening animation, you see the flying Queensryche Tri-ryche totem pole scatter its five pieces over the game's island.  You must find the five pieces of the totem pole to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
