			<description>Dance Off: Furry Fury is a competitive card game based on a dance competition. You play 3 cards face down and compare them to your opponent's, utilizing 12 different dance moves.  Keep track of your score because after the 3rd round, the player with the lowest score at the end of the round gets eliminated.  Be careful, because if your opponents use the same dance move, everyone loses value of that move, and hope you don't flub up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a solitaire version of the game so you can play alone.  Try to get the best score you can to win 1st place on a pre-set scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
