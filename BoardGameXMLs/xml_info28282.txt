							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Panda Go Round</name>
									
			<description>From the Educational Insights catalog:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panda-Go-Round is a fast paced race game of &amp;quot;turn and find,&amp;quot; where each turn of the tube reveals a new expression on the panda's face, from happy or sad to sleepy - even surprised! Be the first to exactly match the expression on the panda's face with the one on the card and claim the card. Corresponding symbols on the tubes and inside the cards make the game self-checking. The player with the most cards at the end of the game is the winner. Builds visual discrimination skills, a key to reading success. Includes 2 face-maker tubes and 16 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 4 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
