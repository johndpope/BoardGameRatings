			<description>Leading Company is a construction-oriented strategy video game that was released for both the Super Famicom (SNES) and the NEC PC-9801. The traditional definition of a leading company is a corporation that currently dominates the &amp;quot;corporate wars&amp;quot; against their competitors. Its employees are considered by most people to be winning the &amp;quot;rat race.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both versions of this game were released to an exclusively Japanese market. However, the NEC PC-9801 version has sharper graphics and the ability to use a mouse. Instead of abstract colors (to depict control of each square of the board), buildings are used to depict a typical Japanese residential neighborhood. A theme park is visibily shown on an island in the PC-9801 version to depict recreational opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Leading Company&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
