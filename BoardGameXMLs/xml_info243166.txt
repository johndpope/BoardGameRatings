							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Snake! (1982)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fast and fun action game for one player.  You're a big snake roaming around the screen.  Mice, rabbits, eggs, and feet appear at random.  Your mission in life is to bite these targets.  You have to be quick - the targets don't stay for long.  The main problem is: you always seem to be running into the wall or into yourself (the longer you play, the longer, and harder to avoid your tail!) [sic].  Snake! keeps high score and requires a joystick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
