			<description>Worzle.  The strategic word puzzle game.  It&amp;rsquo;s cute and creative, fast paced and fun, and you might even learn a thing or two along the way.  Two to eight players evenly distribute a total of 100 puzzle pieces. Each has a printed letter along with four wild pieces. Begin by placing a puzzle piece on the table.  Start the timer.  Taking turns, each player adds a piece to the puzzle. How the puzzle expands is up to you.  Once every piece has been placed or time runs out, players pick up their pencils.   Start the timer again and find as many words as you can.  As long as the puzzle pieces are next to each other, any direction goes, however a player may not skip over a void in the puzzle to complete a word.  When time runs out, using the Worzle Scoring System, the points are tallied and the player with the most wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worzle is the next progression in word games.  It combines the strategic component of building hidden words with the fast paced nature of finding as many as you can.  It is not as simple as you might imagine.  As the puzzle expands, pieces are placed in multiple directions leaving them upside down and sideways.  Each player around the puzzle has a unique perspective of the game. The &amp;ldquo;building the puzzle&amp;rdquo; dynamic adds huge interest to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worzle will be packaged in a printed drawstring cotton bag complete with a timer, several custom pads and pencils all in a full color box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
