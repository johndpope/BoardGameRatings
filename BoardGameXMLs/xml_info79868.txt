			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sword of Fargoal was an early home computer game designed by Jeff McCord. The player controlled a dungeon questing hero who needed to explore dungeon levels in search of a lost sword, all the while attempting to survive an onslaught of ever increasing monsters and traps. Each level was increasingly difficult and each new level was randomly generated and needed to be explored to find the stairs to the next. The sword itself was hidden on levels 15-20 and once the sword was found the player had only 33 minutes in which to make their way all way back out of the dungeon. The game was extremely difficult as the sword could be stolen on your way back out not to mention simply just surviving to find was an extreme challenge into on itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
