			<description>A great game self-published in the mid-1990s of college basketball simulation. Originally, the designer rated two seasons of ACC basketball. The game also included a capsulized report on each team. Individual ratings were on par with Fast Break.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, the game was picked up and distributed by Taylor Marketing - which subsequently released MANY more seasons, before driving the game into the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
