			<description>NUTS! The Big Hurt is an expansion to the NUTS! World War 2 tabletop miniatures wargame.  From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The H&amp;uuml;rtgen Forest was the site of America's most costly European battle of World War Two. Within its fifty square miles the US suffered more casualties than anywhere else. The H&amp;uuml;rtgen Forest was a densely packed hell of tree-bursting artillery and machinegun fire. It was a trap where the infantrymen of the Allied First Army fool heartedly walked into. Virtually unsupported by armor and artillery, the numerically superior American forces would dash themselves against the hardened defenses of Hitler&amp;rsquo;s West Wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Big Hurt is a supplement for NUTS! - 2nd Edition. Although intended to be played from the American side, The Big Hurt play's just as well from the German side. The Big Hurt can be played solo, cooperatively with all players on the same side or head-to-head.&lt;br/&gt;Packed with 21 linked scenarios, this book covers a variety of small-unit and medium sized actions through the four months of the H&amp;uuml;rtgen meat grinder.&lt;br/&gt;Track down German infiltrators. Raid an enemy outpost. Capture a dam. It&amp;rsquo;s all up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
