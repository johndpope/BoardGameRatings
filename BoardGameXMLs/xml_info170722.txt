							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Aliens: The Zeknari</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Close Encounters of the Mythic Kind!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re encountering them on a distant planet in a far-off nebula, or they&amp;rsquo;ve come to you, and are abducting innocent villagers for nefarious purposes, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing quite like a strange, alien race to help breathe some life into your galaxy&amp;mdash;and your game. Some Pathfinder products have even explored the idea of alien life in the past, and it&amp;rsquo;s certainly true that many aberrations could serve as alien creatures in a pinch. But there&amp;rsquo;s one thing that Pathfinder aliens have never been until now, and that is&amp;hellip;mythic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents the Zeknari. A proud and mysterious people with a long and storied past, the zeknari (singular zeknar) were among the first races to explore the stars. Their interstellar quest for gold brought them into contact with a large number of less advanced races, and while the zeknari had a strong hand in the development of several of these races, these encounters had a strong impact on the zeknari as well, giving them an ingrained sense of superiority that has contributed to a long stagnation amongst their people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
