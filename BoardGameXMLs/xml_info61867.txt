							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ghosts of the Lady Grace</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Local legend says the Monroe Inn has been haunted for about a hundred years. A ship named Lady Grace struck a rock off the coast of Massachusetts and sunk within sight of the inn. A few survivors were brought to the inn, but died before help could arrive. They have been haunting the place ever since.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inn is now a bed and breakfast, and the haunting has made the place a local attraction. The ghosts are spooky, but have never frightened people away. That is, until now. The ghosts have changed their behavior and have become downright terrifying. People no longer stay the whole night, and business is drying up. The Monroes have called the Foundation for Paranormal Investigation to find out why the spirits have been acting up and to maybe get things back to normal. The investigators must get to the bottom of the mystery before anyone gets hurt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghosts of the Lady Grace is a pair of adventures for the Now Playing Role-playing Game. You get to play the roles of real paranormal investigators and handle these cases the way the real ghost hunters do! Although these adventures are designed for Now Playing, it is just as easy to play them using the Fudge Roleplaying Game, and can be converted to nearly any game system without much effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
