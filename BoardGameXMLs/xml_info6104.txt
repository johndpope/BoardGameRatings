			<description>Battle for the Sprawls is a two-player boardgame that was published in Buck Rogers #2.  The game is loosely based on the novel Rebellion: 2456 by M.S. Murdoch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player plays one side of the conflict, either NEO (New Earth Organization) or RAM (Russo-American Mercantile), the current masters of Mars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a map (which represent the sprawls of Old Chicagorg), 3 pages of rules (covering basic initiative, movement and combat procedures), and one sheet of cut-out playing pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is decided on Victory Points, which are given for eliminating opponent's units, or for destroying enemy transports.  Effectively, to win as the NEO player, you must get more of your transports off the ground than have been destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional, optional rules are provided for ranged combat, transport defenses, and secret passages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
