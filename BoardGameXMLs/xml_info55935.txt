							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bust: Explosive Roleplaying</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bust is a fast, narrative focused card based system that uses player defined traits in a single, explosive resolution mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core mechanic is that player characters assume a tough template of 21 with player created traits and flaws boosting and detracting that number. Threats and challenges in the form of cards attempt to bust that number. The harder the challenge the more cards have to be turned. Insert Aces that neutralize difficulty, exploding kings that create more, Jokers that twist fate, and play becomes more dyanmic and tactical with a degree of player controlled script immunity. The system is flexible using templates like 14 or 28 for more realistic and heroic play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
