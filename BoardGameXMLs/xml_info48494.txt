			<description>(From the back cover)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;One Hundred Thousand to Attend Mutant Execution,&amp;quot; one headline screams.  &amp;quot;Senator Hints at Link Between Mutant, Commie Plots!&amp;quot; shouts another.   In the Streets, white-shirted men wearing distinctive armband of the Knights of Genetic Purity march in lockstep, treading underfoot any suspected of being soft on mutants.  In the  public schools, kindergarten children raise their arms in clenched fist salute of the National American Social Improvement Party and chat the party slogan, &amp;quot;One People, One Blood, One Nation!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is this but a super hero's nightmare?  No.  This is America; home town U.S.A., 25 to 50 years in the future.  In this America, constitutional government is all but gone.  Real power is held by the sentinels, a group of powerful robots programmed to seek out and capture or destroy all human mutants and all beings with any hint of super poewrs.  Sharing power with the sentinels are a handful of political demagogues who keep the population whipped into a constant frenzy about the mutant menace.  Any super heroes who survive in this hostile environment do so by constantly facing the full military, political, and technological might of a new totalitarian state in the making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The X-Potential is the second in a series of MARVEL SUPER HEROES game adventures set in the nightmare world of the future.  It can be played as a complete adventure in its own right, or as part of the ongoing MX series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
