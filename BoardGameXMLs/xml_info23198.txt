			<description>Not to be confused with the simulation game of the same title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box: Lead your armies like the famous Greek military leader through enemy lines back to your fatherland. Try to avoid own losses, but fight, if unavoidable.&lt;br/&gt;In fight you are supported by your trusty henchmen, who are willing to give their lives for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Packaged in a very small box comes another game of the short-lived &amp;quot;Pocket-Games&amp;quot; (Taschen-Spiele) series from Heyne, which is better known as a book publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though themed in Greek history, this is a variant to traditional abstract games, but with several twists. Each player has one leader playing piece, several citizens, and some henchman - he must try to get his leader and citizens to the opposite side of the board, trying to lose as few as possible. The other player tries the same with his men. Also both players have &amp;quot;servants&amp;quot; or henchmen, who are expendable for &amp;quot;the dirty work&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;In the end each player gets points for his citizens and leader for reaching the other side - the number of remaining henchman does not matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The movement is determined by throwing a dice - but only one player throws it, both have then to use the same number of movement points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the four player variant two players control the citizens and the leader, the other two try to help their allies with the henchmen - but they are not allowed to communicate with their partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
