			<description>From the book's introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This system can be readily used by Game Master and players alike. How many times have you gotten to a game late, only find that your character's statistics sheet was left at home? Normally you would waste a good half-hour of game time creating a new one. Well, not any longer. Now you can roll up a character and equip him or her in less than five minutes! Game Masters can easily use the system to outfit and create encounters or non-player characters.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entire booklet is a set of tables for creating AD&amp;amp;D-compatible character with three rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Character Statistics&amp;quot; table (which in in the back of the book, despite being the one gamers are instructed to use first) uses a d1000 to generate all six character scores at once. This table takes up half the pages in book, and continues onto the inside back cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After choosing the character's class, a second roll on (using a d10 or d20 a class-specific subtable) selects the character's weapons and armor. Finally a d6-based &amp;quot;Backpack Sets&amp;quot; table determines what non-class-specific gear the character is carrying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(The book itself never mentions AD&amp;amp;D by name, but all character have six ability scores in the 3-18 range, and the weapon/armor combinations respect AD&amp;amp;D character class restrictions.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
