			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        A group of strangers awake in a derelict sawmill strewn with a variety of boobytraps and a canister of toxic gas that will release its contents in two hours. Will they work together to get out or will the secrets they expose tear them apart?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sawmill is a short, rules-lite RPG where players increase their chances of getting out by exposing painful truths... but also bring themselves closer to an ugly death. The PCs must accuse each other of dreadful things in order to reveal the skills they possess that will enable them to overcome the booby-traps. Some of the revelations made will drive a wedge between them and the co-operation of at least 2 PCs is the minimum requirement for the whole group to avoid death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
