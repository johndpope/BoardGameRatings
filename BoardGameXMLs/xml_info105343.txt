			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a scenario designed for the Warhammer Game System, and can be played either with the Warhammer Role Play game, or with the Warhammer Battle Rules (or even with both).  The game consists of a dungeon adventure, deep inside The Web of Eldaw - a system of labyrinthine caverns.  The scenario can be played out using any other suitable gaming system, so long as you are prepared to change stats and minor details as you go along.  Stats for Warhammer Role Play and Battle Rules are provided.  Note that two values are given for the Wounds characteristic eg, 1/10.  The first number is used for Warhammer Battle Rules, the second Role-Play.  All other stats are identical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played by 2-4 players taking the roles of the characters described, plus GM.  If two or three players are to attempt the adventure, the two characters Giltbrook and Mickelson can be run by either one player or by the Rolando player as 'henchmen'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
