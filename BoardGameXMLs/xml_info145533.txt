			<description>Do you like the insanely fast, insanely hard difficulty level of the 80s' arcade games? Welcome back to the arcade era with Futiridum EP!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Futuridium EP is a retro fast paced shoot&amp;rsquo;em up with a modern twist, that was inspired by one of the greatest 8bit shoot&amp;rsquo;em up of all time, Uridium by Andrew Braybrook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a lone starship pilot who get lost in a dimensional loop just before a battle: with a limited and constantly depleting energy bar your only hope is to fly as fast as possible over enormous space dreadnoughts and destroy all the cyan power cubes, replenishing your energy tank and revealing the ship&amp;rsquo;s power core, which must be destroyed to move to the next ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is heavily score based, you can gain big multiplier destroying cubes and chain cubes together to get huge score boost. You can play it safe, but only taking big risks and learning the right path on the dreadnoughts will lead you to the top of the online leader boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- No special powers, no bonuses: only the player reflexes count. Your ship, your lasers, your ability!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- You can stop and turn your ship 180&amp;deg; at any time, just pressing a button&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- No speed control: you fly as fast as possible...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;13 levels&lt;br/&gt;    11 original music tracks, for a 45 minutes original soundtrack. You can skip them in games like a jukebox.&lt;br/&gt;    A new energy based gameplay mechanic&lt;br/&gt;    4 different gameplay speed, unlockable finishing the game. The game can get crazy fast...&lt;br/&gt;    4 different graphic skins&lt;br/&gt;    a peculiar graphic style, full of colours and glithy full screen special effects- online leaderboards (with full GameCenter and achievement support on Mac OSX)&lt;br/&gt;    a credit system: destroy cubes to get in game credits to continue and other goodies&lt;br/&gt;    Ragequit button: a useful feature when the game becomes too hard!&lt;br/&gt;    some cool easter eggs...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is hard, and while the keyboard is supported it's a lot better played with a joypad: the Xbox 360 is natively supported with all the buttons correctly mapped, but the game supports any controller with Windows drivers. The Dual Shock 3 is also supported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
