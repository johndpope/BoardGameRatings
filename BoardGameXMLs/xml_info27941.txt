			<description>2-4 players try to build enclosures for lions and zebras with fence tiles. The tile edges have different color and just similar color can be placed next to each other. As soon as a player builds an enclosure he places one of his animals within it. The first one to place all his animals wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an easy strategy game for children with wonderful artworks. Rules are in German, French and Italian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
