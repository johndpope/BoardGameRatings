			<description>A new game based on Xemytica Card Game System will be 1910! It is an action-packed anachronistic game with an early 1900:s stylish theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1910 will be released during 2010 - no release date is yet set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1910 Starter Pack will include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* 54 Game Cards&lt;br/&gt;      At least 3 of these will be Rule Cards. The rest will be Fighter Cards, Fate Cards and Gear Cards.&lt;br/&gt;    * A clear hard plastic protective case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1910 will play similar to - but not exactly as - Fate of Heroes. Some minor changes to characters and game-play will be added to 1910 that will be unique for this game. 1910 and Fate of Heroes can not be combined - they are separate games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
