							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">White Room</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They put the ESP in Espionage&amp;hellip; White Room!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Renegade Organization, White Room is a mysterious intelligence agency composed of individuals with unique gifts. White Room is an iconic setting element in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;White Room&amp;rsquo;s file has no color or ranking designation, because the organization may be composed of people of hugely diverse backgrounds. In fact, the membership of the organization is left largely vacant, for the GM to fill with characters tailor-made to their players. The two feature agents of White Room detailed in this release are Mr. Ulysses and Ms. D. These two mysterious characters are PL 11 and 9, respectively, each offering a distinctive set of psychic skills with which they serve the interests of White Room. What are those interests? Will the players find themselves targets of this mysterious espionage group, or will they fight side by side? Only time, and serious investigation, will tell!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
