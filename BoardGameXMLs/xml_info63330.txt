							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conspiracy of Shadows</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How far are you willing to go to learn the truth?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this role-playing game, the characters are people, not elves, dwarves or orcs.  They are like you and I only they live in a medieval world where dark supernatural forces conspire against humanity.  Driven by a secret knowledge o a hidden evil, they risk, their lives searching for the truth about the conspiracy and a means to thwart it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in this game are different from characters in most other games in that they are bound together from the start with a common purpose.  They have not chosen a life of adventure and glory, but have instead been forced into a dangerous life by circumstance and fate.  Some lead a life of two extremes, living and working as most do during the day.  But at night, they venture out into the dark world of monstrous horror and human deceit.  Others have forsaken any semblance of a normal life and spend night and day seeking the truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a complete role-playing game that allows you to create an entertaining story with your own antagonists and protagonists.  Event resolution is quick and easy, based upon a single die mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The truth is waiting for you.  Will you be able to handle it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
