			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Wreck Age depicts humanity&amp;rsquo;s desperate struggle after betrayal and disaster have decimated Earth as we know it. Your introduction to Wreck Age begins in the 26th century, during the re-setting of the calendars, or Year Zero, the first year in the re-emergence of civilization we call The Resurgence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Blackwood, the Staker community that you sprouted forth from. You have witnessed its growth and seen the effects of over-population, and your Elders are about to ask you and your friends to go on a mission to help expand the settlement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is an introductory adventure for beginning a Staker campaign. Being a introductory adventure, this adventure is designed with the goal of getting your players (and yourself) familiar with the core game mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This Narrative mission will not use combat and is designed to teach new players the mechanics of this game. This narrative will focus on the players using their characters abilities and building up their characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
