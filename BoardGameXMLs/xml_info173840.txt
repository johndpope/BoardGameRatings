			<description>Clash Along the Psel I: A brand new take on the Battle of Kursk, with Tigers, a contested river crossing ... and Russian counter-attacks. A titanic struggle, recreated in detail down to the last tank ... squad ... and forward observer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the ATS CORE MODULES, all new for 2014. New map, larger, on cardstock, folding with no trimming needed -- did we mention new terrain art throughout AND larger hexes? Perfect for those classic -- YET ALL NEW ATS COUNTERS -- the you'll have on the map deciding history ... all ... over ... again! This module is for owners of the ATS 2014 Color Rules plus ATS Standard Small Markers + Large Markers but may also be used easily by owners of any past edition of the ATS rules. All Special Rules and AFV Cards needed for play are included, along with ALL NEW FOLIO STYLE packaging. &lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE: This product contains ALL the combat counters you need to play -- IT IS NOT A COMPLETE GAME. You need small and large marker counter sheets and the ATS Rules Binder/Play Aid set to use this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
