							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wrong</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a fairly cruel adventure for the investigators. They will believe that they are going on a well earned vacation on a peaceful island in the middle of a Maine lake. Unknown to the investigators, chemicals leaking from a forgotten illegal dump site have leaked into a marshy area and mixed with the algae, slime and muck encasing the bones of a drowned man. The horrid combination gives rise to a truly alien intelligence, one that is very curious about the world, especially about what is inside those fleshy squishy things...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, instead of a peaceful week of fishing and lying in the sun, the investigators will have to face a walking pile of slime, muck and death. Not exactly the sort of vacation recommended by your friendly travel agent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is set in 1990s and is located in Maine. With a few minor changes it could be located in other times or places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
