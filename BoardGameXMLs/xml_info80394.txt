			<description>King's Knight (キングスナイト) is a 1986 video game published by Square for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and MSX. It was later re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan on November 27, 2007 and in North America on March 24, 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;King's Knight is often incorrectly credited both as an RPG and as Square's first development. It was in fact developed by Workss. It was, however, Square's first North American release under Square Soft, Inc., and their first release as an independent company. King's Knight saw a second release in 1987 on the NEC PC-8801 and the Sharp X1. These versions of the game were retitled King's Knight Special and released exclusively in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nobuo Uematsu provided the musical score for King's Knight. It was Uematsu's fourth work of video game music composition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;King's Knight&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
