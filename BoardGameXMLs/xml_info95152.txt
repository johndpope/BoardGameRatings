			<description>In this issue:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, we're back. In our second superlative issue, we're tackling the question &amp;quot;What is Role-Playing?&amp;quot; It's a good question, and often one that's hard to answer. Andrew Rilstone, our first celebrity guest writer, gives us his comments, along with others. These are joined by the continuing History of Role-Playing, plus news, links and your mail. And, oh yes: to win a copy of the new Men in Black RPG, see below. And see the editorial for all the other details.
