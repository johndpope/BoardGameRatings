			<description>&amp;quot;Story&lt;br/&gt;Somewhere in the desert of Kalua, in the country of Suelang, stands a huge tower. This is the Tower of Fata Morgana. Legends say that powerful ancient wisdom is hidden in this tower. But no one dares to venture in, fearing ferocious monsters and deadly traps. Three people, however, are exception to this rule: the young thief Dee, who hopes to steal treasure from the tower; the lovely elf witch Clare, who needs to discover ancient magic; and finally, a mysterious man named Quien, who doesn't remember his past and works as a mercenary...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Brandish VT is the 4th game in the Brandish series. It departs from the primary story featured in the other titles of the Brandish series and opens a previously unexplored chapter in the mythology. Players can are able to choose Clare, Dee, or Quien as the main character from the start of the adventure. Each one of these characters starts in a different place in the map, but eventually they will have to solve the puzzles of the Tower. The gameplay is not dissimilar to the other Brandish games, with a point-and-click interface, real-time combat, and they are now able to jump. As with the other games, there are experience points (XP) and levelling up. The game departs from the top-down view of the previous games, and instead uses an isometric viewpoint.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Brandish_vt,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
