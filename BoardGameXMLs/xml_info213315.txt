							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paradox Girl: Game Time!</name>
									
			<description>Paradox Girl is a fast-paced and dynamic card game based on the quirky, time-traveling comic book heroine of the same name. With its balanced blend of theme and abstract tactical play, Paradox Girl makes a great &amp;quot;gateway game&amp;quot; for 2 or 4 players, playable in about 20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't have to know anything about the comic books or their storyline to enjoy or play the game. Paradox Girl combines mechanics like those you might find in Chrononauts, Carcassonne, and Reversi to create a kind of battle-of-wits on an ever-changing board, which offers lots of chess-like tactical thinking in a more social atmosphere. Paradox Girl is streamlined enough to be welcoming and accessible to new gamers and all general audiences, but thought provoking and dynamic enough to engage more experienced and calculating gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 4x4 grid of cards representing possible events along a timeline/continuum. Players represent different manifestations of the same character (since the gag is that Paradox Girl frequently crosses her own timeline and interacts/fights with herself). The object of the game is to score points for yourself or to deny points to your opponents by claiming and locking down event cards on the timeline with your pawns. Unlocked events and their point values are subject to be changed every turn when players &amp;quot;change the future&amp;quot; (deal new cards). Control of individual spaces/cards can be contested through a very light combat mechanic called a &amp;quot;paradox brawl.&amp;quot; Players can also accumulate secret bonus points by snagging Waffos (tokens), Paradox Girl's favorite brand of toaster-waffles.&lt;br/&gt; The game is based on characters created by Cayti Bourquin and appearing in &amp;quot;Paradox Girl&amp;quot; by Hanako Games/Hana Comics. Artwork by Yishan Li.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
