			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chronicles of the Void (CotV) is a Pen&amp;amp;Paper RPG set in an original space opera universe. Each player will create their own iconic hero and decide their fate as they collect elite equipment and customize themselves by earning experience which will be distributed in an intricate nexus of abilities that are completely unique for each of our iconic character templates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is built on the foundation of an innovative game engine which defines two major systems for handling fast paced action: the One Breath Combat (OBC) and Vehicle Assault and Pursuit (VAP) systems. The OBC system engages players in skirmishes which encourage cinematic actions and the speedy resolution of events to keeps players in the moment and prevents the lag of complex sequential actions. The VAP system captures the excitement of piloting your own customizable star fighter into battle simulating 3D combat on a 2D grid. CotV trims the fat off of the tabletop gaming experience and cuts straight to the action with a strong emphasis on ease of play and unlimited extensibility through the cyber realms of the Neuro Labyrinth. The Neuro Labyrinth allows each player's iconic character to create avatars to roam the vast cyberscape opening up new frontiers in customization and depth on a level which is previously unimagined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
