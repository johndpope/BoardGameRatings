			<description>From Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;Troopers from five warring factions stranded on the barren world of Tundari, cut off from your mother ships - will you survive? Can you regroup? Will you forge a truce with troopers from the other factions who are trapped on this planet with you? And what of the ancient secrets of the Xen race which once inhabited Tundari? Don your all-environments carapace and your hover pack, adjust your energy shield settings, pick up your plasma blast rifle, stride forth, explore and do battle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sundered Space is in its alpha playtest edition (version 1.1) following its debut at Indiecon 2008. Plans to release version 1.2 have been shelved due to ongoing work on a new fantasy game, Omnifray Lite. It is likely that any future version of Sundered Space will use an adapted version of the Omnifray Lite system as its foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
