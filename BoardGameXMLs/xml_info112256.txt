			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Several of the Forgotten Futures collections include spreadsheet templates which were originally written for use with Lotus 123 Executive. Unfortunately this is now somewhat elderly, and includes a WYSIWYG add-on that is incompatible with many later programs. They have been rewritten for Lotus 123 without the WYSIWYG add-on, Microsoft Excel, and Claris Works for Windows. Most spreadsheets can read one or another of these formats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the Claris templates are somewhat less &amp;quot;bullet-proof&amp;quot; than the others, since some logical functions that seem to work well in Lotus 123 and Excel gave problems. There are probably ways around this, and I would appreciate comments from anyone who feels able to improve them. The Excel templates seem to work well; however, they mostly require Excel 3 to 5 for correct operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes Templates for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Character Records&lt;br/&gt;    Blank Records&lt;br/&gt;    Currency Conversions&lt;br/&gt;    Airship Details&lt;br/&gt;    Spaceship Designs&lt;br/&gt;    Space Travel Times&lt;br/&gt;    Zealand Units&lt;br/&gt;    Calendars&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
