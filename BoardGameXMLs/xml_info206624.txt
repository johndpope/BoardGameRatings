			<description>Can you leave 21 or less in two minutes? &lt;br/&gt;Game play begins with rolling of the 3 dice to determine which one of the 1-15 numbered balls will be taken out first. Players put in a chip and each players tray is passed to the right so the individual does not play with their own tray that they set up. The two minute timer begins. Players continuously jump numbered balls creating a pattern as they are jumping and discarding balls that are jumped. The jumps continue until there are no more jumps or until the two minute timer is up. The numbered balls on the playing tray are totaled up. With the goal being to leave 21. If you go over 21, you busted your game play. And if you don't get 21, try getting the next best score: 20, 19, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
