			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kaiser is one of the most anticipated realm simulation games from its time. Up to eight players manage their realm by dividing their harvest, trying to avoid catastrophes while building houses, crops and mills. They also have to protect their land by constructing walls and recruiting military.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the meantime they have to adjust the taxes to get more gold with which to build a bigger castle and and a cathedral, which they need to increase in rank to become the ultimate Kaiser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next to the turn based control of the realm the game also features a war part where each participating realm has to control its units and tries to destroy enemy buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
