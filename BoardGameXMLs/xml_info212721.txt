							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Magician&#039;s Club</name>
									
			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1921 and the Academy of Magicians has gathered once again to perform their greatest stage tricks. The competition to win the title of World&amp;rsquo;s Greatest Magician brings out the worst in these rivals who won&amp;rsquo;t hesitate at a chance to ruin the act. Fortunately, a good magician always has an assistant at their side and a trick up their sleeve&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magician's Club is a &amp;quot;Trick-Making&amp;quot; game where players are Magicians who play Trick Cards for points. Moving around the table, the other players will try to decrease or modify the Magician's tricks using conjure cards. The Magician can cancel out some cards by using his assistant cards but they are one-time use only cards, so play them wisely. When play returns back to the Magician, they can play one more card and then collect the trick for points (either positive or negative)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all the players have had a chance to be the on-stage Magician, the points are totaled up. A second chance to score happens at the end of the game by counting up collected cards that have a similar suit. The player with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
