							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Magicians of England Core Rules</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magicians of England was written with a mixed group of role-players and casual board-gamers in mind. It plays well with both types of player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is also a loving tribute to Susanna Clarke's novel Jonathan Strange &amp;amp; Mr. Norrell. If you haven't read it, you really shouldn't waste your time on an unfinished lump of a game. Go read the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an unfinished game. It's playable as written, but the experience may be blocky. I've included notes about the parts I'm still working on, or haven't finished. When it hits, it's a big hit, but it doesn't always hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
