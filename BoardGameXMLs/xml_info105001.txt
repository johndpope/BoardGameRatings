							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jekyll &amp; Hyde</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An action game loosely based on the book Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson. The game takes place in victorian London.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Henry Jekyll has developed a potion that allows him to become a powerful and brutal being, Mr. Hyde. When Jekyll's daughter Laurie is kidnapped by an inmate from the insane asylum, Jekyll realizes that the only way to save her is to become Mr. Hyde, his evil alter ego.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls Jekyll, who has limited physical abilities but is great to solve puzzles, but he can turn him into Hyde, who is both stronger and more agile, but feebleminded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
