			<description>&amp;quot;The fascinating boardgame&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract race game played with tetrahedral pieces on a hexagonal board divided into six large equilateral triangle regions, each of which is subdivided into 25 equilateral triangles which are the movement spaces. The centre triangle in each of the 6 larger triangles regions is marked with a letter of the alphabet (A through F), each of which is the starting and finishing space for one of the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six playing pieces are tetrahedrons, each with one face in each of the colours; red, blue, white and orange. All 6 pieces have the same colour sequence, but are distinguished by each face being marked with the letter (A to E) corresponding to the start/finishing space to which it pertains&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each game, 3 of the spaces (except the start/finish space) in each region are marked with one of the colours; red, blue or orange. The players must move from their own starting spaces, to tag all the spaces of a particular colour and return to their own starting space to finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played with each player required to make three laps of the boar,d once tagging ll the red spaces, then all the blue then all the orange. Alternatively players race the same coloured track as their opponent opposite in each round (e.g. players A &amp;amp; D race the red track, B &amp;amp; E the blue, and C &amp;amp; F the orange; then in rounds 2 &amp;amp; 3, swap colours).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces are moved by either &lt;br/&gt;a)rotating 120 degrees in place through a vertical axis (i.e. the face-down side remains face down), or &lt;br/&gt;b)by pivoting the piece along one of the three edges touching the board, so that it 'rolls' into one of the 3 spaces adjacent along one of the sides of the current space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To enter (and tag) a coloured space, the colour of the face-down side must match that of the coloured space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn a player rotates his piece in place or moves to an adjoining triangular space. First player to complete the race around the predetermined course wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game does not appear to have been published in a commercial version. Rather, an 18-page manual with hand-drawn line illustrations was produced in 1986 suggesting players make their own copy of the game for tabletop play, or even construct a giant set for outdoor use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 3-page supplement (Modified Tramid) was produced in 1987, with proposals to improve the quality of a manufactured board, and slight changes to the rules..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
