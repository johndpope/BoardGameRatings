			<description>Players take control of a primal human race and try to be the first to evolve from Australopithecus to Homo Sapiens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map is divided to different tiles and each one has a number on it. Active player throws the dice and populations in that tile multiplies and possibly gains a power card. The idea is to multiply &amp;amp; try to spread ones race to the far corners of the Earth. By discarding power cards (instead of playing the effect written into them) players can develop their muscles so that they can drive their rivals away from the fertile forests or generous jungles. Or alternatively they can develop their food diet and outbreed their rivals and beat them by sheer numbers. At least that way they can better afford the occasional bestial attack or an epidemic disease. However, player's can't hold on to their good locations forever because every time they want to evolve to the next level only a small fraction of their population can make the leap while the rest continue to populate the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
