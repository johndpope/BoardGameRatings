			<description>Everybody get together and help save the pond!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this semi-cooperative, educational game, players try to save the lake from the digger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has to fill his pond with 8 animals, two of each kind. Meanwhile, the digger (consisting of 8 puzzle tiles) is approaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn, the player has to roll a die. If he rolls one of the four animal symbols (or the shamrock as a joker), he is allowed to add the corresponding animal to his pond. If he rolls the digger symbol however, he has to add one puzzle tile to the digger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of adding an animal to the own lake, a player can put one of the 8 &amp;quot;stop stones&amp;quot; in front of the digger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the digger is finished before the 8 stop stones are placed, all players lose.&lt;br/&gt;If the 8 stop stones are placed before the digger is finished, the game continues until one player has filled his pond with all 8 animals. The first player to fill his pond wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
