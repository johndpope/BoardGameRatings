			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Braugh (pronounced BROW)is a wondrous and mysterious place of adventure, danger and excitement. As you will discover, Braugh, specifically the main continent of Thallorand is a world fraught with controversy and betrayal. Plunged into millennia of war, Thallorand rose from the ashes against a common foe and found a shaky alliance as a result. Now, under the new alliance, adventurers are hired for &amp;quot;expeditions&amp;quot; into the tombs and ruins of the world to find treasures of old. No longer are wars fought on the battlefield, but in the back rooms and private chambers of the ruling lords. for an adventurer with a sword (or implement) for hire, there is never a shortage of work, either directly for a lord, or as a freelance &amp;quot;explorer.&amp;quot; You can uncover subversive conspiracies, evil plots, backstabbing relatives with greed for blood, and monsters of untold horror, and that's juts on the good days! Players in the Age of Lords campaign setting will find themselves up against new foes and new versions of old favorites. Following the tradition of Blackbyrne Publishing products, The Age of Lords is a contemporary setting with an old school feel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
