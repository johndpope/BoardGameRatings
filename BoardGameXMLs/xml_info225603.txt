			<description>Assault &amp;ndash; Red Horizon 41&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;is the first volume in a series of tactical level wargames in which players lead historical units into battle during Operation Barbarossa (June through October 1941). Two factions &amp;ndash; the German Army and the Soviet army &amp;ndash; fight one another by use of infantry, artillery and armored units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assault - Red Horizon 41 is intentionally not an accurate simulation of reality, but rather it abstracts certain aspects in favor of playability and duration to convey the feeling of comprehensive tactical combat situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Mechanics and rules: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assault &amp;ndash; Red Horizon 41 is a turn-based, semi-historical system with a modular rule-set. A Turn consists of 5 different Phases: Initiative, Planning, Support, Action, and Organization. Players must use the Command points to activate the units in order to achieve the goals and victory conditions. Combat is resolved using six-sided customized symbolic dice in conjunction with cards. Overall, the Assault game system is modular: the rule-set contains basic-, unit-specific-, and optional rules to help beginners delve into the game and in the various maps can be assembled as desired to form new scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes the game different from the competition: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically, the Assault game system is completely modular and encompassing with the gamer. There are different scenarios that the players can choose and within these scenarios, the units that are available for the player to use can vary, and this is determined by the Formation cards. In each scenario, the players are given the option to choose random Formation cards (infantry, artillery, or armor/vehicle) based on their faction (this modularity will be a foundation for a strategic-level Campaign System at a later date). The Formation cards chosen list the units available for the scenario. This ensures variation and regular surprises. It&amp;rsquo;s as if your high command has assigned you certain units to achieve a goal, so you will have to adjust your individual tactics based on the available units and objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units in the Assault system are activated by Command points. Players receive a certain number of Command points, which are listed on the Formation cards. Before Command Phase, players secretly decide (behind a small screen or divider) which units to activate in the current turn. The Command point number allows the player to activate approximately 75% of all available units. Thus, players must set priorities for the turn. Not only does this speed up the game play, since all units are not used in each turn, but it also makes for some exciting moments in the fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Assault game system, we have tried to minimize the counter stacking issue. With many game systems in the hobby, you can find towers of counters and markers on certain hexes of the game board. The overview is then quickly lost. In Assault, there is a clear limit of one unit counter per hex, with the exception being the transport of units. In addition, there is usually only one command and/or status marker. Regarding Command Markers, we have devised a simple double-marker system: each marker is double-sided and after the end of the round, in the Organization Phase, the markers are flipped or removed according to their color. This goes pretty quickly.&lt;br/&gt;In general, Assault paid more attention to game flow. The fact that Command Points are assigned to activate units in the Planning Phase accelerates the game. Since the units to be activated are already established before the Action Phase, there is less for the player to think about and fewer opportunities for AP to set in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, the Assault system is modular and can be expanded as desired. A game can be finished on a single map piece in 1 to 2 hours. If you have more time available, you can also take an entire day for a battle using larger maps with multiple tiles. Players should be able to learn the game rather quickly. The basic rules are fixed and future expansions will not lead to new rule flooding and make the game confusing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the level of detail and the level of the player:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would describe the level of detail for the Assault system as &amp;ldquo;medium.&amp;rdquo; This also applies to newcomers to the wargaming hobby. Test results so far show that playing Assault becomes increasingly interesting because experience gained in the game can be converted into goal-oriented decisions in future games. This means that players who already understand the various properties of the units, terrain, and the combination of possibilities will naturally have an advantage.  &lt;br/&gt;  For this, we have also created a small start-up aid. For each unit in the game, there is a profile with historical fact and also included is a brief description of how these can be used tactically in the game. This can also be of use to those players not deeply versed in military history and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is in the box (preliminary):&lt;br/&gt;To this end, we have created prototype with the following scope:&lt;br/&gt;1 x design rules booklet&lt;br/&gt;3 x Combat / Scenario Cards&lt;br/&gt;2 x playing aids&lt;br/&gt;9 x map tiles&lt;br/&gt;1 x round marker&lt;br/&gt;1 x round indicator&lt;br/&gt;4 x target field markers&lt;br/&gt;4 x neutral / waypoint markers&lt;br/&gt;2 x Initiative Cube&lt;br/&gt;22 x formation cards&lt;br/&gt;32 x unit cards&lt;br/&gt;36 x command cards&lt;br/&gt;24 x battle cubes&lt;br/&gt;15 x damage markers&lt;br/&gt;20 x fog marker&lt;br/&gt;26 x command points&lt;br/&gt;100 x command and status markers&lt;br/&gt;50 x unit marker Wehrmacht&lt;br/&gt;55 x unit marker Soviet Army&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
