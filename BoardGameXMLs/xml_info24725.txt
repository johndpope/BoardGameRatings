			<description>This game belongs to a series of 4 games by Scandecor, which come in a square plastic board (Play Cavalry, Play Balance, Play Ecology and Play Numeric). )&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 12x12 board. The game can be played with 2 or 4 players. Half of the players take the industrial pieces, the others the nature pieces. When 2 players play, each has the following 47 pieces: &lt;br/&gt;- 18 roads/rivers, 12 straight and 6 curved&lt;br/&gt;- 24 houses/trees&lt;br/&gt;-  4 factories/volcanoes&lt;br/&gt;-  1 pollutions/earthquakes (disasters)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If playing with 4, each player gets half the pieces and the 2 additional pollution/earthquake tiles are used also.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with an empty board except the 2 or 4 disaster tiles, which are placed in the corners of the board. The players then start to place roads and rivers on the board and as soon as the first road/river is placed, they can also start to lay down the other pieces. Houses and factories can be placed 1-2 spaces besides the road, trees and volcanoes 1-2 spaces besides the river.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Factories/volcanoes protect the surrounding spaces from being overbuilt by the opponents. These restrictions make it more and more difficult to place the tiles on the board. Winner is the player/party who can lay down all their pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to be the first, who can play all of their pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
