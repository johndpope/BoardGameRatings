							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Peanuts to President</name>
									
			<description>Peanuts to President is a takeoff on Jimmy Carter's successful run for the presidency in 1976. In this game, players each start as a peanut farmer and work their way upwards towards the office of governor. When the player has obtained both this title and $300,000, he may then move to the inner track and begin acquiring electoral votes in his bid for the Presidency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player reaches the &amp;quot;end&amp;quot; space, votes are tallied. The player with the most electoral votes wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
