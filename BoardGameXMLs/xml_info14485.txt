			<description>Blast Off was released by Five Star Games Company (possibly the later Helen of Toy) that was featured on many comics during the 1960's.  The Blast Off Space Game does not seem to be a War Game but it appears to have included 3D Toy Soldier Spacemen. Because GIANT supplied most of the 3D figures for Helen of Toy Comic Game Sets, it seems possible that the Spacemen of Blast Off could have been the Spacemen figures made by GIANT. Ads suggest that there may have been some type of 312 sq. inch Playmat onto which players somehow &amp;quot;launched&amp;quot; their &amp;quot;X7-DART and XL-DART Space Ships.&amp;quot;  The &amp;quot;40 Multi-Stage Rocket Ships&amp;quot; with the game supposedly included their own &amp;quot;Removable Astronaut&amp;quot; so a dart Game seems unlikely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
