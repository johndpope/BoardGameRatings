			<description>Mozaic ... two players take turns drawing gemstones, one at a time, from the bag and placing them on the empty board to form point-scoring squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four same-color gemstones in a square scores 4 points. Points are won with a player's own gemstones (even when placed by the opponent) and always accrued, never deducted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four exception gemstones are included: red = miss this turn (i.e. drawing red is the turn), green = slide any gemstone diagonally to an empty adjacent tile, black = take two turns (i.e. set the black aside and draw twice more), white = remove any gemstone from the board and replace it in the bag. Exception gemstones are always returned to the bag after a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over when all the tiles on the board are covered, only the four exception gemstones remain in the bag and the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using luck of the draw and strategy, players may place, move and/or remove opponent's gemstones, as well as their own, in order to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
