							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legacy at Sea</name>
									
			<description>Unemployment is high. European oversight is sparse. Merchant vessels are transporting lucrative goods through the Caribbean. The conditions are set for the Golden Age of Piracy. Given few options, many chose a life of plunder and strife. But alas, life aboard a sailing ship is anything but easy. Cramped quarters, storms, rats and infested food, most will be lucky to survive. A few may even find fortune. Be skilled and your name may live on in history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features of Legacy at Sea&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Actions are resolved by sector, not by player &amp;ndash; Commanders stay involved in the game. No long pauses between turns.&lt;br/&gt;     Upgrade your ships &amp;ndash; You will command three ships. You may add cannon, crew, officers, and specialists.&lt;br/&gt;     Key Event Cards &amp;ndash; Each card adds a story element of the game. Your choices will affect your reputation and how the foreign powers view you.&lt;br/&gt;     7 Victory Conditions &amp;ndash; (Wealth, Guile, Ruthlessness, Spanish Hero, English Hero, Captain objective, Secret Back Story objective).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will control 3 ships in their armada. Each round they will choose one of four actions. Sail/Explore, Plunder, Attack, Repair. Larger Merchant Ships and Treasure Ships will be heavily defended and more difficult to take. Do you risk it or attempt to build up your reputation by picking off smaller ships?&lt;br/&gt;This is a medium level difficulty game. Giving you a representative experience without bogging you down in details. However, the choices you make and lady luck will determine which pirates will ultimately prevail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
