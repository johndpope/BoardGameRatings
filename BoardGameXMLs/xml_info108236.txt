							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dhampir: Scions of the Night</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the shadows of civilization, the offspring of the forbidden union between humans and vampires struggle to find their place in a hostile world. These scions of the night need every trick available to them if they are to survive the enmity and mistrust that awaits in the world beyond. The dhampir children of undead vampires and hapless or depraved humans survive through unique fusions of ingenuity and resiliency, and now these abilities can be yours!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Packed with variant racial abilities and class features designed to allow players to customize the feel and style of their dhampir characters just as thoroughly as any elf or dwarf, Dhampir: Scions of the Night offers everything you need to bring a dhampir adventurer to life. Complete with racial analysis and idea starters for character background and appearance, Dhampir: Scions of the Night is an advanced guide to playing a dhampir.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And of course, since anything that players have access to is fair game for a GM, quick and easy guides for creating random dhampir NPCs are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
