			<description>Dice Rockets is a fun dexterity game, in which players are&lt;br/&gt;flicking dice on a surface in order to get the best spots on a&lt;br/&gt;field of holes that score points.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has its own set of five colored dice and players are&lt;br/&gt;taking turns flicking dice from the launch space and trying to&lt;br/&gt;land their dice rockets on the most rewarding spaces.&lt;br/&gt;If a die lands on the same space as another player's, then the&lt;br/&gt;player with the higher result gets the reward. In case of a tie,&lt;br/&gt;nobody gets a reward.&lt;br/&gt;After all dice are launched, players calculate the points &lt;br/&gt;scored, take their dice sets back and start launching again.&lt;br/&gt;If a player wins two out of three rounds, he or she is declared&lt;br/&gt;the best dice launcher!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
