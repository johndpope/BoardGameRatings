			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crystal Shuffle is a gem-matching puzzle game developed and published by Ubisoft. It has nice features such as left-handed mode and Facebook connectivity so players can compare scores with their friends. It is a new take on this genre, with a new means of shuffling gems around the playfield. Its difficulty curve is smooth, but challenging. Its pricetag was 1 dollar while it was available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
