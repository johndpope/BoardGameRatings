							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Care Bears: Warm Feelings</name>
									
			<description>In this game, players help the Care Bears stop Professor Cold Heart from freezing the hearts of all the boys and girls in town. On your turn, you spin the spinner and advance to the first empty space that matches the color you spin. If you land on a Rainbow, you place a Rainbow Chip on the Thermometer track. If you land on Professor Cold Heart, remove the top Rainbow Chip from the Thermometer. When all the Rainbow Chips have been placed in the Thermometer, players may remove and keep 1 Icicle Card (covering the the large Rainbow on the board) whenever they land on a Rainbow Space. The game ends when all the Icicle Cards have been removed. Then the players all turn over their cards and the player whose cards show the most Care Bears wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
