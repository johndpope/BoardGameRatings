							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death in the Painted Canyons (Swords &amp; Wizardry)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death in the Painted Canyons is an adventure for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game for 4-6 characters levels 5-6. The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game GameMastery Guide is helpful for the use of this adventure as many of the NPC stat blocks appear in it, though other stats can be substituted as necessary. The party should includes a mix of abilities, especially characters with investigative and survival skills. It would be helpful, but not necessary, if at least one PC has some knowledge of the Painted Canyons, or at least some experience with desert survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, a PC or companion with the scent ability (or who has an item or spell that grants it) would be helpful, but is not needed. If your party lacks investigative skills, there are clues as to the criminal conspiracy in the gnoll encampment, or you can just drop that aspect of the adventure and run it as a stand up fight. Parties lacking survival skills or desert experience can hire a guide at Salt Springs for 3 silver shekels (gp) a day. There is a hidden secret behind all the events of Death in the Painted Canyons; a great deal of combat can be expected, and those attempting this adventure should be prepared for a vicious battle before resolving the plot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
