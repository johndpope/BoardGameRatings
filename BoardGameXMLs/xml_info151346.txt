			<description>Subterfuge is a 2-player, luck-free, abstract strategy game played on a standard chess /checkers board using 12 standard dice (6 each in 2 separate colours).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has many similarities to chess but uses d6 dice as the pieces.  Each player starts with their 6 dice in their home territory and they advance into the field to play.  Players alternate moving one of their pieces with the winner being the first player to capture 4 of their opponent&amp;rsquo;s pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The value of each die face determines the movement and capability of the piece &amp;ndash; smaller values move lesser distances but can Capture larger dice &amp;ndash; higher value dice move greater distances but Expose smaller dice - equal value dice Influence the value of neighbouring dice, including your own.   Pieces may move forward or backward according to the movement rules defined for each die facing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stuterfuge includes many layers of strategic play and brain-burning tactical play, as the dice values change throughout the game.   Game length can vary between 15 to 60 mins, depending on the time permitted for each move.  Multiple variants are also included in the rules, allowing wildly different tactics and play for each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
