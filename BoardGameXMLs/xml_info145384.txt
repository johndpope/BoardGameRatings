							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Title Chase: Football</name>
									
			<description>Title Chase Football is another fast-paced game using may of the techniques used in Title Chase: Basketball this time in the arena of American football. The game focuses on team building, getting into the playoffs and winning it all. Like its predecessor, Title Chase: Football should not be confused with a simulation. It is a game meant to pit players against each other and as such can be completed from the start of the season to the championship game in less than an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first half of the game is a card-driven game where you build up your team by improving aspects of the game, winning key games and gaining ground in the standings. Not every team can make the playoffs but is it worth it to you to avoid the dreaded cellar spots in each division? Do you build a powerful dynasty? Can coaching and luck to carry you through? Or maybe you just decide to rely on your defense to lock the opponent's down. The way that you build your team is up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the regular season, the game switches to a full-on dice game using the teams you created during the regular season. Teams match up for playoff games where your dice are the ones you labored to improve earlier. As your dice are expended in each quarter, the game gets more and more tense and often it comes down to one final toss of the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the game does not use hard and fast statistics and has no built in way to produce them, I find that it really scratches that sports itch that I used to spend hours on back in the day with Statis-Pro Football and Football Strategy. With Title Chase Football Carla &amp;amp; I can play it together even though she has only a passing knowledge of the sport. The game is meant to be played by players of all levels of sporting knowledge and still be fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
