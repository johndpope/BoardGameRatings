							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Postman Pat Delivery Round Game</name>
									
			<description>Players are postmen travelling round Greendale competing to deliver letters. At the start of the game players are given some letters to deliver. Each time one of these letters is delivered by arriving by exact count on a particular square you take a stamp. The stamps have varying values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games ends when one player has delivered all their letters. The winner is the player with the highest total value of stamps, not the player who finished first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
