			<description>An extraordinary puzzle to play, learn and observe - a game idea that grows with the child. For 1 child (aged 2 and up) and 1 adult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Game&amp;amp;Puzzle contains three variations for playing and educating your child as he/she matures. The variations are:&lt;br/&gt;  &amp;middot; A sorting game for your child to learn to distinguish colors and forms (2+)&lt;br/&gt;  &amp;middot; A simple dice game for children ages 3+.&lt;br/&gt;  &amp;middot; A jigsaw and guessing game requiring careful observation, for platers 4+.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the games: &lt;br/&gt;  &amp;middot; Which piece belong to which dip? Sort everything correctly (2+)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; Who will be the first to reach the locomotive with their game piece? (3+)&lt;br/&gt;  &amp;middot; Who will be able to assemble the jigsaw and find the 10 differences? (4+)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; Your child takes the kindergarten child as their game piece. Then yhey walk the figure up to the different wooden pieces and to the bear reflector. Each time the game piece reaches a wooden piece it should be inserted into the corresponding dip. All wooden pieces are inserted? Then you can try the dice game with your child.(2+)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; You take turns to roll the dice. The child starts. Depending on the colored symbol that appears on the dice the players takes the corresponding game piece and lines it up next to their own game piece in the direction of the locomotive. Then the child puts their game piece past the figure just placed and returns this game piece back into its dip in the game board. Then it&amp;acute;s theturn of the next player. The game ends as soon as the game piece of a player has reached or passed the locomotive thus winning the game (3+)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The child assembles the jigsaw on the picture base. Then they compare the finished jigsaw with the picture on the game board and search for the 10 differences. The 10 solutions are also hidden in the story to be read and loud (in the instructions) (4+)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
