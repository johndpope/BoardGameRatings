			<description>A deckbuilding Legacy game with the Civilization theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with the same set of 11 cards representing their Stoneage tribe and keep developing their society, card after card. The game can be played in two modes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legacy mode: After the first game (Era I) players score their points and set their decks aside. The next time they'll play, each player is going to start with his own old deck and new cards will be available in the market (cards from Era II). After 5 games (5 eras), the player with the highest sum of points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast mode: Use less copies of each card; players play a one-shot game purchasing cards from the market and refilling it with cards of the next eras. The player with the highest sum of points at the end of the single game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game mechanics are both similar and different from the original Dominion; basically, players can play a card and purchase a card from the market, as in Dominion. However, the market is a row of cards instead of different deck containing the same card in multiple copies. Moreover, there is only one type of card in the game. Each card has a point value, an effect, a cost, a colour, and can be discarded from hand together with other cards of the same colour to purchase a new card from the market. There are Leaders and Wonders too; Leaders are multicolour and have powerful effects while Wonders can be purchased at any time and they provide more ways to score extra points or other bonuses. Keep them separated from your deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Legacy mode: players choose and obtain a Leader at the end of each game, with the player with the highest score being the first to choose. Wonders can be purchased at any time (max. 1 per era) in place of a card of the market, and players keep all their Wonders until the end of the 5 eras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
