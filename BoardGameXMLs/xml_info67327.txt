			<description>Discover the wonders of the ancient world in a cut-throat board game of piracy, trading and treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boats laden with gold, diamonds and great treasure, sail the Seven Seas in Riches 'n Rascals - grappling with pirates and encountering wonderous and momentous moments in world history.&lt;br/&gt;You begin your journey in the biting cold of the Ice Age, a time when terrifying sabre toothed tigers and mighty mammoths roam ice covered lands.  As you sail the seas trading and pirating, you travel through the ages encountering the invention of the wheel, the great pyramids, Tutankhamen's magnificent mask and other great human achievements.&lt;br/&gt;Can you fill your treasure chest with the most loot through cunning trading and pirating? &lt;br/&gt;A cut-throat game of adventure and intrigue, Riches 'n Rascals is an exciting educational game where players discover world history without any background knowledge.  No two games are exactly the same, enabling players to play indefinitely, discovering more &amp;amp; more about world history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How Riches 'n Rascals is played:&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you roll the two dice (a numbered die and &amp;lsquo;scroll&amp;rsquo; die) and move your boat counter filed with gold, diamonds or other treasure to lands near and far.  You trade with other lands at their home port and pirate other players by landing on their boats.  If a &amp;lsquo;scroll&amp;rsquo; die is rolled, you consult the &amp;lsquo;History Scrolls&amp;rsquo; - read out what is happening in this place and time in history and follow the Scrolls&amp;rsquo; instructions.  If great achievements are happening in history you may get to double your loot or have a second turn, if there is strife - you may lose your loot or miss a turn.  Any loot you safely bring back to your home port can be placed in your Treasure Chest where it is safe from all pirating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
