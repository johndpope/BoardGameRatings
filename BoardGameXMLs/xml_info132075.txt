			<description>There is game board with a spiral path what ends on the center of the board.&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets hand of cards (red, blue, green, orange or white) numbered from 1 to 10. The number of the card determines the movement of the player, the color corresponds to the colors of the boxes of the route. After distribution, the upper card heel indicates the trump suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round, all players choose one of their cards and pose face down in front of them. All cards are opened and the strongest card wins the trick (the trump outweighs the other colors). Only the player who wins the trick moves his pawn as many spaces indicated by the card., it is necessary that the color of the card matches the color of the box when the pawn arrives.&lt;br/&gt;The white cards are bonus cards in which the color is optional.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who reaches to finish first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
