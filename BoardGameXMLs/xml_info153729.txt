							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flip!</name>
									
			<description>Flip! is an exciting new twist on classic Rummy; the cards are double-sided. Players will steal each other's cards to help them win by playing sets and runs. First player to get rid of all of their cards wins the round. &amp;quot;Flip!&amp;quot; cards cause players to have to flip over their entire hand, discovering new possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
