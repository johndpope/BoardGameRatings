							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dora the Explorer Follow the Leader</name>
									
			<description>This is a simple children's game in which players flip a coin to determine if they move one or two spaces.  On each space they must complete a simple activity, for instance &amp;quot;Flap Your Arms&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Blink Your Eyes.&amp;quot;  Each player who is behind the leader must also complete this physical activity.  Like most roll-and-move children's games, the first player to the final space wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was first published in Nick Jr. Magazine cover date April 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
