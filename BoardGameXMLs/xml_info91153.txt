			<description>From the developer's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New York has been shaken by a series of ritual murders. Wealthy people die in mysterious circumstances, the victims seem to have no traits that could link them in a logical way. Murders are committed with a strange tool, the victims have their hearts removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A young female FBI agent, Nicole Bonnet, is assigned to the case. She is supposed to assist an older, more experienced colleague, Nick, but it quickly turns out that Bonnet will have to accept more responsibility for this investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are the culprit&amp;rsquo;s motives?&lt;br/&gt;What links the victims?&lt;br/&gt;What is this mysterious murder tool? Why was such a young and inexperienced agent given the case?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In her search for clues, Nicole Bonnet will visit the darkest corners of New York as well as the archeological capital of America &amp;ndash; the Peruvian Cusco &amp;ndash; and the Amazon jungle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Art of Murder is a point-and-click adventure game. To solve the puzzle, the player will have to think logically, combine facts and act as an FBI agent would do in a real investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
