			<description>The Marriage of Persephone&lt;br/&gt;A Main Course RPG as Quests and a Play in Two Parts&lt;br/&gt;an Iron Game Chef Entry for 2006&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RPG is the second main course of a Full Course of Love and Death, coming between the first main course of Someone to Love and the third, One More Hour. (It is the third game of the five included in the Full Course.) The couple to be married is one of the most successful couples in the prior game of Someone to Love. Likewise, the team of heroes after gaining the favor of the gods in The Marriage of Persephone will return to life once more, to attempt their last mission or betray it to seek some measure of peace in their lives. Like all games in this Full Course, The Marriage of Persephone is intended for five players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a game designed for Iron Game Chef 2006, it is necessary to discuss the allotments made for that contest. Indeed, for the theme of time, Marriage of Persephone fulfills the two sessions of 6 hours requirement, including the intervening 2 weeks. And it uses the following contest terms: Law, Actor, and Team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
