			<description>An educative board game by the Swedish Consumer Council (Konsumentverket). The goal of the game is for the players to roll-and-move across the board (square grid map over a super market), and get the 3 items on their shopping list, while avoiding buying too much stuff. On certain spaces you must draw chance cards which usually consists of succeeding in a die roll or else you fell for the ad or special offer and you end up with a stupid something you didn't need or want. But if you land on another player's pawn, you can force him/her to take over the item you didn't need!&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get out of the super market with the three items on his/her shopping list, but with a shopping cart total of 50 SEK or less is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;Hilarious and well made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comes with a fairly big &amp;quot;teacher's book&amp;quot; with informative text about how shops make you want to buy more, usual ad-tactics, statistics and drills, to be performed with the class, aimed at middle or junior high.&lt;br/&gt;Creator is uncredited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
