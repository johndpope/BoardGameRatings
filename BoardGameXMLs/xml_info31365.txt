			<description>&amp;quot;The entertaining game that is energizing and challenging, yet easy for everyone to play.  Professional acting ability is not required, though quick wit and good memory are essential to success.  Come find out if you've got the right ingredients to win!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Names of famous people are secretly written on pieces of party at the beginning of the game.  There are three phases: Say Anything, Triple Threat and Charades.  A representative from the playing team gives clues to get their team mates to guess the name.  In Say Anything, players can give any clues but the name on the paper or initials.  In Triple Threat, only three word clues can be given.  Charades require only acting, no words.  Each round, correctly guessed names are placed in the next round's bowl.  Players who have been playing close attention the previous round are at an advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment includes three bowls, marked for each round.  Perforated tablets for writing names.  Pencils.  Timer.  Dice.  Gameboard (place holder for bowls).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
