							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Red Dragon&#039;s Lair: Monster Manual</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Red Dragon's Lair is a successful character-driven adventure game, with a wide range of character types. The stories of Robin Hood, Merlin, Daphne, and many other masters of combat are told with furious battles on across the world. Some rise, some fall, though none of these characters survive unscarred. Their stories have become legend. Now it is time, Your Quest Awaits. The Red Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Lair, the fantasy adventure where you become a Magician, Rogue, Warrior, Paladin, Alchemist, Berserker, Bard and more on a quest to slay an evil Red Dragon. You control the actions of a daring adventurer finding the way through hideous surface creatures, a cave of wonders, and a dark dungeon filled with, undead monsters, elementals and treacherous traps. In the mysterious adventure your quest continues against the evil forces that oppose you. Your daring efforts to reach the Red Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Lair are where your adventure begins and Your Quest Awaits! The evil Red Dragon dwells far across an unexplored land and lives deep within a dungeon filled with undead monsters and elementals. Your quest is to cross the great unknown, clear the dungeon of evil and slay the Red Dragon. You and your friends will make the journey looting monsters and plundering the dungeon in search of magical items, weapons and treasure! This game is a character driven game, and built upon my d10 system. Players use a pre-made character or create one of their own! Creating a character is fast and easy or choose a character and begin the game. Next equip your character with special items and weapons. Each character is unique and uses different styles of combat. The crafty Rogue hides in the shadows firing arrows from a distance. The Paladin engages the monsters head-on with shield and sword. The Warrior jumps in the fray without regard for himself slaying monsters near and far. The alchemist mixes up concoctions for many things, the Magician uses powerful magic to protect the others and destroy monsters and the Berserker is immortal and Berserk. The awesome forces that oppose you can prove to be more than a match and adventurers will die! Mwahahahaha!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
