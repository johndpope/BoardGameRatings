			<description>In June 1917, at the start of the Battle of Messines, the mighty British commonwealth faced off against the proud and powerful German Army. 19 huge land mines were detonated, tearing apart the German lines and the fabric between the natural and Supernatural.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supernatural creatures spewed forth and the western front crumbled, as both sides quickly pulled back from this new enemy. Russia would fall to a new enemy in the resurrected Rasputin the great and the middle east would struggle under the cults of Moloch. The Pacific would see the rise of the Elder Gods with the return of R'lyeh and the cult of Dagon, in the Bermuda the re-emergence of Atlantis would see a new enemy and cult step onto the stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even with all this, mankind still continue to fight each other. Old enemies and grudges reappear, Mexico invades America, the Prussians invade New Guinea, and China invades Manchuria and Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with company-level sized units of infantry, horsed cavalry, tanks or machine guns. In their turn each player moves their miniatures, conducts artillery fire, resolves aerial attacks and then undertakes combat (ranged or close assault) against their opponent. Morale is also considered; as unit take casualties they may become ineffective, retire to the rear or even surrender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players attempt to win by defeating their opponents and driving them from the field or by completing one-off scenario based objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
