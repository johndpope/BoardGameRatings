							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Asteroid Miner</name>
									
			<description>Be the CEO of one of five corporations competing to set up mining operations in the asteroid belt. Demands for resources are at a record high. Corporations, fueled by their desire for wealth and power, race for the chance to be the supplier of these resources. In seven years, the rest of Earth's corporations will have caught up and the ridiculous prices for these precious materials will start to drop. Be the corporation that profits the most and show the galaxy who is the best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asteroid Miner is a worker placement and resource management board game in which players are the CEO of one of the first corporations to make mining the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter profitable. Players play for a maximum of six rounds, which represent a year in space. Each round, players must pick a special subcontractor card which gives special powers for the rest of the round. During the round players must choose where to send their crews: mine, blast, upgrade, or pick up contracts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
