			<description>From the back of the package:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Seas Trader breaks away from the fleet with its unique first person, YOU ARE THERE 3-D perspective!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you ready to take the helm of your own ship as a 17th century horizon slides into view? This completely new look in strategy gaming (no more little ships on flat maps!) puts you right up on deck while you outrun pirates and create trade routes to riches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get ready for wealth, danger and conquest in your bid to master the great maritime trading routes. Put ashore in faraway ports to repair the cannonball damage from the brigands you just blew away.
