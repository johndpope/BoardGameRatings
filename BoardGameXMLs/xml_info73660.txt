							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frontlines: Fuel of War</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Frontlines: Fuel of War is set in a dystopian  2024 in the midst of a global energy crisis. As supplies of oil and natural gas wane, diplomatic relationships between the East and West are strained, causing new alliances to be formed. The two major alliances in the Frontlines era are the Western Coalition, consisting of the United States and the European Union, and the Red Star Alliance, made up of the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China. The Red Star Alliance launches a surprise attack on the Western Coalition in retaliation to proof of the Western Coalition supporting a coup d'&amp;eacute;tat in an oil rich Red Star country. As the last oil fields start to go dry, the countries move to secure what resources are left, leading to several small outbreaks that turn quickly into full scale war. The game also contains some political commentary on how much wars cost in terms of fuel; how in certain occasions it can be more than the actual amount secured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay focuses on a central mechanic, the frontline. This is designed to keep the action in one place, by focusing objectives closer together on the battlefield. The frontline also has bonuses. By moving it back and forth across the battlefield, the player may gain or lose weapons and equipment. The frontline mechanic is used in all gametypes, which forces players to choose which objectives they will pursue or defend, adding a strategic level to the gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UCAV Drone plays a crucial role in gathering information in real time on the battlefield. The drone reconnoiters enemy units, which are visible through walls, and then show them on the player's HUD and map. Some drones can also be used as a kamikaze bomb, by running them into enemy infantry and self destructing them.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Frontlines:_Fuel_of_War,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
