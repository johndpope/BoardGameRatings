			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Microlite74 3d6 Edition rules are based on the 1974 0e edition of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular tabletop fantasy roleplaying game -- the original three booklets -- with some of the house rules the author used in the 1970s, and selected ideas from other roleplaying games. The major differences in this special 3d6 edition is that only D6s are needed for play (3d6 are rolled when a D20 would be rolled in standard versions) and the system includes partial successes as well as success and failure. This book contains the rules for the Microlite74 3d6 Edition, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Simple Character Creation Rules: Roll your attributes and select a race, class, background, and alignment.&lt;br/&gt;    Only three classes (Fighter, Magic-User and Cleric) but backgrounds allow an infinite variety of characters.&lt;br/&gt;    Simple and fast-playing combat system that tracks physical (body point) damage separately from luck/skill/fatigue (hit point) damage.&lt;br/&gt;    Hit points recover with a night&amp;rsquo;s rest. Actual wounds recover more slowly.&lt;br/&gt;    Casting a spell casting requires a successful action roll.&lt;br/&gt;    Rules for hirelings, monster reactions (not every monster wants to fight), morale (not every monster fights to the death), and more.&lt;br/&gt;    A complete list of spells and monsters.&lt;br/&gt;    Compatible with most other 0e based games and adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Microlite74 3d6 Edition is designed to be easy to play and rules light. Limiting the dice needed to play to D6s makes the game more accessible as almost everyone has a few standard six-sided dice around. While the Microlite74 3d6 Edition can be used with adventures and settings from early editions of world&amp;rsquo;s most popular tabletop fantasy roleplaying game with few changes, using only six-sided dice along with partial successes means the experience of playing will be somewhat different lending a new feel to even well-known old adventures. These rules assume that the GM understands the basic concepts of roleplaying games, but provides information for both the GM and the players on the various &amp;ldquo;old school&amp;rdquo; styles of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
