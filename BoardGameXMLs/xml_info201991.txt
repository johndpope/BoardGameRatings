			<description>Take the role of a Video Games development Studio. Employ designers, artists and programmers to make the best game you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-4 Players hire staff, give them ideas, then get those ideas into the game - whilst avoiding industrial espionage from your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, use the free app after the game to see how your game comes out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:  The game uses multi-use cards so that all of the staff that are available to hire can also be used as money - to pay for the staff - or as ideas - to increase the likelyhood that they will be able to add something to your game design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn they use their 2 actions to either draw new cards, put an employee into play (paying with cards,) add an idea, or roll the dice to get that employees idea into the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is augmented by a wide variety of action cards that will help or hinder your and your opponent's progress respectively.  For instance, hire an employee into a rival player's company to employ some corporate espionage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also gain benefits from reaching communal and private milestones / achievements as the game progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
