							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">World At War 85: Red Lighting</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Lightning is the SIXTH volume in the World at War 85 Series of games of fast and furious platoon-level combat. The series is set in 1985, in an alternate history of World War III. With the Warsaw Pact armies driving deep into Western Europe, the Soviets open another front in the Arctic Circle. Sweden, Norway and - in an unexpected and lightning strike - Iceland are invaded. Surprised by Polish and Soviet marine and parachute forces reinforced by ship-bourne Polish and Soviet armor, the Scandanavian and NATO/Icelandic defenders are hard-pressed.&lt;br/&gt; The World at War 85 system features a unique combat system that involves die rolls by both attacking units and defending units, which keeps both players engaged throughout the game. Die rolls are compared and hits applied quickly, as all the information you need to fight your units is on the counters. No combat results table is necessary. Initiative, formation activation, random turn length, close air support and air cover are all smoothly integrated.&lt;br/&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s all here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Basic, Advanced and, for each Volume, Optional Rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Units include:&lt;br/&gt;         SWEDISH STRV-103 and Centurion Main Battle Tanks&lt;br/&gt;         SWEDISH JA-37 Viggen Close Air Support Aircraft&lt;br/&gt;         NORWEGIAN Leopard 1-A1 Main Battle Tank&lt;br/&gt;         NORWEGIAN F-104G Starfighter Air Cover Aircraft&lt;br/&gt;         US MARINE (of the ICELANDIC DEFENSE FORCE) M-60 Main Battle Tank&lt;br/&gt;         US F-15 Eagle Air Cover Aircraft&lt;br/&gt;         POLISH T-62 and T-72 Main Battle Tanks&lt;br/&gt;         POLISH MIG-23 Air Cover Aircraft&lt;br/&gt;         SOVIET T-64 Main Battle Tank&lt;br/&gt;         SOVIET MIG-25 Air Cover Aircraft&lt;br/&gt;         &amp;hellip;and many more.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
