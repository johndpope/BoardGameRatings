			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy as one-two-three. Whoever counts the hedgehogs and birds the fastest yells &amp;ldquo;Got it&amp;rdquo; and collects the harvest! The originally designed game set in compact packaging with bright an unusual animal drawings is a great solution for this fun game and complementary for acquiring the basics of mathematics. Play and get smarter. This game is played in background mode, so you won&amp;rsquo;t have to convince your child to sit down at the table. Not only will children learn how to count, but they will instantly learn to define the number of objects on a card as well, which definitely separates this method of learning from cramming in a positive light. Adding within ten can easily become second nature to your child. HurriCount is a great supplement for developing your child&amp;rsquo;s attentiveness, logic, thinking speed, and reaction time. HurriCount has an application called HurriCount Mathitude where you will get to solve problems that are even more challenging. The cards from this game can be gradually added into HurriCount, making it more difficult, and you can also use it as a standalone playing set. When buying the two games at the same time, you will be able to receive a cut little bag that you can carry the games in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
