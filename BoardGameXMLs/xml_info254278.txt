							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elections in Phandalin</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, your players have just recently completed the D&amp;amp;D; Starter Set &amp;quot;Lost Mines of Phandelver&amp;quot;, wherein they have routed the Redbrand Brigade, cleared up Cragmaw Castle, defeated the Black Spider, discovered Wave Echo Cave, and generally made life better for the residents of Phandalin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it doesn't have to end there! With the reveal of the former Mayor's corruption and association with the Redbrand Brigade, the town is now in sore need of new leadership. And given the amount of time your players have spent in the town establishing connections and making friends, it's only appropriate that they get to participate in the process of choosing the new leader!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
