			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tubes is a game much like Tetris or Columns, but it has a number of twists.  The premise in Tubes is that Lanny B. Brilliant - a scientist - has created a number of new unstable elements: Redium, Greenium, Bluium, Cyanium, Purplium, Yellowium, Pinkium, and Flashium.  These elements need to be reclaimed by being combined together into chains of 3 (called molecules).  The atoms flow through a set of six tubes, one at a time, with the player having to catch them in a moveable container that can hold up to five atoms.  The container can then be flipped to drop one atom at a time into a beaker, where they are arranged to be removed from play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
