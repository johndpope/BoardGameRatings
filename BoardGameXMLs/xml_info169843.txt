							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grognards &amp; Goblins: A Fantasy Roleplaying Game of the Napoleonic Wars</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grognards &amp;amp; Goblins is a game which encourages fantastic adventure in the age of Napoleon.  In Grognards &amp;amp; Goblins magic stays more in the shadows than in the typical high fantasy or sword and sorcery campaign.  On the surface it is a game of valor: of clashing swords and roaring cannons, of cavalry charges and bayonet squares, of looking through the spyglass... are those the blue coats of the French we see advancing on our flank, or is it Prussian black? It is a game of heroic deeds on the field of battle, of mentions in dispatches and rising in rank, and perhaps even joining the vaunted imperial guard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
