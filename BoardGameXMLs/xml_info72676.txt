			<description>Part of the Age of Battles table-top miniatures gaming system using 1/72 scale miniatures, The Battle of Issa replays Alexander's attempt to defeat Darius and his Persian army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;The military-historic game &amp;quot;The Battle of Issa&amp;quot; is based on the events that took place in Syria in October 333 BC in the valley between mountains and the sea. Two armies of Alexander the Great and Darius of Persia met. The Macedonial cavalry and phalanx crossed the river under Persian arrows and made the Persian king and all his army flee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is for 2-6 players. The enemy armies led by the players meet near the bay of Issa, in the valley of the Pinar river. Battle characteristics of the armies are close to the reality.Tactic maneuvering are very important in the game. Under a skillful leader a smaller army can defeat numerous enemies. You can either recreate the historic battle or change the course of the fight. Anyway you should rely not only on the number of your army but also on your leadership and war skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zvezda 8205&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
