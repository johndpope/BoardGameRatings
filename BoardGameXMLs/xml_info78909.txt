			<description>From Box Back&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You arrive, a stranger in a strange land.  Confused, disoriented, you make your way through the twisted, surreal world in search of your partner, Max.  All you carry with you is the knowledge you've grown to accept as the truth.  But you're about to discover that what the truth is depends on what world you're in.  And in this world, things don't necessarily work the way they're supposed to.  In this world, the characters don't exactly do what you might expect them to.  In this world, the laws of physics have somehow become contorted, what is up and what is down is merely a matter of opinion.  Here, after every perplexing puzzle you solve, another lurks around the corner.  And as you unravel each elusive mystery, an even bigger one begins to unfold.  The question is, will you put together all the pieces of the puzzle and make the right choice when the time comes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
