			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opportunity Doesn't Knock... it's Made&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I grew up in the favelas, destitute and desperate. I always felt life had more to offer me than poverty and an early grave, but I could never seem to catch a break. That&amp;rsquo;s when I realized that life doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen to you&amp;mdash;you have to go and get it yourself. So I scrounged up what resources I could and started putting them to use for me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I may not have formal business training like some people, but I have knowledge of the local area and dozens of contacts on my side. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take an educated know-it-all to collect money from people who are willing to give it to you as long as you&amp;rsquo;ve got the charm to make them think it&amp;rsquo;s the right thing to do. That&amp;rsquo;s not something everyone has, but it&amp;rsquo;s my gift and I&amp;rsquo;m not about to waste it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psi-punk Archetypes: Opportunist is for characters who specialize in making the most out of every situation.   This supplement provides further insight into the archetype and offers suggestions for skill selections, Gifts, Faults, and Gear that would be useful to any Opportunist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
