			<description>On a 16-hex gameboard (4x4 quadrilateral) of a honeycomb, two players each control three bees.  The object of the game is maneuver all of your bees so that they are adjacent to any one of your opponent's bees.  Either player may declare a &amp;quot;swarm&amp;quot; at the end of their turn, meaning that for the rest of the game, each player must move twice per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was published in the March 2006 issue of GAMES Magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was reprinted in the August 2010 issue, on page 10. In this issue the board and rules were printed on the same page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
