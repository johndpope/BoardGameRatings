							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Table Air Combat: Yak-7</name>
									
			<description>Table Air Combat is a fast, simple air combat game that can be played on any flat surface. Each ruleset is a self-contained game including cut-out miniatures of one aircraft and a set of rules. All you need are some six-sided dice and some coins to provide weight for the aircraft counters.  Everything else can be printed from this ruleset.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a flight of four fighters, represented by two counters.  Aircraft counters move by means of curved &amp;ldquo;performance rulers&amp;rdquo; that represent the aircraft&amp;rsquo;s historical cornering ability and maximum speed.&lt;br/&gt;TAC is designed for portability;  The entire game can fit in a plastic bag.  Even the largest battles can take place on a fast-food restaurant table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Yak-7 was a trainer for the Yak-1 but was developed into a new fighter.  It can also substitute as a Yak-1 or Yak-9.&lt;br/&gt;This set is a self-contained rulebook that includes miniatures for the Yak-7 and contains five scenarios that reference other aircraft:&lt;br/&gt;Barbarossa: Yak-1s defend an airfield against the Luftwaffe's Ju-87 Stukas escorted by Bf-109E fighters.&lt;br/&gt;Teeth of the Bear: Yak-7s ambush a group of  Bf-109F fighters.&lt;br/&gt;586th:  Stalingrad is under attack from Ju-88 bombers and  Bf-109F fighters.
