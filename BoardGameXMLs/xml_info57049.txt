			<description>Endless Quest #36&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;The Dark Druid Malgarath has stolen the Song of Gold and entrapped the sprites of the Faerie Folk in another dimension. Unless you can return the fabled harp to its rightful owners, the Dark Druid will use its magical powers to drain the hope, the joy, the very life from your land to feed its master's dark power...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are about to enter the exciting world experienced by players of the popular DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS Game. It is a fantasy world filled with enchanted castles and fearsome monsters. Are YOU brave enough to meet its challenges?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In other ENDLESS QUEST Books, you can combat secret agents skilled in espionage, journey to the corners of the galaxy, or attempt to survive in a future world ravaged by wars. The choice is YOURS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each ENDLESS QUEST Book is based on an exciting role-playing game, but you don't need to know the game to enjoy the book. Just make your choices, and accept the consequences!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember! Only your choices can lead to success in ENDLESS QUEST Books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
