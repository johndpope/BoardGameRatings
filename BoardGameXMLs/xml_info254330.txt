							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">OrcQuest WarPath: Chapter Box – Blood for Blood</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Blood for Blood&amp;quot; is a brand new expansion that will enrich the OrcQuest universe with new enemies. With the Secondary Campaign included, your heroes can compete against the Barbarians, this famous warrior folk that can easily compete with the Orcs. Along with Humans, Elves and Dwarves, the Barbarians are one of the major nations to have always been at war with the Orcs... or is it the other way around? Nevertheless, it remains a major problem: a rumor of alliance with the Kingdom of Istarra in the conquest of the Bloody Woods begins to cause trouble among greenskins. Our heroes have thus decided to go to settle their account as they know how best to do it: with brutality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first, the heroes will have to return home and repel the Barbarian troops, thrown in the vicinity of the Bloody Woods. Barbarian camps are set up everywhere and our heroes will have to attack and destroy them as quickly as possible, before their enemies gather. The Alert track will be used to generate waves of increasingly powerful enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a series of unfortunate events, the heroes find themselves facing Ragnar, the Barbarian King, and will have to entertain him in a battle arena. If they emerge champions in the events, they can challenge the warring regent and compete against him. Be careful, because his strength is legendary. Moreover, as he plays at home, his subjects will not stand by idly. In this situation, the Alert track will serve to measure the enthusiasm of the Barbarian King. The more combos the heroes make, the higher the cursor on the track goes. When the cursor has passed the last level, Ragnar the Barbarian King will finally be eager to descend into the arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
