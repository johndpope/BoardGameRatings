			<description>Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Drift (known as Kaidō Battle in Japan) is the third racing game published by Crave Entertainment for the PlayStation 2. The game allows racing at both day and night. Day time offers the opportunity to enter competitions and gain money; nighttime is when you can race against rivals to gain respect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was set between Zero and 3, according to Japanese series timeline. For unknown reasons, the North American release was delayed till 2006, but the plot still set in 2003, due to car listing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game, like any in the series, included the Japanese and imported foreign cars. The foreign cars included Alfa Romeo, Mini and Volkswagen. Honda was licensed in this game but not available in its sequel, due to the licensing problems. Examples of the other licensed Japanese cars were Autobacs Seven. The Mitsubishi Starion 4WD rally car were available in this game, but has been converted to road-going versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The five mountain courses were featured in this game:&lt;br/&gt;    Hakone&lt;br/&gt;    Haruna&lt;br/&gt;    Iroha B&lt;br/&gt;    Iroha A&lt;br/&gt;    Front Rokko&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Drift&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
