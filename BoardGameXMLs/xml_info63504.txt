			<description>A fairly basic trick-taking game which uses a Spanish suited deck of 48 cards (standard deck minus the 10s). The suit of the cards does not matter, the highest ranked card wins the tick, in case of a tie the winner of the next trick takes both tricks. The object is to win more tricks, the first player (or partnership) to win 12 hands wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
