			<description>Sourcebook covering the spirit realms in the land of Rokugan. Dual system for use with both Legend of the Five Rings 2e and Oriental Adventures. Has extensive information regarding the ongoing metaplot of the series at the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Fortunes and Winds opens up new worlds for players already familiar with Legend of the Five Rings - ten worlds to be precise. The Spirit Realms vaguely hinted at in previous supplements are illustrated here in detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Realm of the Hungry Dead, the Realm of Tricksters, even foul Jigoku, home of the demonic oni; all are presented in this volume along with their bizarre inhabitants. How do you get to these realms? What will you find there? Most importantly once you are there, how do you get home again? Fortunes and Winds answers all these questions and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;Mysterious shapeshifters. Terrifying demons. Bloodthirsty ghosts. Mystical dragons. These creatures often appear in the Empire of Rokugan, but where do they come from? The world that they samurai see and perceive is merely one realm overlapping mnay others, a single piece of a much larger puzzle. Great wonders lie beyond the borders of the mortal realm, but terrible dangers wait there as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book introduces the ten Spirit Realms to your Legend of the Five Rings campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Details on the ten Spirit Realms, including the Realm of Hungry Ghosts, the Celestial Heavens, and the foul pits of Jigoku. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for creating shapeshifter and returned spirit player characters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New creatures and magic from the various Spirit Realms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Up-to-date story information, revealing details on the origins of the deadly Tsuno, the enigmatic Naka Tokei, and the nightmarish Onisu. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New feats, Advanatges, and many other new character creation options. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     And much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a dual-system supplement for the Legend of the Five Rings Role-Playing Game, Second Edition, and Rokugan, the d20 Companion for Legend of the Five Rings.
