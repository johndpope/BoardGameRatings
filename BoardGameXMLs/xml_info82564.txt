			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle Kid: Fortress of Peril is a retro-style platform adventure game developed by Sivak Games. In the game, Dr. Tina Byers discovers that a mysterious group is developing a supermech in an abandoned fortress once inhabited by wizards. She asks Timmy to infiltrate the fortress and stop their plans. The player controls Timmy as he makes his way through the stronghold fighting enemies and bosses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is modeled similarly to classic platformers, and is set in one large explorable world. There are over 550 rooms to venture through, and all enemies and hazards cause instant death. Battle Kid includes a difficulty setting that allows unlimited continues, however, and there is a password system to record progress. Battle Kid has elements of several games, including I Wanna be the Guy, Metroid, Mega Man, and Castlevania.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
