			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flags over Mars! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This short FREE Quickstart adventure is designed to allow play&amp;shy;ers to take on the role of heroes from the John Carter of Mars stories as they encounter perilous adventures on Barsoom explore the rules of its 2d20 roleplaying system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is set shortly after the events of A Princess of Mars and the decline of Helium&amp;rsquo;s long time rival, Zodanga. During this period, John Carter stays for years in Helium with his beloved Dejah Thoris, but few of his adven&amp;shy;tures during this time are described in Bur&amp;shy;rough&amp;rsquo;s work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the adventure begins, Carter is travelling with Dejah and several friends and allies by flier to meet with a delegation from a minor Red Martian kingdom, Voninka, that is seeking alliance with Helium. Voninka was a small satellite nation of Zodanga until the nation&amp;rsquo;s recent defeat at the hands of Helium.
