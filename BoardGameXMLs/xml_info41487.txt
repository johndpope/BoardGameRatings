							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Royal Flush</name>
									
			<description>The game consists of 2 standard card decks of 52 cards and 17 card tables. Each game 9 out of the 17 card tables are chosen and players have to collect the card combinations depicted there. Depending on the difficulty of the combination players get points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the beginning, each player gets 5 chips. On his turn, a player can either choose one of the 4 open cards from the display, a hidden card from the deck, exchange the open cards (costs 1 chip) or play a combination on one of the tables. A round ends when the first player has played all of his chips on the tables or when one player gets a Royal Flush. Winner is the player with the most points after 5 rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
