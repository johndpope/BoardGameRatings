			<description>A game of chess played on a game of chess with two sets of chess pieces: a big set that carries a small set. The goal of the game is to take the small king. On a move the small pieces can either move across the tops of the big pieces or pilot the big piece they're on. Small pieces cannot leave their big piece board unless there is an adjacent big piece to legally move to, and can move across several adjacent big piece boards in a move as long as the move is legal and uninterrupted by gaps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
