			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An interactive paedagogical game written in BASIC for vocabulary building work in any natural language.  Although the game as presented here is intended for antonym-matching, it can easily be modified to test definitions, either in the native language, as with remedial work.  The version discussed below is for German; the program is named SPIEL1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by presenting the student with three rounds of ten words each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SPIEL1 was written by Barney M. Milstein and published in an article entitled &amp;quot;A Universal Word Game in BASIC&amp;quot;, in Creative Computing, Vol. 1, No. 3, March/April 1975.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
