			<description>Theme: &lt;br/&gt;Arena of Heroes puts the players against each other in a fighting arena as they battle to the death.  The artwork is reminiscent of an arena filled with gladiators being cheered on by thousands of fans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play:&lt;br/&gt;The game board consists of a 5&amp;quot; by 5&amp;quot; grid, players start in the corners, are given 10 life tokens, and dealt 5 cards each.  There are 3 different types of cards in the full deck of 126 cards: black Movement Cards, red Combat Cards, and full color Item Cards.  The players draw back up to a full hand of 5 cards at the beginning of each turn, allowing the player to use all their cards on their turn or hold some back to defend against attacks on the other players' turns.  Each successful attack causes the defender to lose a life token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center Square:&lt;br/&gt;The center square of the 5&amp;quot; by 5&amp;quot; grid has special properties for both attackers and defenders.  If an attacker is occupying the center square and successfully lands an attack on the defender, the defender loses 2 life tokens.  If the defender is in the center square and the attacker successfully lands an attack, the attack has the choice of the defender taking the hit (and losing one life token) or knocking the attacker out of the center square and into any available adjacent square.  This can setup the attacker for various combinations for dealing additional damage on a second attack on the defender by first occupying the now available center square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement Cards:&lt;br/&gt;Movement Cards allow the players to move their miniature one square either diagonal or orthogonal as denoted by the image on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat Cards:&lt;br/&gt;The Combat Cards are used to attack opponents either diagonal or orthogonal as denoted by the image on the card.  The strength of the attack is determined by the number in the corner of the card.  Combat Cards are also used to defend against attacks and are successful if the defender's card is equal to or greater than the number on the attacker's card.  Combat cards can only be played against another player if their miniatures are adjacent, unless using the throwing axe (see Item Cards below).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Item Cards:&lt;br/&gt;The Item Cards include various weapons, armor, and other items to modify the numbers on the Combat Cards.  If a player has the two handed axe equipped (+4 to attack) and plays a Combat Card with a 7, the defender must counter the attack with an 11 or higher.  If the defender had a shield equipped (+3 to defense), then only an 8 or higher is required to defend the attack.  Bonuses to attack and defend do stack, but each player can only have 2 cards equipped and certain cards cannot be equipped at the same time as any others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal:&lt;br/&gt;Be the last player standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
