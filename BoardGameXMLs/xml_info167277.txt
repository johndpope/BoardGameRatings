							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">UNCORKED! The party game of wine, wit &amp; wordplay</name>
									
			<description>Gather your buds and taste! UNCORKED! is a wine-tasting game best played with 4-8 players and 4 different wines (any kind will do). It can be played at home or on the go, and requires no previous wine knowledge, so it&amp;rsquo;s fun for the fully ripened connoisseur to the unevolved amateur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, the &amp;quot;wine waiter&amp;quot; introduces a new wine and a new theme card to inspire players to write hilarious wine descriptions. Theme examples include, &amp;quot;If this wine had a job, what would it be?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Use sexual innuendo to describe this wine.&amp;quot; The wine waiter reads all submissions aloud and the object of the game is to earn &amp;ldquo;Perfect Pairing&amp;rdquo; points by correctly guessing WHO wrote WHAT. If you guess correctly, you earn 1 &amp;ldquo;Perfect Pairing&amp;rdquo; point and you get to guess again. If you are guessed correctly, you are eliminated from the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When there&amp;rsquo;s just one wino left standing, that person becomes wine waiter of the next round. The wine waiter also  awards 1 point for the answer they like best, and 1 &amp;ldquo;gratuity&amp;rdquo; point to themselves. You play as many rounds as you have wines, and the player with the most points at the end of the game is deemed winner and MASTER CONNOISSEUR and will seal their victory with a grand toast!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
