			<description>The game was published by Club Nathan in 1981, was for 2-4 players, 10 years and up and took about 30 minutes to play.  The principal mechanic is memory/memorization.  On turn, a player would roll the dice and pick up one of the disks, attempting to MATCH the number underneath with the value of the dice roll.  The disk would then be replaced on a different spot than the one it was picked up from.  If successful, the player would move the same colored tile down one row towards the bottom and go again.  Get 3 tiles off the board to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The numbers on the disks were 4 to 10.  Rolls of 3 and 11 permitted a peek underneath any disk.  A roll of 2 would allow a match of any low numbered disk (4,5,6) and a roll of 12 allowed a match of any high numbered disk (8,9,10).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
