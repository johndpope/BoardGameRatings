							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kirby no Kopitoru!</name>
									
			<description>A strategic card game featuring Nintendo's Kirby and his friends and rivals, with three different gameplay modes for different audiences and numbers of players. Cute, cheerful artwork and simple rules allowing for good depth and strategic play make it accessible to a wide audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Copy Power Battle&amp;quot; involves choosing Kirby cards from your hand to defeat enemy cards on the table, after which you can gain different copy powers and abilities based on the type of enemies you've defeated. The player with the highest victory points after seven rounds wins, based on the cumulative point value of the enemies they've defeated throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Simple Battle&amp;quot; is a variant on the above gameplay with simplified rules that works better for younger or larger numbers of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Single Battle&amp;quot; is a single-player variant involving a similar gameplay flow to Copy Power Battles, but incorporating waves of enemy cards that must be defeated to see how far you can progress without having your Kirby cards defeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;112 Cards (Kirby card &amp;times;54, Enemy card &amp;times;48, other cards&amp;times; 10)&lt;br/&gt;Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
