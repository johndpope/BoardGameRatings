			<description>SCARABALL at ESSEN 07 Booth number 9-30&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scaraball is a complete game for 2-6 players that comes with Dodecaedron 2007.  These are two games in one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dodecaedron 2007 is based on a hexagonal field (the Esadome) where players use their figertips to push 6 teams of superwarriors, trying to push the Dodecaedron Cap (the DOD) into the enemy goal areas and to stop the cap there (like happens in curling).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scaraball has the same theme and background but is played in a totally different way.&lt;br/&gt;No more fingertip hits, but rather calculated movements of the warriors based on a deck of &amp;quot;hit cards&amp;quot; that players use to hit the DOD or other players.  Players try to get the DOD into the goal, or knock opposing players off the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can simply push with violence the DOD in opposite direction as happens in Dodecaedron 2007 or you can direct it just like Scrabbles do with their food balls, not by pushing but by rolling. In this way you follow the DOD and direct it not only along straight lines but you can draw segmented patterns avoiding enemies, following the lines on the Scaraball field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can score by making a goal (3 points) or by blasting an enemy out of the field (1 point).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first prototype of Scaraball was presented on January 2007 at IDEAG Italian Designers and Authors Gathering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See the PhotoReport here -- &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://warangel.it/IDG7e.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://warangel.it/IDG7e.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://warangel.it/ScaEng.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://warangel.it/ScaEng.html&lt;/a&gt; (English)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
