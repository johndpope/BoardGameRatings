							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Broken City</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The once glittering glass and steel towers of the City of Dreams have fallen into disrepair and neglect. Thousands upon thousands of skyscrapers, dominating the horizon, their steel slowly turning to rust and decay, which the wind picks up and sends cascading down upon the plains in huge clouds, covering everything in flakes of red. To reach the City of Dreams, one must first cross those rust-filled plains. It is a dangerous and hard land, and the City of Dreams beyond it even more so. Yet, it is rumored that just beyond the City of Dreams there is a land that has not been laid to waste. For some, the hope of such a place is all they have left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
