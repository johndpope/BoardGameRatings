							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darwell&#039;s Tower</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instant adventure for 4-6 characters levels 3-4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darwell Umbruskor has long been known around town as an eccentric but ultimately harmless old sage.  From what you've heard, he keeps odd hours, rarely speaks a word to anyone, and lets no one enter his tower save for a few servants.  Though quiet and somewhat mysterious, Darwell has done nothing to arouse undue suspicion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sir Jeffers, a crusading warrior who just made your acquaintance, claims otherwise.  According to evidence he recently came across, Darwell Umbruskor is both a necromancer and a dedicated priest of an evil power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Don't let Darwell's appearances fool you, as they almost did us.  He may seem like just another fat old academic spending his days with his books and research, but I have learned that he has recently come into possession of an artifact of evil.  Darwell's out of town and shouldn't return for two more weeks.  We believe he is meeting with a few of his fellow servants of evil to hatch some diabolical plan involving the artifact.  Someone of your talents and resourcefulness shouldn't have any problem getting into his place and making it back out with the item we're after.  It's a gray, glass sphere that seems to be filled with swirling mists.  Don't touch it, just slide this bag over it and carry it out to us.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;We can't have the town guard involved in this.  Darwell's padded the coffers of the town watchmen, and they've agreed to keep a close eye on his place.  They're watching Darwell's tower like hawks, and fighting them will only get you thrown in jail.  If they confiscate the orb after you've taken it, Darwell will have no troubles pulling some strings and using some bribes to get it back.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;We need your help.  Stealth is far from our forte, but with the town guards keeping an eye on the tower, that's what we need.  Can you help?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
