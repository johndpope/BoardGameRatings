			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a tiny, folded science fiction roleplaying game. Valence is a game of starships and space, of rebuilding empires and megacorporations, set against a backdrop millions of years old. It's laser pistols and photon blades, mystical powers and bizarre aliens. It's hope and change, and a whole lot of space opera. We hope you have fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Print it out double-sided. Fold in half, then in half, then in half, keeping the game's title visible after each fold. Heck, you can even make copies and hand them out at your local gaming store! The whole thing is covered by a Creative Commons license, so as long as you don't sell it or remove the author's name, you can do whatever you want with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
