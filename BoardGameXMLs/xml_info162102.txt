			<description>Europe, c. 450 A.D. Barbarians are running amok, raiding villages for women (rapine), weapons (pillage) and gold (plunder). Will your tribe reign supreme in this savage contest for survival?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play alternates between the players. On your turn, you have a choice of three actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Rapine, pillage or plunder (RPP)&lt;br/&gt;    Move&lt;br/&gt;    Discard a card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards serve the three above purposes. Most of the time, players will move to villages and perform RPP. Sometimes, however, when a barbarian tribe gets a little cocky, a battle will occur between the players. These are settled smoothly using the symbols on the cards in hand, and rest assured--tribute will be paid by the loser!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I designed Rapine, Pillage &amp;amp; Plunder because I feel there's a dearth of fun, light, yet not-too-simple two-player games. I believe that this game helps fill that void. (Publishers take note). It's a simple game aimed at casual gamers but has enough in the way of tactics and choices to appeal to more seasoned gamers, as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
