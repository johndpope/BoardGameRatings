			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been over 1,000 years since the free people of Eredane won a battle against the dark lord Izrador. They have been burned, beaten, and starved. Magic, literacy, and weapons are outlawed.&lt;br/&gt;But hope has not died, and the will of the people of Eredane has not been smothered. The hope of steel burns brightly in their warrior hearts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new MIDNIGHT supplement Steel and Shadow includes heroic paths, covenant items, prestige classes, feats, and a wide variety of rules variants, all slanted toward the unique warrior traditions of the cultures of MIDNIGHT. This web supplement, Slivers of Steel, provides some setting information to supplement the new rules presented in Steel and Shadow. Each organization or invidual is related to a prestige class, and GMs and players alike may find them useful when creating characters&lt;br/&gt;or developing campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note: Ties into Steel and Shadow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
