			<description>First Flight - The Wright Experience Flight Simulator provides the enthusiast and gamer with a whole new experience; the first historically and aerodynamically accurate flight simulation offered to the public. Using wind tunnel data taken with detailed full-scale reproductions of the actual aircraft, and complete time integrated six degree of freedom equations of motion, the game uses modeling technology developed for use in current military flight simulators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What this means is that the 1902 Glider exhibits the same sensitive yet forgiving flight behavior that allowed the Wrights to train successfully with over 900 gliding flights; that the 1903 Flyer is marginally powered and quite unstable making it one of the most difficult airplanes to fly; and that by 1911 a more refined Model B is an easier to fly airplane (but keep it coordinated in turns!), allowing some period students to solo after 2 hours of flight instruction. So, try your hand at the same simulations the Wright Experience test pilots use to train for flying the real thing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most historically and aerodynamically accurate simulations ever offered including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The 1902 Glider&lt;br/&gt;     The 1903 Flyer&lt;br/&gt;     The 1911 Model B &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historically detailed flight environments including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Kitty Hawk, North Carolina&lt;br/&gt;     Fort Meyers, Virginia&lt;br/&gt;     College Park, Maryland &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compare flight records with the Wrights&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Examine the history leading to the first flights&lt;br/&gt;     Review the Wright Experience's efforts to duplicate the Wright's work&lt;br/&gt;     Read about how the simulations were made &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the simulations, the Wright Experience simulation also provides a wealth of background historical information on the airplanes themselves, the construction process of the exact airplane replicas built for the Centennial of Flight, the wind tunnel testing and the process of developing the simulations themselves. It all adds up to a truly Wright Experience!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Archived Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
