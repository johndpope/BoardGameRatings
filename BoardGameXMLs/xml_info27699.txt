			<description>The game is comprised of eight, ten or twelve card decks depending on which language is being presented. A deck is made up of 65 to 75 cards, with each card bearing one or more words, semi-sentences, verbs, pronouns, adjectives, etc. The phonetic pronunciation is written in the mother tongue beneath the words or sentences of the foreign language. The center of the card bears the translation of the text in your mother tongue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to form complete sentences having at least a subject, a verb, and an object - and making sense. Points are awarded based on the number of cards used in creation of each phrase or sentence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
