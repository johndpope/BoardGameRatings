							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Championship Pro-Am</name>
									
			<description>An enhanced remake of the classic arcade game Pro-Am, from the NES.  This remake has better graphics and more features to offer the player as they try to beat the other AI opponents to the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compared to the NES version, graphics and music are somewhat improved. The letters that can be collected within a level spell out &amp;quot;CHAMPION&amp;quot;, rather than &amp;quot;NINTENDO&amp;quot;. Spelling out &amp;quot;CHAMPION&amp;quot; a third and fourth time will earn superchargers that increase speed from 104 MPH to 108 MPH and 110 MPH. Players enter their initials at the beginning of the game, not the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five opponents instead of three. Cars under the effect of the roll cage power-up cannot be destroyed by missiles or bombs. Dash Zones earn 100 times the points as the Nintendo versions. There are lap records for each track and beating the record grants 500 points. Extra continues can be won every time five consecutive races are won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
