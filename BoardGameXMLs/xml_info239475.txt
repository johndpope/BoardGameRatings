			<description>Nothing is more fun than living A Season in Springfield, where all people tend to be of a good yellow and have four fingers for each hand and foot! All you have to do is choose an interesting job and decide, time to time, whether to use your time or money to do any kind of action: marrying, having children, adopting a pig, fishing a fish with three eyes, becoming mayor, become a mason, open a left-handed shop, create a new flaming cocktail or join the latest local star movie.&lt;br/&gt;Come on! What are you doing there yet?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game are four types of cards: Job cards, School/Wedding cards, Start Season cards and End Season Cards. First you must draw a Job card. You may also choose to attend school which allows you to pick a higher paying career, but you also lose three turns. Your Job card lists how much time and money you can spend on each turn. On your turn, you may play cards from your hand, but only if you have enough time or money to pay for them.  The cards you play feature life goals that are worth points. When the Early Life cards are used up, play proceeds with the Later Life cards. This deck also has the Letter cards &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; &amp;quot;R&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;T&amp;quot;, and when all four of these cards are drawn the game ends. &lt;br/&gt;The players add up their scores and the one with the highest point total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
