			<description>Based on the short-lived 1975 game show taped on location in Hawaii. The last contestant remaining moved to the Money Volcano. This was a wind tunnel in which the contestant had 15 seconds to grab as many paper slips as possible and place them in a pouch placed around their waist. Paper slips represented prizes, cash or $1 bills. When time expired, the host pulled out up to 10 paper slips from the pouch. There was a significant &amp;quot;push your luck&amp;quot; element as the player could stop at any time, but lost everything if the host drew a $1 bill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in three rounds. The player who wins each round gets the greatest reward and the reward for finishing decreases the further behind a player finishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round one: Players answer multiple choice trivia questions to advance on the gameboard. The person who gives the correct response acts as quizmaster for the following question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round two: After hearing a list of items of a given category, the players must recall item from the list. Players alternate taking turns until one fails to call out a yet unnamed item. The other players advance when one fails to respond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round three: Players get the prize discs earned in the previous rounds. The player who earned the most in cash and prizes is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
