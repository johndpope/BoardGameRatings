							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Icar Equipment Index</name>
									
			<description>Introduction text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Icar has always been replete with technology. The Equipment Index is dedicated to the application of this technology in the form of gadgets, guns and gizmos. All large objects have their own sheet of paper that is folded and given to the player. Clothes, small gadgets and Gaia Entities are written elsewhere, there is a place on the second character sheet, next to the skills to put these.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Starters!&lt;br/&gt;If  you&amp;rsquo;re  new  to  Icar,  then  this  book  can  seem  a bit daunting in the beginning. The scenario you&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded will list what bits of technology will be appropriate, so you need only print out those. It is best to start simple and add new things slowly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
