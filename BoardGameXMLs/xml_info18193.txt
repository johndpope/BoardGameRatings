							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tour de France</name>
									
			<description>The game consist of 5 &amp;quot;rounds&amp;quot; (or rather 5 different stages in the tour): 1 team trial, 1 time trial and 3 regular stages. Each stage, there are points to be won for individual cyclists as well as for the team. The player with the best overall score after 5 stages wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a team of 3 cyclists, which he moves by means of cards (he chooses 1 of 4 available hand cards, and then draws a replacement).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the board, there are spaces where the player has to draw 'risk' cards - these can be beneficial, but also baneful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
