							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Return of the Ripper</name>
									
			<description>From the Chaosium website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An 1890s Scenario for Call of Cthulhu and Cthulhu By Gaslight&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Return of the Ripper'takes place in London, beginning in late summer to early autumn of 1893. It involves a new series of killings perpetrated by Jack the Ripper. The Ripper has returned to London to continue his bloody work after a five-year absence. Working in league with the Ripper are other occult horrors with which investigators must deal. At least one of these is far more formidable &amp;mdash; and deadly &amp;mdash; than the Ripper himself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario presents a series of clues, encounters, and locations that, explored to their fullest, lead Investigators to the identity &amp;mdash; and terrible secrets &amp;mdash; of Jack the Ripper. A number of peripheral dangers are encountered along the way that may either be dealt with during the course of the scenario or, in some cases, sidestepped to be handled at a later time &amp;mdash; provided Investigators retain life and sanity enough to do so. A number of red herrings are also present, designed to mislead and confuse the investigators. Some of these might lead to entire side adventures of their own; others will simply throw investigators momentarily off the track of their quarry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
