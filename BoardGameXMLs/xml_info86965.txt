							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cyndarim</name>
									
			<description>From Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Universally viewed as creatures of exceptional beauty, cyndarims are a striking aquatic race. As with most things of beauty, some feel they must be possessed. Woe to those foolish enough to try.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fragile appearance of cyndarims belies their predatory nature. Few creatures, either below or above the waves, can match their appetites and ruthlessness. Their all-consuming hunger is not limited to the physical, for cyndarims are constantly in search of greater power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unwitting creatures often treat cyndarims as unique curiosities. Those familiar with the race respect and fear their power. Their mercenary skill and arcane might have been found useful by many other races, especially when discretion and amorality are required. However, one must be careful when dealing with cyndarims, for they deem none allies in their quest for power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
