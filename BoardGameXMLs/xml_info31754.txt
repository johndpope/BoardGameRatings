							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Rockets Card Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;From the Makers of UNO!&amp;quot; #-1079 As it so boldly claims on the package, while this was also 'Made in Belgium'! There are 34 cards in denominations from 1 to 10, as well with 2 instructions kinds for the couple of variations with this. One of those is a seemingly &amp;quot;WAR!&amp;quot; sort of game for just 2 players, and the other means would be through a &amp;quot;Rummy&amp;quot; type that allows from 2 to 4 of whom can play, using the same deck. There are some decently rendered 'Spaceships' drawings for EACH of the 10 cards and the entire contents are contained within a DECK &amp;quot;pack&amp;quot; for it all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recommended Ages 4 - 7, while parents may wish to have this in order to teach younger players some of the varying methods that &amp;quot;cards&amp;quot; can be used in playing GAMES with such.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
