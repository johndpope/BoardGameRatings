							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Freebooter: The Pirate LRP System</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I offer this system as one way we could do a Freebooter LRP system, based on the way we generally play so far, but a little more formalized. I am handing out copies to FBA members as I see them, with the intent that anyone with any constructive criticism gets back to me so I can alter the system accordingly. I don't have any particular egotism invested in this document (well, no more than usual anyway) so I'm quite happy to see it changed completely- I just thought it would be good if someone made a start so we can all put our ideas into it. I'd particularly like any suggestions on the firearms stats- anything I didn't know I just made up. Please feel free to copy this and hand it on to other FBA members, or use it to run non-commercial adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I owe a debt of gratitude to all the Crew, who over the years have made us what we are, and without whom the document you hold in your hands would never have existed. Which would probably have been a very good thing. In particular, sources of inspiration for some bits of the rules have come from the Behind the Mask system, the Pressgang system, and Cadfannon`s strange ideas about a tabletop pirate RPG. The opening quote, and any others not attributed otherwise, is from Tim Powers' fine pirate novel On Stranger Tides. Quotes with a little 1 after them are from David Cordingly's Life Among the Pirates, whilst little 2s signify a quote from George MacDonald Fraser's The Pyrates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
