			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, you think you have what it takes to be the top striker in the country?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you can score the goals each season, to get promoted, you could go all the way from Division 3, and lift the Premier Division Trophy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, if only a striker's life were just that simple. You will need the help of scouts, agents, and of course the manager. Money, houses, cars, red and yellow cards, fitness, the press and a little bit of the run of the ball.&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main mechanics of Shoot are quite simple, you roll two dice and move around the board doing what the various spaces on the board tell you to. The objective is to promote enough times to the Premiership and then finish a full season there. First person to do so wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
