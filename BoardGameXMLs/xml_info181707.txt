			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While they are alone, isolated from the rest of the team, each of the Vigilantes is simultaneously targeted by assassins. But, the assassins weren't counting on just how resilient these Vigilantes are. What's more, while the attacks are almost simultaneous, they aren't quite. So each survivor (should there be any), utilizing the latest in communications technology, will be able to assist anyone else whose attack came a few seconds later. Then, once the results of the assassination attempt are concluded, the surviving Vigilantes will be able plan how they are going to hunt down those who dared to try to have them killed off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
