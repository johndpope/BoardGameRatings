			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gobblet has very simple rules to learn.  Each player starts with a set of 12 gobblets and takes turn placing them on the board attempting to get 4 in a row.  The game that emerges requires the forward thinking found in chess and backwards thinking found in memory.  It offers interesting choices as a player must decide if he should block a player from winning by gobbling up a piece or use one of the 3 large gobblets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover the original board game that is as strategic as chess but as easy to learn as tic-tac-toe. With over a million copies in print the official Blue Orange Games&amp;trade; Gobblet is now available for the iPhone and iPad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Learn to play in 60 seconds&lt;br/&gt;     Play online with game center friends&lt;br/&gt;     Play against an Artificial Intelligence bot trained to be hard to beat but not impossible&lt;br/&gt;     Pass-and-Play on a single device&lt;br/&gt;     Everything you expect from an iPhone game - great graphics and great sound &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For ages 7 to 77+. Being the first to get 4 gobblets in a row to win the game will require strategy and memory in this award winning game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
