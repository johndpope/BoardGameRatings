			<description>This game is for 4 players, playing as partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has a value from 1 to 48. The four Aces are excluded from this and are called Muettes (the French word for Mute). Each player can bid which is really a search for a trump sequence. An example of bidding could be 'All the red cards' or '7s to 9s'. The only restriction in the bidding is that a legal bid must be at least 2 cards and no more than 24 cards. Once established, the hand is played. Note that there is no following suit, you can play any card in your hand to a trick and that the partnership, that won the bid, can nominate that each trick will be played High or Low (all tricks will be won by the highest ranked card or that each trick will be won by the lowest ranked card).&lt;br/&gt;I understand that one year after the release of the game, the author published a revised set of rules which customers could collect at their Parisian game's shop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
