							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Genius: The Transgression (Beta)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They all laughed at my theories! They called me mad! But now I'll have my revenge!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If only it were so simple. They laughed because you WERE mad. They laughed because your inventions crumbled when unveiled and your theories turned to gibberish. You wept when you saw your equations riddled with childish errors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you know what you accomplished: you broke gravity's spell; you programmed a computer to dream; you banished death! These weren't delusions or lies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe they were right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or maybe just one more experiment will show you the truth. You can do everything you said. There's a price to pay, but you can do it. And you're not mad. The things you do...maybe they're not right. Maybe your peers would recoil in horror. But you're not mad. And you'll show them all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genius: The Transgression is a fan-made role-playing game for the New World of Darkness. In it, players take on the roles of mad scientists and wonder-workers, driven to the brink of insanity by the secrets they have uncovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
