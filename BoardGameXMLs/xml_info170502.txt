							<name primary="true" sortindex="2">&#039;Roid Miner</name>
									
			<description>Space, 2099.  Interstellar, black market commerce is commonplace. In Sector Beta-3, the search is on for minerals among the asteroids (endearingly called 'roids by you and your fellow miners). Your small mining craft will move swiftly through sixteen sub-sectors and collect six types of minerals, as efficiently as possible. The planets in the sector have different demands for minerals, so you must plan your movements and schedule accordingly. Even in this day and age fuel is an issue, and you'll have to call in a supply ship and pay with one of your completed contracts or convert uranium ore into fuel. Other minerals can be used for other purposes as well, although it's usually better to deliver them for profit&amp;hellip; and don&amp;rsquo;t forget to watch out for the Space Police!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Roid Miner is a light game with minimal rules which can be played seriously or as a beer-and-pretzels game. How is this possible, you ask skeptically? Because the game's design and mechanics lend themselves to &amp;quot;planning/looking-ahead/what-if-he-does-that&amp;quot; play  or &amp;quot;instinctive&amp;quot; play--or anything in-between. In other words, you can play 'Roid Miner in tournament mode or just for fun. Due to the random setup, every game will different. Sometimes you and your opponent will easily spot nice &amp;quot;chains&amp;quot; of pickup and delivery, and your scores will be high. In other games, both of you will struggle to make it into double digits. Sometimes you'll keep to yourselves and sometimes you'll &amp;quot;have at&amp;quot; each other. The best part is that no matter how the game unfolds, 'Roid Miner will always take only about a half-hour to play--and I'm betting you'll set it up for a second game every time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
