			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Hero Battle is a forum-based game of cutthroat strategy for eight or more players. The rules are deceptively simple&amp;mdash;however game play is anything but.&lt;br/&gt;Each player is assigned a Hero for the Battle, and as the game starts, all Heroes have an equal number of hit points (HP). Every turn, each player chooses two Heroes to hit and one Hero to heal. Any Hero reduced to zero is dead, and the last one left alive wins.&lt;br/&gt;To complicate things further, Heroes can gain bonuses when their nemeses are killed or suffer penalties if their secret identity is revealed. Every Battle brings new twists and possibilities, from prison gangs to celebrity plastic surgery. So the players always have to remain on their toes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
