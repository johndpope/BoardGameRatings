			<description>Abstract strategy board game with only one type of piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number of players: usually 2, one controlling the black pawns, the other controlling the white.&lt;br/&gt;(The instruction booklet also contains rules for a 4 player version.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is a grid of 144 squares (12 rows x 12 columns).  Each square is marked at one of the  corners to help identify related squares during a complex move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins in a unique way: &lt;br/&gt;The players agree on how many pawns each side will have.  An empty board is placed between the players and the pawns are placed in front of the players, but not on the board.  Black begins by entering one of his pawns on any square except one of the  &amp;ldquo;border squares&amp;rdquo; (the squares along the edges of the board).  Then White enters a pawn, no more than one square away from Black's, and not on a border square.  The players continue to take turns, either entering a pawn or moving one that is already on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How the pawns move:&lt;br/&gt;An isolated pawn cannot move &amp;ndash; it's frozen (hence the name of the game).  A pawn that is not frozen has the potential to make a jumping or non-jumping move in any direction.  The jump can be over allied as well as opposing pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When an opponent's pawn is jumped over, it's removed from the board.  If the player is not at &amp;ldquo;stage 2,&amp;rdquo; that pawn is returned to the opponent to be reentered.  If the player has reached stage 2, that pawn is permanently captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player able to move wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game set has a high quality vinyl roll-up board,  12 black pawns and 12 natural wood colored pawns (molded from material that is 40% recycled wood), and the instruction booklet which includes an explanation of Freeze notation and 12 short sample games, illustrating the rules and touching on the strategy and tactics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.frezcogames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.frezcogames.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
