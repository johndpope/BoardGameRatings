							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mors lilla Olle: Mitt f√∂rsta spel</name>
									
			<description>The theme for this game is based on a Swedish children&amp;rsquo;s song about the little boy Olle who went to the woods to pick blueberries. He then encounters a bear and feeds him the berries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you move your &amp;ldquo;Olle&amp;rdquo; on the trail while trying to collect blueberries for the bear. Movement is determined by the multi-colored die (blue, green or yellow) that shows you to which areas you can move. You decide if you want to move forward or backward. If the area is marked by a blueberry, you get to pick up a blueberry from the board. If you land on an area marked by a bear, you get to deliver one of the berries you&amp;rsquo;ve already picked up and feed it to the bear. The winner of the game is the first person to feed the bear three berries and then make it home to the cabin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
