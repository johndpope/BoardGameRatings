			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MotoGP is a mobile release for the series of the same name. It features a simplified control scheme similar to that featured in the N-Gage title MotoGP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three game modes that players can compete in: Quick Race, Time Attack, and Grand Prix. Quick Race allows players to face off against four other bikes on a single track. Grand Prix places the player in a three-race track set where they aim to earn the most points by finishing well in each race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The controls are different than the home console titles in the series. Players can accelerate or decelerate by pressing up and down on the touchpad, and steer by pressing the side keys. The motorcycles have automatic shifting only. MotoGP includes three tracks to race on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
