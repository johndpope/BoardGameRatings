			<description>Summary from the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of RAPTURE is to have the most spiritual church with the RAPTURE occurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player, like yourself, represents a church.  Fortunately, as you EVANGELIZE, you church's membership will grow numerically.  But, unfortunately you will soon discover that your church is composed not only of SPIRITUAL and CARNAL members, but also of HYPOCRITES.  On the other hand, your church can grow spiritually as you DISCIPLE these same members from HYPOCRITES to CARNAL and also from CARNAL to SPIRITUAL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the way you will encounter CIRCUMSTANCES which, depending upon the presence or absence of SPIRITUAL GIFTS in your church, will either help or hinder your overall growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But sooner or later on one of the CIRCUMSTANCE cards, the RAPTURE will appear.  (Guaranteed to get a rise out of everybody).  Suddenly the game ends; and the SPIRITUALITY of your church is weighed in the balance (in this game, by a point system.  Will your church be found wanting... more points?)  The church with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Definitions:  Whats the RAPTURE?  Something to get all up in the air about, and the point at which the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whats the Church?  Another good question.  We've been debating it for years.  For our purposes, in RAPTURE there are no buildings -- just people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are SPIRITUAL GIFTS?  A part of this game and the REAL one.  There are over 20 listed in the Bible, we've selected 7 for this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whats the difference between a CARNAL and SPIRITUAL member?  See 1 Corinthians 3:1-3.&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a roll and move type game with different things happening based on the different spaces the player lands on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
