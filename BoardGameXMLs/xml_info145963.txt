			<description>OBJETIVE:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has two cards of the same color, a frog and a fly, and the game&amp;rsquo;s objective is to link your tokens before your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPONENTS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Board tiles (x9)&lt;br/&gt;Frog tokens (x4)&lt;br/&gt;Fly tokens(x4)&lt;br/&gt;Book of Rules (Spanish and English)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME DATA:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a very abstract game, mathematician and visionary. It is a game for all the traditional family and friends, suitable for over eight years, and does not last more than thirty minutes the game being able to play for two to four players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game becomes complicated when you realize that this game does not stop to think for even a second, the game is made up of nine rotating tiles that only rotate in the direction indicated by an arrow in the middle of each tile and not all tiles rotate in the same direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each tile is divided into four waterlilies, color each player, and all the tokens must be always on top of his waterlilies of the same color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn the player always has two movements, and each movement is a move a token or rotate selected tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a tile that tells you how to get extra moves. Getting until four moves in a turn, and this is where the thing becomes complicated and you need to visualize more moves of all your opponents and yours, can use even false movements to play to lapse of concentration of your opponents and try to fool them to they do not find your way to get your tokens together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wetland is definitely the XXI century modern puzzle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wetland is designed for the enjoyment of everyone, friends and family. Play something different and surprise surprising your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regards and hope you like it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
