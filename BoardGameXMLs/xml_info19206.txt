			<description>Draw cards. Act out scenes. Gain points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE GAME IN A NUTSHELL - You choose one of eight categories. Draw a card from one of three levels of difficulty. Act out the scene written on the card, while the others try to guess the scene. Then, take turns playing until you're ready to stop. While all the time you HAVE FUN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:&lt;br/&gt;This is our answer to... well, actually, there's no game quite like it! It couldn't be easier to learn and, with 1,000 scenes, is so much fun we couldn't get our test players to stop playing. PANTOMIME&amp;trade; is contagiously entertaining. It is imaginative and clever - FUN for the whole family, the bigger the better. Wild and crazy, with 8 different categories and 3 different levels of play, it builds personal confidence and increases sensitivity to others. &lt;br/&gt;Just a pile of FUN for everyone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's used in schools, hospitals and anywhere kids and families want to have FUN! The categories include: Science and Nature, Sports, Emotions, Life skills, Professions, Entertainment, Oops and Oh Goody cards. All but the last two have three levels of difficulty and are played by acting them out, without sign language (like Charades) or props, or sound effects. It's pure non-verbal communication from the actor, and nonstop guessing and laughter from the rest of the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
