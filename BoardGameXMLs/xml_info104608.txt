			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jagged Alliance: Back in Action is the official sequel of Jagged Alliance 2 and the first in the series that does not feature turn based combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It will feature the so called &amp;quot;Plan &amp;amp; Go&amp;quot; system in which the game can be paused anytime and a set of complicated orders be given to each soldier. This is supposed to allow for complicated tactics which get executed by each soldier at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new system gets a lot of bad reactions from the solid fan base and the lack of Fog of War is also not well liked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
