							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Play on Words</name>
									
			<description>40 cards, each containing one or two letters, are placed face down in the center of the table in eight stacks (four stacks in top row and four stacks in bottom row). Player ONE begins play by turning over top card of each stack, and from the 8 face up cards makes ONE word of 2-or-more letters and places it in his play area. Words are played fanned together like a Rummy hand to save space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player TWO (and every player thereafter) flips over any face down card atop stacks the prior player used to make their word, thereby replenishing the formation to 8 face up cards. Player TWO likewise makes ONE 2-or-more letter word and places in in his play area. However, in addition, he may steal words from other players' areas by adding one or more of the remaining letters in formation to those words (inserting at any point of word or optionally rearranging the letters in those words). Multiple play-ons are allowed each turn, and players can &amp;quot;play on&amp;quot; their own words also. Play continues with the next player. When any stack is depleted of cards, face up cards from other stacks with multiple cards are slid over to occupy open position and underneath card is flipped over to be face up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the most letters in his play area when all cards in the 8 stack formation are depleted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;80 cards total in deck. Deck is re-shuffled before each game for a fresh set of 40 cards in the formation for each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play best 2-out-of-3 or 3-out-of-5 rounds (as decided by players beforehand) to determine winner of match. Each round takes about 10 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
