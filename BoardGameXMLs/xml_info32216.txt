			<description>Unusual game from the Pepys Card Game Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It consists of 54 playing cards and two key cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 54 cards can be laid out to complete a large puzzle picture containing 9 x 6 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All cards are dealt out, the player with the letter card &amp;quot;F&amp;quot; begins play by laying out this card. Next player in line tries to add a fitting card to it and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner is the player getting rid of all his cards first.&lt;br/&gt;Other players receive penalty points for cards left in their hands.&lt;br/&gt;After reaching a points limit agreed beforehand play ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can see the wartime production by the grey and thick card quality and the not-so-glossy-graphics, but still top !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
