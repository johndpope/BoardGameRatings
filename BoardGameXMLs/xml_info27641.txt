			<description>This boardgame is based on the PC-game Backpacker.&lt;br/&gt;For 2-4 players or you can play in teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are going to visit cities around the world, and they decide how many before the game starts. (for a beginner it's best to start with 3 cities)&lt;br/&gt;Every city has its own board. The players arrive in the city and they try to earn some money by answering questions about different occupations. They also get money if they can answer questions related to the city. These may be about history, politics, geography etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge is money. And the player/team with the most money after a city is finished gets a postcard from that city. The first player/team to get 3 postcards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
