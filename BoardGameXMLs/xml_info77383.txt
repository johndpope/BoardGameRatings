			<description>Condemned: Criminal Origins (known in Asia as Condemned: Psycho Crime and in Australia as simply Condemned) is a psychological survival horror video game with brawler elements. The game was developed by Monolith Productions and published by Sega. It was launched fall 2005 worldwide on the Xbox 360, with a Microsoft Windows version released later in 2006. The Windows version had few changes from the console version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a first person perspective. Condemned: Criminal Origins places an added emphasis on melee combat and puzzle solving, including searching for fingerprints and gathering evidence. It is firmly placed within the horror genre, and more specifically survival horror. The game also implements elements of psychological thriller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon release, Condemned was met with moderate to good reviews by many aggregates and critics. Many reviewers cited poor storyline and progression as the game's biggest fault. As a reprieve, the game's solid controls and fresh approach to the horror genre were praised. This allowed for a sequel, entitled Condemned 2: Bloodshot, which was released on March 11, 2008, for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Other media forms include an internet prequel and a planned film adaptation to expand the Condemned franchise. The developers have cited films such as The Silence of the Lambs and Seven as inspiration for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia,&amp;quot;Condemned: Criminal Origins,&amp;quot;available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
