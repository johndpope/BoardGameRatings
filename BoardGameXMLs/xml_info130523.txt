			<description>Football related card game. The 52 cards are split into two different decks. 25 cards are used to Arrange Matches in part 1 of the game. The other 27 cards are used in part 2, Playing the Arranged Matches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arranging Matches: Each player getrs a hand of cards and a turn consists of laying down a pair of cards from the same division, or drawing a card from the stack. Depending on the number of players, this goes on until all players have arranged the correct number of matches or there are no more cards to draw from the deck. Points are awarded or lost depending on whether you did or did not arrange the correct number of matches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now play shifts to the second deck. All the arranged matches are placed in the middle of the table. These nicely illustrated cards are in four suits, marked A to D. A is trumps. Now you play 6 hands of cards in Whist fashion. Must follow suit, if not can discard or trump. The winner of the most tricks decides the result of any match on the table. He does this by choosing one of three face down cards - Away Win, Home Win, Draw. An Away Win scores him 20 points, a Draw scores him 15 points, a Home Win scores 10 points. Then another hand of cards is played, and the winner chooses a card to be the result of that match, and so on, until all the matches have been played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The points in Part 1 are added to the points in Part 2 and the winner is the one with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
