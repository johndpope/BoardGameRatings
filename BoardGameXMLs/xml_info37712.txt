			<description>Parental Advisory: This game has has a maturity rating equivalent to the ESRB video game rating of MATURE due to content of warfare and technology that may be considered too explicit for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blak Dragon: A Game of Space Warfare&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blak Dragon brings players to the war for Sol system. Fight strategically and tactically in the orbital cities, asteroid bases, Martian jungles and all the icy vacuum in-between. This game is set in the time after the Earth's cities were destroyed by the evil Warpigs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can control cities and capital ships that are deployed on a simple 3 dimensional hex-board. As well these larger areas have their own tactical maps for simulation of boarding party battles, weapon strikes and tactical deployment information like command center locations, hangar decks, and storage areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vessel commands are issued with Command cards that have to be played in a cunning manner as there are a limited number of these powerful abilities like Network Commands, Ship Movement, Beam Fire, Rally Troops and even Self Destruct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat and skill use are decided by a simple combination of ability stats and some random dice elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blak Dragon also has a robust technological strategic computer system that portrays use of network and hive mind drone systems that can be co-opted through computer hacking by a vessel or a boarding party. There is also a system of hidden movement for cloaked units. In Blak Dragon players can field units with genetically engineered or cybernetically implanted abilities like finger claws and night-vision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Factions of Sol:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Blak Dragon players choose and tailor a Faction set. The two Factions of Blak Dragon included in the first rule-book and components set are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rogue Army: Former NATO operatives that now exist as the DDF, sworn enemy of the Warpigs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the basic set the Rogue Army is positioned on an asteroid base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Warpigs: Techno-communist fascists that live to consume and destroy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the basic set the Warpigs field a destructive Gravitation Killer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other Factions: For future development we are working on other Factions for players to command as their own...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Corporates: Efficient yet callous builders of the Sol System infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Settlers: The builders and energy farmers of orbital space. Also Martian colonists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Zero-G Mafia: A cartel of future criminals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cover illustration by Bradley Bleeker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Blak Universe product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game in development.
