			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CATCHA SNATCHA brings to your TV screen the mad, mad world of the store detective in what has to be the most chaotic super-store every [sic] built with hordes of harassed housewives doing their weekly shopping.&lt;br/&gt;Collecting lost property, lost children and evacuating the building when planted bombs are found can only add to the fun as you battle to keep the shop clear of shoplifters...and just wait till the late-night shopping starts!&lt;br/&gt;Barney Bootlace had never had it so bad, demoted from ace detective of the aristocracy to the level of a mere store detective at one of the craziest run down stores in town. He wanders his now well-worn beat around the jewellery and watch counters considering his predicament. It's a hectic life for the hardened crime fighter when he has to look after lost children taking them to the lost children office in the top left hand corner of the shop. Rushing lost umbrellas and bags to the lost property office ready for their careless owners to fetch, the lost property office is in the top right hand corner of the shop.&lt;br/&gt;At least some variety enters the action when the occasional bungling shop lifter attempts to remove a box off the counter and get away with it. Barney only has to grab the box and return it to the manger's office to prove he was shoplifting, but watch those shoplifters run as you try to grab that box, they hide the box under their coats and you have to keep your eye on him in case he gets mixed up with the other shoppers. The manager resides opposite the main exit in the lower left hand corner of the shop.&lt;br/&gt;There is one time our hero has reason to panic - when the occasional customer drops a parcel bomb in the rows between the counters. The only option left open to him is to grab the bomb and make a run for the double doors at the exit. Of course do something like that and you're well on your way to instant promotion to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;Barney's only aim in life is to be promoted to the next level of play by earning the respect of this manager, of course if that opinion drops below 0% then he will be given a written warning and taken down a level. Three written warnings and you're fired, you can always increase your chances by moving up two levels, the manager will be so pleased he will remove one written warning.&lt;br/&gt;Always keep an eye on the time because at 6 o'clock in the evening it is late night shopping and more customers will appear. You will look forward to 8 o'clock and closing time more than ever but be prepared for the following day and yet more hordes of harrassed housewives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Eugene Evans&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
