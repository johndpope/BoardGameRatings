							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monopoly Junior: Bakugan Battle Brawlers</name>
									
			<description>This appears to be one of several unlicensed themed versions of Monopoly Junior originating in China. Although Uncle Pennybags appears on the Monopoly Junior logo and (incongruously) on some game spaces and cards, there are no publisher logos or other crediting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems there exist at least five cover variations: two with the Bakugan logo under the Monopoly logo ringed by characters, one of them with a flat Monopoly logo and one with a more elaborate fake-3D one; one with the Bakugan logo in the bottom left and three foreground characters; and two with the Bakugan logo at the bottom flanked by two foreground characters, one with English text and one with a Romanian flag and text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is identical to regular Monopoly Junior, with a nearly complete lack of player decisions. Players roll and move along the board, automatically purchasing visited properties, drawing chance cards, and performing monetary transactions until someone runs out of money. Properties are a selection of characters and other features from the Bakugan franchise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
