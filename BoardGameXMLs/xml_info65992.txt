			<description>From the adventure's introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mother's Milk is an adventure for 2-4 characters of power level 2. It can be adjusted for higher power levels by increasing the number of enemy NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the sleepy Midwestern town of Pleasantville, the annual cheese festival is the absolute highlight of the year. This week-long event is the most exciting thing that ever happens around these parts, the backwater equivalent of Mardi Gras, and this year anybody who is anybody will be there. The festival even attracts revelers from the neighboring towns of Ten Commandments, Yellow Banks, and Small. To the folks of Pleasantville this makes it practically an international summit. The Mayor has hired a bouncy castle and some clowns, and Sheriff Byrne has even put together a band - the Boys in Bluegrass - to welcome the out-of-towners. This year's festival looks set to be the best ever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately for the unsuspecting cheese-fanciers, a monstrous threat lurks behind the innocent fa&amp;ccedil;ade of Pleasantville...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
