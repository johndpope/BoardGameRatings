			<description>A Hideous Plot in Which Murder is Just the Start&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is suitable for inexperienced or beginning player characters. It is set in Delberz, but could be used in any urban setting. It pits the PCs against Skaven and their human allies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this adventure, the PCs witness a cultist, Peter Tavelli, chasing and seemingly trying to kill a young man, who begs for their help. Pursuing Tavelli leads the PCs to a dangerous underground complex where a band of Skaven, led by Skretth &amp;ndash; an unusually dangerous specimen &amp;ndash; have joined forces with a group of human cultists. Can the PCs prevent the terrible ritual these groups are planning, and save themselves into the bargain?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note the PDF is formatted &amp;quot;two-up&amp;quot; for booklet printing.  The PDF has 14 pages; a printed and folded booklet would have 28 pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
