							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rugrats: Turn the House Upside Down</name>
									
			<description>The object of the game is to be the first player to explore and mess up the objects given to you at the beginning of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a two player game, each character must mess up 6 objects to win. In a three player game, 4 objects; and in a four player game, 3 objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start, put together the 3D game board, put the neat sides of all the items into their respective slots on the game board. Put the Mom and Dad marker on the spot on the game board with the star. Select a Rugrat and place it in the playpen, then deal two cards to each player. The remaining cards form the draw deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you roll the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you roll a number:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Move your Rugrat up to that number of spaces on the game board&lt;br/&gt;- If you reach an object you have a card for place the card face up in front of you and flip the object to the messy side&lt;br/&gt;- You do not have to land on the object by exact count&lt;br/&gt;- If there's another Rugrat or Mom and Dad in your way, jump over that space (don't count it)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you roll 'Draw':&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add a card from the draw pile to your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you roll 'Mom and Dad':&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Move Mom and Dad up to 6 spaces on the game board&lt;br/&gt;- If Mom and Dad land on any Rugrat, send that Rugrat back to the playpen&lt;br/&gt;- Mom and Dad can, like a Rugrat, ignore a Rugrat and not count a spot to travel farther on the board&lt;br/&gt;- If Mom and Dad move onto a red dot space in front of one of the house items, they block any of the Rugrats from making a mess of that item until they are moved&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All right, all you Rugrats, break out of the playpen. It&amp;rsquo;s time to turn the Pickles house upside down!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Race through the family&amp;rsquo;s kitchen, bathroom, living room&amp;hellip; upstairs and downstairs on the 3-dimensional game board. And what do you do when you reach one of your objects? You turn it upside down!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mom and Dad try to prevent the mess&amp;mdash;but they can&amp;rsquo;t be everywhere at once. Sooner or later, you and the Rugrats turn the whole house upside down. What a mess you&amp;rsquo;ve made!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
