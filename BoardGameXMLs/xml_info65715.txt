							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Illusionist</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The Illusionist is a card game for 2&amp;ndash;4 players who play rival Victorian-era magicians/illusionists. The goal of the game is to become the City's most prominent performer by having the highest number of Prestige Points at the end of the game. Prestige Points are earned by creating/assembling astounding illusions and &amp;ldquo;performing&amp;rdquo; them at various types of theatres in the city. Strategy, timing and elements of luck all play a role in your rise to prominence, as do the political machinations and jealousy of your peers.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's basically a set-collection card game that plays in 30-45 minutes. The suits are four different types of illusions commonly performed by late-Victorian era stage magicians and you'll need an &amp;quot;aha!&amp;quot; idea card of a suit and a card of values 1,2 and 3 of the same suit to perform (put into play) an illusion to earn Prestige Points points. There are 16 different magicians to play, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, optional trait cards, and the all important Events (fate) deck that you both need and dread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
