			<description>This is a 1930s game of aerial maneuver that pits five fighters against a single bomber. The board has a factory at the center (the target for the bomber), two fighter bases on the upper and lower left, and a bomber base at the lower right. The rest of the board is filled with images of colored airplanes connected to between 2 and 7 other locations (bases, factory and other plane images) by white two-way arrows. The bomber is silver; the smaller fighter figures have colored wings: red, yellow, brown, blue and green.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bomber moves first, along any arrow to an open adjacent space. The five fighters then move in turn, and the order must be kept the same from turn to turn. Planes must move if possible, but cannot move to a space already occupied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bomber must reach the factory to drop its bombs and then return to base. It may bomb, move off the factory and return to bomb again without returning to base. If it bombs once or twice, it must return to its own base. If it succeeds in bombing three times, it may return to any of the three bases. If the bomber gets back to base, the bombing player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the fighters is to surround the bomber, occupying all of its adjacent spaces so that it is unable to move. The fighter player who makes the final decisive move to surround the bomber is considered the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
