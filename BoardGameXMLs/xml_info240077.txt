							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hero: Prepare Your Champion</name>
									
			<description>A dragon has invaded your kingdom with a promise for disaster. The common people crave for a mighty, brave and legendary hero in this time of need. And you... are part of the common people. So, you should go find some true heroes and prepare them for battle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hero is a cooperative and semi-cooperative game where players take the roles of common people with different trades who must prepare a hero. By using transparent cards, players can actually see how their hero looks like and how their stats change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a fierce minotaur paladin with golden bracers armed with a flaming great-axe and mounted in a t-rex with a scorpion tail, to a circus goblin with a bionic arm, equipped with a butter knife and a mop, leading a pink chicken army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will take actions and manage resources to recruit and provide supplies to the greatest heroes while the dragon destroys their kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there are no cards left in the kingdom deck, the players lose. If the dragon is killed, the players win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
