							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anima Tactics: Hiro</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hiro was a slight boy who always dreamed of becoming a &amp;quot;Hero of Justice&amp;quot; whose wish has amazingly become a reality. After suffering a crippling and horrific accident, Wissenschaft researchers subjected Hiro&amp;rsquo;s body to a ridiculously large dose of Process. Hiro was reborn with abilities to match his wildest dreams. Now, convinced that he is part of a secret society that seeks to protect the world while operating from the shadows, he has no qualms about using his superhuman prowess to further the aims of Wissenschaft. Along with the other crows, the &amp;quot;Ranger Avengers&amp;quot; as he calls them, Hiro stands ready to safeguard Gaia, at least in his own mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warrior - Light Wissenschaft - Level 50&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pewter figure is unpainted and unassembled. Requires additional Anima Tactics figures to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
