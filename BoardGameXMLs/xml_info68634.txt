			<description>Flip your hoops onto dolphins to win! Be the first player to score 50 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An electronic base unit containing 4 colored dolphin heads is turned on and rotates around while dolphin heads bob up and down.  Each player places one of his 10 rings on his seal's tail and flips the tailback to release the ring.  Players keep flipping rings until all 10 have been used.  This constitutes a round. AT the end of a round scores are tallied : &lt;br/&gt;A ring around a large spinning dolphin of your color: 5 points&lt;br/&gt;A ring around and large color spinning dolphin: 3 points&lt;br/&gt;A ring around any stationary gray dolphin: 1 point&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players keep playing round until a someone reaches a total score of 50 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
