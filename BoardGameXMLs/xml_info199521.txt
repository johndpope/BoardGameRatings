			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game does not use a game master but does require one person to perform some setup and introductory actions.  Additionally, one player becomes the primary focus of the narrative and the remaining players act as a group.  The game uses custom cards that are provided as print-and-play components in the document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are asked a series of questions based on rational or irrational philosophical fallacies.  Familiarity with philosophical logic is presupposed by the game (this may be a barrier to entry for some).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
