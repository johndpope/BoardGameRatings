			<description>This game is based on the film &amp;quot;Gintama Red Cherry Blossom.&amp;quot; In this game, characters fight for their government or for their beliefs using weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a print and play game. The pdf includes the following components:&lt;br/&gt;- weapon cards&lt;br/&gt;- player tokens&lt;br/&gt;- life points&lt;br/&gt;- surprise cards&lt;br/&gt;- game board with track and card space&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round, the active player flips a coin and moves his character according to the number.
