			<description>&amp;quot;Super Soccer (Super Formation Soccer in Japan) is a soccer video game developed by Human Entertainment for the Super NES. Human published the game by themselves in Japan whereas Nintendo did it overseas. It was released in Japan in 1991 and in the United States on May 1992. The game consists of exhibition games and tournament games. In exhibition, one can choose to play either a game or a shootout. In tournament mode, one plays until one beats all other teams. At the end of the tournament, the player must play one final team, Nintendo. When the tournament has been won, the player receives a code to play the game in a more advanced mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally, Formation Soccer was a PC Engine native game that was released around the time of the 1990 FIFA World Cup. The series was then carried over to Super Nintendo and, ultimately, to Nintendo 64.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is innovative because of its viewing perspective, to this day unique in soccer video games: the field is shown plainly on a vertical view, and the opposite goal can be seen from anywhere in the field, making use of the Mode 7 chip. This feature, however, is exclusive of the Super Nintendo games in the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the opening screen, players can choose to compete in penalty kicks without playing an actual game. Extremely responsive controls for both the goal-keeper and the kicker produced a penalty simulation which some argue is still the best version available on any game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game spawned a series of four sequels, all of them developed and published by Human in Japan only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teams&lt;br/&gt;The Rankings for Teams:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Germany &lt;br/&gt;Argentina &lt;br/&gt;Italy &lt;br/&gt;Brazil &lt;br/&gt;Holland &lt;br/&gt;England &lt;br/&gt;Cameroon &lt;br/&gt;Romania &lt;br/&gt;Ireland &lt;br/&gt;France &lt;br/&gt;USA &lt;br/&gt;Japan &lt;br/&gt;Colombia &lt;br/&gt;Yugoslavia &lt;br/&gt;Uruguay &lt;br/&gt;Belgium &lt;br/&gt;Also, beating the game on the hardest difficult setting unlocks the Nintendo team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sequels to the game&lt;br/&gt;Super Formation Soccer 2 (1993) &lt;br/&gt;Kept largely the same structure of the original game, only with some teams changed. &lt;br/&gt;Super Formation Soccer '94 (1994) &lt;br/&gt;Was made specially for the then-upcoming 1994 FIFA World Cup, including the 24 teams that partook it, plus Japan. &lt;br/&gt;Super Formation Soccer '96: World Club Edition (1995) &lt;br/&gt;Instead of national teams, this game featured 18 club teams (13 European, 4 Latin American and one Japanese) from around the world, based on well-known teams by the time. &lt;br/&gt;J-League Dynamite Soccer 64 (1997) &lt;br/&gt;Released for Nintendo 64, it was the last game to date in the series. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super_Soccer,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
