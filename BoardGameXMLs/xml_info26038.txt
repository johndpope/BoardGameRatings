							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tri-Memo: The Lord of the Rings â€“ The Two Towers</name>
									
			<description>This game is an average run of the mill memory game with a twist.  In the game you are trying to match characters from the Lord of the Rings Two Towers movie. Instead of finding a matched pair on your turn you must find a matched trio of pictures.  This makes the game somewhat more difficult than the traditional matched pair style of gameplay.  Don't fret though, rules are included to play the routine memory style game of matching pairs.  The game was published by BETEXA which is in the Czech Republic.  FEVA, located in the United Kingdom, was the distributor.  This game is hard to find and most likely would appeal to collectors of Lord of the Rings themed games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
