			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volcano God is a story roleplaying game about the final days of a forgotten tribe. Unaware of their impending doom, the tribe continues to sacrifice its people to the Volcano God in an attempt to appease the unquiet spirit within&amp;hellip; until the tribe is no more. Characters are important members of the tribe living under the shadow of the Volcano God, doing everything they can to abate the inevitable end rushing toward them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
