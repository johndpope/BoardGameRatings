			<description>USER SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Castle of the Winds was a Roguelike dungeon crawl released as shareware for Windows 3.1. Norse mythology provided the thematic backdrop for the game, where your farm has been burned and your family killed. The relatively thin plot leads you forth to set out into a cave and eventually a larger dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graphics are more advanced than the traditional ASCII roguelikes, making use of full color icons for both items and enemies. Snakes look like snakes, ogres look like ogres, and chainmail looks like chainmail. The gameplay is still fairly straightforward; you navigate dungeon floors with your keypad, press towards adjacent enemies to attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accumulation of experience, spells, and various randomly enchanted loot, provide the impetus for continued exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
