			<description>You are investigating alien ruins on Mars. Just as you are getting ready to take all the artifacts back to your ship, disaster strikes! A meteor storm sweeps across the planet! Your equipment is damaged! Your oxygen is running low! And to top it off the dust kicked up by the meteors has obscured the location of your ship!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What had been days worth of air is now only a few scant hours. You have to make it back to your spaceship - but what about all the artifacts you have already found? Decide what to take and what to leave, but remember, if you take too much, you run out of oxygen faster!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by moving your character across the barren Martian landscape, exploring tiles, attempting to find any Martian artifacts, more air, and most importantly, your ship.  Your spacesuit has three randomly selected abilities that can help your character navigate the hostile terrain.  Abilities which come into play when Event cards are drawn after moving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player only wins when:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The player does not run out of air.&lt;br/&gt;     The player finds the spaceship.&lt;br/&gt;     The player has at least one alien artifact upon reaching the spaceship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mars Exploration mission fails if no items from the Martian Ruins make it back to Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was an entry in the 2014 Solitaire Print and Play Contest.  It won first place for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Best Large Game&lt;br/&gt;     Best Thematic Game&lt;br/&gt;     Best Greyscale Printed Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
