			<description>You start out the game as a visitor to our fair community.  By acquiring various properties such as local hotels, restaurants, retail stores, radio stations, TV stations and other well-known businesses in the areas- and developing them into skyscrapers- you become a resident entrepreneur. The last entrepreneur to avoid bankruptcy, or the one with the most property, wins! It's just a different version of monopoly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
