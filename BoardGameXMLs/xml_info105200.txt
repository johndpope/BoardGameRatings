							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kith&#039;takharos Simple Scenario Bundle (OGL 3.5)</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple Scenarios are set piece encounters or very short adventures the Gamemaster can insert when needed to fill a gap or spice up an ongoing adventure. All three Simple Scenarios for the Kith&amp;rsquo;takharos setting &amp;mdash;KS10, KS11, and KS12&amp;mdash; have been gathered into one bundle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents (from the publisher):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KS10: Spider Hunt!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A foraging party stumbles onto a new species of spider and ignites a hunt for the creature&amp;rsquo;s fiery web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two Order of the Jade Leaf scouts retreat from newly discovered Harlass Orn ruins when confronted by large red spiders. One of the scouts strikes a spark when his sword scrapes a wall, which ignites a portion of the spider webs in a large fireball. The characters are sent by the Order of the Jade Leaf to retrieve samples of flammable spider web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KS11: The Repository&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mysterious cavern holds constructs inert since the end of an ancient war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A thousand years ago, the Harlass Orn thrived in the swamps surrounding Kith&amp;rsquo;takharos. At the height of their achievements, the Harlass Orn fought a desperate war against extra-dimensional creatures called Veilwalkers. The Veilwalkers created numerous battle constructs and placed them in storage facilities called repositories. The characters encounter a Veilwalker repository that houses a cache of deactivated constructs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KS12: The Hideout&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fragment of an ancient bridge offers a commanding view of the surrounding swamp&amp;mdash;and a defensible refuge for poachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outlaws called poachers roam the swamps and nearby river lands. Poachers continuously spar with the Order of the Jade Leaf, waylaying shipments of swamp plant products, dodging and fleeing patrols. They turn remote islands or forgotten ruins into bases. The characters stumble upon a poacher hideout at the ruins of a Harlass Orn bridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
