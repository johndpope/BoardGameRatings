			<description>Cribbage played upon one track with a figure 8 design.  All players start in the &amp;quot;start&amp;quot; holes and choose the direction they wish to peg.  You may end up pegging the same direction or in the opposite direction of the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The real excitement starts when you finish your pegging on another player's peg (AKA &amp;quot;crash&amp;quot; another player's peg).  If you hit your opponent's tail peg you will send it forward one past the the same color lead peg, if you hit your opponent's head peg you will send it backward one past the rear peg. And if that displaced peg happens to end up in another peg's hole, another &amp;quot;crash&amp;quot; occurs... This greatly enhances the strategy involved in the pegging phase of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card play is exactly the same as traditional cribbage and the track is exactly 121 holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the back of the Crash Cribbage board, a regular cribbage board is found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
