			<description>DGList comment:&lt;br/&gt;A permanently shelved monograph for BRP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;subtitle:&lt;br/&gt;Role Playing U.S. Special Operations Military Soldiers in the modern era&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the Special Operations Manual for Chaosium&amp;rsquo;s Basic Role Playing system is to provide keepers and players the opportunity to utilize these extreme soldiers in any situation they can imagine. This manual will provide all of the details and information needed to include Operators in the most realistic way possible within the confines of the BRP system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is intended for an action oriented campaign where the extra weapons and combat skills will be not only desirable but essential. The characters outlined here should be far above normal human characters in almost every aspect, combining the physical prowess of Olympic level athletes and the problem solving and critical thinking skills of a private investigator or a competitive chess player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this manual is set in the modern era, real world setting. However, it is perfectly suitable to apply these characters to a horror, sci-fi, or super hero or any other campaign from the Viet Nam war to a near future or alternate reality setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
