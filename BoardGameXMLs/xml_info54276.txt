ADVANCED DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS NON-PLAYER CHARACTER RECORDS are especially designed for ADVANCED DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS.  No longer will the DM need to worry about lack of continuity or lost records on non-player characters, for these sheets provide the DM with easy-to-store records of the many non-player personalities which populate his or her campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These convenient referee aids contain all information needed to run each non-player character and his, her or its personal background.  The sheets have been organized under specific headings and important, oft-consulted information is boxed in eye-catching, easy-to-find displays.

Compact, but complete, their small size provides easy handling and more sheets.
