			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Futuristic Cycle Racing and Drama!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gelly Rain: The Kid's Parent was a famed Cyclon racer, but died on the track in a ball of flames. Instead of selling the racing seat back to the sponsor company, though, the family held the seat open for the day when the Kid would come of age and could race the seat in the Parent's place. It has meant facing the anger of the sponsors, who don't like leaving a racing seat open for so long &amp;ndash; a seat that they're paying good money to sponsor. And it has meant years of grinding poverty while the family suffered under seat rental fees and the dead Parent's racing debts. Yet, they somehow managed. ...And now, the Kid has come of age and has taken up the Parent's old seat. This is the Kid's first race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
