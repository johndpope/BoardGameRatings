			<description>&amp;quot;CivCity: Rome is a city building strategy game by Firefly Studios and Firaxis. In terms of game logic, it includes elements from two well-known game series, i.e., Caesar (primarily) and Civilization, giving players the opportunity to build, run and maintain various cities of the Roman Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game offers two types of missions: stand alone missions to include freeplay (or &amp;quot;sandbox&amp;quot;) and a campaign based mission. The campaign based mission begins when the player, an engineer, is hired by a local stone works overseer to construct a stone mine colony. The player then gets further opportunities to prove himself, meeting such historic characters as Crassus and Julius Caesar. The player is offered various ranks, progressing through such titles as: Quaestor, Aedile, Censor, Praetor  and Consul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each campaign mission begins with a patriarch to the player offering the greeting of &amp;quot;Hail!&amp;quot; and then stating the character's title. Midway through the game, the player can choose to embark on military campaigns which involve combat or continue to play peaceful missions which have harder goals but no risk of invasion.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Civcity,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
