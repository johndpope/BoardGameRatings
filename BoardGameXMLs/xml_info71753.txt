			<description>It&amp;acute;s 1910 and revolution is about to start in Mexico because the welfare of the few is based on the oppression of the majority. Several chieftains are fighting to impose their ideals. You&amp;acute;ll have to control them and take advantage of the historical events to win the race of power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two types of cards: chieftains and event cards. &lt;br/&gt;Players choose a pawn that will move spaces in the board depending on the event cards. At the beginning of each turn a player draws 5 cards and can play 3 cards, chieftains and/or events. The events affect the players controlling the chieftains involved in the historical event and the pawns of these players move forward/backward. The game ends when a player is in the &amp;quot;Power&amp;quot; space at the beginning of his/her turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
