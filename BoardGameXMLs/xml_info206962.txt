			<description>User Input Required is a card game that can be played three different ways. But, before you play the game, the players themselves help craft the cards that will be used during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played as either A) a drafting game, or B) a push-your-luck game, or C) a take that game. Before the game starts, players will fill in the cards that will be used during the game. Also, before the game starts, the players will also decide on the rules of engagement and how scoring will work. The limits of the game are only limited by the imagination of the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All 116 cards in User Input Required are dry erase and come sleeved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
