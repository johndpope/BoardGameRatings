			<description>Now there's an easy way for all the family to speak Spanish while having fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Going to Spain? Play Comprendo!&amp;reg; the board game, and you'll soon be getting by effortlessly in the language!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fast and fun family game simulates a holiday in Spain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't need to know any Spanish beforehand &amp;ndash; but you do need your wits about you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By speaking Spanish words and phrases you collect day trips. The first person to match these day trips to their original 'wish list' wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't need any Spanish to play. The questions in Comprendo!&amp;reg; are specially constructed with clues so that even complete beginners can answer them. All the Spanish has an intuitive pronunciation guide. Playing Comprendo!&amp;reg; is not like being in a classroom. There's no grammar or exercises. You pick the language up unconsciously, by hearing and speaking. It's a friendly, fast-moving family game, and making the odd mistake is all part of the fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.comprendogame.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.comprendogame.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
