							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BASH! Fantasy: Codex of Fantasy Folk</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BASH! Fantasy: Codex of Fantasy Folk is designed to allow you to do two things. First, we have provided dozens of examples of fantasy species that can inhabit your fantasy worlds using BASH! Fantasy, either as playable Heroes or for the Narrator to use for NPCs and Villains. These fantasy folk range from the stock elves and dwarves common to western fantasy fiction, to more modern and rare tropes of the genre, such as the dragonkin or cathulian. Some of these species may even be more traditionally associated with being antagonists to heroes (such as orcs, goblins, snakemen, or kobolds) but here we present the various species as not being inherently good nor evil, but perhaps motivated by conflicting goals. You can take or leave this backstory text as you see fit, of course, and just use the mechanical content if you like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our second task was to give you the tools and inspiration to create new species of your own. If you don&amp;rsquo;t see the species you want for your game in these pages, you can create new ones of your own. Here you will find some information on species specific Weaknesses, Advantages, Disadvantages, and a few new powers as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy Folk featured in this Codex include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Human - The standard by which all others are compared.&lt;br/&gt;Hybrid - You can make half one species and half another&lt;br/&gt;Angelkin - Descended from the divine&lt;br/&gt;Birdkin - Fine feathered folk&lt;br/&gt;Bouda - Hyena folk&lt;br/&gt;Catfolk - Humanoid felines&lt;br/&gt;Cathulian &amp;ndash; Squid-like humanoids from the subterranean deep&lt;br/&gt;Centaur - Humanoids with the lower body of a horse&lt;br/&gt;Demonkin - People with infernal ancestry&lt;br/&gt;Dhampir - People with a vampire parent&lt;br/&gt;Dragonkin - Descended from dragons&lt;br/&gt;Dwarf - Stout and dependable folk from beneath the mountains&lt;br/&gt;Elf - Woodland descendants of the fey&lt;br/&gt;Flamekin - Humanoids with elemental flame in their veins&lt;br/&gt;The Forged - Magical machine-men manufactured by cathulians&lt;br/&gt;Frogkin - Hopping good swimmers and jumpers&lt;br/&gt;Gargoyle - Flesh and blood creatures with ties to the earth&lt;br/&gt;Giantkin - Descended from giants&lt;br/&gt;Goblin - Little green folk with a gift for gab&lt;br/&gt;Gnome - Tiny fey with a knack for invention&lt;br/&gt;Halfling - Small folk who try not to be late for dinner&lt;br/&gt;Kobold - Small miners with strong ties to earth&lt;br/&gt;Lizardkin - Reptilian humanoids of the swamps&lt;br/&gt;Minotaur - Legendary humanoid bovines&lt;br/&gt;Naga - Charming and magical snake folk&lt;br/&gt;Orc - A proud and strong warrior people from underground&lt;br/&gt;Pixie - Tiny flying fey most at home in the woods&lt;br/&gt;Packfolk - Humanoid wolves, coyotes, and jackals&lt;br/&gt;Ratkin - Humanoid rats with a predilection to purloin&lt;br/&gt;Skykin - Humanoids with infused with elemental air&lt;br/&gt;Snakemen - An ancient species that once ruled the world&lt;br/&gt;Stonekin - Humanoids of elemental earth&lt;br/&gt;Troll - The more sophisticated cousins of the &amp;quot;Cave Troll&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Ursine - Bear folk with a love for battle... and honey&lt;br/&gt;Wavekin- Humanoids with watery elemental origins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
