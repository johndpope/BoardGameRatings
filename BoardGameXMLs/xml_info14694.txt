			<description>The aim of FARMING is that each farmer should finish the farming season with as large a profit as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The farmer with the largest profit at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Farming also gives the players a realistic insight into the activities that occur on a farm during the course of the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
