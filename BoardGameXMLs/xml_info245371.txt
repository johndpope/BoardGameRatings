			<description>In Haervejen, players slip into the role of traders in the late Middle Ages. On the H&amp;aelig;rvejen (German: Ochsenweg) which connects Denmark and Germany, the players buy goods and sell them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game there is a Danish and a German currency, which can change at any time. Players must set up trading houses, upgrade their ox cart, buy goods, travel long distances, and resell goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who has managed by strategic actions to win the most money, win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME PLAY&lt;br/&gt;A Game is played in 12 rounds. Every round is divided into 4 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Event phase&lt;br/&gt;2. Income phase&lt;br/&gt;3. Action phase&lt;br/&gt;4. Round-end phase&lt;br/&gt;5. Evaluation phase (only after round 12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of an event phase, an new event tile is revealed.&lt;br/&gt;An event consists of 2 parts, one part changes the bid price each time and the other includes events that change the interaction between the players, restrict movement on the game board or similar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Income phase, get every player resources from his built trading houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main phase is the Action phase. During the Action phase, players can buy resources, build buildings, travel over the Haerveje and sell the resources in other places.&lt;br/&gt;You always have to keep an eye on the price in order to sell as profitably as possible. They can accept assignments to get more profit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only those who expand their trading network and develop their oxcart will be able to win in the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
