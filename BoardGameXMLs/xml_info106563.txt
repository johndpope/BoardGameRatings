							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">10 Region Maps</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Party wandered off the edge of the map? Need a setting for a quick one-shot? Looking for campaign inspiration? There's a lot of solutions for those problems, but here's one they all have in common: a good map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10 Region Maps presents a Player Version and a DM Version map for each of five regions - ten maps total. Player maps label the geographic features, most of the cities, a few of the danger areas, and maybe a point of interest or two. There's about a half page of description accompanying each Player Map with the most widely-known information about the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DM maps have a little something extra. A smaller map with more details added, plus nearly a full page of info and plot hooks for the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go dungeon-crawling in the Adventure region, solve the political problems of the Kel region, fight monsters in the Zarek Forest, delve into the violent past of Exile, or go pirate hunting along the Grey Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Want more great maps? All the maps in this book were randomly generated with the Kingdom Builder Generator Pack - the only change made was the addition of text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
