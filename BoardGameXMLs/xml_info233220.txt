			<description>Gallia Cisalpina, a tactics game for 2 players from 10 years, is game No. 8 of the series &amp;ldquo;Die Kleinen Feinen&amp;rdquo;. &lt;br/&gt;In 396 BC, the Celts set out to conquer the lands south of the Alps, but the Romans are also fighting for supremacy. Defences are set up in a hurry to protect agriculture and ensure the supply of the warriors. But the enemy is also armed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only 12 cards form the landscape, on which the enemy troops stand in the form of dice. &lt;br/&gt;In his turn, each player has three opportunities. He is allowed to recruit up to 3 new warriors in his own capital, he can build (or destroy) defences in occupied areas - for this, the corresponding card is reversed and 2 warriors are reduced to pawns &amp;ndash; and, of course, he can move the troops and attack the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game principle is straightforward and intuitive and also suitable for casual players as an entry-level tactics game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
