			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this official supplement to the BareBones Fantasy role-playing game, you'll find 20 playable character races fully defined.  Beautifully illustrated and ready to drop into an existing campaign setting.  If you're playing in the Keranak Kingdoms you're in luck; each race is given cultural information on how and where it fits into the kingdoms.  If you're a GM running kingdoms of your own, you'll still find this a useful supplement full of ideas.  From the dragon-kin of Caer Urdak to the enigmatic tigerfolk of Ravenreach, you're sure to find a place for all you find within these pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included for the sake of completeness, the four core races of the BareBones Fantasy role-playing game are also repeated here, with expanded information from the Keranak Kingdoms setting book.  This truly becomes a one-stop-shopping place for players to choose character's races while making their heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've played with the bare bones... now add some flesh &amp;amp; blood to the mix!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Bugbear&lt;br/&gt; * Changeling&lt;br/&gt; * Dragon-kin&lt;br/&gt; * Dwarf&lt;br/&gt; * Elf (Dark)&lt;br/&gt; * Elf (High)&lt;br/&gt; * Elf (Wood)&lt;br/&gt; * Giant/Half-Giant&lt;br/&gt; * Gnoll&lt;br/&gt; * Gnome&lt;br/&gt; * Goblin&lt;br/&gt; * Halfling&lt;br/&gt; * Half-Ogre/Ogre&lt;br/&gt; * Half-Orc/Orc&lt;br/&gt; * Human&lt;br/&gt; * Kobold&lt;br/&gt; * Lilithii&lt;br/&gt; * Lizard kin&lt;br/&gt; * Living Construct&lt;br/&gt; * Mantis men&lt;br/&gt; * Sprite&lt;br/&gt; * Tigerfolk&lt;br/&gt; * Werefolk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And as if that wasn't enough, you'll also find the Artificer, a new character skill that gives you the ability to construct contraptions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes print &amp;amp; play reference cards for the races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
