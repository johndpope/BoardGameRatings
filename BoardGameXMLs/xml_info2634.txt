			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Omar Sharif's mental push and pull for two players. A great new game of fast strategy, withs and bluff.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proprietary version of a paper and pencil game Footsteps. The board is a line with seven spaced on it. A single marker is placed on the center space. Both players start with 50 points. Each makes a hidden bid simultaneously. High bidder gets to move the marker one space closer to himself. Both players reduce the number of points by their bid amounts. Winner is the first to move the marker to the third space closes to him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Vying Games (under the name Footsteps)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Quaak! from Dirk Hanneforth (1994)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
