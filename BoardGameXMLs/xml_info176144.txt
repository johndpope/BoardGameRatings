							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SciFi Bridge</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a full-color, 24 inch by 40 inch, floor plan of a SciFi Bridge, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I never thought our own weapons and ship would be turned against us like this. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry I let whatever this thing is into the Hangar Control. We cannot let these aliens leave this ship. I&amp;rsquo;ve set the self-destruct mechanism, we have fifteen minutes to stop these things or die trying.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Captain Michael Willard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SciFi Bridge is a single level interior map of a tactical room suitable for the bridge of a starship or space station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SciFi Bridge is intended for use in far-future science fiction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last Transmission Part Two (Continued from Hanger Control freebie): The small silicon-based life forms have infected most of the ship&amp;rsquo;s systems. They have taken over the ship&amp;rsquo;s 3d printers and have begun producing weapons to kill all alien carbon-based lifeforms on the ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The surviving crew is fighting an increasing difficult battle throughout the ship. Computer and engineering experts are trying everything they can to keep the aliens from completely taking over all the ship&amp;rsquo;s systems, greatly fearing they will take off life support if they gain control of that system, and restore control to lost systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weapon and security experts are fighting weapons of their own design with the increased difficulty of trying to hit a weapon alone rather than a man holding the weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medical and science experts are furiously studying any of the animated object samples that were destroyed successfully so far, trying to analyze the alien lifeform and find some way to kill them on a microscopic level that doesn&amp;rsquo;t also kill the crew. The aliens must have a weakness!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The crew&amp;rsquo;s final stand is on the bridge. The silicon lifeforms create a laser cutter to breach the reinforced steel door leading to the bridge. They bring in an army of weapons and devices to assist with hacking into the bridge systems. Can the group survive the assault on the bridge long enough to find a way to take back control of the ship&amp;rsquo;s systems and exterminate the aliens?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
