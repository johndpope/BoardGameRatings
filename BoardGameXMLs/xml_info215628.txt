							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Falcon Master</name>
									
			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Man can build bridges and castles and towers.  We can refine ore into wonderful tools and machines.  But to truly hunt, we look not to man&amp;rsquo;s creations, but God&amp;rsquo;s - the falcon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use the tools and skills at your disposal to become a master falconer.  Learn skills, obtain a falcon, take time to train it, then build your reputation with successful hunts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Overview&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the player will decide to take one of the following 5 actions: &lt;br/&gt;- Go to town (to buy, sell, or barter items, work for gold, or obtain skills), &lt;br/&gt;- Stay home to build items, &lt;br/&gt;- Stay home to train a falcon, &lt;br/&gt;- Stay home to tend to an injured falcon, or &lt;br/&gt;- Attend a falconry hunt/tournament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player will need to balance finances (gold amount) with learning skills, training their falcons, and hunting with their falcons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Falcon Master is played with a deck of 50 cards, plus about 25 tracking cubes in 28 turns total over 4 seasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;36 cards are Item cards. 10 cards are Hunt Resolution cards used to determine outcomes of hunts.  4 cards are used to:&lt;br/&gt;- track the turns through the 4 seasons, &lt;br/&gt;- track player Gold amount, and player Reputation&lt;br/&gt;- hunt&lt;br/&gt;- aid in hunt resolution (reference card)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning&lt;br/&gt;A master falconer cares for falcons, hunts them successfully for a variety of prey, and has demonstrated the skills required for falconry.  To win:&lt;br/&gt;- Earn 12 Reputation points, &lt;br/&gt;- Successfully hunt with at least 2 different falcons, and&lt;br/&gt;- Successfully hunt at least 3 types of prey: dove, Quail, Pheasant, or Duck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reputation points are gained by successful hunts, training your falcons, and by gaining skills important to the art of falconry (selling items built with your skills).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Falcon Master was an entry in Boardgamegeek's 2016 Mint Tin PnP Contest, and won the following:&lt;br/&gt;2nd place Best Overall Design (tie)&lt;br/&gt;2nd place Best Theme&lt;br/&gt;2nd place Most Innovative Mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
