							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Type-Y Yacht</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the very rich, starships are eminently affordable purchases. Although a starship may be bought as an investment, then hired out to other organisations or used for mercantile operations, a yacht is a personal vessel. Most are specially commissioned or refitted to fulfil a specific purpose, and can provide some inspiration of what can be done with an open-ended budget without simply sinking money into armaments. The Type-Y yacht is the merest of what is possible with truly unlimited wealth but provides a classic status symbol recognisable throughout Charted Space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built on a 200-ton hull, the Type-Y yacht is a noble's plaything used to entertain friends and undertake political or commercial missions. M J Dougherty takes you through this ship, luxurious stateroom by stateroom, to explore how the other side travel through space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
