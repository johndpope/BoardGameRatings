			<description>&amp;quot;Fire the starboard broadside!&amp;quot; shouts the Captain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cannons roar as H.M.S. Courageous attacks the enemy frigate. As one of the junior officers--really, more of an officer in training--you command three guns on Courageous's main gun deck. The guns of the battery next to yours fire, leaping back against the heavy ropes that prevent them from smashing across the ship. Clouds of white smoke billow about you as you give your gun crew the commands to ready your battery's cannons: &amp;quot;Swab! Powder! Wadding! Shot! Run out the guns!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Captain yells out, &amp;quot;Fire as the guns bear!&amp;quot; You give your gun crews orders to load and fire as quickly as they can, without waiting for the rest of the broadside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They swab out the bore, push in a charge of powder, push wadding down on the powder, load the shot, push the gun out through the gunport, and fire the cannon, with you commanding each step of the process. &amp;quot;Swab, powder, wadding, shot, fire! Swab, powder, wadding, shot--&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world turns upside down as the enemy's broadside rips through the hull some ten feet away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
