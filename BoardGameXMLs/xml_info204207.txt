			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A world shaking event is now drawing nigh.  After centuries, the prophesied awakening Elder god, Ashen Sudar, is but years away.  Ashen Sudar has been partially awake for several decades, but now is coming fully into his own.  His power will be felt on the Prime Material Plane, and the other gods tremble at his approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several brave individuals have been chosen by Fate to keep this from happening.  They are the Elected, specially picked by the gods to save Tryll, and protect the world from the ravages of Ashen Sudar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario consists of three distinct parts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Quest: The Beginning (1st level characters)&lt;br/&gt;        Slow Death (1st - 2nd level characters)&lt;br/&gt;        Temple of an Elder God (4th - 5th level characters)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three-part scenario usually is distributed as a ZIP archive including the DOC adventure and nine JPG files (maps).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
