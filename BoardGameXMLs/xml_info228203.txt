							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tribe Name Generator</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many game and stories have tribes. Some view them as primitives, others as having achieved the perfect balance between civilisation and nature.  They are not limited to any one race, with tribes being found across all worlds and empires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever the nature of the tribe, they need a name, one by which the outside world knows them. Their true name is often more rich and detailed then the one presented to non-tribal members. Or they could just be very simple being who can&amp;rsquo;t use their imagination very well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This tribe name generator is aimed at those tribes with what can best be described as an orcish way of naming. It is by no means complete and is ideal for a starting point for your own ideas as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
