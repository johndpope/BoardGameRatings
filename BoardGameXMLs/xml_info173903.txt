			<description>Craok! Croak!&lt;br/&gt;Colorful parrots are waiting to fill their plumage with chips of the correct color which can be found in the eggs. &lt;br/&gt;The player who completes his parrot with all the color chips first, has won the game. &lt;br/&gt;Have fun with this thrilling seeking/searching game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;At your turn you take an egg and open it. &lt;br/&gt;Hopefully you will find a chip that isn't already on your board. &lt;br/&gt;If this is the case, you can add it to the board. &lt;br/&gt;If not, you put the chip back into the egg and withdraw it with the other eggs. Then it's the next players turn. &lt;br/&gt;The first player who has filled his board with all colored chips has won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
