			<description>&amp;quot;An exciting game of skill and chance with all the thrill of Stock Exchange speculation&amp;quot;, from the box lid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board looks interesting at first glance but prepare for disappointment. Players move round the track on the edge of the board (using the die) and they have a choice when they land on certain squares, to buy or sell stock. Chance cards here are called Ticker or Private Line cards. After an hour or so of play, the Markets close and players' stock are converted into cash. The winner is the player with the most money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was produced in both a large box version and a small box version (but both had the same rules and components).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
