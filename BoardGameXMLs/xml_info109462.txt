			<description>Easy to grasp high concept mind game (a math equivalent of Scrabble that is played like Domino).&lt;br/&gt; It teaches/applies the four basic math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on various positive numbers. Future versions will contain also negative numbers, and fractional joiners (to form fraction numbers)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTENT:&lt;br/&gt;Key game components are octagonal tiles with numbers in the center, equal signs, and half math operations between them (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), decimal joiners, and tile holders.  &lt;br/&gt;Basic Edition contains: 33 Positive Tiles, 11 Joiners, and 2 Tile Holders.&lt;br/&gt;Standard Edition contains: 66 Positive Tiles, 22 Joiners, and 4 Tile Holders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME RULES:&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives an equal number (6-10) of randomly selected octagonal tiles that he/she keeps hidden from other players on tile holders. The remaining tiles are kept in the bank face down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the tiles from the bank is placed face up on the table. E.g. Tile no. 5 is placed on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player makes a move by creating a math operation with his/her tiles by attaching them to the tile on the table. (E.g. The player that happen to have tiles 2 and 3 uses them to create the math operation 5-2=3)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next player attaches his/her tiles to any number on the table creating his/her math operation. (E.g. The player that happen to have tiles 1, 4, and 7 may create the operation 14/7=2. (The double digit number 14 is created by placing joiner between 1 and 4).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take turns using up their tiles. The one who uses up all tiles first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To prolong the game the players may take additional tile (or even 2 tiles) from the bank after each move&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See. &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.octino.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.octino.com&lt;/a&gt; for more information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
