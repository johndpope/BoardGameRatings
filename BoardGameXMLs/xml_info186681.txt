							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The NC Skill System</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skills are one of the most critical aspects of any role-playing system. More than almost any other aspect of a character, they shape the actions the character takes. The &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; role-playing system has a rigid, limited system for acquiring skills. The total selection of acquirable skills is very limited. Further, there are strict limits on the acquirable skills, dependent on the class of the character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NC skill system allows characters to develop skills in a variety of areas; far more skills than a character from the &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; system can acquire: anything from Weaponless Combat to Cook. At the same time, the skills are linked in such a way that the set of skills a character knows will usually be related to each other, or fall into a few basic groups. You can be a jack-of-all-trades, but will indeed be a master of none.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By spending experience, a character can either gain new skills or improve existing ones. Some new skills will require an initial &amp;quot;entry&amp;quot; roll to determine whether the character is able to gain the skill. The chance of success will depend on some attribute of the character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most skills will require practice in the skill to improve, and certain skills will require that particular actions be performed for advancement to be possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skills may be improved faster by finding a mentor proficient in the skill, who can instruct the character. This applies only up to a certain level of ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is designed so that the referee can design new skills, and easily plug them into the existing framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
