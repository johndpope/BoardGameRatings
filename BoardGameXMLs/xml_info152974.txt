							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dust Tactics: &quot;Snow Lynx&quot;</name>
									
			<description>We are very proud to introduce our third Elite Exclusive item: Sigrid and her own walker the Snow Lynx, which she used in Zverograd at the beginning of 1947. Sigrid, who has the soul of a huntress, is a formidable walker pilot. She was one of the very first of these on the planet, since the first prototype of the Luther was created. Now she hunts her preys amidst the ruins of Zverograd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you can see this &amp;ldquo;Elite Version&amp;rdquo; comes with a special diorama base that can also serve as a playing base for the Snow Lynx. It takes a little bit more than one space on the battlefield, but consider it as one space. The walker can also be placed on a regular grey round base that we have magnetized: you can swap the Snow Lynx from one base to another with ease.&lt;br/&gt;We also magnetized Sigrid: she can be played independently, the rock under her feet is the same size as a regular base. And thanks to the magnet she can be placed back on the large base with her walker instantly. In an instant Sigrid and the Snow Lynx can go from a Collector Item to being fully playable. And of course, as usual, everything is already painted and you can enjoy it as soon as you open the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This brand new JagdLuther model has a &amp;ldquo;belly&amp;rdquo; machine gun, that can be used with deadly effects against any infantry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course these two models come with their very own unit cards, and are fully playable in Dust Tactics and Dust Warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
