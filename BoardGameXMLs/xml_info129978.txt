			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;Der Planer&amp;quot; the player starts as the new manager of a shipping company with a focus on trucks. With a clear goal from the owners of the company it is his job to get new contracts, increase the flotilla of trucks and increase the income. In the meantime he has to care for his time management as he goes to meetings, drives to vendors or calls other companies for help or a cooperation. And of course he has to care for his family which is not very happy if he works late again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game looks a lot like MadTV but without the humour. But it is a serious business simulation with many unique aspects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
