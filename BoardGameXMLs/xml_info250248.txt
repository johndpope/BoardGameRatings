							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Campers: A Post Apocalypse Nomad Group</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A New Gang Of Nomads Has Rolled Into The Outskirts Of Town...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Campers is a ragtag group of post apocalyptic survivors who hail from different walks of life. True to their name, these folk tend to favor vehicles and shelter associated with camping and also have been known to temporarily settle in former parks, recreation sites, and, of course, campgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite their own internal struggles and mismatched collection of personalities and backgrounds, the Campers are well equipped, generally well armed, and reasonably diverse in regards to skills, talents, and abilities. They are also generally friendly towards outsiders provided that such outsiders are as equally as friendly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
