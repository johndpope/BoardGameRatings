			<description>Geistesblitz is a lightning fast word game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt a number of letter chips. A random letter is placed on the first lightning field. Now players simultaneously try to find a word with that letter and a letter chip of their choice from their pile of chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It does not matter where the two letters are located in the new word, but the two letters have to be in the sequence displayed on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example the first letter chip is &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;. Player1 has a &amp;quot;N&amp;quot; chip, so he shouts &amp;quot;ANd&amp;quot; and places the &amp;quot;N&amp;quot; on the Blitz board on the field next to the &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;. Now the players just have to find a new word with &amp;quot;N&amp;quot; and a letter of their choice from their chip piles. Player2 has a &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; and shouts &amp;quot;liNE&amp;quot;. he places the &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; chip on the next field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when a letter chip is placed on the last field on the blitz board. Player with the smallest number of chips left wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
