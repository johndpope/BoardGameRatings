			<description>The Simpsons: Bart's Trivia Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greetings, everyone. Lisa Simpson here! Everyone knows my underachieving brother Bart, right? But do you know which of our neighbors gave Bart a well-deserved spanking? Or what Bart's silly middle name is? No? Well, don't fret. Not everyone can be an A+ student like me! (the answers are below!) inside this box are lots more questions about America's favorite bad boy, Bart Simpson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can compete with your friends or even other Simpson trivia experts! See how &amp;quot;Bart-smart&amp;quot; you are! You'll have lots of fun and you just might learn something. Believe it or not, it's more fun than a trip to the library!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And guess what? The game comes with a Springfield Elementary chalkboard pad, so you can write sayings, just like Bart does each week.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
