							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dirty Politics: The Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Two to four players campaign against each other to capture the presidency.  As the players move their tokens (elephant, donkey, bull, bear) around the board through the states they use dirty tricks and smear tactics to gain the 270 electoral votes needed to be elected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is somewhat similar to Monopoly with a square board made up of state squares.  In the middle of the board are stacks of Media cards and Power cards as well as a stack of Bribery Checks.  Players are given money to &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; the votes of states as they land on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the candidate rolls the dice and whatever state square the player lands on he can win that state by paying the required fee or draw a Power card to give the player a further advantage.  If the player lands on a state owned by another candidate, that player draws a Media card and suffering the consequences.  Various cards drawn require the candidate to either gain or lose influence and votes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until one candidate accumulates the required 270 electoral votes or all other players run out of money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
