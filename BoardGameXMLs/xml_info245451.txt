							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes of Normandie: FFI â€“ La Cellule de Guesclin</name>
									
			<description>A set of two fan-made 'Print &amp;amp; Play' punchboards that expand the FFI army of Heroes of Normandie. Made by the Devil Pig Games French forum moderator, GDuprez. Approved by Devil Pig Games' Yann and Clem as an 'official product'. Part of the four punchboard expansion, Cthulhu Mythos Call #3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New for the FFI:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Recruitment tile for Julie Aubrac.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Recruitment tile for Michel and his 'Cellule de Guesclin'.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; PIAT squad&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Side-car motorcycle squad&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Mortar squad&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 'Traction &amp;agrave; Gaz' car with the scout ability&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Citro&amp;euml;n T23 Transport Trucks (without weapons) &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Recruitment options: 'Bicycles', 'Knife', 'Tricky' and 'Concealed' to improve your FFI troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;______________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quoting GDuprez, January 2018:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;As you know, during the past months the Pigs have been extremely busy (that&amp;rsquo;s putting it mildly): finalisation of the card game KS as well as that of Age of Towers, add to that of course, the creation of Black Reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, since HoN and SoN were lying somewhat dormant, I tried to create units, tiles, markers and other options. Thanks to Clem and Yann who generously gave precious advice and granted access to the rich graphic library of Devil Pig, I have been equiped with both intel and means to embark on this adventure which is in all quite new to me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But where to begin? Clearly, the problem was not finding an idea but choosing the right one from my vast amount of ideas&amp;hellip; The arrival of the FFI dice and order tokens tilted the balance. Reading up on the subject along with finding several internet images pertaining to the French Resistance provided inspiration. My vision on how this page of our history is intertwined with the secret war in the universe of Achtung Cthulhu prompted me to create a new FFI unit and different options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a long time I wanted to expand this faction so as to turn it into a complete and in certain cases independent army. Initially made to represent only the French Resistance, an FFI army can be used to depict any group of civilians that has taken up arms, regardless of their nationality in the scenario or whether they are deployed in the HoN or SoN universe. I spent many hours in front of my screen, with trials and errors, corrections, new attempts&amp;hellip; So finally today, I have the pleasure of presenting to you, my first punchboard. It is approved by Yann and Clem and validated as an official DPG product.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
