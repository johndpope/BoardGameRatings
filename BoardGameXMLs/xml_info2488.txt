			<description>Venice, Italy , 1756. Casanova has escaped from the dungeon! Some italian ladies in love plus their chambermaids start a search to rescue the fugitive from the bloodhounds of the doge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Casanova has disguised himself with women's attire (a pin is inserted into one of ten pairs of women playing pieces - it can only be felt or seen from the underside of the playing pieces). It is the task of the players to secretly figure out, under which pair of women Casanova hides, to get him into the player's palazzo via a gondola, and finally to bribe the doge to make sure Casanova can escape into freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 playing board&lt;br/&gt;10 plastic figures&lt;br/&gt;1 Casanova marking pin&lt;br/&gt;12 plastic gondolas&lt;br/&gt;5 colored necklaces (in fact small metal rings)&lt;br/&gt;5 jewellery cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
