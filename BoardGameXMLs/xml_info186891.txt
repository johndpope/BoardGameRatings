							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paradox Basic Rulebook (Faight Industries) Version 2</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Paradox Basic Rulebook is separated into six chapters, Introduction, Game Play, Resolving Game Play, Magic, Equipment, and Appendixes. Due to the progressive ideas in the paradox system, all players and the Gamemaster should read these sections, even if they are experienced with other game systems. Each section attempts to convey the feel and simplicity of the Roleplaying system; however, there may be some spots that will confuse players. To help you along, Faight Industries offers a Facts Forum (FF) to all registered users. All you need to do is register the Paradox rules and you will be eligible for all the benefits of registered users, including support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Basic Rulebook handles all the rules that Players need to be familiar with in order to enjoy the game. As they become more familiar with the system they may wish to explore the more expanded rules of the Advanced Rulebook. The Advanced Rulebook includes many of the formula and creation utilities used to create the items in the Basic Rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
