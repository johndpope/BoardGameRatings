							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Realms: Elves &amp; Orcs</name>
									
			<description>Jarn watched as the orc hoard rushed forward, heading right for him and the other elves standing beside him. They all stood in a straight line before their sacred forest home, each having sworn an oath to protect it from these foul folk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overhead the high elven king rode the winds upon the back of his dragon steed, but even with such a mighty beast on their side, Jarn did not think he and the other elves would hold the day. The mass of green orcs were to many he feared, and his folk far to few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realms is the newest Mini-game from Bad Baby Productions. Take the side of the bright elven nations or the foul orc hoards, as the two battle for control of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fast paced fantasy game of warfare, spells, magical items and mighty beasts, all will be under you control as you battle your foe. Can you out last, out fight and out maneuver your enemy, or will you fall to their sharp edged sword.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
