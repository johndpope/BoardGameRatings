							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chanda Kesin</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chanda&amp;rsquo;s precise origins are unclear. She was born to one of the many tribes of barbarians that fight for survival against calibans and enukas. There, she learned the art of battle from a very young age and grew to become a fearsome warrior. How she went from being a simply warrior is the source of a lot of debate, however most agree that dark forces one day came in and destroyed her village and her people. The anger she felt turned her into something must greater than most people ever experience. She became vengeance incarnate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
