			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mythic setting, designed for the Savage Worlds rules system, takes inspiration from real world history, ancient mythology, and modern movies and tv shows to create a unique view of Earth&amp;rsquo;s ancient history, it&amp;rsquo;s cultures, and it&amp;rsquo;s mythologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike most other settings that deal with the ancient world, Mythic doesn&amp;rsquo;t just focus on one culture and it&amp;rsquo;s mythology. Instead, several cultures and mythologies have all been brought together to exist side by side in the same setting. The core setting book includes three cultures and mythologies which form the Known World. Pridith is based on Celtic culture and mythology, Illosia is based on Greek, and Niserri is based on Egyptian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core setting book is broken into five sections. The first section provides additional information for character creation, including Edges, Hindrances, gear, Powers, and setting rules. The next three sections deal with each of the three cultures that make up the Known World, including background information and information on the gods and goddesses that form the pantheons of each culture. The final section is a bestiary with stats and descriptions of over 90 creatures, animals, and npcs pulled from all three core cultures and mythologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
