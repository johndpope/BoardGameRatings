			<description>Uffda is a trivia game for Scandinavian-Americans. As players move around the board, they answer questions about Scandinavian countries, people, and languages which are chosen based on the board spaces. The first person to reach the finish line is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It appears to be marketed to first-generation American immigrants. The box is adorned with flags from Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, and The United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
