							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monday Morning Manager</name>
									
			<description>Monday Morning Manager is a fairly detailed baseball simulation. Each player designs their own 25-man team by selecting base types (e.g., right-handed singles hitter) and then purchasing upgrades and abilities; the players are given limited bankrolls for this purpose. After designing their teams the players select lineups and play the game using the player statistics, charts, and die rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional rules are provided for seasonal play; if playing a season the teams need to change their lineups from game to game and rules are also provided for injuries, hot streaks and slumps, and mid-season replacements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
