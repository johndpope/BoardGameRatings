			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hi again and welcome to the SuperBabes One Night Stands! These are mini-modules designed to be one night adventures that can easily fit into your existing campaign or will work well as starting games to bring new groups together. After all, &amp;quot;You all meet in a bar&amp;quot; doesn't work very well for superheroic games. So with that in mind, we've designed some quickie adventures using characters from Knockout and Powerhouses. If you  don't have  a copy feel free to pick one up at your local gaming store, order one from us or just make up villains of your own to fit the scenarios within. Whatever it takes to make it work for your campaign- go for it! Most of the conceptual work has been done for you; all you have to supply are a few stats, some scenery and players, and you're ready to play. We hope you enjoy these short adventures, and we'd like to hear what you think.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
