			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;War Final Assault&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two main modes to the game: Campaign and Head-to-Head. A single player is forced to play through the campaign, but if multiple people are playing the game they can either cooperatively play through that mode or alternatively play the free for all Head-to-Head. The campaign is made up of eight different levels each with a variety of enemies and ending in a unique boss fight. The are 14 maps in the Head-to-Head mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When starting up the game, the player is allowed to pick one of four characters (multiple players can pick the same avatar), each with its own strengths and weakness. Players are also able to track and record their game progress by entering a name and PIN. As the player kills more enemies and other players, their slowly rank up. While this has no impact on gameplay, it does allow players to pick from a variety of hidden characters as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a large selection of weapons. Each player has a unique starting weapon and the player can also find various weapons lying around on the battlefield, from a short-range flame-thrower to a laser cannon with reflecting projectiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
