			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a super-hero role playing game. Players get to take on the role of superheroes and superheroines: larger-than-life characters in modern-day myths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Firstly, the characters are super. They can do incredible things, beyond the scope of mere normal human beings: run at great speed, lift enormous objects, fly into space. Players and the GM should agree the scope of the campaign, then strive to match it. Throw streetlamps as spears! Fly to Europa! Wield cosmic power! Save thousands of lives!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secondly, the characters are heroic. The Superhero genre is often black-and-white, with established heroes and opponents. Sometimes the opponents are not portrayed as clearly evil, just seeking goals that the heroes oppose, but what sets most heroes out from their opponents is their willingness to risk themselves for what they believe in (a trait that is not limited to those with superpowers, nor to fictional people). Confront the raging monster! Run into the blazing inferno! Step in front of innocents to take the energy blast!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
