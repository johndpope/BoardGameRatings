							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sail and Steam Navies</name>
									
			<description>Sail and Steam Navies is a PDF set of rules designed for 1/600 scale miniatures, but has information for use with 1/1200 scale miniatures. The period covered is 1840 to 1880 when most warships were equipped with sails as well as steam power. The basic rules are 40 pages long, with charts, markers/templates, an example of play, and conversion information for 1/1200 scale. The Under Both Flags module is included and adds six scenarios, a scenario generator, and log sheets for the ships. There are over 1000 log sheets representing almost every ship involved in the American Civil War and a number of forts and shore batteries. Sets of 1/1200 scale counters in PDF format are available separately for use instead of miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may fight historical battles using one of the 6 scenarios provided or create their own using the scenario generator. Game length will vary depending on the number of ships used and scenario victory conditions. Most scenarios played at conventions with multiple players last 3 to 5 hours. &lt;br/&gt; The game uses D10s for resolving combat and other actions. Usually you will only need one or two dice but more will be required for most damage checks. D6 dice are used to record momentum for each ship. A player aid and a sheet of markers/templates will need to be printed out for use. As with most miniatures based systems any flat playing surface can be used and a ruler or measuring tape is required for checking range and movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The turn sequence is straightforward; it starts with writing speed orders for the turn (how fast the ship will go for the turn), followed by combat (cannon fire, musket fire, boarding/melee), then movement, and finally morale checks and repairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
