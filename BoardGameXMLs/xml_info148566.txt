			<description>from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are Concept Cards?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever had trouble coming up with a backstory for a character? Have you ever had a player that thought their character was just a bunch of numbers on a sheet with a name at the top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well we definitely have and it&amp;rsquo;s from this idea that Concept Cards came to life. Concept cards are character development aids that provide a framework for coming up with some key unique elements to a players background and perhaps, give them a little edge in return for their creativity. However you choose to use them we at Night on the Wall games believe that Concept Cards will help your group develop a deeper and more meaningful gaming experience and stronger more memorable characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
