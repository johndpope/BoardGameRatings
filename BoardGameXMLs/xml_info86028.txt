							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Incorporated Volume 1</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurp:&lt;br/&gt;The world is changing, and the game goes on. The Five grapple in an endless, lethal deadlock; behind each fractional movement in their balance of power is an impenetrably complex web of secret deals made and broken, brutal battles won and lost, blood and wealth flowing amongst the Spires. Keep watch on the game, or be ground to ruin in its machinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is changing, and allegiances shift. Trusted allies are a blade&amp;rsquo;s width from bitter enmity; ruthless new players carve out their territory while old kingpins crumble, choking on their last breath. Keep watch on your allegiances, or face alone the knives of yesterday&amp;rsquo;s friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is changing, and the war evolves. Expert killers endlessly refine their craft in cold laboratories, grim academies, and bloodstained streets; new weapons of horrifying power are built and bought, sold and stolen. Keep watch on the war, or be numbered amongst its countless victims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;The next book from Brutal Games is entitled 'Incorporated Volume 1' and is a collection of pieces which were either produced as PDFs only, available in Signs &amp;amp; Portents or have been written for the game but were not appropriate to the theme of existing books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    New rules for crashing vehicles, permanent wounds, martial arts, calling in backup, cyberlin psychosis and reducing the power of NPC cannon fodder. &lt;br/&gt;    A style generator with hundreds of clothing options, hairstyles, tatoos, quirks and oddities. &lt;br/&gt;    New playable corporations including BobCo and Kalari&lt;br/&gt;    A range of in depth missions&lt;br/&gt;    A selection of new NPCs&lt;br/&gt;    And much more....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
