			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MIG Alley Ace is an exciting and action packed split screen head-to-head aerial combat flying simulation.  The game allows two players to fly against each other in their own jet fighter and each receive outstanding graphics and flight information as if they were in the cockpit of their own F-86 Sabre Jet.  The game play consists of a series of actual fighter pilot maneuvers, from loops and High-G turns to Hi-Yo-Yo's, as each player attempts to center his opponent's aircraft in his gun sights and shoot him down.  Additional game options include a solo mode against one to three enemy aircraft, and a cooperative mode where two human players can fly against two computer controlled enemy aircraft.  Five actual Korean War scenarios are included, each with five different skill levels.  MIG Alley Ace is an outstanding simulation that requires superior fighter pilot skills and guts to survive and win the Silver Wings of a Jet Ace!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
