			<description>Sirens split the black... BATTLESTATIONS! Control mighty battlecruisers facing off against each other in deep space. Use programmed actions to launch fighters and torpedos, fire lasers, and even unleash your railgun! Every move counts when the cold embrace of space awaits outside...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control two battlecruisers fighting across an imaginary grid of 3x2 cards. Weapons are played into the columns and move over to the opponent's cruiser in an attempt to cause damage. Each player has a command queue that they load cards into the back of and execute from the front of. This queue is played face up so your opponent has an idea of what you intend to do, but each card has two options so you are never sure what is going to happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It works like a two-player space invaders, with weapon cards moving across the space between cruisers and causing damage if they reach the other side. With only three hit points for each cruiser, it is intended to be a quick dueling game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
