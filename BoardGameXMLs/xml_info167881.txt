			<description>ATUM pulls the player into a world where the player is the mechanic. It brings a novelty take on the point-and-click gameplay of previous generations and combines it with platformer puzzles. The game toys with the concept of multi-layer gameplay, dipping its layers in mathematical loops and philosophical recurrences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design and the aesthetics are influenced by a manifold of science fiction classics, Blade Runner and Philip K. Dick's story Martian Time Slip among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game environment, used as narrative device, provides a considerable amount of references and clues that complement the underlying storyline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ATUM has been developed by a group of 3rd year students at NHTV IGAD, The Netherlands as part of the University's Gamelab, a one-day-a-week workshop that simulates a development studio environment. The team, consisting of an average of 10 members, worked on this project for 42 days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You Are Here, reads the legend on that map. Which one is you? Does it matter? Your finger is a pointer on a screen.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;-Gene Van Troyer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
