			<description>Little boy, Smolicek, is lost in magical forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player rolls a die, lifts plastic cup of his/her choice from the gaming board and thereby uncovers hidden item. If uncovered item matches picture on dice, player keeps the item and discards the covering cup. If boy is found, player can keep the lost boy regardless of dice-rolled symbol. If item doesn't match the rolled picture, player discards item into box and keeps the covering cup.&lt;br/&gt;When all cups are uncovered, players sum points scored for their items. Some items, such as poisonous mushrooms make you lose points rather than gain. Kept cups also count as negative points.&lt;br/&gt;Player with most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
