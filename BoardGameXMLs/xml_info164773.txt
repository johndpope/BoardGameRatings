			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlock a New Kind of Mythic Power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sure, your character&amp;rsquo;s mythic path tells you about the kinds of abilities in which he specializes, and perhaps even gives some clue as to his ultimate mythic destiny, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t say anything about where he came from, and what made him mythic in the first place. For that, you can turn to a mythic heritage. This new aspect of mythic characters allows for further customization of your mythic character. A mythic character can choose a mythic heritage in addition to his or her mythic path, and doing so grants him access to a number of unique abilities that are designed to reflect the flavor of his heritage, while also being of value to characters of every mythic path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This installment introduces the mutant heritage. Most of those with a mutant mythic heritage were not born with it, but were instead altered by exposure to strange energies, which either infused them with mythic power, or unlocked the potential mythic power that was already present within them. They may be the result of strange arcane experiments and manipulations, or they may simply have been exposed to an artifact or lingering spell energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever its cause, this mythic heritage allows you to harness the great cosmic powers of the heavens. This book includes 25 new mythic abilities, which together make up the mutant mythic heritage. Grow extra eyes and extra arms, develop tough green skin that not only makes you more resistant to blows, but also allows you to shrug off acid. Grow wild, thrashing tentacles with minds of their own, or develop superhuman strength, speed, and toughness. Shapechange into strange amalgamations of different creatures, or climb sheer surfaces and grapple foes into submission with sticky suction-cup fingers. Why be ordinary when you can be superhuman?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
