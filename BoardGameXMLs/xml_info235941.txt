			<description>WTF: Whisky Table Friends is a fast-playing card game playing under 15 minutes. The goal of the game is to have least points, and to do that you must play cards from you hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WTF (Whiskey Table Friends) is a card game, played over three rounds, in which players try to avoid getting penalty points. &lt;br/&gt;Each round all cards are distributed to the players. The cards represent a value between 3 and 30. Of each type of cards there are as many cards as 60 divided by the value of the cardtype: e.g. 20 cards of value &amp;quot;3&amp;quot;, 2 cards of value &amp;quot;30&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;In his turn, the starting player plays as many cards (min.1) of the same value as he wishes open on the table. &lt;br/&gt;The next player in turn has the choice: a/ follow = play as many cards (min.1) of the same value as played, and pass this on to the next player; &lt;br/&gt;or b/ counter = play as many cards (min.1) of a different value so that the total amount of the cards is higher than the total amount of the cards played by the starting player. &lt;br/&gt;If the player can't do neither option a nor b, then he has to take all cards as penalty points.&lt;br/&gt;Of course there are some Joker-cards, which allow the players to avoid taking the penalty points. Some examples are: change the direction of play; take a card from the discard pile, take half of the penalty cards and move the rest on to the next player, ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
