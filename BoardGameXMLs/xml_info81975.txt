			<description>&amp;quot;In 1933, Stubbs is a traveling salesman during the Great Depression  trying to make a living. He temporarily finds happiness with a girl named Maggie Monday, but he meets his unfortunate end when Otis, Maggie's father comes home, chases him outside, and murders him, dumping his body in the wilderness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in the fictional city of Punchbowl, Pennsylvania at its opening ceremony in 1959. It just so happens that the city, founded by Andrew Monday, Maggie's son, has been built directly on top of Stubbs' not-so-final resting place. Stubbs rises from his grave as a zombie and decides to get his revenge by eating the brains of the inhabitants of Punchbowl, quickly creating his own army of the undead, causing increasing amounts of havoc as the zombies clash with the various militant factions of the area.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
