							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">EOS Rules Guide</name>
									
			<description>From the Book's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the live role-playing game Eos, set in the World of Dawn. This book is the rules guide for the game. It contains all of the information that you should need to design a character and play. It also contains some basic background information on all of the races and history of the World of Dawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules contained in this book have been written with inexperienced players of live role-playing games in mind and we have tried to explain many of the concepts in as clear a way as possible. With this in mind, we ask that you use the book in the best way that you can to get a feel for how to play the game. Some players may only need to read a small amount of some of the sections included, whereas others may find it useful to read every page; that choice, of course, is yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As designer of the rules and game world, it is my hope that you, as a player, will be able to share in the imaginative ideas I have attempted to communicate here and take them a great deal further than I am capable of doing. All of the rules material contained in this guide is considered to be open source, and as such eminently usable by other people to make and design their own live role-playing games, indeed, I actively encourage this as others actively encouraged me. The game world information I consider to belong to the players of the game. With this in mind, we politely request that should you be looking to design your own world and see these ideas as a source of inspiration please do contact me and ask for permission. By making the effort, you will probably get what you are after.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A great deal of thanks must go to several people in the writing of this book. To all of the people involved in the writing of the Lorien Trust player's guide version 2, especially Andy King. To Matt Davey for his work on the Twilight Gothic Rules and to Matt Pennington for his generous attitude with his own rules for Maelstrom. The rules of Eos draw from my contributions and experience of these three sources. Other thanks must go to the contributions made by several users of the Pagga.com live role playing forum, Ed Fortune for his kind donation of the Eos Forum and all the assistance granted therein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally some additional thanks should go to all of the players of Eos over the last three years. Your enthusiasm, criticism, feedback and praise has kept us working late into the nights to make our game better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
