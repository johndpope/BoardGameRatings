							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Activist Game</name>
									
			<description>This game abstractly represents the struggle of an activist group to spread its message and convert the world.  It is a single player game played on a 6 by 6 grid, involving the use of two dice and also a number of checker pieces and one piece representing a core group.  Players struggle with trying to recruit, and losing support due to attrition and dissension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
