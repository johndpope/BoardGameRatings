			<description>Batty is basically a competitive version of the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Players each get three cards (A, B, and C) to place stacks on and then try to get a given set of numbered cards arranged in one stack in descending numerical order; the cards are moved from stack to stack with the players forbidden to place a card on a card with a lower number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with three cards, then proceed to four the next round, etc., up to a maximum of fourteen (the number of cards provided per player). All except the highest-numbered card in each round are shuffled, which is the only difference from the usual Tower of Hanoi puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
