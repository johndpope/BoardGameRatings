			<description>Box description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Crossbows and Catapults... The action advendture game where skill and imagination win the battle.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In the Dark Ages, enemy kingdoms battled using the powerful crossbow and the mighty catapult...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The battlefield is now being readied for the clash between the Vikings and the Barbarians.  You are the commander of the Vikings and you opponent is the commander of the Barbarians.  Both commanders have great arsenals of weapons and brave warriors, but the one who possesses the greater skill and better strategy will conquer!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TROJAN BATTLESET CONTENTS:&lt;br/&gt; 2 towers&lt;br/&gt; 2 courtyards&lt;br/&gt;24 wallblocks&lt;br/&gt;16 warriors (8 vikings, 8 barbarians)&lt;br/&gt;32 projectiles (15 standard and 1 king carom each)&lt;br/&gt; 2 crossbows&lt;br/&gt; 2 catapults&lt;br/&gt; 1 trojan horse&lt;br/&gt; 1 battle shield&lt;br/&gt;   Label sheets&lt;br/&gt;   Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This rare Crossbows and Catapults set (not to be confused with the smaller and more common &amp;quot;Trojan Horse and Battle Shield&amp;quot; expansion) brings the additional power of two mighty weapons to the battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set follows the rules of Crossbows and Catapults, but adds the Trojan Horse and Battle Shield to the players' arsenals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play, each player is given a set of castle parts, plastic warrior figures, flags, projectiles and the seige engines that fire them.  Before play, each player sets up their defenses to best withstand the oppenent's onslaught. They then take turns launching projectile caroms at the opposing defenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opponents agree before play on any of the four official winning conditions. Alternatively players make up their own rules, or simply blast away at eachother's defenses until the enemy's force is annihilated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trojan Horse (Vikings) and Battle Shield (Barbarians) are weapons used to propel caroms at the opposing forces, similar to the standard catapult and crossbow respectively.  But they also serve as tempting targets for the enemy. When struck, internal mechanisms spectacularly expel warrior figures or caroms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
