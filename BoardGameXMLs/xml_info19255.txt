			<description>Ad copy:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If You Love Golf...&lt;br/&gt;You'll Love Club-House Golf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new fun golf card game that plays like real golf&lt;br/&gt;and incorporates strategy, risks and rewards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complete with water hazards and out of bounds, every hole is a challenge that combines skill and the luck of the draw, giving all players an equal chance of winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hole's par determines how many cards are dealt each player, and the hole's handicap determines the wild card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play begins by dealing three cards on par 3's, four cards on par 4's, and five cards on par 5's. The wild card is worth 0 and the value of other cards varies from 1 to 20.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to have the lowest score on each hole. Four players can play a round in under two hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A superb gift for the golfing enthusiast and a great game for the entire family.&lt;br/&gt;Includes scorecards, pencils, cards, a scoring ball&lt;br/&gt;all in a smart decorative tin box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
