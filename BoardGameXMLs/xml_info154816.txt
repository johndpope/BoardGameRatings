			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the quirky and bizarre world of Far Away Land. This is a world where noknil clones are part of a hive mind, where clown plants hurl terrible jokes while stabbing their victims, where a cataclysmic event of the past has sewn together the various realms of creation to a forge a nexus point on a fantasy world known as Far Away Land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Far Away Land is a rules-lite fantasy role-playing game that uses six-sided dice. It mixes fantasy, sci-fi, and apocalyptic elements to create an immersive and rich world full of history and adventure. It is easy to learn and a perfect game for new (young) gamers as well as veteran gamers. All of the Far Away Land books contain colorful artwork, humor, and rules that allow gamers and GMs to pick and choose the level of crunch they want in their game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tome of Awesome contains everything from the Far Away Land Core Rules, Creatures Volume I, Companion Rules, and Tales of Awesome under a single cover. It features a bunch of extra artwork. The Tome of Awesome is available as both pdf and hardback.
