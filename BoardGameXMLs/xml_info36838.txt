			<description>This game is played with a pack of 53 cards and is based on the nursery rhyme &amp;quot;Sing a Song of Sixpence.&amp;quot; The colorful cards feature the different characters from the rhyme. This is a war-like game where cards are dealt face down to players and they turn cards up one at a time, battling to steal each others cards until finally one player holds all. Special cards like clowns, queens, kings, and maids dictate how many cards must be turned up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
