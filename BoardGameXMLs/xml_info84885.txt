							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Depths of Ruin</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A ruthless band of criminals has been raiding merchant wagons for several months, causing great anger and frustration for the nearby towns and merchants. However, the true motives for the attacks are as yet unknown and may prove to be far more sinister than first expected. The mastermind behind the attacks is certainly a figure to contend with as his schemes have roots in an ancient artifact. Will the PCs be able to stop him or will they fall victim to his sinister machinations?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure designed for four 7th level characters, &amp;ldquo;Depths of Ruin&amp;rdquo; can be played in one or two sessions with enough seeds for further adventure to start off a small campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
