			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Paragons!, the Super Powered RPG Battle Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;s a Super Powered RPG Battle Game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple: a streamlined collection of rules for running super powered battles and roleplaying superhero stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a battle game, Paragons! can be used to play out comic book slugfests between heroes and villains that you create. The combat system is a dice game all by itself, one that requires strategy, teamwork, and the ability to outthink your opponent. You can play Paragons! as a battle game, even if roleplaying games aren&amp;rsquo;t your thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But since you&amp;rsquo;re here, you should know that Paragons! is also a toolbox for roleplaying super powered adventures. We call it a toolbox because it only includes the rules of the game. We&amp;rsquo;ve left out a lot of the fluff normally found in roleplaying games. You won&amp;rsquo;t find an introduction to the superhero genre. If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, we&amp;rsquo;re going to assume you already know a thing or two about superheroes. You won&amp;rsquo;t find a section explaining how to play roleplaying games, or an example of play. Again, if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, we assume you pretty much have that down. And you won&amp;rsquo;t find a section describing how to be a better player or gamemaster. There are a ton of excellent articles, books, games, podcasts, and websites out there that cover this stuff. We&amp;rsquo;ve given you the tools, and assume you know how to use them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However you decide to play the game, we hope you enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
