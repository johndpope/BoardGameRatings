			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;NUGGET is a simple set of roleplaying game (RPG) rules. A group of people sit around pretending to be imaginary characters having adventures in a fictional setting. Each controls a player character (PC), except one who takes the role of Game Master (GM), setting up situations for the PCs and controlling the other characters they meet (non-player characters, NPCs). The players say what their characters do and the GM tells them what happens next. The story progresses through scenes of particular actions at a location. You'll need pencils and paper and about 10 six-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment:&lt;br/&gt;The Nugget rules are available as a free download from the publisher's site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
