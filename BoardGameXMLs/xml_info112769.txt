			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Hi Dysfunctional Gamers!&lt;br/&gt;      We're back, did ya miss us? Sorry about the long gap since the last issue of Critical Miss. We had a fair few things happen in our lives which kind of delayed things, but they should be out of the way now.&lt;br/&gt;      When we started we had planned on publishing an issue every three months, regular as clockwork, but then I guess we're not the only ones who started out with the best of intentions, but then found other things getting in the way.&lt;br/&gt;      But although it's turned out to be a lot more work than we realised, we're glad we did it. We've been pretty successful. Admittedly not as successful as the Jersey Association of Gamers, whose web site's counter (as of 3rd June 2000) recorded 2,532,463 visits to their main page since 14th July '97. Compared with their record of a staggering 2400 visitors every day, we're small fry. But we're catching up on them.&lt;br/&gt;      Anyhow, enough of that. Hope you enjoy this issue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
