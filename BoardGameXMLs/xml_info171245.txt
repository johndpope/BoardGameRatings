			<description>Snelbieden is a fast paced card game focused on trick-taking.&lt;br/&gt;The game originated in East-Flanders, Belgium as a pub game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to bid on how many points you will be able to get, and then get those points through trick-taking. Everyone starts at 41 points, the first one to get to 0 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be played with a standard card game deck, using 32 cards (from 7 to aces).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
