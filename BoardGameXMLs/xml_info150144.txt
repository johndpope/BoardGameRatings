			<description>The battling robots card game comes to iOS! It's easy to learn, quick to play and impossible to put down! With dozens of adorable (but also deadly) robots!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build your Stak and attack your opponent using the army of bots at your disposal. Every bot is unique and the game will be very different depending on which bots you have and how you use them. The last player with cards left in their Stak is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stak Bots is a two-player game which lets you challenge your Facebook friends. You can also jump straight into a game against the next available opponent or play offline with pass-and-play and practice modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The app features all 16 bots from the original card game, and the &amp;quot;Bot of the Day&amp;quot; feature offers a sneak peek at several of the upcoming expansion bots too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have arrived to help your Bots during a time of great crisis, for they are in the midst of what will later come to be known as &amp;quot;The Great Bickering&amp;quot;. Bots who once stood alone have found others with similar ideals and formed together to create mighty Staks, with new Bots coming to join them at every turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must guide your Stak of Bots to victory, by scrapping all other Bot Staks that stand against you, for they are clearly in the wrong. Learn what each of your Bots is capable of and how to command them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stak them wisely, choose your attacking Bots carefully, rely on your skills, trust to luck and maybe you will be able to defend what you and your Bots stand for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get to know your bots and they will serve you well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
