			<description>Guide a species from the earliest beginnings to the height of the evolutionary ladder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brief Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin with their animal only having a single body part, such as a torso, and must evolve to gain additional appendages and abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each species has a set of stats that will increase as the game progresses and they gain new abilities (such as Predator).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins with a single adult of their species. You have a limited number of actions to split between hunting for food, birthing new offspring, changing the current environment, or claiming an effect tile which will give their species a new ability once they can afford to put the tile into play. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;If a player's species is strong enough they can also attack one of the other players and try to slow their progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whichever species has evolved the most by the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
