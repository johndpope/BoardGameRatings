							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Muppets Party Cruise</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An exceptionally solid collection of thirty minigames becomes an instant classic with the overlay of all of your favorite Muppet characters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beginning in the &amp;quot;Engine Rooms&amp;quot; on the bottom deck of the Muppets Party Cruise ship, players will compete against the computer or (preferably) up to three friends to earn party favors.  Favors may be spent, in between games, to unlock new minigames to play.  Unlock enough games, and you're granted access four additional, more luxurious decks; each with its own decor and music, but also pitfalls and twists of fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six of Jim Henson's Muppet Show characters are playable, including Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzy, Animal, Gonzo, and Pepe the King Prawn.  In addition, each minigame is 'owned' by a character from the show, who both introduces it and announces the winner.  Various Muppet Show denizens will also wander the decks with you, heckling or complimenting as per their temperament, and either helping or hindering your progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Voice-work is done by the actual artists, as licensed by the Jim Henson company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
