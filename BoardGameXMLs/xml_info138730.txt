			<description>The Basics:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hull Breach is an award-winning Card Game from Not-So-Broken (NSB) Games. First released in 2011 as an 'Alpha Run'; then Re-released in it's final version in 2014; as Corporate Wars and Loyalty &amp;amp; Vigilance. Now, we are moving to complete the set with In Defiance of Dictators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This space-based Card and Dice tabletop game which features epic combat between warships, firefights during Marine boarding actions, and a multitude of clever tactics and galaxy-shaking events, Hull Breach is one of the fastest-growing platforms in the gaming world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Hull Breach, you assume command of an advanced space station belonging to one of our several in-game factions and fight it out with one or more other Commanders to achieve galactic domination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to protect your Station - your home in space - from other Commanders while trying to capture or destroy theirs. Be warned - they&amp;rsquo;re trying to do the same thing to you. It's a tough galaxy and at the end of the day only one Commander will remain standing. Only through careful planning can the most daring gain command of the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each deck of Hull Breach cards consists of fifty-five (55) cards, including a Station, two Station Module enhancements, two Stockpile cards to track your resources and economic wealth, with fifty others to help extend your power across the galaxy. Each pre-constructed deck sports an effective array of the different card types you&amp;rsquo;ll need to wage war against your opponents: Upgrades, Options, Modules, Marines, Ships, Events, Tactics, and Breakthroughs. Once you have a few games under your belt you can mix and match cards from different decks to create your very own personalized fighting force and compete against some of the finest commanders in the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best of all, while we encourage customization and deck-building, this isn't one of those &amp;quot;collectible&amp;quot; card games that will have you tearing through randomized foil packs of cards to find the ones you want. Hull Breach plays right out of the box and you'll know where you can find every card in the game without having to drop a ton of cash on additional boosters or turn to the secondary market to field a competitive deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, Hull Breach is not only a game, but a developing universe where the players have the opportunity to affect the outcome of the fighting between the factions. In every box you receive a fiction supplement to help you immerse yourself in the Universe&amp;rsquo;s rich backstory, and we are currently in negotiations to expand upon that literary presence. In fact, several of the Reward levels below will allow you to create your own historical presence in the Hull Breach universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm a returning Commander (player); so what can you tell us about the new Hull Breach Expansion: In Defiance of Dictators?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hull Breach!: &amp;quot;In Defiance of Dictators&amp;quot; focuses on the rising conflict between the Republic Defense Force and the Colonial Unaligned Forces in the wake of the Corporate Wars. Once again, you take control of one of the faction-controlled stations, build up your fleet and forces, and do battle with any who would attempt to encroach upon your space. Each box set includes four (4) pre-constructed decks (ready to play directly out of the box) complete with all new stations and cards that pit 2 RDF Commanders against 2 Colonial Commanders. Are you ready to fight off the imperialistic monsters, or crush the rebel scum? You decide, you command!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You asked and we listened! Over the course of the last two expansions, we have consistently continued to listen to our players and fan base, in order to continue to expand and improved our Hull Breach Universe. In Defiance of Dictators will include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- New Team Play and Team Victory Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- alternate Victory Conditions; Diplomatic and Economic Victories&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- even more Faction-Only cards and effects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 65 never-before-seen printed cards and artwork, and many necessary revisions to our First-Edition cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- two new Ship classes; the Freighter and the Transport; in inspire trade between players and aide in the valiant Marine-heavy decks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- a revised Rulebook, complete with easier access rules for beginners; and a digital video rule book put together by the awesome team at 'Skip the Rules'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- a completely all new Fictional Supplement that focuses on the Republic Defense Forces and Colonial Unaligned Forces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- everything you need to enjoy our new Organized Play system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;if you have any other questions feel free to email us direct at hullbreachthegame@gmail.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
