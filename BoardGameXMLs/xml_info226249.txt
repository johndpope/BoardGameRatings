							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pathfinder Live Action Role Playing: 2015 Manual</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may have played a tabletop Role Playing game, seen a fantasy film such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy or read a fantasy novel and imagined yourself in the place of one of the characters. How would you react in the same situation? With Live Action Role Play you get the chance to find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to complete a quest that may involve physical combat (in a safe environment), solving puzzles and talking to other inhabitants of the fantasy world. You will create a character with skills and powers you want to use. The physical limits of your character are your own rather than the dice rolls of tabletop games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N.B. This game is unrelated to Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
