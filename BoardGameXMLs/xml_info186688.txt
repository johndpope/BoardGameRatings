			<description>Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neo-Hunt 3 is a round-based, multi-phase board/card game for 2-4 players.  Each player controls a team of three &amp;quot;varans&amp;quot; (large, humanoid reptiles bio-engineered for combat).  Players try to kill as many &amp;quot;troopers&amp;quot; and opponents as possible before one team is eliminated.  Opponents include the varans of other players as well as &amp;quot;troopers&amp;quot; (non-player game tokens) who occupy the game board and arrive at the beginning of each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player selects a color and takes all the pieces for that color.  Players sit on corners of the playing surface.  The game board randomly is generated by creating a 3x3 grid from the board pieces.  Each of the nine sectors of the game board provides various terrain benefits or penalties.  During the game a total of fifty &amp;quot;troopers&amp;quot; will deploy into various sectors and players may move their varan units into sectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play proceeds in turns.  During turn setup, each player selects and plays four action cards.  Then play proceeds in player order, with each player in sequence executing their four played action cards.  Action cards are resolved in the order of priority indicated on their face; they may distribute damage tokens.  Damaged &amp;quot;troopers&amp;quot; are eliminated and varans with enough accumulated damage tokens also are eliminated.  After each player has taken their phase all &amp;quot;troopers&amp;quot; take automatic actions of either shooting at a visible varan or, if no varans are visible to them, by moving to a new sector.  At the end of each turn new &amp;quot;troopers&amp;quot; deploy onto the board if any counters remain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until end of turn when there are no more trooper counters on the board or one varan team has all its members killed. When game ends, the player with most points wins. If tied, the one with most surviving varans, and if still tied, tied victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Comments:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is print-and-play and published for free access via HTML.  Components and rules are downloadable in PDF format.  Color printing is recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
