			<description>Translated from the books intro:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are you going to do when the chaos arrive? When you look around you and feel that things are not the same anymore, that the world changed and you hardly had the chance to realize, busy you were surviving, or distracted that you were having fun?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are you going to do when nothing that has been done is enough? When your dreams become strange and your hope looks jagged? What are you going to do when all you have left is cynicism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When vengeance, prejudice and revolt sounds like honor, dignity and glory... what will still be left to be done? On that day, maybe you will find that the nightmare where you live is not that bad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chaos is alive and growing. Some will fight to avoid it, others, to accelerate, hoping it brings renovation. The values don't change, they get lost. Many fight for much less. Security is a luxury and hope is a dream. And, in the shadows, there are those that are more than human.  Being that we always knew were among us. Beings that, like us, must choose between oppose or join the chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
