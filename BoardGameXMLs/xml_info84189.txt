			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diseases are a part of life in every society, in every time period, and in every world. Most of them are pretty terrible - you drink the brown water, throw up a few times, and then die. Not exactly the makings of an adventure. But in a magical world, things are a little bit different - the diseases can be as exotic as the surroundings, and can serve as adventures all their own. The following is a collection of fantastic diseases, feats, and even a character class to help a GM add a different type of challenge to their campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement has includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     10 All new disease including Black Touch, Dreaming Sickness, Logar Spawn and Therian's Whisper.&lt;br/&gt;     10 All New Feats including Breath Rot, Disease Sense, Contaminated Wounds and Infectious Spawn.&lt;br/&gt;     All New Prestige Class: Phage Touched&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
