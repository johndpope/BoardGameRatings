			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For all those who dreamt of being a cowboy, strap on those spurs, because in this wild, wild west, wagon rollin', trigger happy, rootin' tootin' PC simulation, gamers can be all they had ever dreamt of.&lt;br/&gt;Start out as a rancher with a handful of cattle and a few good men to help out. The main objective is to extend the ranch and herds through cattle trade and make a few dollars along the way.&lt;br/&gt;Players need to create a team that can work together: The cowboys and girls are there to protect the herds from bandits and indians. Of course, this protection comes at a price. To keep those yellow-bellied, lily-livered &amp;quot;Gringos&amp;quot; happy, you will need to constantly supply them with all a cowboy's favorite things: coffee, beans, and of course a bottle of Ol' Redeye for their travels.&lt;br/&gt;In order to maintain and expand the ranch, players can choose to take the high road and expand their farms upholding the law... or to take the low road, where for a few dollars they can train their cowboys to become bandits... and set criminal gangs on the loose in native reservations, saloons, banks, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
