							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arrow of Death Part 2</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Catalog&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having successfully completed Part I of Arrow of Death (this is not mandatory; both parts are self-supporting) you are now in possession of the component parts of an arrow. You will need the arrow in order to destroy Xerdon the Evil, the source of the ill which has befallen your homelands. You now find yourself on the fringe of Desolation Marsh with no clear idea about what to do next. Your main objective is to seek out the only man who is able to create a Magical Arrow from the parts you now possess. This man is Arnid, the royal fletcher. He has been kidnapped by the minions of Xerdon the Evil who have somehow learned of your intent. You must now set off in search of Arnid the fletcher. Danger lurks at every step, your only hope of survival on this quest is to rely on quick wits and cunning. Your mission must not fail....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
