							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Inspector Moss: House Arrest</name>
									
			<description>Inspector Moss must investigate the mysterious death of millionaire baker, John Dough, who has been found battered at his stately country manor during a social gathering in the bachelor&amp;rsquo;s home. With an injunction in place to keep the guests from leaving, Moss has only a short window of opportunity to investigate and question the suspects. Can he eliminate the innocent and arrest the culprit before the injunction expires?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, you get to play as Inspector Moss, exploring a 25-room house consisting of tiles. Each tile contains either a suspect, evidence that can be used to eliminate suspects, or something to assist you in solving the case in time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, you roll 7 white dice and 1 colored &amp;quot;time&amp;quot; die up to 3 times. You may then use up to 6 of the dice for movement (by matching the number on the destination tile), for gathering evidence (with any 4 consecutive dice), and for getting assistance (with any 3 matching dice). After performing any actions, you must move the time marker down a number of spaces equal to the number shown on the time die plus 1 minute for every wild 6 that was used for an action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 10 possible suspects in the game. Once you have collected enough evidence to eliminate 9 of them, you must arrest the remaining suspect and escort him/her to the waiting police car. If you can do all of this before time runs out, you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
