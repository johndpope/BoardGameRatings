			<description>Teams are drafted from a deck of the best players of the day. Hank Aaron, Ernie Banks, Lou Brock, Rod Carew, Roberto Clemente, Tommy Davis, Jim Fregosi, Bill Freehan, Tom Haller, Frank Howard, Reggie Jackson, Harmon Killebrew, Mickey Lolich, Juan Marichal, Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, Sam McDowell, Dennis Menke, Don Mincher, Phil Niekro, Rico Petrocelli, Boog Powell, Frank Robinson, Ron Santo, Tom Seaver, Mel Stottlemyre, and Tony Taylor are some of the players represented. Once the players have their teams each organizes a line up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another deck of cards represents the possible outcomes of an at bat. This deck is shuffled and one card for each player in the field is placed face down on the playing surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An at bat consists of rolling two six-sided dice and if the result is a two the batter has drawn a walk. Seven means a strike out. Otherwise, check for the number on the back of the batter's card. The number corresponds to a fielding position and check that fielding position of the result. An outfield result is more likely to result in a hit than an infield result. any card used is replaced from the top card of the draw pile and the deck is reshuffled when depleted. All standard rules of baseball apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a prized collectible. Milton Bradley also released an Official Baseball board game at about the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
