			<description>From Original Publisher Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically, this is just a set of simple rules, so that you can create characters, vehicles and have both normal and auto combat. I suggest that you have played other RPGs before, and also the I'76 computer game before you start with this one, so that you know what it's all about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I haven't described the world of I'76 at all in the game: it's up to the gamemaster to do that. He also must create fun adventures for his players. However, if I get a good response from you out there, I may do more for the game in the future. Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the final version of the RPG, and no more changes will be done. I won't update this page any longer, but it will stay up until the day I need the Web space for something more important. The reason is simple: There is no need for more updates. The RPG turned out to be as I wanted. My friends and I enjoy it as it is. I hope you do too. : )&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional User Information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RPG is a free RPG based on the world created in Activision's Interstate '76 computer game. The RPG came with rules and sheets for the characters &amp;amp; vehicles. The designer acknowledges that he's not a native English speaker, and the rules do have some interesting syntactical moments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
