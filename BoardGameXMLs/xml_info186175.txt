			<description>Posted with permission of John Yianni, designer of Hive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hive Colony is a collection of unofficial expansions for Hive designed by Stephen Taylor. It includes Hive: Original, Venom, Swarm, Predators, Guardians and Honeycombo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hive: Venom &amp;ndash; Includes all the original pieces in addition to some new creatures on the reverse sides. You must decide which face up to place the pieces depending on the current state of the board and your future plans. You can flip the pieces but this will cost you a tempo. The new pieces are designed not to over power the Originals be rather to compliment them and present the player with more strategic choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hive: Swarm &amp;ndash; A mode of play which adds in a little bit of randomness to Hive and challenges the player to make the best use of the hand they are dealt. It can be played with Hive Original or any of the expansions and even allows you to place your opponent's pieces!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hive: Predators &amp;ndash; Introduces some powerful pieces with killer moves which can permanently remove an opponent's creatures from the Hive. It also introduces the alternative victory condition of removing your opponent's Queen Bee which encourages even more interesting ways to play and the greater possibility to come back from a losing position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hive: Guardians &amp;ndash; Dominate the top of the Hive with these high flying creatures. You now have to fully surround the Queen Bee so even the top must be covered to win. They can also be very useful in neutralising some of the new expansions when playing with all the expansions together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hive: Honeycombo &amp;ndash; This piece is shared by both players which allows you sacrifice your current turn in order to then play two moves in your next turn. This opens up many new possibilities such as being able to place and move a piece without it getting pinned, or moving two pieces in to surround the Queen without your opponent being able to move one away with the Pillbug.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please see attached files for the rules and print and play stickers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
