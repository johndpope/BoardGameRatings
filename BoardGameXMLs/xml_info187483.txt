							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">My Big World: Europe</name>
									
			<description>A fun and simple geo-themed game, where players put their tokens on a map, trying to be the nearest from the monument shown on the card. But beware, i bet you're not on the good place !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, players draw a card from a pile, that displays a monument, a famous building, or anything else related to a specific place, sometimes accompanied by a flag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players should guess where in Europe this place is. The first player put his meeple where he think the answer is, on the European map/board. The next player take his turn and must do the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all players have placed their markers, the card is turned over, revealing the right position. Now, using the benchmarks along the edges of the map, the players should deduct how far they are distant from the solution. The nearest player from this place score more points. If 2 or more player's markers are on the same position, the token that is under the others scores more points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then a new card is revealed. Game ends after 12 cards revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
