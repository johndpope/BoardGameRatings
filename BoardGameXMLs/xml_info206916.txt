							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of Industries</name>
									
			<description>This is a late 19th Century quiz game, which the box says contains &amp;quot;400 Questions and Answers on the Great Industries of the United States&amp;quot;. It consists of 100 plain cardboard cards. Each card has four questions, each followed by its answer, with a black line surrounding the text near the card's edges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take two cards to start, with the remainder placed face down to form a draw deck. Each player in turn asks a question from one of his cards to the player on his left. If that player answers, he takes the card and places it in front of him. If he cannot, each other player in turn has an opportunity to answer and take the card. If no one answers correctly, the asking player gets to place it in front of himself. Whenever a card is taken, it is replaced from the draw deck, and the turn passes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some sample questions and answers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What river is said to drive more mills and factories than any other river in the world? The Merrimac.&lt;br/&gt;The exports of what city are ten times the value of its imports? New Orleans.&lt;br/&gt;What city in New York is the largest cheese market in the Union? Utica.&lt;br/&gt;For what is Troy, N.Y. noted? Collars and cuffs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is undated, but Alex G. Malloy (American Games, 1999) dates it to the 1890s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
