			<description>What do pirates do when sailing the seas? The distances between harbors are long and there are only so many times the crew can try mutiny before it gets old. The captain is grumpy all the time and the ship needs constant management. So what do the crew do to keep up the spirits? Gamble with Round-o-Loot of course!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round-o-Loot is a fast, risk based card game, where cards are played fast and plays disrupted by selective hand management. Players try to play the most points they can while gathering cards to get combos to disrupt other player&amp;rsquo;s play. The deck consists of 61 cards: 5 different cards and the captain card. Most of the cards are point cards, and then there is the rum card. Cards are played one type at a time, and when possible, 3 or more cards can be played in conjunction with rum card to create combos to disrupt other player&amp;rsquo;s game. After dealing their hand cards, players play one type at a time. With careful card drawing and hand management, players can also collect 3 or more of the same card type, and when played with the rum card, players get a combo. These combos affect other players and gives the player an edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to get the most points possible until someone draws the captain card. After someone draws the captain, the round ends immediately and points are calculated. The player with the most points win the round and gets a token card. Then cards are shuffled again and a new hand is dealt. When any player gets their 3rd token card, they win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
