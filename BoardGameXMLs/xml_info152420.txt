The game board is a town &amp;quot;map&amp;quot; with roads, signal lights, barriers, one-way streets, supermarkets and six pizza customers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Todays pizza customer is decided by throwing the die. A cute littel wodden house is placed on the location to identify where to deliver the pizza.&lt;br/&gt;All the bakers then set off in their vans to deliver the pizza to the hungry customer. If you are the first to arrive at the customer's house, you will recieve moey for your pizza before a new customer shows up.
