							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cave Pilot 55: Stay Frosty Expansion</name>
									
			<description>The goal of this ice themed expansion is to fly the cave, collect reputation points and destroy or face the flying Ice Skeleton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The flying Ice Skeleton is accompanied by an Ice Mummy and an Ice Ghost, whereas you can also end up in an Ice Storm or been fired at by an Ice Ray.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a game of Cave Pilot 55 that makes use of large beasts like the flying Ice Skeleton, the cave is slid outward to create a small corridor. This corridor can be used to place the large flying beast in the center of the cave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On top of the regular 'static' challenges, the flying Ice Skeleton presents an extra moving obstacle affecting its surroundings.&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the beast moves 1 or 2 positions through the cave. Based on the strengths and weaknesses of the beast, players need to strategically plan and time their route through the cave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
