			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defeat the enemies building toward your character. Enemy units construct a building so they can get near your avatar. As they get closer more of them can attack. If your health reaches zero you lose the round. Use the mouse to set where fireballs will attack enemy units. Click to unleash a special wall of fire that hits any enemy unit in the path. Unlock hats to get different bonuses. Different enemy units have different powers for example archers can hit your avatar at a range, soldiers have shields to reduce damage from fireballs, priests protect other enemy units with shields among others. As you play the game earn coins to increase your powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
