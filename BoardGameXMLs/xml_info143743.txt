							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of Inchon (1950 AD)</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;North Korea invaded the Republic of South Korea in 1950.  The UN voted to recommend military assistance to the Republic of South Korea, and President Truman sent US troops to Korea.  The North captured much of the Korean Peninsula and the only hold outs were in the Pusan Perimeter.  General MaCarthur proposed relieving the pressure on Pusan with a surprise amphibious landing behind enemy lines at Inchon.  The landing was a  major victory for the UN forces in Korea.  UN forces went on the offensive and drove north until the Chinese intervened.  The war ended in an armistice, with a demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas near  the 38th parallel.  The border remains an area of heightened tensions to this day.  The Korean War is sometimes called the &amp;quot;forgotten war&amp;quot; in the United States because it comes between two more famous conflicts, WWII and the Vietnam War.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forces portrayed in the game include American squads in units of 8 soldiers, with an officer, radioman and two BAR machine gunners for each squad and North Korean squads in units of 15 and have one officer and one machine gun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
