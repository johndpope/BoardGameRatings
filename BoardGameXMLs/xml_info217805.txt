			<description>The team-based social deduction game Spy King includes three royal families as well as a family of spies who wants to defeat the royals. If the spies defeat all the kings, they win; if the spies are defeated, then the family with the highest value wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A moderator is needed to play Spy King, but this player can also be part of a family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
