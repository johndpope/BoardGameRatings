							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon Hunting</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragons. They&amp;rsquo;re everywhere. Big ones. Small ones. Mosquito-sized ones that buzz around your head and crawl up your nose. Red ones. Green ones. Blue ones. The varieties are endless. However, all dragons have two things in common.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only children can see them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And they love getting children in trouble.&lt;br/&gt; And now, a plague of dragons has infested your home, breaking things and making a mess, and you are getting all the blame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So grab your magic swords and your dragon-killing gear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to hunt dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon Hunting is an introductory scenario for Little Fears. In particular, it is an attempt to show how Little Fears can be run without any of the heavy issues that are normally associated with the game. Dragon Hunting is perfect for convincing new players to try out the game or as a break from a more serious campaign. Besides, it is based on the imagination of an actual three-year old. If Arianna can have hours of fun chasing dragons, then so should you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
