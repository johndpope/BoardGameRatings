			<description>I-Magi-Nation is a dungeon crawler that got created during the &amp;quot;my many monster dice game competition&amp;quot; held by Todd Sanders in August 2010.&lt;br/&gt;The task was, to create a game that uses mainly a couple of dice, that were permitted by Todd. Some of those dice are common, some are special dice, available from Flying Buffalo Inc&lt;br/&gt;The required common dice are:&lt;br/&gt;1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d12, 1d20&lt;br/&gt;The special dice are:&lt;br/&gt;1 complete set of monster dice&lt;br/&gt;3 trap dice in different colors (e.g. blue, green, red)&lt;br/&gt;1 corridor die&lt;br/&gt;1 treasure die&lt;br/&gt;Additionally to this, you will need some sheets of grid paper and a pencil to keep track of your stats and to draw the dungeon you are going to explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the rules are written in English, the game itself depends on symbols and numbers only, so it can be easily transfered into any other language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start the game by creating your character and equipping him with a weapon and armor of your choice. &lt;br/&gt;With your character you start on the first level of a dungeon and you have to reach the exit, which is 10 levels below.&lt;br/&gt;Between the start and the end points, there are going to be hordes of monsters to defeat, but hoards of treasure to loot, too.&lt;br/&gt;The dice will determine everything: What kind of dungeonsection you have found (a room, a corridor, ..), whether you have run into a trap and the kind of the trap, what monsters you will encounter (from a lowly rat up to a fierce dragon) and the kind of treasure you are going to loot (upgrades for your equipment, gold, jewelry or even scrolls with powerful spells on them).&lt;br/&gt;Combat is fast, deadly and - driven by dice, of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
