							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Illuminati Endgame 2012</name>
									
			<description>This game is about the historic struggle of the free peoples of the World against the control of the Illuminati.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two opposing teams in this game. On one side are the &amp;ldquo;Free Peoples&amp;rdquo; players who can only win or lose together. Their main goal is to survive. On the other side are the &amp;ldquo;Illuminati&amp;rdquo; players who must both the defeat the &amp;ldquo;Free Peoples&amp;rdquo; players and lastly also their team members to win the game individually. Illuminati players need to get as much power as possible. Nobody knows who belongs to which side at the start of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts up in a province and can then expand his civilization. He can also upgrade the technology level. At the end of each turn calamities may occur. A player gets &amp;quot;power points&amp;quot; which he can use for his actions or save his provinces from the effects of these calamities, so a player must strike a balance between these two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a tactical game with only a very small element of luck (the calamities at the end of each turn), so it becomes kind of like chess to plan your moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
