							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forgotten Heroes: Scythe and Shroud</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forgotten Heroes: Scythe and Shroud introduces death as a new power source for Fourth Edition characters. All of the four new character classes presented in this book draw upon the death power source: the assassin, deathwarden, necromancer, and spiritsworn may now be played in 4E games!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The assassin is a dedicated killer that relentlessly stalks his victim, waiting in the shadows for just the right moment to launch a deadly assault.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deathwarden is a sentinel on the boundary between life and death who uses his shield to make sure that, when trouble arrives, his friends and enemies each wind up on the right side of that boundary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The necromancer is a student of death and undeath who is at home with the grimmest tokens of mortality. His dark arts give him command of the entropic forces that blossom when death triumphs over life, as well as the negative energies that allow the dead to rise again and wreak vengeance on the living.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spiritsworn is an armored knight who fights on behalf of those who are no longer among the living. His relationship to the souls of the departed allows him to draw upon the spirits to aid his cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
