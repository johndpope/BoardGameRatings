			<description>This is a dexterity game with an unusual box. It is hinged on one side, and when opens, creates an extended lithographed playing field. The bottom of the box has a ramp starting at the hinge, and five scoring slots on the far side (worth 10, 20 and 50 points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns shooting marbles from the top end, over the ski jump and (hopefully) into one of the scoring slots. Player with the highest total score for six marbles wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was produced by the German publisher Klee, but the box says &amp;quot;Made in Bavaria&amp;quot; and bears the company's early &amp;quot;Clover&amp;quot; international logo (Klee is German for Clover). While undated, this certainly means it was published after Moritz Bromeisl joined the company in 1915 and began moving it into international markets, and probably between the end of WWI and the early 1920s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
