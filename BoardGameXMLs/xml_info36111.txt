			<description>A tactical boardgame set in the Battletech Universe. Each player controls a group of Battlemechs. The object of the game is to capture the opposing leader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on an 8x8 grid or chessboard. The game provides specifications for forty-two different Battlemechs. The statistics provided include hit points, movement, jump capability, and damage inflicted at close, medium and long range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player assembles a force of Battlemechs with up to 50 hit points. Movement and combat are governed by the cards. The players draw hands of cards from a common deck and card play determines when units may move, attack, or defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
