							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Mining Station</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The space mining station is an old and venerable institution,&lt;br/&gt;having provided valuable material resources to planetary civilization for decades. It&amp;rsquo;s never-ending mission is to strip the ores and minerals out of asteroids, moons, and dwarf planets alike. It is hard and often thankless work, taken for granted by those who can afford the goods only made possible by the tireless efforts of the miners. But the promise of decent pay is too much for so many who come from the lowest classes of planetside cultures, and those who yearn for a long vacation after their work is done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But all is not what it seems. There are three distinct cultures amongst the station&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants &amp;mdash; management, miners, and robots &amp;mdash; and they each have their own schemes and plans. Indeed, it is perhaps a miracle than any actual mining even gets done at all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
