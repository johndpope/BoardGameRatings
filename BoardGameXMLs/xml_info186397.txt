			<description>Kalyr - A GURPS Game World&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ancient kandar civilisation of Kalyr has stood for a thousand years, protected by the watchful eyes of the Guardians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now their long reign is threatened. The human slaves, kidnapped across the dimensions generations ago, tire of servitude and beginning to rebel. Beyond the lands of kandar rule, barbarian kingdoms descended from runaway slaves grow in strength. All the time. the long- running war with the mountain- dwelling zughru slowly wears them down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the decadent kandar cities, political, religious and guild factions scheme and plot as they have always done. The honour of the clan, and the status in the guild matter above all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wizards are worried. Some of their number have detected something strange happening with the fabric of space and time. Have the mirrors reopened? Will the horrors of ancient times return again?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The campaign world was developed primarily for GURPS but has also been adapted to FUDGE.  Both systems are fully supported by the setting.  A method for converting from GURPS to FUDGE also is provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
