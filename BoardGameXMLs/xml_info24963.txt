			<description>(Treasure of the Pirates)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are sport divers or deep sea divers who try to retrieve as many treasure from a sunken ship as possible by picking up small plastic parts with tweezers, not disturbing the octopus. This does not only sound like Operation - it actually has the same board layout but with other plastic parts (the heart for example is a golden crown here - the rubber band is referred to as a necklace, which strangely has to be put back(!) into its compartment) and of course another illustration (the patient's nose of Operation is one of the eyes of the octopus here).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not to be confused with the MB game &amp;quot;Sunken Treasure&amp;quot; of 1976, where the players had to pull metal coins from a similar board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
