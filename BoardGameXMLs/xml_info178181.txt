			<description>It is the year 2062. The NSP received a cordial invitation to join visiting extra terrestrial dignitaries for a cup of intergalactic java. The purpose was to embark upon a unique journey of friendship and shared knowledge. But as with all things sinister, it was simply too good to be true. The aliens, who called themselves Repondors, imprisoned a handful of animals on the mothership. After years of experimentation the animals escaped with one thing on their minds: escape and return to earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is simple, quick and full of fun strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
