			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Motorhead is a racing game first developed for the PlayStation by Digital Illusions CE (DICE) in 1998 and published by Gremlin Interactive in Europe &amp;amp; Fox Interactive for North America. The game was later released for Windows PC-CDROM and on the PlayStation Network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Motorhead is a moody arcade racing game set in quasi-futuristic urban environments. The cars available for play are reminiscent of  sports cars of the late 1990s. 10 cars are available to chose (three initially selectable, seven hidden) and eight courses, only two of which can be selected prior to unlocking. Modes include: time trial, single race, league play, a ghost mode and two player split-screen. Latter PC versions added 2 more cars and allowed the play of tracks in reverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Handling, while exaggerated, was more physics based than arcade racers of the time. Proper line and keeping the car on the edge of tire grip is rewarded with more speed through corners. However; speed loss for sliding and crashing is not greatly penalized either. There is no damage modeling of crashes for cars or environment. Steering wheel and force feedback support was added in the PC versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Music consists of 10 tracks of mostly electronic music, composed by the Swedish video game music composer Olof Gustafsson (also known as Blaizer). The lack of commentary audio was applauded by game critics as it enhanced the moody racing experience. Motorhead on Windows was one of the first racing games to adopt 3D sound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was nominated for the BAFTA Interactive award for &amp;quot;Best Computer Programming&amp;quot; in October 1998 and has so far sold more than one million copies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
