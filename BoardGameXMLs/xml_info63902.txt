							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Seven Civilizations</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Politics, economy, history, personalities, location ... every GM knows how challenging it is to balance all the elements that go into a good game world. In this book, we&amp;rsquo;ve collected seven separate, detailed, ready-made cultures that do the work for you. Each one is designed to fit easily into your game, and provides just enough hooks to entice your players to move right in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each entry talks about how the culture came to be, what forces shaped its development, and the current political situation. We provide a few examples of notable characters and places, as well as new rules to give the culture some extra surprises. We&amp;rsquo;ve also included detailed discussions about how to play a character from each culture, discussing outlook, opinions, naming conventions, and a host of other hints that will bring the society to life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
