							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Gulliver</name>
									
			<description>GURPS Gulliver is a rules expansion for GURPS 3rd Edition Revised covering the creation and scaling of creatures under that system.  From the website's introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;GULLIVER focuses on all things physical for characters: building and gaming life forms of any shape or size. It's the biggest expansion ever on that topic for GURPS (or maybe any RPG). Picture a GURPS Vehicles for creatures, with a good dose of biomechanical science as its base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It is not a single use-it-or-don't-use-it item. Not at all. It's a collection of independent and semi-independent rules additions. Many add detail and complexity. Some simplify GURPS and make it easier to play. Together, they create a more universal, generic rules set that works equally under extreme scales/situations and under normal human conditions. But you can pick as many or as few parts as you like, and mix and match as you please.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Topics in GULLIVER include, but are not limited to, the following:  Size, scaling and stats; shrinking and growing; ST and HT and HP and Fatigue and making them get along; natural encumbrance; weight vs mass; encumbrance on land, in water, in air, in space; powered vs unpowered flight; density and buoyancy; disadvantages and environment; gas bags and swim bladders and static lift; odd shapes and TH; fat and energy stores; bioluminescence and weird venom enhancements; all about thermal regulation; solution for &amp;quot;DR cheaper than HP&amp;quot;; new weaknesses and tolerances; skeletons, exoskeletons and invertebrates; movement and drag; every type of flight imaginable; airfoils, load ratings and other advanced wing design; grip and manual dexterity; new strikers; multiple brains; slime; antennae; deer and headlights; movement and resisting weight and fatigue; acceleration and deceleration; crawling and flopping; aquatic jumping; running takeoffs and too-fast landings; air brakes; microgravity movement; weight, and climbing; non-muscle jumping; jump angle, body position and distance; jumping speed, acceleration, air time, air resistance and escape velocity; one-handed, two-handed, and four-armed throws; throwing speed, angle, and running throws; baseball pitching and other sports throws; balance and off-balance; detailed Stealth modifiers; generic Extra Effort; target size, weapon size, Dodge, and TH; speed and range in melee combat; parrying massive attacks; size and shields and big attacks; size and weight and wrestling; pushes and slams; bear hugs and crushing; rending and amputation; weight and damage; physics-friendly judo throws; how to be saved by knockback; dealing with high AD; size and shock and damage; handling split HP; new collision and falling systems; size, poison and disease; cube-square effects and exposure hazards; light and dark; size, food requirements, and expected life span; make-your-own appendage builder system; life span meta system; scaling big and small games; size and supernormal abilities; tiny games; big games; bunny games; shrinking rays and enlargement spells; Somakinesis; underwater games; sample fantasy campaign background; sample aquatic campaign background.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
