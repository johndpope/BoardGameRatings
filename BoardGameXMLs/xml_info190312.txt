							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Professor Pleistocene</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prepare to face the Prehistoric Prowess of&amp;hellip; Professor Pleistocene!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 11 Rogue, Professor Pleistocene is a one-woman threat from a prehistoric era! Professor Pleistocene is an iconic character in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Pleistocene's file is designated &amp;quot;Gold&amp;quot; to denote that her powers are the result of external manipulation of some kind. Through a strange accident, the professor has gained the ability to absorb and imitate the properties of fossilized creatures! Now she seeks to continually expand her repertoire of abilities, &amp;lsquo;learning&amp;rsquo; new shapes to transform into and collecting raw materials for future transformations without regard to ownership or preservation. Her lack of concern for the scientific community may put her at odds with heroes who seek to preserve and protect the development of science. Her animal motif makes her a fun foe for heroes with hunting habits, or heroes who are animal-themed themselves. With each new form she learns, she becomes more dangerous, and soon will be a threat to everyone if the heroes don&amp;rsquo;t find a way to reign in her bestial impulses! Professor Pleistocene comes with stats and standees for four super-beasts she can transform into, all illustrated in full color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
