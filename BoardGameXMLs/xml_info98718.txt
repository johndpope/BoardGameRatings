			<description>One of four games in the Subbuteo racing series, which also included &amp;quot;Table Speedway&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Horse Racing&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Cycle Speedway.&amp;quot; All were dexterity games, designed by Peter Adolph, the inventor of Subbuteo. They used a ball bearing rolled down a tube to propel a Subbuteo style base around a racing track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version of the racing game was an attempt to simulate automobile racing. Like all games in the series, the rules were very similar to those of the parent game, but varied somewhat from those of &amp;quot;Table Speedway&amp;quot; in order to allow for the representation of the sport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to Peter Upton, the game variations were as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game was played with a minimum of two, and a maximum of six players. So there could be six cars on the track rather than just the four bikes in speedway. The number of cars is divided by the number of drivers (players), so 2 players get 3 cars each, 3 players get 2 cars each, or you could have 4, 5, or 6 players with a car each.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Drivers drew for positions on the start line. (although there is nothing to stop you from having qualifying laps)&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A race could consist of one or more laps.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The different size ball-bearings still signified different gear ratios, but drivers could select any one they wished at their turn. You were not limited to the one you started with&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
