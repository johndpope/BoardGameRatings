			<description>A trivia game where players collect colored stones for answering questions correctly.  The object of the game is to collect all colors of stones and move to the central square of the board (similar to Trivial Pursuit).  The four categories of trivia are: Parapsychology, Science, Theology, and Occult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four of the stone colors are collected by answering a question correctly of the appropriate color, you can only have one stone of each color.  The fifth stone (black), is special, there is only one of them.  It is collected by either moving your pawn to the center of the board, or stealing it from another player (by landing on the same board square as their pawn.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a &amp;quot;special rule&amp;quot; variant that allows players who have collected stones to use them after a six is rolled on the movement die.  Each color gives the player some kind of advantage (free movement, card skipping, etc).  As well, you get to keep the cards that you have answered correctly (though only one at a time), and use them in much the same way as you use the stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Why? This question has plagued humanity since... well... forever. It is what drives people and science to explain the unknown. While others embrace the unknown, some fear it... but that's why this is a GAME.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The X-Game combines current knowledge of our world into a fascinating combination of Science, Paranormal, Theology and the Occult trivia. The X-Game contains 1000 questions on 250 cards, 16 Power Stones, 4 Player Pieces, 4 Power Cards, 1 Black Power Stone, instructions and a fantastic playing board. Anywhere from 2 players can compete for the glory of winning (abducting) the Black Power Stone and the rest of the X-Game...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
