							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cheddar Challenge</name>
									
			<description>Cheddar Challenge is an abstract game of strategy and skill similar to Chess. Imagine simplified Klingon Chess. Each player has three categories of wedges. Sharp Cheddar, Medium Cheddar and Mild Cheddar. There are specific sizes, numbers of, movements and strengths for each category of wedge. Each category of piece has unique movement and strength. (For example the Mild Cheddar has the greatest number of pieces.) The goal of the game is to win by capturing all wedges comprising one of your opponent's three categories of cheddar. A player will lose if they lose one of their categories. The game is played on a rhombus shaped game board made up of triangluar cells. The theme is fun because its based on cheese and the shapes of cheese wedges. And its much easier to learn and less complicated than Chess or Klingon Chess and can be a great introduction to those games later on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
