			<description>The one of Japanese collectible card game that uses the Japanese anime art style. This game's art and theme is base on famous Japanese visual novels (PC games).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main concept of the game is letting the Character cards join the battle and deal damage to the opponent's Character cards. Knock down 3 of them or an Ace Character card to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card types in this game are&lt;br/&gt;Character card, Event card, Item card, Battle card and EX skill card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deck construction has 3 parts: Main deck, EX skill deck and an Ace character card. Each player must have at least 60 cards in main deck and a Character card (total 61 cards). Optional, each player may have up to 3 EX skill cards for EX skill deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike Magic: The Gathering, the Creature Cards in Magic: The Gathering have 2 values; Power value and Toughness value for attacking and defensing in the game. But in this game's Character cards have 5 values. Each value will be determine which is the Attacking Value or Defense Value by the Battle Cards. 5 Value are Force, Agility, Intelligence, Skill and Tranquility (This is unofficial translated.)&lt;br/&gt;Example, one of Battle card determines Force for attacking and Agility for defensing. In that battle, Force become attacking value (power) and Agility becomes defensing value (toughness).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The huge amount of tokens are necessary to play this game for counting a damage in each Character card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
