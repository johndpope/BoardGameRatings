			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adventurer&amp;rsquo;s Compendium: A Comprehensive Guide to Adventuring for Gold and Glory and how to Survive Long Enough to Enjoy It, 2nd Edition or more commonly For Gold &amp;amp; Glory (abbreviated FG&amp;amp;G) is a role-playing game fashioned after David &amp;ldquo;Zeb&amp;rdquo; Cook, Steve Winters, and Jon Pickens&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Fantasy Adventure Game, 2nd Edition&amp;rdquo; (hereafter referred to as 2E).  A simulacrum or &amp;ldquo;retroclone,&amp;rdquo; FG&amp;amp;G attempts to reproduce the original work under Open Game License allowing others to produce derivative work based on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the design goal for FG&amp;amp;G?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In short, to simulate 2E as closely as possible.  Material has been changed when clarification is needed or unfortunate design decisions were involved.  For example, druid spheres have been altered because important spells were missing for them.  Revisions have been made where the original material was vague or contradicted other sources: for example, the abstract rules for flying have been completely revamped to work without being completely GM fiat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What will be included in the final product?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FG&amp;amp;G will include practically everything from the player&amp;rsquo;s book and game master&amp;rsquo;s book plus over 100 monsters ranging from low to high experience value.  The optional rules were removed to avoid bloating the project: they will be released as a separate document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When will FG&amp;amp;G be finished and how much will it cost?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no projected release date yet for a finished version.  When it is finished it will be freely distributed online in editable .rtf format and .pdf format with hyperlinks.  A print-on-demand hardcover and softcover versions are being planned complete with art and extra material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This &amp;ldquo;Preview Edition&amp;rdquo; contains the final rules from the two rulebooks sans items and spells.  It represents a &amp;ldquo;complete&amp;rdquo; game provided you supplement magic and items.  As the spells, monsters, and items sections are finished they will be added to the PE until the game is finished entirely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
