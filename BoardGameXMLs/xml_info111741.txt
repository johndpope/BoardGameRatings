							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Unofficial Calvinball Mini-Game</name>
									
			<description>Other kids' games are all such a bore!&lt;br/&gt;They've gotta have rules and they gotta keep score!&lt;br/&gt;Calvinball is better by far!&lt;br/&gt;It's never the same! It's always bizarre!&lt;br/&gt;You don't need a team or a referee!&lt;br/&gt;You know that it's great, 'cause it's named after me!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;The Calvinball theme song&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Calvinball is a game played by the characters of the classic comic strip Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Calvinball is to round the circuit of bases in sequence while in the possession of the required Calvinball for each base.  One time successful around the bases wins the game.  Opponents will attempt to halt other Player&amp;rsquo;s advancement while simultaneously trying to reach their own sequential base with their Calvinball (it may or may not be the same ball).  Scattered around the field are trees, rocks, a stream, sports equipment and other items to hinder and assist players in their efforts to win the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
