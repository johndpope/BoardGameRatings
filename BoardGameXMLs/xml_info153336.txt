							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Parking Lot &amp; City Streets</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the title says, this is a parking lot surrounded by city streets.  There are cars parked in the parking lot as well as vehicles on the streets.  This map can be used with any modern gaming system, and would be useful with scenarios involving a shoot out in a parking lot or a fight that erupts after the players find something special in the trunks of one of these vehicles.  There are plenty of possibilities!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     80&amp;quot; x 80&amp;quot; in size.  That's nearly a 7' square map, bigger than most tables if printed in its entirety!&lt;br/&gt;     HEX and SQUARE grids for each type of map listed below.  Each one is sized to be 1&amp;quot; = 5' of gaming space.  A NO GRID option is available with both the full color and black and white versions if that's your thing.&lt;br/&gt;     Full Color Version &amp;ndash; This is a printer intensive, full color version of this map.&lt;br/&gt;     Black and White version &amp;ndash; A black and white version, meant to be the least printer intensive.&lt;br/&gt;     Plenty of modern day vehicles parked in the parking lot, giving your players options if they need to escape...so long as they can hotwire a vehicle, that is!&lt;br/&gt;     VTT map included for online players that prefer a smaller map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
