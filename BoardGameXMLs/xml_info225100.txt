							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The King&#039;s Will Extension</name>
									
			<description>The four extensions The New Buildings, The Fertile Land, The Fine Arts and The Bad Times can be played individually, all combined, or in any combination together with the basic game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New Buildings contains four new buildings(two green, two orange ones) which improve actions permanently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fertile Land consists of six fertile land terrain tiles for easier access to resources. Each peasant on these terrain tiles can harvest or exploit both resources if the action tiles harvesting or exploiting are chosen. These terrain tiles do not have building sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fine Arts add the four gemstone mines to the terrain tiles of the basic game and four new buildings to the other buildings. For these a player can get additional victory points according to the gemstones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bad Times consists of nine bad times tiles for experienced players. They offer new challenges as individual actions become temporarily worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
