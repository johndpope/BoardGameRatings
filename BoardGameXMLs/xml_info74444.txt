							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Outfit</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The Outfit is a squad-based action game built for Microsoft's Xbox 360, set within war ravaged Europe during the Second World War. The game combines squad-based combat and easy to use strategic gameplay elements with cinematic interludes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Outfit gives players the option to control three different squad leaders (voiced by Robert Patrick, Ron Perlman, and Terrence &amp;quot;T.C.&amp;quot; Carson), each with their own specific skills and abilities. Via the squad leaders, players are able to control a squad of battle-forged soldiers on missions based in highly destructible battlefields. By engaging in combat with the enemy, players earn &amp;quot;Field Units&amp;quot; (FUs) that can be used to order in &amp;quot;Destruction on Demand&amp;quot; to upgrade their arsenal, order in tanks and many other vehicles, build machine gun nests and anti-tank emplacements, or call for air or artillery strikes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game received mixed reviews. Reviewers mainly noted that although the developers intended for the game to be strategy-based, most of the game saw players driving a tank through a linear level, from point A to point B. Thus, the game was deemed strategy lite. Reviewers also noted that the on-foot sections of the game were dull and repetitive, but luckily could normally be avoided. The multiplayer aspect of the game received mixed reviews. Most reviewers noted that the multiplayer game was more strategy heavy, because the games sub par artificial intelligence was replaced by a human opponent. Besides the core gameplay, the graphics were also criticized. The game was praised for its draw distance, as huge amounts of a level were viewable at any given time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 12 single-player missions and Cooperative missions, and it supports online play with Microsoft's Xbox Live service. The Outfit is designed to play in high-definition (16:9 ratio) with Dolby Digital surround sound.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The_Outfit_(video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
