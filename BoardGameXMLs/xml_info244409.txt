							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arcana Western Reaches Source Book</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The realms of the west can be a prosperous place, rich in good farmlands and wild with game, but it is also a dangerous place with monsters and goblins lurking in deep woods and highland plains. The Western Reaches has a long history of prosperity, being one of the few places on Terival that has seen regular rule by wise kings and little war. Despite this, the lands have their share of troubles and political feuds. Being so close to the Magus' tower, the realms of the land are the playground and battlefields of the formidable Magi and others of great powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lands are composed of rich soil and rolling highlands, dotted with thick woods and deep rivers. The great city of Githmorgian acts as a center of culture for the region and also as a gateway to the riches of the merchant princes and their ships. While the northern arm of the territory is a wild place of centaur clans and goblins tribes, lost elven ruins and ancient magic, as one moves southward the rule of men rises and kingdoms flourish. As you reach the southern borders of the region, you look out over the great Grass Sea and the wilds of that untamed land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fully detailed overview of the western reaches, this source book is a must for fans of Arcana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
