The top fours card is turned over and put face-up in the middle of the table. The playing area is formed by 4 cards laid out 2x2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round, the player chooses one of the three cards in their hand and places it in the playing area. Then they pick up a new card from the pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One card cannot be put next to (vertically ou horizontally) a more powerful card: you cannot put a treasure next to a thief, or you cannot put a thief next to a vizier.&lt;br/&gt;If the card put down is adjacent to one or two weaker cards, the players wins the adjacent cards or pile of several cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the pack has all be taken and all cards held have been played, the game is over.
