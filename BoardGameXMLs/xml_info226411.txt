							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jetta D-1: World Travel Game</name>
									
			<description>Jetta D-1 World Travel Game is designed to teach geography. &lt;br/&gt; &amp;quot;Jetta&amp;quot; is a contraction of JET Travel Adventure.  In this game, each player chooses a travel itinerary that will take them around the world in a series of flights and places their airplane pawn on the world map board.  They then roll two dice repeatedly and add the totals until they reach the exact total required to move their pawn to the next city in their itinerary.  They record how many rolls it took.  The rules do not specify what to do if the roll total goes over the exact amount needed.  When each player has completed his or her itinerary, the player who rolled the dice the fewest times wins.  Players will learn the names and locations of cities as well as airport codes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
