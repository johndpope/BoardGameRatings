			<description>Due to overwhelming demand, this is a small set of 12 duplicate cards that are already in the game but with original artwork that was either a bit too terrifying, or a bit too racy for a PG rating. These are simply duplicates of existing cards but with slightly different art - they are not required for play. If you do purchase them you can either replace your existing copies with them, or just shuffle them into your games along with their existing counterparts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
