							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spawn: The Eternal</name>
									
			<description>Spawn: The Eternal is a video game developed and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation, based on the Spawn comic book series created by Todd McFarlane and produced by Image Comics. It was released on December 1, 1997 in North America, the same time the movie was released on VHS and received poor reviews from many notable game critics and fans. When played on a CD player, the disc would be revealed to contain a lengthy audio interview with Spawn creator Todd McFarlane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon release, Spawn was universally panned by critics and even fans to an extent. Most reviewers lauded its authenticity but were also exasperated at its poor graphics, camera angles and repetitive, button mashing gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Spawn: The Eternal,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
