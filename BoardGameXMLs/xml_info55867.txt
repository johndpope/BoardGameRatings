			<description>P.A.N.I.C. Studios presents:&lt;br/&gt;Zen and the Art of Mayhem&lt;br/&gt;The Anime Style Roleplaying Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;Zen and the Art of Mayhem is designed to be a toolkit role playing system. The core rules are presented as a simple base, fast and easy to use, which can be added to, allowing for different genre and settings to be created easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Creation system are fairly detailed allowing for construction of many different and detailed character types. Rules are presented for both a point buy and random generation. The core rules are designed for easy of use, and kept fairly simple for fast play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are built on 9 Stats, 3 Physical, 3 Mental, and 3 Presence&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Physical: Strength, Speed, Coordination&lt;br/&gt;    * Mental: Intelligence, Comprehension, Abstract Reason&lt;br/&gt;    * Presence: Appearance, Size, Cool&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All stats are ranked on a scale of 1-15; 1-2 Below Average, 3-4 Average, 5-6 Above Average, 6-7 exceptional, 8-9 outstanding, 10-12 unmatched, 13-15 unequaled. Stats can't be purchased over 10, to get any higher the character will need a talent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set up to be generic: able to be used in whatever genre the players and gamemaster wish. So the skills list provided is broken down into sub-genres, not all skills fit all games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules for equipment are fairly small and straight forward themselves. But the core rules includes a considerable list of items, or props as they are called, for many different genres from Fantasy, Modern Day, to Sci-Fi. Including clothing and armor, weapons, tools, personal effects, furniture and household items (including the kitchen sink), and vehicles for wagons to cars, to aircraft, to spaceships. Also included is a Tech Level system for ranking equipment and advancements for many different types of settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is handled in a cinematic method, where the description of the characters action will add bonuses to what they are attempting (within reason).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
