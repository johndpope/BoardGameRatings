							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Totems</name>
									
			<description>Totems is a new strategy game that is sure to become an international classic. It combines all the fun of strategy board games, matching games, and simple card games into one. If you enjoy Risk, Carcassonne, Stratego, war games, or even Uno or Solitaire, you will love the &amp;ldquo;easy-to-learn, hard-to-master&amp;rdquo; fun of this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to place carved animal pieces (totems) on the map in order to claim territories. Each turn you will place matching totems on adjacent territories to expand your control of the map. The player who conquers the most territories when the map is full, wins. A game of Totems can be finished super-quickly or slowly, depending on your skills and your approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game design is derived from the world-famous &amp;ldquo;4-Color Map Theorem&amp;rdquo; the first major theorem to be proved by the use of a computer. The randomness of the totems in your &amp;lsquo;hand&amp;rsquo;, the changing colors of the territories, the variety of the maps, and the cleverness of your opponents will all conspire to make each turn a fun and interesting challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
