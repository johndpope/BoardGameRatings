							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Savage Thunderbirds</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Thunderbirds is a ground breaking tv show produced in Britain in the mid 1960s by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. The show used Anderson&amp;rsquo;s trademark puppetry style, dubbed &amp;quot;Supermarionation&amp;quot; and is renowned for it&amp;rsquo;s relentless action, remarkable visuals and large explosions. Not to mention the cool vehicles. The show centres on International Rescue, an organisation founded by ex- astronaut Jeff Tracy, dedicated to using high-tech equipment to provide aid to those in need around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Savage Thunderbirds came about as a dare. In a break in our regular gaming schedule, I suggested to the group that I could use Savage Worlds to create an adventure in any setting they cared to mention. I got off lightly,they chose Thunderbirds and this document is the result. It is by no means a complete sourcebook for this wonderful show but it allowed me to run some fun sessions and hopefully may encourage you to do the same, or at the very least check out this great show if you&amp;rsquo;ve not seen it before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
