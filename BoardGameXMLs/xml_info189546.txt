			<description>Genimo is a game of skill that gives you and your opponent the chance to show off your vocabulary. Designed for two players, children or adults, Genimo tests your ability to locate and identify your opponent's word on a special numbered game sheet before he discovers yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of instructions as well as two pads of pages on which to write your word, and according to the instructions, it comes with two &amp;quot;lead pencils.&amp;quot; In the first stage of the game, the player must determine where their opponent has put the word, like a simplified Battleship game. The second stage plays like Hangman, with the player guessing letters so they can figure out their opponent's word.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
