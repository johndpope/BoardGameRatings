							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">America&#039;s Army 3</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Adapted America's Army 3 uses the Unreal 3 Engine and introduces changes to how a player manages their account. Despite America's Army 3 being from an entirely new game engine there are still a number of similarities between America's Army and America's Army 3 which includes similar training and reproductions of the maps Bridge crossing and Pipeline. This version is said to put emphasis on graphical performance and graphical flexibility to cover a greater range of PCs as well as decreased file size for the full version download. The game features fictional weapons for the enemy as opposed to the Soviet and Warsaw Pact based weapons used in the previous versions.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;America's_Army,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
