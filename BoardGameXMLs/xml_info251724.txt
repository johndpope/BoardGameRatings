			<description>In Galaxy Wrestling Federation, you need to overcome opponents so that you can win championship belts and win the entire event, but you have only a small hand of moves that you can make, so manage them well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives a hand of ten wrestling cards and one victory card; each wrestling card has a strength value on it as well as an opposing value that it overcomes. On a player's turn, they choose an opponent who doesn't have the most cards on the table in front of them and challenges them to a bout of either strength or speed. Each player chooses a card in hand, then reveals them simultaneously. If your card overcomes the value that your opponent played, then you win the bout automatically &amp;mdash; unless you each overcame the other's number, in which case the bout is a tie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If no one overcame the other, then you compare the values of the cards themselves. In a strength bout, whoever played the higher value wins; in a speed bout, the lower value wins; in a tie, the bout is a tie. If a single player played their victory card, then they automatically win &amp;mdash; unless the other player did the same, in which case you tie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the bout returns their victorious card to hand (except for the victory card, which is a one-shot effect), while the loser places their card face up on the table in front of them. The winner receives a championship belt token, then the next player in clockwise order chooses an opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a bout, before both players reveal their cards, they count to three, and while they're doing this, a third player can interrupt by playing one card against one of the cards in the bout. If the interrupting player overcomes that player's card, they win the bout and receive a championship belt token, returning that card to hand. If they don't overcome the card, they place their card face up on the table, then the bout resumes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one player has three pairs of card values face up in front of themselves (e.g., 1/1/2/2/3/3), then the game ends. This player loses, and whoever has the most championship belt tokens wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
