However, a string of disappearances has struck the club recently. The Palm Canyon Country Club Committee has been able to keep these events quiet, but word got out recently after the disappearance of a famous professional golfer. Since then the Palm Canyon Country Club has told personnel and golfers to get on the links after sunrise and leave before sunset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The disappearance of the professional golfer has brought the story to the attention of Maya Ohya, a Los Angeles reporter. She has arrived at the Palm Canyon Country Club to interview golfers while looking for clues to the disappearance scheduling the slowest golfer, Todd Martin for the last interview. Notoriously calculated golfer Todd Martin golfs until sunset followed by nervous caddy Michael Aiken who needs the golfer&amp;rsquo;s punch card to get paid. Meanwhile greenskeeper Bill Webb investigates increasing problems with the golf course and greens. This brings them all to the eighteenth hole just as the sun begins to fade from view (continued inside).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
