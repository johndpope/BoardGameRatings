							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Old Frontiers Core Rule Book</name>
									
			<description>From the RPG description here on RPGGeek:&lt;br/&gt;Old Frontiers is an exciting pen and paper role-playing game set far in the future after a long dark age during which interstellar travel was impossible.The dark age has passed and three planets have rediscovered interstellar travel and are currently re-exploring the remnants of Humanity's once vast empire. It is a universe filled with peril, be it from mounting international tensions, domestic problems, or from the regular personal drama of every day life in a rapidly changing society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your players may be explorers searching for fun and profit on alien worlds, or members of their planet's military or government trying to thwart an interplanetary espionage ring, or perhaps just regular people who get caught up in the turbulence of the times. The core book contains the OF d12 system, character creation rules and setting information on the three core planets of Old Frontiers: the noble world of Eir, the mercantile world of Ballingschap and the theocratic world Nven.  Each of the three worlds has its own distinct history and culture from which to draw story ideas and on which to base your characters.  The rules emphasise fast pace action with an emphasis on player creativity and role-playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
