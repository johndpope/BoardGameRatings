			<description>&amp;quot;From the back of the box (Atari 2600 release):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our charming &amp;quot;Mad Bomber&amp;quot; really doesn't mean any harm.  It's just that he loves nothing better than to drop his bombs and watch them explode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only you can stop him.  As he tosses his bombs, you race to douse their fuses with your buckets of water.  The more bombs that splash in your buckets, the more points you score.  But, the more points you score, the faster the bombs drop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miss a bomb, and you'll learn how Kaboom! got its name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's a true test of stamina, reflexes and concentration--Kaboom! by Activision.  Simply spellbinding!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Kaboom! is an Atari 2600 game designed by Larry Kaplan and published by Activision  in 1981. It was also released for the Atari 5200 and the Atari 8-bit family of computers. A 16-bit remake for the Super Nintendo was in the works at some point, but the game was never released.[1]  In the late 1990s, a keychain version of the game was created by Tiger Electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay in Kaboom! consists of using a paddle controller to catch bombs dropped by the &amp;quot;Mad Bomber&amp;quot; with a set of three buckets. Points are scored for every bomb caught, extra buckets (maximum of three) are awarded at every 1,000 points, and one bucket is lost every time a bomb is missed. As the game progresses, the &amp;quot;Mad Bomber&amp;quot; traverses the top of the screen much more erratically, dropping bombs at increasingly higher speeds, making each of the seven higher levels more difficult.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Kaboom!_(video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
