			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerous events have led up to this point. From the time he was released from military service - five years and an entire star system away - Rorian Deevergh has amassed a group of people, some of whom he can even call friends, who are collectivly hunted by the authorities.  And in a world where all transactions are relayed to a central authority which automatically logs and ID's everything from the purchase of a fuel stick to the destruction of a planetary system, that can create problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As for Rorian's gang of fugitives, they found just one way around the problem. Killing for a price and without recourse was a job in which they all excelled and one that allowed them to retain at least a comfortable style of living. Payment in rare metals. No questions.  If you live, that's your business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the surface, this was just a normal job.  The patron funding the current operation will probably remain unknown, but the mission brief suggested that this particular mission would be a piece of cake.  The political implications of the mission were glossed over - they were motivated by money, not politics. The payment, half up front, half on completion, was regular.  Nothing seemed out of the ordinary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only thing that aroused curiosity was the destination.  A backwater planet called Graveyard.  The name aroused some faint disturbance in Rorian's memory.  But what the hell, so did most names he heard nowadays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
