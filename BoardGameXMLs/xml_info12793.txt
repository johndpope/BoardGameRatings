			<description>Beck Designs' Watergate features a struggle to eliminate all of your rivals by amassing incriminating evidence against them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a team of five aides and one chief. Starting from the safety of their own headquarters, these teams move themselves or their rivals according to increments indicated on Motion Cards. When armed with sufficient points of evidence, a team can move to a space occupied by a rival piece, exhibit the incriminating revelations, and thus capture the rival. The object of the game is to be the last player eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the designer, only about 1,000 copies of this game were produced... and only about half that number sold. Some of the remaining back stock was procured by the AGPC (Association of Game and Puzzle Collectors) and given away as mementos of their 2002 convention in the Washington, D.C. area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
