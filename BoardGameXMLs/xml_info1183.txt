			<description>A hike in the Australian Outback&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must construct the landscape. Roll out the board and place the bits on the board. Advanced players may add other objects, like dry moss, other animals, or stranger things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player projects themselves into the game board in a spot. He imagines himself in that position at a certain facing. The object is to report his position on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He does not speak but instead draws a sketch of what he sees on the notepad. The sketch is marked with his name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sketches are all then turned up. Each player takes the little maps of the game board and locates each player on the map. Also draw an arrow to indicate the facing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speed is good. The first player to slap his guess face down gets bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
