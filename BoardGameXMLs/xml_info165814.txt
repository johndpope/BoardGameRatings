			<description>From the introduction to the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Muse is a storytelling game where players collaborate and compete with each other to tell an enjoyable story. Before starting, players will brainstorm a Story Sheet upon which the story will be based. Players will generate Questions that will be answered as the story unfolds. Next, players will take turns narrating the story, with play passing from one player to the next in clockwise order. No-one knows in advance how the Questions will be answered, so the story's twists and turns are an exciting mystery to everyone. The game ends when the story's Crisis Question is answered in a final Showdown. The winners get to tell the story's Epilogue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
