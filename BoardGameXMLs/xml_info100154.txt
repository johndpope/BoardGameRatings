			<description>&amp;ldquo;Companions&amp;rdquo; is a fantasy-themed RPG taking place in the immersive world of &amp;ldquo;Altland&amp;rdquo; where your party of four heroes set out to fight the evil god Detexx and his minions. Altland is a fantasy world where the old races of Dwarfs and Elves live in harmony with the younger races of Humans and Minotaur&amp;rsquo;s. At your disposal in your party you have a Minotaur, a Dwarf, an Elf Maiden and a Human Mage, and every character has different and unique skills and abilities. For example, the Dwarf is best utilized in building structures such as scythe towers or spike pits, while the Minotaur character is better suited for hand-to-hand combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Companions&amp;rdquo; begins after 300 years of peace between the races. The dark god Detexx and his evil minions are hard at work trying to cause an all-out war in the otherwise peaceful lands of Altland. Your companions begin their adventure in the catacombs of Mentzel and will quickly become acquainted with the evil doings of the high-priest of Detexx, who solved riddles that unveiled the secrets needed to unleash the &amp;ldquo;Hordes of Nether&amp;rdquo; into the world. Pursued by the undead and cultists your party of four have to learn to trust each other in order to survive, and you will need strategy, stamina, strength and clever use of each character to fight off the constant attacks of the undead and demons. Are you brave and strong enough to restore peace to the lands of Altland once more?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10+ hour Campaign mode (with one party combination!)&lt;br/&gt;Unique and intriguing story&lt;br/&gt;4 races, each with 3 classes&lt;br/&gt;40+ skills to learn&lt;br/&gt;100+ items to collect &amp;amp; 30+ unique&lt;br/&gt;41 Achievements&lt;br/&gt;3 maps featuring leader-boards&lt;br/&gt;Tactical Pause (20 or 60 seconds)&lt;br/&gt;Philosophical pest zombies&lt;br/&gt;Massive oversized dragon&lt;br/&gt;3 difficulty settings&lt;br/&gt;GameCenter Support&lt;br/&gt;OpenFeint Integration&lt;br/&gt;Available in English &amp;amp; German&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
