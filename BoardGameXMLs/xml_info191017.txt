			<description>Players are sentient dice that are evolving and battling at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dice Mutants: Evolution Battle is a dice drafting game.  At the beginning of a round, all the dice in the game are rolled and then players take turns claiming one of the available dice.  The dice players draft are then assigned to improve their attack, defense, guile, mutation, and speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every round, each Dice Mutant attacks every other Dice Mutant. Once a player has lost all their life points, they are out of the game.  Last player left alive is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
