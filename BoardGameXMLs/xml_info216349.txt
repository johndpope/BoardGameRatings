			<description>Each player has 10 playing pieces: 4 combat aircraft, 3 strategic bombers, 3 anti-aircraft artillery (Flak). The combat aircraft moves 4 spaces along straigt or curved lines the Bombers moves 3 spaces. The Flak moves 2 spaces only along straight lines. Only the planes are allowed to move over friendly playing pieces. Movement is permitted in all directions. Directions can be changed in mid-movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemy pieces are destroyed by moving onto spaces from where they can be hit by weapons fire. Firing range is the same as moving range. So an enemy plane is hit, if the attacker could reach the targets space in the next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game, a player has to move 3 of his pieces into the enemy base (Fliegerhorst) or destroy all enemy pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box cover shows a biplane with a swastika; but the use of biplanes suggest that there may be an earlier version, perhaps from World War I. The second biplane shows either a neutral or a british roundel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
