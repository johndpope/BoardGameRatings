			<description>Terra Shrinka is a cooperative dam-building survival game for 1-4 players.  Terra Shrinka has a unique lunar tide system that controls the water and will erode the island if you don't work together to scout out the island, gather resources, and build dams fast enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE STORY SO FAR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a South Pacific flight your plane is struck by lighting and makes an emergency landing on a small desert island.  The good news is that everyone survived the landing, the bad news is that the tides are rising and the island is flooding.  It's up to the brave passengers to step forward and bring order to the chaos.  You survived the crash, now can you survive the flood?  The very earth is shrinking around you!  Can you dam the flood?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE OBJECTIVE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dam the flood by creating an unbroken chain of dams from one board edge to the other and protect the crash-site in the process!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW THE GAME PLAYS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with the board taking its turn. The board&amp;rsquo;s turn is broken into five phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Move Moon Tracker&lt;br/&gt;2. Add Flood Cube(s)&lt;br/&gt;3. Roll Moon Die that matches current Moon Phase&lt;br/&gt;4. Draw card if &amp;ldquo;N&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; is rolled.&lt;br/&gt;5. Move Flood water and resolve damage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the water does a good job of destroying board squares, it is the players&amp;rsquo; turn. Each player starts with their Team Leader in the Crash Site. During the players&amp;rsquo; turn, they do the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Explore and Move&lt;br/&gt;2. Create&lt;br/&gt;3. Transfer&lt;br/&gt;4. Set Dams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a starting character. Are you the ren-faire blacksmith, or are you the bag lady? No matter whom, it is each team&amp;rsquo;s job to explore this uncharted little island. The survivors find food to bribe more recruits off the plane. They make networks of people to transfer gathered goods. And finally, they create and set dams to stop the water. This requires lots of communication and teamwork to protect your Crash Site and stop the water from spreading any more. If your Crash Site is destroyed, you lose. Otherwise, keep track of how many squares were destroyed when you finally blocked off the flood and try to do better next time. There are additional scenarios to add replay value and ensure that you want to come back for more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
