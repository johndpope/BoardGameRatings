			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guild of the Fallen is an adventure dice worker placement racing game where players lead guilds of adventurers seeking vengeance for their fallen heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spirits of past heroes linger in the guild halls until their revenge is secured. These spirits can inhabit the bodies of novice adventurers to share their knowledge and abilities.  The first player to defeat their guilds nemesis wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with each player getting a random nemesis quest which is kept secret. Players then proceed to draft their guilds starting hero spirits. Players are given a number of dice relative to the hero types drafted. There are four types of dice used which are distinguished by their colors: red for Might, blue for Magic, white for Faith, and black for Deceit.  The dice will act as the novice adventurers and can be used as &amp;lsquo;workers&amp;rsquo; to activate various spaces on the board. They can also be used to activate the hero spirit cards, enabling hero abilities while on an adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventures must be completed in order to unlock access to a player's nemesis, which would be their final quest to win the game.  Each adventure can be attempted by multiple players and will likely help more than one player get closer to unlocking their quest.  An adventure consists of staged pattern matching from dice rolls and any augmentations from heroes or items to complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a single resource in the game called essence. Essence can be acquired from successful adventures and be used to unlock hero abilities, gain new heroes, and to purchase or upgrade equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nemesis quest will need to be completed solo and will require a lot of preparation and some luck to defeat. Similar to adventures, the quests will consist of more difficult pattern matching from dice rolls and various augmentations. Be the first to complete your nemesis quest and earn the honor that your guilds fallen heroes deserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
