			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fan-created mission for Orpheus.&lt;br/&gt; From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MISSION TYPE: Fumigation / Intelligence Gathering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LOCATION: Eastern Airlines jetliners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fourteen months ago, Eastern Airlines Flight 411 from Miami to New York crashed into the Florida Everglades just miles from the Miami International Airport, moments after takeoff. The Boeing MD-90 jetliner was carrying 142 people, 97 of whom were killed during the crash, including the entire crew. Quick-response emergency crews pulled the survivors from the flaming wreckage of the smouldering plane. The story made the rounds in the papers for a few days, but given that Boeing quickly attributed Flight 411's fall from the sky to minor design faults that could be quickly corrected, the incident blew over remarkably quickly. In the aftermath, Eastern Airlines managed to quietly salvage most of the plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since that time, however, there have been a steadily increasing number of hauntings and supernatural occurrences on Eastern Airlines flights across the eastern U.S. seaboard. Passengers and crew of no less than fifteen Eastern Airlines flights have reported ghostly apparitions and 'disappearing' figures on board planes, most (but not all) of which originated out of Miami International Airport. Most of the incidents have been fairly benign, but as of late have been growing increasingly belligerent and violent. Two months ago a meal cart being pushed by a stewardess was apparently physically lifted out of the aisle by unseen hands and flung at the stewardess, delivering her a major concussion. Last week, Flight 1173 from Miami International to Boston was forced to make an emergency landing in Roanoke, Virginia after a ghostly apparition materialised on board mid-flight, terrorising and attacking passengers and crew members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the Flight 1173 incident, Eastern Airlines has approached Orpheus to deal with the problem, hopefully as quietly as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
