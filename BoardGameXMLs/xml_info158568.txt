			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh bumpers!  The animals have escaped from the Safari Park!  Only one has stayed behind.  Work together to help Wilson, Brewster and Koko travel around Chuggington as they pick up the remaining animals.  Discover who decided to stay with Mtambo in the Safari Park.  Guess correctly and you're a winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A children's game based on the Chuggington series.  This is a cross between a spin-and-move and a very simple Clue type guessing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8 animals are in Safari Park.  They are tuned face down so no one knows which is which.  One animal is marked as the Mystery Animal and will remain unseen until guessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns spinning the dial then moving the appropriate train the spun number of spaces.  If a train lands on a station it picks-up one animal from Safari Park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn he can guess the Mystery Animal to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
