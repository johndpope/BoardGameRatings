			<description>We are Approaching the limit...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It started as we were leaving the mall. Tom had seemed tense all evening, and walking to the car he kept looking over his shoulder. Then as we were driving across the dark parking lot, I saw three men in dark suits run for another car.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Let's get out of here!&amp;quot; He yelled as he pulled a bug gun out of his jacket and leaned out the window.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Where did you get that?&amp;quot; I demanded. But soon I had something more important to worry about. One of the men ran into the path of the car. I slammed on the brakes but it was too late - the impact sent him up onto the windshield. Then I saw his face. Blind milk-white eyes seemed to stare at me out of a face that was part metal, part rotting flesh. He opened his mouth, exposing rows of gleaming steel teeth and a long blue tongue. Then he smashed his fist through the windshield and reached for my throat. Tome fired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legions of Darkness is a background supplement to the roleplaying game Kult. It contains more information about the illusion we inhabit, the reality we can sometimes glimpse, and the creatures and dark organizations which keep humanity captive. Archons, Angels of Death and Lictors are described in great detail, and a number of new cults and creatures introduced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Legions of Darkness gives you information about some twenty cults and organizations, maps of their headquarters and meeting places, and descriptions of more than a hundred people, gods and monstrous creatures who inhabit the world of Kult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our Reality Will Be Destroyed and the Truth Revealed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
