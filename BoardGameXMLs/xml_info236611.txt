			<description>A One-Round Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What a grueling month it has been! You have done nothing but work, work, work to please your benevolent master Pharsea. Not that you begrudge him the labor. He's a kindly old man who took you under his wing and gave you all the honor of studying magic. It's just that you have had very little time for yourselves. Everyday has been nothing but reading, writing and reference work. Even the little magic you have practiced has grown stale. The constant repetition, though necessary, has become tedious. But today all that will change. Your exams are over and you have earned a day off!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
