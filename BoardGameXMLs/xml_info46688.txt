			<description>Every year the ostriches gather for a big race across Australia. But the race in the wilderness is not easy: our competitors are often the prey of the feared dingo who wants to catch them. Will you escape the dingo and reach the finish line?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crazy Dingo is a card game where each player controls ostriches who participate in the race. Your goal is to move your ostrich as quickly as possible to reach the finish ahead of the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All means are allowed, including sending the dingo to steal feathers from other competitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content: &lt;br/&gt;6 tables representing Australian regions&lt;br/&gt;90 cards&lt;br/&gt;6 figurines &lt;br/&gt;rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
