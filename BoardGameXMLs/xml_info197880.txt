			<description>Windlands is an action adventure in the vein of Shadow Of The Colossus and Zelda, but adapted for VR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes advantage of the Oculus Rift technology to make you feel like a superhero as you make huge jumps, swing in the air by the grappling hook and walk along narrow ledges. It is all about movement, exploration and mastering your skills on the way to the final epic battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The essential elements of the gameplay are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Freedom of Movement&lt;br/&gt;    Exploration&lt;br/&gt;    Fighting Gigantic Bosses&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play as the last automaton created in a desperate attempt to fight war machines and end the war. The goal is to find and destroy the source powering all the golems. Your adventure starts from a hub where you choose a destination. Each destination level is themed so you will find yourself in a different environment every time: in a desert, underground, on a flying island, in a ruined town, etc.  Your goal is to explore the level and find your way to the level boss. After defeating it, you will collect an item for the final fight. Once you are heroically done with all the level bosses, use all the collected items to unlock the ultimate battle for the future of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Core mechanics:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Grappling Hook - These are essentially your arms. Except 30 meters long :)&lt;br/&gt;    Super Jump - Gather speed and jump across vast expanses.&lt;br/&gt;    Wall Jump - Use to reach impossible heights jumping from wall to wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
