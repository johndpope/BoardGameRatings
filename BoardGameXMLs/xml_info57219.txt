							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">3D Risk</name>
									
			<description>A game leaning on the mechanics of risk, although with slightly different rules.&lt;br/&gt;The project developed out of our love for the original game, so we made it a hybrid of StarTrek 3D chess and Risk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entire game was built on a wooden door (cut in the center, so it can be packed up and taken on travels), and several planetary systems (each with planets and different continents and countries on them). The planets were built on wooden platforms an connected to the base-plate via wooden pegs. The game was handcrafted, and hand-painted, all the cards, rules, and names were invented for the occasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The army pieces were made from broomsticks (round pieces), and the others by sawing rectangular rods. Rocks were glued to the surface of the board and elevations were made from insulation foam. Electric illumination from toy railroads were added later, the pictures added here are from the candle - sun phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If players were eliminated, they received the ability to control a non-player character, who would occupy a certain space (i.e. planetary system) that could not be reached by any player, and could continue harassing the best players.&lt;br/&gt;Army pieces were allowed to move so long as they successfully conquered a new territory, making the game travel fast, and allowing boxed-in plaers to quickly gain territory on their round. Refreshments (new armies) were doled out on two methods (agreed upon in advance). Once, with more and more armies each time, and one depending on what the player offered the non-player characters (in terms of cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It never left this conceptual design phase, but allowed us several years of extreme gaming fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
