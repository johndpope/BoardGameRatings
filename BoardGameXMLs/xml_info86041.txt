			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eden Blues is an arcade adventure game designed by Patrick Dublanchet, with graphics by Catherine Vagnon and Michel Rho, and music by Philippe Ulrich. Robots have taken over the planet and gotten rid of the human population. The only survivor is held prisoner in a high security prison, his goal is to escape his cell, find a way out of the building and rescue the last woman of earth, who he hears singing somewhere in the prison every night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The character is defined by three stats: strength, courage and vitality. Strength is used for breaking down doors, courage is used to scare the robotic guardians, and vitality is the life energy of the character. Each of these stats can be replenished by finding the appropriate item (food, drinks and coffee). Time is an important gameplay element, as some robots are only active during the day, others during the night. Players must carefully explore the prison, keeping notes on patrol routes, places where items are stored, and safe places to rest while awaiting the next day or night period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
