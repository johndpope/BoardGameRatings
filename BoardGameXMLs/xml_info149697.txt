							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fourplay Checkers</name>
									
			<description>An adaptation of Checkers for 3 or 4 players, Fourplay uses a 10 x 10 grid of squares for its board, with four corners of four squares each left off.  A border surrounds the central 6 x 6 &amp;quot;Field.&amp;quot;  The outer portions of the board are called &amp;quot;Bases.&amp;quot;  There are four colors of pieces; each player begins with 6 each and places them on the dark squares of their base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays essentially the same as English Draughts, but with a few differences.  Once players move into the Field, they may not move back into their own or any other player's Base, unless it is as part of a multiple jump that ends back in the Field.  Once a piece is in the Field, it moves as a promoted piece, in any direction.  Captures are compulsory, and a player's own pieces may be captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variations are provided, either for last-man-standing victory conditions, or for scoring points.  Also a more challenging variation called &amp;quot;DUBL-CHEKRS&amp;quot; is described.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board itself is reversible, with a standard 8 x 8 checkerboard on the reverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board and instructions feature small diagrams of variations of the Fourplay board, with larger Base areas; it is unknown if the game was ever published with these alternate boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
