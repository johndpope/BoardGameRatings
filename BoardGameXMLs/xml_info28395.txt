			<description>The Candy Land DVD game brings new excitement to the classic board game, with music, animation, and several classic characters brought to the TV screen. This game is for 2-4 players of Ages 3 - 6 - it includes one DVD, 20 gingerbread tokens and 24 floor mats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three separate games and some music videos. &amp;quot;King Candy&amp;rsquo;s Adventure Game&amp;quot; is a color-matching game with movement similar to the board game; &amp;quot;Mr. Mint Says&amp;quot; is a game of following directions (like Simon Says); and the Grandma Nut game is a themed version of musical chairs. Youngsters will get up and move around as they try to perform the various tasks and collect gingerbread tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
