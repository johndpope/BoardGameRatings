							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yellow Magic (D20)</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some worlds, Magic may not be seen as a force in and of itself. In some philosophies, magic can not be classed by types of effect, like Evocation, Illusion or Abjuration. Instead, it might be seen as a result of fundamental aspects of arcane metaphysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One such theory holds that all magic is a result of the principles of Colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yellow is the colour of health, vivacity and passion. It represents the power of life to survive, thrive and increase. Those with mastery over Yellow magic are powerful healers, easily the match of clerics, but using study, reason and arcane magic to evoke their effects instead of faith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those that focus on healing mind and body, studying how to best blend practical doctoring with arcane magic might become Physicians. These specialists in yellow magic learn to heal wounds, cure diseases, even raise the dead, with only arcane power and their bare hands. Should the need arise, the hands of a Healer can also be used to harm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this product:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    3 new Clerical or Mystical domains &lt;br/&gt;    a linked reclassification of one twelfth of the spells of the players handbook, with some new spell effects to fit the spells into Chromatic Magic Theory &lt;br/&gt;    a whole new character class, the Physician. This spellcaster is a powerful healer and user of Yellow magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
