							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Moose&#039;s Dossier of Heroes and Villains</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Hello, friend. I've seen what you and your fellow adventurers have done out in the world and I think you and I think alike. It seems like you could use a bit of foreknowledge to help you on your path, so here's some information I've gleaned over the years. Trust me, its better to know about the groups you are bound to encounter in the world than be caught off guard.&amp;quot; ~Moose Hound, legendary spy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pugmire is a large world full of bands of heroes and legions of villains who can change its destiny in a heartbeat.  Told from the perspective of Moose Hound, the legendary spy, this guide helps provide examples and inspiration of dogs that can threaten your players or provide them with aid against other threats. This guide contains within:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    An ancient order of pauper knights who believe in doing their best to save the world even if it means giving their lives to do so.&lt;br/&gt;    The Brimstone Lodge, a group of scientists and mages dedicated to achieving power through ruthlessness and any means necessary. &lt;br/&gt;    Crews of pirates who roam the Acid Seas in hope of plunder and plastic to line their hulls.&lt;br/&gt;    A group of survivalists who hope to keep ancient ways alive while exploring the vastness of nature. &lt;br/&gt;    And more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
