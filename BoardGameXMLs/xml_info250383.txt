			<description>Quester Party is a hybrid co-op fantasy card game with fast paced adventure and uncommon style. Build a party of six questers among the five legendary codes of Mutra complete with Power Orbs and special items. Give those quest cards a good shuffle and your journey will begin. Take turns as the leader revealing quest cards, collecting as many cards as you can to lock the overall win in the end. Pool your Power Orbs to defeat the foes you encounter along the way. To earn the sweet taste of victory with the group win, you must hunt down and defeat 3 of the Bosses&amp;mdash;Get both for the win win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the way you will need to use your path finding and questers' abilities to locate and wield powerful artifacts to boost your party&amp;rsquo;s strength. Quester Party features 108 different cards and with a randomized setup, each quest will bring something new to your table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With approachable gameplay Quester Party is quick to pick up for 1-6 players (more if you get creative). The game features artwork by the game designer Matt Kirsch in Stevens Point, WI who also directs the fantasy paddling event PaddleQuest.&lt;br/&gt;Join the party!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player wins, or everyone loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
