			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lord of the Dice is a simple, easy to play fantasy roleplaying game. It is specifically geared to those people who wish to join this fascinating hobby without having to learn extremely complicated rules, and is also challenging enough to interest the veteran roleplayer. The Player assumes the role of an adventurer in a fantasy world, and allows his persona to merge with that of the character. Creativity is necessary to this game; the more fertile the Player's imagination, the better the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note: In case you're wondering about the incongruity of an HTML version with a 1979 date, this game was originally published in a Chaosium magazine.  It is now found on the web for free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
