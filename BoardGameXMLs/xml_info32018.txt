			<description>Hullabaloo the Game of Observation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players wager on winning three rounds of observation activities using pictures of cluttered junk.  In Eyespy the players look for items that the Game Boss has chosen.  The first player to find each of the three objects wins double his wager.  In Scrutiny the players look at a picture card for a minute and then answer questions that the Game Boss asks about the picture.  In Detection the Game boss picks out an item and writes several clues for the other players to use to determine that object.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
