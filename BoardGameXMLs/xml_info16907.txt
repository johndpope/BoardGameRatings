			<description>In &amp;quot;Pol-A-Tics&amp;quot;, each player is assigned a platform of seven different issues that shows which position their candidate has taken on each issue. As with many election games, players choose a game duration prior to the start of game play. When that time has expired, players determine the popular vote winner in each state to allocate the electoral votes. Unlike actual elections, however, a tie in the popular vote for a state results in a split of that state's electoral votes, and the player with the most electoral votes is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
