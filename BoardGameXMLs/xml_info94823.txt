If the player can answer the question correctly then that player scores and gets another turn. if the player fails to give the correct answer then the other players are given a chance to answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first to get ten answers has answered the $64,000 question correctly to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game only contains ninety six questions so it has limited play value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
