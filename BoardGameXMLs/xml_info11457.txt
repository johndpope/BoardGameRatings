							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vortex</name>
									
			<description>A whirlwind game of survival! A game where every move threatens to draw you deeper into the depths of the Vortex. A totally new concept in board game design that will provide hours of fun and entertainment for every member of the family. All players start in the Vortex (center of the board) with their 4 pawns and make their way through the many waves to the outer circle! Objective: Move all your pawns safely into your Life Rafts before your opponents can send you back to the Vortex, to start over again! A game of strategy and excitement with every move! EQUIPMENT: 1 Playing board, 1 die, 6 sets of colored pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
