			<description>Big Box Office &amp;quot;The Movie Business Game!&amp;quot; lets you become the Producer, Director, Writer and Agent of a Big Box Office Hollywood movie!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you arrive in Hollywood, you first go to work.  After you make $10,000 you enter the main playing board.  As you move your token around the board, you accumulate &amp;quot;Industry Title Rings,&amp;quot; such as Black for Producer, Red for Director, Blue for Writer and Green for Agent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you go around the board, you accumulate &amp;quot;Movie Titles&amp;quot; when you enter the theatre where the movie is playing.  You enter the theatre and multiply your profits depending on how many &amp;quot;Industry Title Rings&amp;quot; you have on your token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other squares have &amp;quot;Pick Director (or other industry title) Card.&amp;quot;  These cards direct you to other areas of the board, which can be good or bad, depending on which &amp;quot;Movie Titles&amp;quot; you have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also land on a &amp;quot;Spin the Wheel&amp;quot; square.  This wheel will either give or take away your industry title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first person to make $1,000,000 wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
