							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadows in Focus: Sioux Nation - Starving the Masses</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Half-Step from Chaos&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there&amp;rsquo;s anything shadowrunners have learned over and over again, it&amp;rsquo;s that the veneer of civilization coating much of the world is extremely thin (in the Barrens, of course, it&amp;rsquo;s non-existent). There are so many tensions in the Sixth World that altering the delicate balances just a hair or two can bring chaos and conflict to areas that had previously managed to scrape together a peaceful appearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to cause that chaos, all that&amp;rsquo;s needed is a little gentle pressure on one of the essential arteries that keeps civilization alive. And no artery is as susceptible to this pressure as the food supply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stripped of a lucrative position and exiled from his family, Theo Two-Hearts has a score to settle, and he&amp;rsquo;s going to take it out on the entire Sioux Nation. Like many vengeance-minded people before him, he&amp;rsquo;s turned to shadowrunners to do his dirty work. If they sign on to his plan, they&amp;rsquo;re going to confront some of the toughest forces the Sioux Nation can throw at them. The first bit of chaos they create will rain down on them&amp;mdash;if they survive, much more will follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starving the Masses is an adventure that is part of the Shadows in Focus: Sioux Nation series for Shadowrun, Fifth Edition. It can be played alone, or the Sioux Nation and Cheyenne books can be used to add more richness and details to a challenging run!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
