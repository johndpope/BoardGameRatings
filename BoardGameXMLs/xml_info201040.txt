							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gregory Loses His Clock</name>
									
			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Settling down for a good night's sleep, our hero Gregory finds his alarm clock, pops it on top of the chest of drawers and clambers into bed for a restoring regime of kip. The first few zeds have hardly escaped our Greg's sleeping lips when a naughty ghost intervenes, stealing Greg's timepiece. And this ghostie is really wicked - it breaks the clock into five pieces and scatters them around four weird Dreamscape locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However will our hero manage to wake up in the morning? Greg's got an important day at work ahead of him. Thanks to that bad spook, Greg will never, ever wake up to reality unless he can retrieve the parts of his clock and get them to the nice old horologist (clock mender to the likes of ordinary folk).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you might imagine, time is of the essence. Greg has only three game-hours in which to complete each section of the quest and restore order to his world. So this game is played against the clock as well as for it...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Programmed by Don Priestly&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
