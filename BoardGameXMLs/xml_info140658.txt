			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dank dungeon cell as getting boring, as well as disgusting, and since rescue didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be coming, Mopsy Segalle decided to liberate herself. A few minutes of effort and straining muscles, and she was free of the straight jacket, and just in time too; she was sure the coarse sackcloth was going to give her just the worst rash. A few more moments of work with one of her hair pins, and the steel chains binding her ankles fell away. Now to get out of this cell! Pressing herself against the bars, Mopsy just had to wait a few more minutes for one of the brainwashed cultists to pass by on one of his regular patrols. The masked cultist&amp;rsquo;s dark brown robes couldn&amp;rsquo;t conceal his shock at seeing the beautiful girl standing there, free, and the befuddled thug was even more confused when she gestured seductively towards him. This 4 page PDF is an easy-to-integrate PC class and just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern Neo-Pulp setting and campaign world including Haven: City of Bronze.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
