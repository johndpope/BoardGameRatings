							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dragon&#039;s Wish</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for characters of 9th-12th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As your party comes over the rise of the hill, the dragon comes into view beneath you: A massive golden body, lying in sharp contrast amidst the tall emerald grass beneath a small grove of trees. Although its blood flows from a plethora of wounds and the mighty muscles that line its sides heave slowly with labored breathing, you see that there is a majesty about this creature that remains even as it struggles with the slow spiral of death. At your cautious approach the dragon's flickering lids fly open, and you find yourself suddenly staring into eyes whose unfathomable depths betray the great age of history that lies behind them. A voice that was once melodious and deep rasps forth with sounds that will soon become a death rattle:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You must help me... I know you to be heroes. Know me to be Al'theirean'il'hariad'el'theron. In this, my final hour, I must beg your aid. I ask you to take your sword and pierce me here.&amp;quot; His jagged claw points to his breast. &amp;quot;Take my heart. Carry it to the Hall of Dragons, wherein lie the hearts of all my kin. Do this and you shall be rewarded by the Keepers of the Hall.&amp;quot; A keening wail of mortal pain echoes through the grove, and then the dragon speaks his final words: &amp;quot;Please. Grant my dying wish.&amp;quot; And then the light is gone from those noble, gold-streaked orbs... And all is silent within the grove.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
