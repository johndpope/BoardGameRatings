							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pipes</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arlo is a hard-working plumber, but a touch absent-minded.  He's building a water supply system for the whole neighborhood, and he really has his hands full.  Help Arlo decide what kind of pipe to buy and where to put it... his limited budget doesn't leave him much margin for error.  Figure out the shortest, most economical way to get everyone hooked up... and just hope poor Arlo has remembered to open and close the right valves.  A marvelously entertaining and challenging exercise in planning, economics, and spatial relationships for all ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
