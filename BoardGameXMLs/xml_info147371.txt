							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wedding Planners Cortex Plus</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the War, some folks chose a side and others pitted the Alliance and the Independents against each other for fun and profit. Well, mostly profit. Enter Templeton Steele, a powerful weapons designer whose bride-to-be is none other than the lovely Liliana Fairchild. Now, on account of these two lovebirds getting hitched, you and your crew are hired to transport Lilly to a fancy ship called the Rim&amp;rsquo;s Dream. Sounds easy enough, right? Unite the happy couple and they'll get paid? Only thing is, this Princess ain't exactly happy about the wedding. The more you find out, the worse this job gets &amp;ndash; and the less chance you have of getting paid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wedding Planners is presented by Margaret Weis with art by Kurt Komoda. This Episode is part of the Echoes of War role-playing adventure series, which is centered on a common theme: the Unification War. Echoes of War adventures are compatible with the Firefly Role-Playing Game and all subsequent releases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version of Wedding Planners employs the Cortex Plus game system and requires the Serenity Crew, which is sold separately. The Firefly Role-Playing Game is based on the hit television series by Fox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This release was first featured in Gaming in the 'Verse: Gen Con 2013 Exclusive. This title is the stand-alone version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
