							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dora the Explorer Block Game</name>
									
			<description>A tower building block game consisting of 48 wooden blocks (similar to Jenga) with two methods of play specifically for children.  Designed for Ages 3 - 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In one game you remove the blocks one by one from the tower and watch it tremble and eventually fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the other, three of the blocks are stamped with pictures of Backpack, Map and Boots, characters from Dora the Explorer.  Mix them up in the tower and try to find them by pulling out blocks without causing the tower to tumble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
