							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spheres of Might</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's so much more to martial combat than swinging a sword, and so much more to martial characters than waiting for the next fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spheres of Might is a brand new approach to building martial characters in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. From the makers of Spheres of Power, Spheres of Might changes combat into a cinematic experience, replacing boring, repetitive combats with tactical decisions, dynamic exchanges, and a host of options that let martial characters be as fun to play outside of combat as they are inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this book, you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    8 New Classes &amp;mdash; including the armiger, the blacksmith, the commander, the conscript, the scholar, the sentinel, the striker, and the technician.&lt;br/&gt;    23 Combat Spheres &amp;mdash; granting a host of new abilities based on concept, including alchemy, athletics, barrage, barroom, beastmastery, berserker, boxing, brute, dual wielding, duelist, equipment, fencing, gladiator, guardian, lancer, open hand, scoundrel, scout, shield, sniper, trap, warleader, and wrestler.&lt;br/&gt;    Full Archetype Support &amp;mdash; both for new classes and old classes, giving a breadth of new options for creating and enjoying martial play.&lt;br/&gt;    Legendary Talents &amp;mdash; for when games deserve to become truly epic, legendary talents allow games to reach beyond the gritty to truly mythical proportions, including leaping mountains, stealing skills, and bending armies of monsters to your will through sheer force of personality.&lt;br/&gt;    Non-Magic Support &amp;mdash; with the help of the scholar's knowledge, the blacksmith's skills, and the technician's inventions, Spheres of Might gives a variety of options to facilitate games with little or no magic at all, greatly expanding the stories that can be told with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game without requiring extensive re-balancing.&lt;br/&gt;    GM Support &amp;mdash; including monsters from CR 1-21, along with guidelines for making the most of cinematic combat and the Spheres of Might system in your games.&lt;br/&gt;    NPCs for every new class to spark ideas or drop into a game.&lt;br/&gt;    Starfinder Conversion &amp;mdash; giving you the information needed to adapt the system to Starfinder rules.&lt;br/&gt;    And much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
