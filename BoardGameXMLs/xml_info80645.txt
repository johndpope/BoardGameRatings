			<description>Chinese Paladin 3 is an action role-playing game developed by Taiwan's Softstar Entertainment, and a sequel to The Legend of Sword and Fairy 2, even though its story setting is before that of The Legend of Sword and Fairy. Set in ancient China, the game is based on the Wuxia genre with elements of fantasy. Characters' stats are measured in Jing (精), Qi (氣) and Shen (神). Jing refers to health points; Qi is the energy points required to perform special moves; Shen refers to magic points. The concept of the five elements (Fire, Water, Lightning, Wind and Earth; works in a similar way as the Wu Xing in Chinese philosophy) is also applied in the game. Each of the five protagonists have a special attribute based on one of the elements and can use special powers (Xianshu) of their respective elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Chinese Paladin 3&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
