			<description>Arpaa Turup is a four-player plain trick taking card game from Somalia, played in partnerships, whose name means &amp;quot;Four [packs of] Cards&amp;quot;. No doubt it is so called because it is played with a 144-card pack made up four identical 36-card packs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards in this game are dealt in batch of three. After the player sitting on the dealer's left gets the first three cards, the dealing is stopped and this player, having looked at his cards, calls the trump suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As usual the highest trump, or if none are played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick.  The winner of each trick leads to the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning the game and the match&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game each partnership counts the tricks they have taken. The game is won by the party which takes more tricks. To win the match, a partnership must win two games, without losing any games in between them, the number of tricks taken in the second game they win being more than in the first game they win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
