							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (Game Boy)</name>
									
			<description>The Game Boy version is a side-scrolling action game with five levels, each consisting of two segments. In the first segment, the player will control one of the five original Power Rangers as they fight the Putty Patrollers throughout the stage in order to reach their goal. The player can switch between a standard punch attack or a Power Weapon attack that will gradually consume their life gauge when used. When the player reaches the end of the level, they will control Megazord and fight a giant monster. Like the rangers, the Megazord can switch a regular sword attack and a lightning bolt sword attack that will consume a great portion of the life gauge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
