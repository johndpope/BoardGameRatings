							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Collider Cards</name>
									
			<description>This is a brand new concept for traditional card games. In this game, the cards are colorful particles and the table top is an active collider slamming them into each other for the betterment of science. Experimental patterns called Waveforms are placed into the collider in an attempt to break them down into readable samples. Depending on the strength of the collisions you might get the harmonization of a perfect sample, or the particles might cause an explosion, scattering random particles around the collider and possibly ending the experiment too early.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game comes with rules for both solitaire and multiplayer games for up to four players. Both versions of the game play very similarly. At the beginning of the game you pick a Waveform, which is a pattern of face up and face down cards played to the table. At the beginning of a player's turn they play one card from their hand by placing it face up onto the table. Once the card is played, the collider engine begins to run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collider engine is a set of rules that cause the cards on the table to interact. The highest numbered card located at the bottom of the Waveform will search for the lowest numbered card it can interact with (based on suit). If it finds one, it will pull that lowest numbered card to itself and they will merge into a new number (by adding their numbers together), then one of four different reactions will occur based on that new number. Once that reaction is done, the collider engine begins searching for another possible interaction, and keeps doing so until there are none left, which ends the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players score points by collecting cards based on some of the possible reactions. In the solitaire game the object is to score well while trying to clear all of the cards from the Waveform. The multiplayer version is all about getting the highest score through multiple rounds of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
