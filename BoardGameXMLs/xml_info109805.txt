			<description>Inevitably, when Steven Spielberg, the King of Cinema (whose love for the Spiel is hidden in his name) invites us to relive an adventure of Tintin on the big screen, no one is surprised that the character known to all also appears in a brand new board game, only months before the release of the 2011 movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adventures of Tintin - The official game is a cooperative game where players act as Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock or Dupont and Dupond and go on an adventure. Search through the mythical places of &amp;quot;Adventures of Tintin and the Secret of the Unicorn.&amp;quot; You must pass a number of missions in the 4 corners of the world: the big escape, combats against pirates, a motorcycle chase - many challenges wait for you, each of them on different boards and using cards for the events. Will you be able to discover the secret of the Unicorn?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game, which is said to be very faithful to the film and the spirit of the character created by Herg&amp;eacute;, is edited by M6 Interactions and distributed by Tactic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
