			<description>Elemental is a strategic board game of simultaneous action and hidden information. Players assume control of either the light mage or the dark mage and control 7 elementals in a duel. The elementals--water, fire, earth, wind, frost, bolt, and light/dark--interact in a 5-way rock-paper-scissors system. Each of them is equally strong, given the right circumstances. The goal of the game is simple: either defeat or isolate your opponent's light/dark elemental.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trick is that you can only find out your opponent's pieces by battle or deduction. Each player will be trying to gather information while cutting losses and revealing as little as possible. Elementals can sustain 2 hits, allowing players to take calculated risks and control an area with a bluffed piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arena itself plays into the deduction process with its fountains (which provide tantalizing bonuses for matching elementals) and its energy wells (which generate crystals for special one-time maneuvers). Once the player has deduced their opponent&amp;rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses, they can take command of the arena and lead their elementals to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Print and Play is available here: Elemental Print and Play&lt;br/&gt;Note that the print and play is meant to convert an old set of checkers and 2 D6. As such, the lightning elemental is not included in this version, as that would require 4 more pieces than the standard checkers set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
