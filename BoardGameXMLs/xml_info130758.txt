			<description>From the back cover&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for Ellis: Kingdom in Turmoil&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kingdom of Ellis is in Turmoil. Good King Heinrich, who ruled for sixty years, is dead, and his three sons are now willing to go to war to see who will inherit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the midst of this chaos, the small monastery of St. Ascelin's wants nothing more than to stay out of trouble. To remain a sanctuary of peace and tranquility. To continue worshiping Halek as they always have. To be overlooked by the larger world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;St. Ascelin's, however, is a wealthy place, patronized by the old King. Their old abbot has passed on to his eternal reward and a replacement has been chosen. The new abbot would wield all that wealth and power and would be a lord in his own right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outside world has come to St. Ascelin's&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new abbot, a wayward countess and a mysterious knight have now come to the monastery, only to find it leaderless and in strife. Mysterious strangers stalk the nearby forest. A depressed and ineffective lord is only barely able to maintain order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters are thrown into this tumult where they are charged to make order out of chaos and find the truth hidden by a monastery full of lies in order to discover...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;... The Mystery at the Monastery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is for 3-5 players and is compatible with any fantasy roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
