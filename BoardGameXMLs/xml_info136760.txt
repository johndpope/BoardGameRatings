			<description>Website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Hey folks! The incorrigible-yet-awesome G-Man (an unrepentant Jupiter lover, but that&amp;rsquo;s a topic for a different discussion) has done it again! Behold (by which I mean &amp;ldquo;download&amp;rdquo;) the majesty that is his latest Hyborian adventure for Barbarians of Lemuria: Ghosts of Acheron !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, you pissed off the Picts. Next, you made friends (or perhaps enemies) with a strange sorcerer. Now you&amp;rsquo;re at the bottom of a burial pit and facing the unknown. Who do you think you are? Some dude who&amp;rsquo;s destined to be King of Aquilonia? Well, whoever you are, picture your story being illustrated by John Buscema in a late 70s issue of Savage Sword as you play through this adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the adventure itself, G-Man provides us with some nifty treasures in Appendix B and a complete party of pregenerated characters in Appendix C, to help you dive right in to the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what are you waiting for, people? Download Ghosts of Acheron now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;This pulp-fantasy scenario is set in Howard's Hyborian Age and comes with setting-appropriate pregenerated characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
