							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Golden Goal: Olympic Soccer</name>
									
			<description>Following on the tradition of the TCS games dedicated to other olympic sports (Water polo, basketball,field and ice hockey), Golden goal is a fast and easy to play statistical replay game on Soccer, featuring all the Soccer tournaments, both male and female, from the early olympics onward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is easy: both teams are rated for attack and defense, you compare the factors and roll a die to see how many goals each team scored. But there are random factors, incarnated by &amp;quot;third die&amp;quot;, a random die roll that may have strong effects on the initial factors. &lt;br/&gt;A tournament may be completed in less than an hour&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
