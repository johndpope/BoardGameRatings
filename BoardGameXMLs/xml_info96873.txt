							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ravenwood Fair</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player gains possession of the tree-filled land of Ravenwood and is tasked with clearing the land and setting up a fair in time for the upcoming royal wedding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ravenwood Fair is a social, casual online game. Tasks expend character energy, which regenerates slowly, and the player slowly levels through clearing trees, defeating monsters, purchasing buildings, games and decorations for the fair, and completing quests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can add 'neighbors' (other players, each playing on their own Ravenwood map) and can visit their fairs, trade gifts, assist in tasks, or simply in order to meet certain quest conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
