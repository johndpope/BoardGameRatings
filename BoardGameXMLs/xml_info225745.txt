							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Firearms &amp; Margarine</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Murder in the City of Lights!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a prominent leader in the Faerie labor movement is struck down by an assassin&amp;rsquo;s Cold Iron bullet it falls to the Dramatic Characters to find the culprit. Who could possibly have committed such a dastardly crime?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Was it the owner of the margarine factory the labor movement was protesting?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or perhaps the underground anarchist organization known as the Commune?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or might it have been a head of police, frustrated at his inability to quell the demonstrations?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators must work quickly to solve the case before chaos erupts upon the streets of Paris or, worse, a war between human and Faeries spreads like wildfire across New Europa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Firearms &amp;amp; Margarine is an Adventure Entertainment in the form of a mystery and suitable for any Castle Falkenstein game. Also included are a new subspecies of Brownie, known as the Teuz, who are native to France and pre-created Dramatic Characters for those Hosts who wish to skip character creation and move onto solving the mystery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
