							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Invisible College</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Theus created the world and left it to us to discover.  Do you think the proclamations of a few torch-wielding fanatics can change that?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;     - Goskelen Leman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Inquisition has launched a war against learning. All across Th&amp;eacute;ah, it hunts down scholars with ruthless abandon, burning and destroying anything it perceives as a threat. Decades of advancement have vanished in a single bonfire, while brilliant men and women are murdered in the night for daring to speak the truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But some fight back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a thousand hiding places, the Invisible College continues its forbidden studies. Separated by vast distances, ensconced in the deepest hiding places, its members continue the struggle for learning and enlightenment. From their experiments, Th&amp;eacute;an science advances. From their teachings, countless mysteries have been solved. From their courage and daring, the people understand the world around them... and learn that tyranny can be defied. The Inquisitors believe they hold the keys to human knowledge; the Invisible College is here to prove them wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Invisible College includes:&lt;br/&gt;-A detailed history and background of the College, including prominent members, secretive protocols, and the organization's most closely-held secrets.&lt;br/&gt;-New Advantages, Skills, and Backgrounds, a new Swordsman school, and rules for the sinister alchemical art of Blood Science.&lt;br/&gt;-New rules for creating Inventions, plus a list of new gadgets for use by your Heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
