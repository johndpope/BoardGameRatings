			<description>Game Chef 2012 Finalist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subtitle: A Game of Letters and Monsters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;First of all, thanks for your attention. This is Epistolary, a game meant to create a playing experience that mimics an epistolary novel&amp;hellip; that is to say, a story which is told entirely in the form of letters, newspaper articles, and other found documents. The most obvious comparison is Bram Stoker&amp;rsquo;s Dracula, of which this is an obvious pastiche. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read it, you probably should.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few notes before I begin; this game is set a hundred years in the past, and the gamebook is written in character, as an epistolary guide which posits to come from the same general time. Being epistolary, it&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily written in the most coherent or chronological fashion&amp;hellip; please, give it a chance and read it through before you dismiss it as incomprehensible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
