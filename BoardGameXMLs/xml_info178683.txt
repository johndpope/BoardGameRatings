							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Uglydoll: Babo&#039;s Cookies</name>
									
			<description>The Crazy Snatch-the-Cookies Card Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No cookie jar is left unemptied when Babo's around, so when he opens the jar you've got to be quick to snatch a cookie before they're all gone. Join Babo and the rest of the Uglydolls in this crazy card-passing, cookie-snatching game. Collect 4 matching Uglys and you can snatch a cookie. Too slow? Well... you can eat the crumbs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the only player who has not collected 5 Crumb Tokens. The game is played in rounds, passing cards quickly from player to player. In each round, you try to collect 4-of-a-kind of a particular Uglydoll and be the quickest to grab a cookie from the middle before they&amp;rsquo;re all gone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
