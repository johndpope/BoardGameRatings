			<description>The object of this track game is to be the first player to move each of his or her 6 space ships from Earth to another planet. On your turn you spin the spinner and advance a ship the number of spaces indicated. When you reach a planet, you must &amp;quot;orbit&amp;quot; it by following the track arrows around it. If you land on a space marked with a red triangle, you may leave orbit and head for another planet through the connecting path. If you stop on a space with a ship pictured, you may land on the planet. If you land on an opponent's ship, you send that ship back to earth. The first player to land all 6 of his or her ships on 6 different planets is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
