							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MINT 400 Off Road Game</name>
									
			<description>During the first phase of the game, the players roll and move on the outer part of the board, getting their trucks, coupons, and spare parts.  After using the coupons to pay the &amp;quot;entrance fee&amp;quot;, they begin doing a pre-determined amount of laps on the inner part of the board.  The more laps that were chosen, the more spare parts that will be needed to complete the laps.  There are also &amp;quot;good news&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;bad news&amp;quot; squares on the outer and inner board, which act as random events.  The player who completes all the laps, or makes the most number of laps, wins.  The rules book also contains more info on off-road racing and contains driver profiles on Parnelli Jones, Team MacPherson (Jerry McDonald, Jeff MacPherson, adn Joe MacPherson), John Baker, Walker Evans, Ivan Stewart, and Kjell Eriksson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
