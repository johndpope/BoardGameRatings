			<description>Embark on a journey as you develop new settlements and race to become the largest town. If you enjoy exploration and resource trading games, you'll love MicroWorld. As you move around the beautifully illustrated game board, you build cabins, churches, blacksmiths, trading posts, mills, fortresses, storehouses, and more. The larger your cities become, the more you are able to accomplish because each building gives your city a special benefit. Whether you enjoy building an empire passively through farming and logging, or furiously through war and pillaging others, this game lets up to six players be who they want to be and that's what makes it such a great game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(The above description is based on text from the publisher's website:  &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.biglittlegames.com/microworld.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.biglittlegames.com/microworld.php&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    website no longer active&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
