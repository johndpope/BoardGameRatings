							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Urizen the Bleak Lord</name>
									
			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;URIZEN, THE BLEAK LORD - A DEATH KNIGHT (CLASS BY SUPER GENIUS GAMES); CR 6, 14 and 19!&lt;br/&gt; A horrifying new Infamous Adversary for the Pathfinder RPG!&lt;br/&gt; Towering in an ancient suit of cold blue-black plate, Urizen stands immobile and impassive.  Sharp, icy wind cuts around him like a tornado of razor blades, and yet he only stares ahead with blazing blue energy where he once had eyes.  Those same eyes once belonged to the living, and now only gaze to the future, to a time when the world is swallowed by ice and he rules upon a throne of bones.&lt;br/&gt; Infamous Adversaries contains: one chilling ready-to-use villain, complete with equipment, a rich background including motives, history, personality, network, resources, lair, tactics, morale, advancement options, a quote, plot hooks to easily insert them into your campaign, local lore, full color art and a vibrant description. The Infamous Adversaries characters are campaign-worthy villains designed to challenge an entire party; not just in combat, but also through less direct methods requiring careful planning and confrontation.&lt;br/&gt; Contained within is many pages of original TPK content including a full depiction of our Infamous Adversary, plus original short fiction, several supporting cast characters and monsters, plus our personally designed Hero Lab files for use in customizing our characters and content in your campaigns!  This even includes Hero Lab files for the Death Knight class and a foreward by the creator of the Death Knight class, Owen K. C. Stephens, of Super Genius Games!    &lt;br/&gt; Give your players a reason to hate again. You can blame it on us...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
