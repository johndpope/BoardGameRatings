							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle for Hoth</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Battle between Rebels &amp;amp; Imperial troops on the Icy World of Hoth. Takes place in the Star Wars Universe. Each figure represents a hero, vehicle or unit of troops. Victory: The Rebels win if they destroy all the AT-AT Walkers. The Empire wins if they destroy the Ion Cannon &amp;amp; the Shield Generators.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on an 8x8 grid or chessboard. Miniatures or counters are used to represent the combatants. The Rebel force consists of Luke in Speeder (becomes Luke on Foot if hit), Shield Generator, Ion Cannon, five Snow Speeders, two Laser Turrets, and six Rebel Troop Units. The Empire force consists of four AT-AT Walkers, two AT-AT Scouts, two Probe Droids, two Heavy Blaster Teams, and six Snow Troopers. Each unit is rated for movement distance and attack range. The players draw a hand of cards from a common deck and card play determines when units may move or attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
