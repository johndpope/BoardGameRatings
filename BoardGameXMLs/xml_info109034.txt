			<description>from the Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What This Book Is About&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This booklet is about OD&amp;amp;D, as it is played when I run the game. When  I talk about &amp;quot;OD&amp;amp;D,&amp;quot; I'm referring to Original Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons  (published in 1974), which included three booklets: Men &amp;amp; Magic,  Monsters &amp;amp; Treasure, and The Underworld &amp;amp; Wilderness Adventures.  There were multiple rules supplements released for OD&amp;amp;D, including  Greyhawk, Blackmoor, Eldritch Wizardy, and Gods, Demi-gods, &amp;amp;  Heroes. There is also Swords &amp;amp; Spells, a set of miniature rules based  on D&amp;amp;D and Chainmail. Lastly, I consider the Holmes Basic Set as a  close relation of the OD&amp;amp;D family. My personal OD&amp;amp;D game consists of  rules from the three brown books, plus house-rules (i.e. I'm not using  many rules from the supplements). It also owes a great deal to Meepo's  Holmes Companion, which got me started down the OD&amp;amp;D path. I hope  the thoughts on this page will be helpful to someone that is thinking  about running an OD&amp;amp;D game. There's also a link to my B4 Lost City  campaign log on the web, at:  &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.philotomy.com/lost_city.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.philotomy.com/lost_city.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
