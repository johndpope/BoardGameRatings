Most things are available from the website but we are more than happy go through any questions you might have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've spent the winter looking at how the first event went and taken on board all of the feedback we received. As a result, you should see some improvements and less sleepless nights for our staff!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have made some amendments to our rules guide. You will find a list of the changes from version 1.02 to version 1.1. on our website. In addition, if you attended the first event, you should have received your first event downtime results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have been to a Hicks with Sticks event before then you will know all about the evening meal and licensed bar. The serving and opening times are in this guide and please remember your Saturday night meal is included in your ticket price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our continuing aim is to offer you an entertaining live role-playing experience that makes you want to come back for more. To this end, we are open to new ideas and the re-examination of some of the accepted conventions of live role-playing. For us this is a continual learning experience, so please do feel you can talk to us about any aspect of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thank you for your support and trust in us, hopefully we can provide you with a great event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
