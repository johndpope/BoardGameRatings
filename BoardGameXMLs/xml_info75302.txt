			<description>Palavra Final is an exciting game, on every word, and every card. You spin the wheel, play, and start to create you sentence, from the first word. Everybody starts the game with 10 cards and the objective to achieve the victory is to discard all your cards, but to do this you have to keep an eye on the sequence: It has to be logical.&lt;br/&gt;Each turn every player spin the wheel and do whats it's written.&lt;br/&gt;It could be to drop a card, drop a closed card, give two of your cards to another opponent, challenge another player if the sequence makes sense, without the risk of taking all cards to you, change two cards, put a card between others that are already on a sentence, or the most excite option, put a card on any blank space, but when the sentence gets there it has to be logical. And if you don't agree with your opponent you can challenge him to explain the sentence. You can conjugate the verb in diferent ways to make sense, but if the other players don't agree you take all the cards from the board, but if you can explain to them and they accept the opponent that challenges you take all the cards. The first one to discard the last card wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
