			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bow Before the Master of Magnetism!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A potent meta, with the powers of magnetism, Jakob used his powers in his youth to hunt down and destroy the Nazis who had destroyed his family. During those years, he made an enemy of the Horde, and a friend of Dean Donovan Shepherd. Together, they founded the Meta Commune.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many years later, after the US Government was revealed to be using metas as soldiers, Jakob, as Polarity, renamed the commune New Avalon and declared it a sovereign nation who was now at war with not only the United States, but also any who supported their policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iconic Legends. Because sometimes you a need a character everyone knows, even if they're meeting them for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
