			<description>A pachisi variant.  Each player has four named pieces, the Horse, Rider, Child and Dog.  As usual in pachisi the object is to get all four pieces around the circular track and &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; to the center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique feature of the game is that on a turn each player rolls two dice and moves any two pieces.  There are &amp;quot;obstacles&amp;quot; on the course, and the Horse and Rider must cross each obstacle on the same turn, as must the Child and Dog.  If a player's Horse and Rider, or Child and Dog, occupy the same space then they form a &amp;quot;block&amp;quot; which opposing pieces may not pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
