			<description>Fotball is a tactical boardgame for two players (teams), where knowledge of real football can determine the outcome. The game comes with two sets of rules, one for junior players (minimal football knowledge) and one for senior players (with good football knowledge). Each team choses their play system, for example 5-4-1 or 4-4-2, and many of the real football situations and techniques do occur in this game, like dribbling, tackling, throw-ins, offside and yellow and red cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
