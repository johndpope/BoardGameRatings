			<description>Johari is a world famous jewelry market in Jaipur, so naturally in the game Johari you and your fellow players will try to buy and sell gems in order to come out tops on the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lasts ten days, with players taking three actions each day. At the start of each day, the market is seeded with new gems, gold and prestige cards, with the stores holding only items of the same type and bazaar booths holding whatever comes to them. A new noble visits the market each day, offering a special power to whoever wants to pay for the privilege, with his price dropping each day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses one of the seven action cards in hand, then they resolve them in order of who has the most gold. They then do this twice more, getting discounts now for the cost of taking certain actions. The action cards let you earn gold, take all the cards from one store or bazaar booth, hire a noble, swap gems, protect yourself for inspections in case you have fake gems, copy your previously played action, or (most important of all) sell gems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to points from nobles and prestige cards, most of your score will come from gems that you sell &amp;mdash; but you need to sell the right gems in the right way. When selling to a jeweler, you need to sell four different types of gems (or three types and gold), but you score only for one of the gem cards sold; when selling to a collector, you sell gems of only one type, but you have to hold the most gems of that type and you score only the difference between what you hold and what the player with the secondmost gems of this type holds. Status matters in the collector community!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever has the most prestige points after ten days wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
