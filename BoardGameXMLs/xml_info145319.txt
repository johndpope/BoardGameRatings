			<description>The disc golf dexterity game 150-Class uses thin acrylic sheeting, thick stackable shims, semi-adherent vinyl cutouts, and a desk lamp to represent a disc golf course and its obstacles, elevations, and bounds, as well as wind effects and sun glare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can score single holes or variable-length courses by total shot count, hole shot count, or shot location, and may opt to use a freeform wagering system in combination with any of the three scoring styles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
