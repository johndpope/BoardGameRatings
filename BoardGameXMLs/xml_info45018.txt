							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Babylon 5: The Roleplaying Game (2nd Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From The Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was the dawn of the Third Age of Mankind, ten years after the Earth-Minbari War. The Babylon Project was a dream given form. Its goal - to prevent another war by creating a place where humans and aliens could work out their differences peacefully. It is a port of call, a home away from home for diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs and wanderers. Humans and aliens wrapped in two million, five hundred thousand tons of spinning metal, all alone in the night. It can be a dangerous place but it is our last, best hope for peace. This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations. The year is 2258. The name of the place is Babylon 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The greatest science fiction adventure ever comes to roleplaying as it has never been seen before. The Babylon 5 Roleplaying Game is the single greatest information resource available for the award-winning television series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have the opportunity to play humans, Centauri, Narn, Minbari, Drazi and Brakiri characters from the main rulebook, playing through vast and wide-ranging story arcs that will seal their fate and that of the galaxy. The entire Babylon 5 space station is detailed in the main rulebook, along with the characters and personalities to be found on board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Never before has a licensed game been approached with such attention to detail, delighting fans of the television show. Coming as a large 304 page full colour hardback book, the Babylon 5 Roleplaying Game has been designed to set new standards in both game play and presentation. Revolutionising the d20 System, it brings unparalleled realism to the table, as well as the chance to explore the galaxy of one of the most popular science fiction television shows of all time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring the space station that changed the destiny of an entire galaxy, this all new roleplaying game allows players to take the role of characters on board the Babylon 5 station and travel to the many stars and planets seen in the award-winning television series. From lowly lurkers and smugglers through to brave Earthforce Officers and members of the Minbari warrior caste, a whole galaxy awaits to be explored!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
