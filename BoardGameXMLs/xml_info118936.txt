			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;ACHIEVE FAME AND FORTUNE - OR DIE TRYING!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are an adventurous music video director! You've risked your life and fortune on a one-way trip to the hard-rockin' Distortion Dimension in search of fresh material for your music videos! You might become rich and famous... or you may die a horrible death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's the situation: You have this incredible tower equipped with video production gear and everything you need for survival. You've spent all your money to transport the tower and yourself to an alien dimension. You can spend days with all of the hi-tech toys in your tower, but you'll never become a success &amp;amp; make it home again unless you step outside the safety of your tower and explore the far reaches of the deadly Distortion Dimension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab your video camera and start shooting! But to get the best material, prepare to overcome guitar warriors, puzzles, traps, starvation, exhaustion and other deadly obstacles. Hob nob with supernatural rock stars and try to make it back to your tower in one piece. Create music videos with hard-won media treasures. Hop on the video phone and deal with earthbound TV producers. Sell you creations for millions and you;ll make it big!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
