			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interstellar War!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the late twenty-fourth century, the Federated Worlds need a bigger and better space fleet than ever before. Exploration continues. Hostile aliens abound. Rebellion ferments. And the UDP worlds have just declared war!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More ships. Faster ships. Stronger ships. Better and brighter crews. And, to command them, the best leaders, tacticians and strategists in the known galaxy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mindcraft presents Omnitrend's Rules of Engagement, where you command the massive space fleet of the Federated worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Captions for four photos:]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choosing your enemies: Each race, human or alien, has its own unique shape, color, characteristics and background history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starship design: Equip your fleet with a multitude of devices, armor and missiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ship-to-ship combat: Select your target and choose the best missile to seek it out and blast it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stellar navigation: Pilot your flagship and send orders to the rest of the captains in your fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omnitrend's Rules of Engagement--New for the Interlocking Game System!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Millions of missions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Over twenty detailed missions already provided. You'll command convoys, sorties, and last-ditch defenses. Role-play your commander through all of them, watching him or her advance through the ranks, receiving well-deserved decorations on the way to ultimate naval command. &lt;br/&gt;     A completely integrated mission builder. Design your own spaceships, alien enemies, subordinate captains, and even newly discovered star systems! Then drop your commander into the middle of the latest crisis! In the vastness of interstellar space, the possibilities are endless. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stunning sound and graphics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Fully-visualized control panels and situation screens. Multi-media communications with friend and enemy. &lt;br/&gt;     Stirring musical score and sound effects (IBM version supports AdLib and Roland sound boards). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interlocks with Breach 2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     When the time comes for a boarding party or commando raid, you can, at your option, use the Interlocking Game System to fight the full battle with Mindcraft/Omnitrend's Breach 2. The combat and role-playing results are automatically credited to your Rules of Engagement commander.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
