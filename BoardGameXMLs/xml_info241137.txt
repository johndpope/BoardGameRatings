							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dig In</name>
									
			<description>Featuring a bowl filled with 128 beautifully modelled, colourful game pieces (32 different everyday items in 4 different colours each), a chunky timer and cards showing 6 items to be collected, Dig In! looks exceptionally simply, but is quite challenging. Players get just 15 seconds to dig through the bowl with both hands to try and get all the pieces they need to fill their card. If no-one manages to fill their card this way, all players then &amp;lsquo;dig in&amp;rsquo; at the same time, using one hand only, until someone fills their card. Dig In! offers two levels of play &amp;ndash; one where players must find six pieces in any colour and one where the pieces must be specific colours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
