			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are not alone in space. The discovery of an abandoned alien spaceship in the asteroid belt has answered this question once and for all and accelerated technological progress into the immeasurable. We've begun to colonize space. Life is ubiquitous there, but no traces of alien civilizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until now...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ender-2473 is a small research outpost, one of the bases farthest away from Earth. From there comes the news of an incredible discovery. Top secret! The world government is discussing the topic and will probably put together an expert commission. This gives &amp;quot;the company&amp;quot; time to take the find for itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haste is called for, and only a small team can get there in time. But the lack of quantity is more than made up for by quality. Each and every member of the team has superhuman abilities. Some even claim they aren't even human any more... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core of &amp;quot;Context Sensitive&amp;quot; is a relatively simple exploratory mission on a foreign planet, on which two research bases are located. The peculiarity lies in the different characters that the players take over, and in the interaction that will hopefully result from this. It is therefore particularly suitable for players who enjoy playing unusual characters and bringing them to life. The topic of &amp;quot;transhumanism&amp;quot; and the question of what makes a human human always resonates in the background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Chief, artifical AI in a flying box, team leader&lt;br/&gt;    Jochen Hell, cyborg, soldier, drone operator&lt;br/&gt;    Anahita Rahimi, medical doctor and carrier of multiple personalities&lt;br/&gt;    Atimur, genetically enhanced pilot&lt;br/&gt;    Lynne and Lynda Abbe, augmented research engineers, a pair of identical twins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure uses the Cepheus Engine, but can be converted to other game systems without much problems. It comes with it's own hard sci-fi background set in the near future. It is suitable for 4-6 players, with six being the optimum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
