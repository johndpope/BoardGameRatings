			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fan-created mission for Orpheus.&lt;br/&gt; From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MISSION TYPE: Intelligence Gathering (TRAINING)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TEAM LEADER: Miranda White&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT LEADER: McKenzie Walsh (CONSULTANT)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LOCATION: ElecTrans Supply Line #15, Vine St. Crossing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In December of 2002, a school bus from White Pine Elementary stalled at Vine St. Crossing, an active thoroughfare for ElecTrans Supply Line #15. A malfunctioning junction switch did not permit an emergency rerouting of the oncoming supply train. Evacuation of the school bus was not completed when the collision occurred. The death toll was sixteen: Two adult teachers and fourteen children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the years since, Vine St. Crossing has become a tourist Mecca for observation of repeatable PLE manifestations: Any vehicle stopped on the railroad tracks would be pushed to safety, uphill, by an unseen force. Dustings on the backs of test vehicles revealed the small handprints of children. Orpheus Group investigation has confirmed the presence of at least ten blip-class place-bound reactives on site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday, the phenomena at Vine St. Crossing underwent a reversal in intent. Instead of pushing vehicles to safety, the resident PLEs have begun pulling cars into harm's way. The Mayor has requested our immediate assistance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEE: $450 000.00 (for neutralization of hostile disturbance)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
