							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tailor</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tailor is a good and honest worker. He does his time. He keeps his head down and his nose clean. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t bother anyone and he doesn&amp;rsquo;t ask for anything in return. He is always at home when someone needs him and he never refuses a request for help. The Tailor is everything the Black Monk expects from his prisoners. There&amp;rsquo;s never any drama here. Lately, the Tailor has been asking strange questions, working long hours, and generally breaking his old habits. Yesterday he was seen measuring a mule and carrying wood back from the forest. What kind of clothing requires two trees?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
