							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The King of Infinite Space (5E)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 5th Edition Mini-Dungeon adventure for 4-6 Characters Level 15-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Underworld&amp;rsquo;s layers hide many mysteries. Vast, long-abandoned, deep-set cities exist in the dark. One such site houses Urkkia, a gnome spy who was more... but is now less...than he appears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over time, Urkkia perfected ways to manipulate shadow, particularly the Plane itself. With near-perfect control over shadow walk let him appear within ten feet of his destination, he became an efficient spy; nothing seemed safe from him. As the bounty on him grew, he retreated further from the surface to this safehouse- here, Urkkia built his ultimate creation: The Room of Infinite Space. But his links to the Plane as &amp;ldquo;something real&amp;rdquo; attracted powerful shadow beings; they sent three nightwalkers after him recently. He destroyed two, fell to the third, but was ready for such an event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Urkkia is evil in that he lies, cheats, steals, and even kills in the name of retrieving items from the worst creatures in existence. He&amp;rsquo;s self-focused, thinking of himself first, as any spy does if they want to live.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
