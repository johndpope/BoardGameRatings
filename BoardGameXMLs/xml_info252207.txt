							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nightfall</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nightfall is a short adventure for 4-6 players of 8th to 10th level, in which the players enter an unsettling graveyard to find it has become inhabited by a plague vampire. This creature has contaminated the large oak tree in the center of the graveyard, giving it the ability to continually raise creatures from the dead. To make matters worse, the vampire has also enslaved two flesh golems, which have been bound to a stone slab outside her mausoleum. What vile purpose could these monstrosities serve?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will your party be able to figure out this horrifying scenario and defeat the vampire before she buries them in her graveyard?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
