			<description>60 cards, featuring Goods Cards, Conveyance Cards and Obstruction Cards.&lt;br/&gt;It is a trick-taking game really, but quite advanced for its age. The first player in any round must offer a Goods Card. The next player may offer a Conveyance Card, suitable for carrying the Goods on offer. If he does, he collects the Goods Card. The third player may play an Obstruction to this arrangement and snaffle the Goods himself.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who collects the highest tonnage of Goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
