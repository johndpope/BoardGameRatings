			<description>Atomik Deathmatch is just the plugin for people who think their Fuzion games have too much stuff that isn't shooting things.  From the opening:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Atomik Deathmatch is a &amp;quot;proving ground&amp;quot; for Atomik WAR 3.0, the cutting-edge, suped-up combat rules for the  Fuzion&amp;trade; RPG system.  Atomik Deathmatch is  not a gameworld, but simply a set of rules for laying out a quick and dirty &amp;quot;Quake-style&amp;quot; shoot-em-up combat session.  Deathmatch has everything you would come to expect from a Quake-style computer game including Generic Character Types, Frag Counts, Objective Points (for buying new stuff), Respawns when you die, and various game modes such as Teamplay, Capture the Flag, Team Fortress, and the ever popular Deathmatch Free For All.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So why play Atomik Deathmatch at all when you can just play the latest greatest 3D shoot-em-up?  First, Deathmatch is a great way to demonstrate the combat action potential of the Fuzion system.  It will stress test Fuzion to the max (just like 3D shooters stress test your PC to the max).  If there are bugs in the rules, the game will break (and break hard) in Atomik Deathmatch.  Second, this game is free, and does not require you to have expensive state-of-the-art PCs networked to a LAN with many other computers, all of which you have to upgrade every 3 weeks to keep playing the latest games.  Third, you can do just about anything you can possibly imagine with this game and not have to worry about spending hours programming.   Just do it.  It's as simple as that.  Finally, if you want to introduce someone to Fuzion, Atomik Deathmatch can be the avenue of choice.  It will demonstrate all the rules necessary to play any Fuzion base game quickly and with an excessive amount of fun.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
