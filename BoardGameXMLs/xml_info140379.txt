			<description>Author's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Terminal Hours is a narrative RPG where the GM takes the role of Coyote, a (mostly) benevolent trickster spirit, and the players take the role of a person during the last hours of their life. These people have to fight their way past the challenges of the spirit world and the real world in order to accomplish their dying wishes, but they have to work together to have any chance of survival. This is a mostly traditional RPG, where the players act and the GM narrates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principals of the game are collaborative storytelling, emergent character stories, and that you play to find out what happens - whether the characters &amp;ldquo;succeed&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;fail&amp;rdquo; should be totally subordinate to the story at hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
