			<description>In this childrens game, players travel across Sugar Plum Country trying to be the first to reach the Sugar Plum Tree. On your turn, you spin the Sugar Plum Fairies' magic spinner and advance along the Sugar Plum Trail to the color you spun. When you pass over, or land on, a place marked &amp;quot;Take A Sugar Plum,&amp;quot; you draw a (wooden) gumdrop from the bag. Once you have four gumdrops, you may head for the Sugar Plum Tree in the center of the board. You must be careful of your gumdrops - because, if another player lands on your space, you must give that player one of your gumdrops. The first player to reach the Sugar Plum Tree with four gumdrops is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
