			<description>A fast paced boardless board game &amp;ndash; PeltaPeeps is a game for 2 to 6 players. The play combines negotiation and placement. Players take turns placing new game pieces and making connections in the play area. They may also flip or move another player's piece in each turn. Flipping a piece down lowers its scoring. However, a piece that has been flipped face down, may also be flipped up with some help from other Peeps, restoring its value. A piece may also be moved from one area to another. A player may never move their own pieces, and a piece may only be moved if it will not cause a discontinuity in the connected pieces already in play. The player with the most points counted up at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has either 8 or 16 unique pieces per team color, with up to 6 colors, depending on game version. The versions are- PeltaPeeps For Two (2 player) or PeltaPeeps Core and Full games, both of which are 4 to 6 player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play revolves around the unique connections each piece can make- blocking pieces preventing other players from making favorable connections, leaving open connections that allow you to connect to your own color (giving you bonus points) or creating hubs for future plays. Different playing pieces have varying point values based on being face up or down and who they are connect to as well as what they are. Play continues until no more valid placements are available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game combines bluff and negotiation, as players get bonus points for connecting to their own color, but cannot directly reverse the moves other players make against their pieces. Even if players choose not to discuss their moves, the moves, themselves act as a form of diplomacy, potentially forcing other players to react to 3rd parties as play progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces started out as wood, but are now coming to market as UV printed and laser cut Acrylic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
