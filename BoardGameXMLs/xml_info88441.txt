			<description>Publisher quote:&lt;br/&gt;From the Publisher / Developer Website&lt;br/&gt;As a member of Delta Force--The Army's Elite, top secret special forces unit--the word &amp;quot;impossible&amp;quot; is not in your vocabulary. In Delta Force, you will conduct missions swiftly and silently, in every possible terrain, under every imaginable condition and through unconventional means.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Immersive environment consists of real-world effects, such as bridges that creak, insects that buzz, flocks of birds that form and re-form, and fish that bite.&lt;br/&gt;- Watch your enemy\'s every move, listen for their approach then strike with brutal precision over the most heartbreaking pieces of terrain the world has ever seen.&lt;br/&gt;- Play in either 1st or 3rd person across miles and miles of vast outdoor environments. Engage the enemy over unprecedented distances.&lt;br/&gt;- Over 40 gut-wrenching missions across five continents ranging from airfield takedowns in Central Asia, clearing out S. American cartels to stopping Nuclear terrorism in Northern Russia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
