			<description>Unmechanical is an award-winning 2.5D side-scroller which combines tricky puzzle solving, alluring exploration, and an engrossing atmosphere. The game had humble beginnings as a student project and since then both game and team has grown. Unmechanical focuses on accessible controls that makes it easy to pick up and play, and challenges you with a wide range of challenging puzzles.&lt;br/&gt;On a bright and sunny day you&amp;rsquo;re spirited away by a network of coiled pipes into a mysterious underworld. You find yourself in a strange environment that pulsates from mechanic and organic machinery alike, and your journey to freedom begins. Flying freely through the odd and fantastic surroundings, a powerful tractor beam lets you pick up objects and interact with the world.&lt;br/&gt;Your quest for freedom requires you to solve a great variety of puzzling challenges, and while it&amp;rsquo;s easy to pick up and play, later challenges may prove very difficult indeed. On your adventure you might also begin to understand what it all means&amp;ndash;The underworld may be more than it seems, the fateful descent more than just chance, and you might not be entirely alone after all&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
