			<description>Theme: Robots racing through security rooms to be the first to reach &amp;quot;Master Control&amp;quot; and win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set-up: Characters are selected and the remaining deck is separated into a Main Deck, the &amp;quot;Master Control&amp;quot; goal card, Shieldpass cards, and the Dice Deck. The Main Deck is shuffled and the first thirteen cards are placed face down on the table in a cross, with one in the center and three leading out on each spoke. Each player chooses one of the spoke ends to start on. The goal card is placed face up as a fourth card at the end of one of the unchosen spokes. One card from the Main Deck is then dealt to each player and the card at the end of the spoke they each chose is flipped face up, revealing the first room they must move through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play: Players take two actions per turn from an assortment of actions including drawing new cards, using special rooms to fabricate protective Shieldpass cards, place a new room from their hand into an empty spot adjacent to one or more cards, check a neighboring face down room, or move from room to room. To move from a room without spending cards, a player must either have a Shieldpass attached that matches either the Security clearance of the room (Theta, Sigma, or Omega) or the attack type of the room (Fire, Ice, or Bolt). Alternatively, a player may elect to &amp;quot;crash&amp;quot; a room by discarding cards from their hand to draw cards from the Dice Deck in order to equal or overcome the number at the top left of the Security Room they are in. Once a room is crashed, it no longer hinders any player for the rest of the game. The first player to move their robot character to the goal card and spend an action there wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also serves as an alternate art poker deck, and has a one-to-one correspondence with a standard deck. Rules for playing a free version, by using a standard deck of cards are also available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
