			<description>The deck has eight suits and 13 cards for each suit.&lt;br/&gt;Players get ten cards at random and use them to bid (simultaneously) on a card revealed from the deck: the highest bid chooses if that card must be discarded (and everyone draws a card) or kept on the table. Then another card is revealed and bid upon. When five cards are on the table, each player scores accordingly to the five cards he still has in hand (due to matching suits and values with the cards on the table). &lt;br/&gt;The rulebook presents three scoring systems (one must be selected beforehand) to offer different levels of complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
