			<description>Stop 'N Tow - A whistle blowin' card game for Ages 6 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given a plastic whistle. The entire deck of 55 cards is dealt out. In turn, players flip over cards from their stacks and state from memory every vehicle turned over. If a player makes an error, the first player to blow his whistle and prove the error wins the stack of cards and a new round begins. The player with the most cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special cards in the deck include Yield (skip turn), U-turn (reverse direction of play), and stop signs (first person to blow his whistle wins the stack.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six whistles are dishwasher safe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
