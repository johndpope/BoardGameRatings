							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Das grosse essen &amp; trinken Men√º-Spiel</name>
									
			<description>This game was available solely through the magazine &amp;quot;Essen &amp;amp; Trinken&amp;quot; (a magazine for cooking). &lt;br/&gt;You objective is it to get as many menus as possible. The menu always consist of 4 courses. You collect by drawing a card from a course of your choice. The card shows the kind of menu (classic, veg. etc.)and the value of that dish. You move forward as many spots as the value of the cards - depending on the place you finish you might have to answer a question or you can trade cards with other players.&lt;br/&gt;At the end only finished menus are counted (and all menue cards have to be from the same kind).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All menu-cards contain a real recipe from the magazine, so you can actually use this game as a cook book (if you can understand German)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
