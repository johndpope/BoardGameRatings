							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chult: Adversaries and Allies</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kwanda, an avenging Tabaxi warrior. Professor Larin Narcross, relic hunter loyal to the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Alliance. Bapoto Fhan, disgraced barae and renegade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are just three of more than a score of nonplayer characters detailed in this supplement, perfect for Dungeon Masters planning to take their characters deep into Chult for a Tomb of Annihilation campaign. Each NPC is illustrated, includes a description of their personality and motivations, the items in their possession, and their place in the vast jungle expanse of Chult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 92-page guide includes three wilderness quests: Lead an expedition to find the source of the Tiryki River and uncover its dark secret, join the Emerald Enclave as it seeks a miracle plant while assailed by firenewts in the Peaks of Flame, and risk all in a high-stakes race to find the survivors of a crashed skyship deep in the Chultan wilderness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 15 new monsters, including the titanic rivals, Mlima Mweupe, the gargantuan girallon of the Wild Coast and his towering nemesis, Kula Kubwa, the queen of the tyrannosaurus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
