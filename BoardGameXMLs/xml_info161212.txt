							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Art of Food Conversation</name>
									
			<description>A new game from the makers of The Art of Conversation: The Art of Food Conversation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the website:&lt;br/&gt;Do you eat to live, or are you one of those passionate souls who lives to eat? Food is certainly enjoying a high profile at present. With hit TV shows, social sites, glossy ranks of gastro-porn at every newsagent, and the return of the dinner party, many of us have headed back towards the kitchen as well as continuing our passion for dining out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TAOC serves up 300 culinary entrees on topics like food destinations, cooking classes, slow food, fusion, indulgent food, leftovers and bizarre food ideas. It includes a comprehensive guidebook to culinary communication, complete with fascinating endnotes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all TAOC editions, it&amp;rsquo;s not a quiz &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s not about who knows the most. Rather, it&amp;rsquo;s a communication tool that draws on your own experiences, thoughts and reactions to facilitate fascinating discussions. Even wannabe foodies and reluctant eaters will love it, because let&amp;rsquo;s face it &amp;ndash; we all eat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
