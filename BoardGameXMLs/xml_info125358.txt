							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Castle Dungeon</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A spiral staircase leads down below the castle, deeper even than its storage cellars, to a guardroom and a narrow corridor flanked by cells making up the castle's dungeon. The dungeon is a simple affair and does not provide much in the way of comfort even compared to other prisons. Although no one on locked up in here will miss them for long as prisoners are usually only kept until it is time for their trial or their punishment to be carried out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spiral staircase leading down ends in a short corridor leading to the guardroom. The guardroom itself is a simple room, two massive columns supporting the weight of the roof and the structures resting atop it. A simple wooden table and a pair of rough wooden benches have been set up to accommodate the guards and a few barrels in one corner probably contain lamp oil, old bread and thin beer for prisoners and guards alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The guard rooms only other exit leads into a slightly longer corridor flanked by prison cells left and right. Each cell can be entered through a massive wooden door reinforced with iron bars. The iron shows its age though, covered by a thick patina of rust as it is. Separated from the doors by a massive stone column an equally rusty grid of interlocking iron bars allows the guards a clear view into each cell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Piles of relatively fresh straw are the otherwise featureless cells only furniture. The cells are only dimly lit by the lanterns hung in regular intervals in the corridor, unless the guards embezzled the money for the lamp oil or the oil itself, in which case they are left entirely in the dark. The same lamps light the corridor only moderately more brightly. Only in the guardroom is it that the light is comfortably bright, although columns and furniture throw unsettling flickering shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
