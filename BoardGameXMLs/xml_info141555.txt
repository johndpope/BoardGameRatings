			<description>This is a game produced by Golden Books under the name &amp;quot;a Little Golden Game&amp;quot;.  &lt;br/&gt;A game for 2 to 4 players ages 5 to 8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a children's game that touches on a type of memory game.&lt;br/&gt;Players start with a Scoring Board in front of them.  In turn, players will announce &amp;quot;Heads&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Tails&amp;quot; and flip over one of the Animal Cards in the center of the table.  If they called the correct animal part (heads or tails) they get to keep that Animal Card and take another turn.  &lt;br/&gt;When they get the matching head and tail of an animal, they place the completed animal on their Scoring Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
