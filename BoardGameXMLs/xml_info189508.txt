							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Infected Zombie</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each release for Crawthorne's Catalog of Creatures for the Pathfinder RPG presents a single, new creature for your Pathfinder RPG game, as presented by the famous and retired monster hunter and adventurer, Lord Crawthorne. Each release presents game stats for the new creature, as well as three adventure ideas to help insert them into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Infected Zombie is the flesh-eating zombie we all know and love from popular media. This is not the vanilla mystically raised from the dead automaton the Pathfinder Role-Playing Game defaults to, nor is it the plague variation that falls short of the genre. This difficult-to-kill zombie has no goal but finding warm flesh to eat, but the true danger comes from the infection its bite can spread. Aiming for the head is also crucial to truly killing these monsters, as you've been hoping for&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
