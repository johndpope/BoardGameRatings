			<description>From game's manual&lt;br/&gt;3 Overview&lt;br/&gt;3.1 About&lt;br/&gt;Hardware Engineering is a design-and-simulate game that sets its goal to present concepts of digital circuit engineering as close to the reality as possible while still reserving certain simplifications, so that the game remains playable for the wide public despite its technical content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Users can take advantage of serveral game modes and detailed tutorials present inthe game and pick up the topic, challenge oneself with simulation of real life conditions by meeting the budget and co&lt;br/&gt;mplexity limits or compete against other players online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The learning curve of Hardware Engineering (HWE) is rather steep when compared to other games of the genre. This learning requires lots of reading and thinking effort and it is therefore recommended to play this game only when feeling well and ready to play something new. It most certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t a game for straight several-hours-lasting gameplay. Our best estimate of a proper learning plan consists of a daily completion of one level only, possibly combined with competing online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
