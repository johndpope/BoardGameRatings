							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Drascula: The Vampire Strikes Back</name>
									
			<description>The evil vampiric Count Drascula has a plan to conquer the world. Building an army of monsters created from parts of corpses reanimated by a machine of his invention called &amp;quot;The Indifibulator&amp;quot;, he plans to take over the whole planet... Ok, maybe it's not such a good plan, but he is determined to carry it out. The only thing he really needed was a &amp;quot;brand new and unused brain&amp;quot;. And beautiful innocent Billie Jean's brain was the best candidate.&lt;br/&gt;So Count Drascula kidnapped the girl and took her captive to his castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the fearsome vampire didn't figure on the brave Johnny Hacker, a real estate agent in business trip to Transylvania who happens to be in love with Billie Jean, and will do anything to rescue her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
