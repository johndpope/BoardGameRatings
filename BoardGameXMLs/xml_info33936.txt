			<description>A straightforward edge-matching placement game consisting of 32 square tiles (called 'stones' in the rules), each a red plastic frame inset with a white plastic square which has symbols cutout on the edges. Each edge has either no cutout (a blank edge), or half a square, circle or diamond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns to add tiles to the layout, always matching edges. Scoring is simple: whenever a player completes a square or rectangle of tiles of any size they score points equal to the number of tiles in the square or rectangle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 10 stones, and must play if possible each turn. If not, they take a stone from the reserve. As soon as one player has played all his stones the game ends and the scores are tallied. Any stones remaining with a player count as -1; if he has taken from the reserve at any time during the game then each stone remaining counts as -5!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was made in England by Merit, and appears to date from the 50s or 60s (no date is given on the game materials). The so-called stones are nicely made components that fit neatly into the small square box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules suggest that there are 35 stones in the game. The combinations of symbols that appear on the stones are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     4 symbols the same (all 4 possible stones)&lt;br/&gt;     3 symbols the same, 1 different (all 12 possible combinationss)&lt;br/&gt;     2 pairs of 2 symbols, matching pairs are adjacent (all 6 possible combinations)&lt;br/&gt;     1 pair the same and 2 other symbols, matching pair is adjacent (12 of 24 possible combinations, including one of each mirror-image pair)&lt;br/&gt;     4 different symbols (1 of 6 possible combinations).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
