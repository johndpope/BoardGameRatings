			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gods of Gondwane is a role-playing game of swords and sorcery, set in a pulp-style world of dinosaurs and a sinister alien presence that oppresses the inhabitants by imposing monstrous genetically engineered or mechanical 'gods' upon them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over a hundred million years ago, the wisest of an ancient and incredibly advanced race looked into their future - and discovered their people were extinct. Vanished, without a trace. Their proud place had been taken over by the descendants of apes. And so they who would be called the Shapers began their Great Experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Casting their nets through space and time, the Shapers captured primitive hominids and accelerated their evolution, to find out how and why Man had supplanted them. When they failed to find the answer, they destroyed the cities their subjects had built, wiped them out, and tried again. Still the answer eluded them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And so the Shapers cast their nets further up the time stream ... into that place that we call the Bermuda Triangle, in that time we call the 20th century. The Eighteenth Cycle of the Great Experiment has begun ... and you have been summoned to be part of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
