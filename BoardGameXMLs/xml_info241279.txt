			<description>Adorable Monsters is the super cute card game, for all ages, in which the first player to put together a squad of 7 cutie patootie monsters, wins! Have a blast with your buds, pals, mates, friends, family, or even absolute strangers, as you try to be the first to create your monster squad!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play&lt;br/&gt;Learning to play Adorable Monsters is easy! That's because what each card can be used to do during play is written directly on it, in the form of concise instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin the game, all players draw 5 cards and thereafter take turns drawing and playing one card at a time, as they try to line up a squad of 7 monsters in front of them to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, it's not that easy, as there are lots of cards that players can use to remove monsters from their opponents' squads. So, not only do you have to try to put together your monster squad, but you have to try to stop your friends from doing so, too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
