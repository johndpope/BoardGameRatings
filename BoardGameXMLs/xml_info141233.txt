							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">So What&#039;s The Riddle Like, Anyway? II</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your PCs are deep in the dungeon and have just encountered a terrifying monster which they have no chance of defeating. Luckily, the monster is bored and challenges the party to a riddling contest instead of simply just killing them. Alternatively, the party have encountered a sentient statue that will not let them past until they have answered three riddles correctly. At this point, a GM may panic and just hand wave the ensuing riddles or allow the PCs to answer them correctly by making skill checks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So What&amp;rsquo;s The Riddle Like, Anyway? II picks up where So What&amp;rsquo;s The Riddle Like, Anyway? left off and presents scores more riddles ready to insert into almost any GM&amp;rsquo;s campaign. Now a GM (or aspiring bard) has loads of riddles in his arsenal ready to strike fear into the hearts of those hearing them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
