			<description>This is game #18 in the Games on Half a Checkerboard Series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, players alternate turns moving and capturing an enemy piece, while avoiding a cascade effect that could result in a number of their own contiguously connected pieces being eliminated during their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play starts out with players alternating turns placing one of their pieces on the board.  Once each player has placed their 12 pieces on the board, play begins, with each player attempting to capture an enemy piece while avoiding removal of their own pieces in the same turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The flow of the game is one that starts out very strategic in nature, then shifts to a very tactical one in the second half.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
