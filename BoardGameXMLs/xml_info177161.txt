			<description>The monkey players in Viva! Coconots want to grab coconuts from the field, with those coconuts ideally lying in a straight line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up the game, place the &amp;quot;Las-nut&amp;quot; card in the center of a 3x3 grid, then shuffle the other coconut cards and lay eight of them in the surrounding spaces of the grid, removing any unused cards from the game. The coconut cards have powers on them that come into effect when that card is active during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lasts nine rounds. Each player has a deck of monkey cards numbered 1-10, and to start play, they each shuffle their deck, lay two cards at random face down in the front of them (looking at them whenever they like), then take a hand of three cards. In a round, the players look at the coconut card for this round (as indicated on the Las-nut card), choose a monkey card in hand, then reveal them simultaneously. If two or more players lay down the same card, they're out for the round. After taking into account the coconut's power, whoever played the highest card wins the round and places a token on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Las-nut card is claimed in the final round, with whoever has the highest total in the two cards set aside claiming it. (These cards can possibly be swapped during play.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player has ever placed three tokens in a line on the grid, that player wins immediately. If this doesn't happen, whoever has placed the most tokens (with the Las-nut counting as two) wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
