							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Piercing Fortress Europa</name>
									
			<description>Piercing Fortress Europa is a new game from veteran game designer Frank Hunter, which covers the campaigns of the Western Allies from July, 1943 through the end of April, 1945 in Sicily and Italy.  Each area has its own map and time scale to best represent the campaigns for Sicily and Italy and the player is offered complete freedom, limited only by a historical order of battle and logistics model, to plan his operations and explore all of the many &amp;ldquo;what ifs&amp;rdquo; that the Italian theater has to offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The units of both sides are fully modelled, including armored, infantry, airborne, commando and garrison units rated for size, quality, strength and disruption.  Although strength and disruption are important, the focus of the game is on supply and fuel.  As the commander you need to plan ahead in this &amp;quot;WEGO&amp;quot; system, allocating your limited combat supply to your units in advance of combat operations and making sure your supply lines do not stretch too far.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Piercing Fortress Europa is not a difficult game to learn, but it is modeled with historical accuracy from start to finish to give a fast playing historical wargame that allows you to think and plan based on the same considerations as a historical theater commander.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
