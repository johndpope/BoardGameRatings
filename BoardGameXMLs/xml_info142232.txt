							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SeaWar: 1805</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;SeaWar: 1805 is a set of wargames rules designed to recreate the naval battles that occur during the Age of Sail, from the First Anglo-Dutch War in 1652 through the Napoleonic Wars to the end of the Greek War of Independence in 1829.&lt;br/&gt;Designed to be simple enough to introduce gamers new to the period (indeed even to wargaming), SeaWar: 1805 is challenging enough to provide experienced naval wargamers with hours of fun and even provide the ideal vehicle to introduce their &amp;ldquo;landlubber&amp;rdquo; friends to the joys of naval wargaming. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A relatively simple miniatures system with rules for wind effects on movement, deterioration of ship capabilities with damage (with possible random effects), broadsides, bow &amp;amp; stern fire, and 7 classes of ships (with further sub-classes for finer detail). Movement is phased, 5 phases per game turn, each ship moving between 0 and 4 cm per phase. Bookkeeping fairly light, supplied record sheets gives 2 ships per sheet with generous space for writing in ship capabilities &amp;amp; damage. Rules include many photographs of game in play, but only a couple have rules purposes, the others being decorative only. Time scale is 5 minutes per game turn, movement scale not given - all measurements are standard regardless of scale/size of miniatures used, 1/1200 scale being recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
