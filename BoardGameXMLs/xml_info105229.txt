			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine a bleak battlefield on the Eastern Front in World War II.  Panzer tanks rush forward in an awesome display of fire and steel.  Yet, for all their fury and firepower, they are not enough to achieve the objective of war: Conquer territory.  Someone has to go into the woods, the towns to make sure that the territory is actually taken.  That &amp;quot;someone&amp;quot; is infantry.  But not just any infantry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What the German Army needs is infantry that can keep up with the blazing offensive charge of its Panzer tanks.  Not possible?  Well, meet the Panzer Grenadiers: Soldiers on halftracks, trucks and armored vehicles with impressive speed and explosive firepower.  And best of all, they are yours to command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this exciting solitaire wargame, you make the decisions for a regiment of this elite armored infantry attached to the Grossdeutschland Panzer Grenadier Division.  Your forces also include mortar, artillery, Panzer IV, Panther and Tiger units.  The Russian enemy is directed by the computer, which will fiercely challenge you with its own complement of infantry, tanks and anti-tank guns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be prepared for some heavy fighting when you play the five historical scenarios provided.  Your missions include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Taking and holding crucial bridgeheads while forcing the Russians back across the Lutchessa River in late '42.&lt;br/&gt;     Participating in Hitler's Operation Citadel (summer '43) to penetrate the Russian lines and to cut off the Kursk salient.&lt;br/&gt;     Breaking up the Russian counterattack in Kirovograd to stabilize your defensive line when things were going badly for the Germans in early '44.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With three levels of difficulty to accommodate players of all skills, the action never lets up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Roger Damon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
