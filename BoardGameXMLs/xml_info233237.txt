							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dice Age: Eggstinction</name>
									
			<description>The Ice Age is approaching! The Dinos must gather as much food and supplies as they can to grow and thrive. But watch out for the volcano looming over the island...it might destroy everything!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dice Age: Eggstinction is an entry level strategy game for 2-5 young/new game players and families to introduce them to contemporary game concepts like player asymmetry, resource collection, tech trees, and victory points. Players chose from a variety of dinosaur species and move around an island gathering goods in order to produce eggs...the first to produce 6 eggs in their nest wins the game! On your turn you'll roll a bunch of giant dice to populate the island with resources like insects, ferns, ginko, meat, and fish. Then you'll move around the island (possibly using your dino's unique ability) and gather up those resources to feed and grow your broods to produce more eggs. As you nest fills up, you'll gain new and enhanced skills to help you on your journey. But be careful when you gather goods from the dangerous areas of the island, as the volcano might erupt laying waste to valuable goods and scaring you back to safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Double-sided components are designed to enable competitive play between gamers and non/early-gamers at the same time and let young kids grow into the game by watching and learning from older players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
