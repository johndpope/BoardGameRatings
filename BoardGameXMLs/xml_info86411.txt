			<description>This set of oversized ( ) cards comes with instructions for several games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Penguin Pick-Up: Players turn over the top card of their stack and the card with the most penguins wins the trick. Play continues until one player has captured all the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Penguin Race: Each player is dealt 5 cards. The top card of the deck is turned over and players race to find a card in their hand that has the same number of penguins. The first player to get rid of all the cards in their hand wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Countin' Penguins: A player turns over a cards from the draw deck and counts the penguins. S/he continues turning over cards and adding penguins to the count until either a counting mistake is made or a Mother penguin card is turned up, at which point the player keeps all the cards turned up so far and play passes to the next player.  The player with the most cards when the draw deck is exhausted wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No More Penguins!: Each player starts with 5 cards. The top card of the deck is turned face up and players take turns playing a card that matches either the number of penguins or the color of scarf on the face up card. Anyone unable to play from their hand draws cards until a match is found.  The first person to play all their cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Penguin Memory: Cards are placed face down in a 4 x 10 matrix.  The player turns over any 2 cards. If the cards make a run (e.g., 2 &amp;amp; 3 penguins or 4 &amp;amp; 5 penguins), another card may be turned over.  The player continues to turn cards face up until one is found that does not continue the sequence. The player keeps the cards that formed the sequence and the next player takes his/her turn. The player with the most cards once all cards have been claimed is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;{User Summary}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
