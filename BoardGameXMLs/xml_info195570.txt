			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A one-shot adventure for the GUMSHOE system!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greece, 1948. The civil war is raging, with Communist partisans waging a guerrilla war against the US-backed government and National Army. In the south of the Peloponnese, a British archaeologist is missing, presumed dead. In truth, he has fallen prey to one of the most terrifying creatures of Greek folklore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators are tasked with finding out what has happened to him. They may be:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Officers of the gendarmerie (the Chorofylaki) from Githeio, the nearest large town, or from Sparta, the provincial capital.&lt;br/&gt;    Private investigators retained by the well-to-do Martin family to locate their relative.&lt;br/&gt;    Friends of Martin concerned about him enough to travel to Greece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     At the End of the Corridor: A short story by Evangeline Walton, originally published in Weird Tales.&lt;br/&gt;     No Feet to Follow Us, No Hands to Strike Us: The GUMSHOE scenario described above, a sequel to the story. &lt;br/&gt;     Information on the vrykolakas - the undead monster of Greek folk legend. &lt;br/&gt;     A complimentary copy of Against the Unknown, the low-prep GUMSHOE game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
