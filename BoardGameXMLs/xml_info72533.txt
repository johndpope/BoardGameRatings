			<description>User summary and from Japanese Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also known as the New Famicom, this was released in 1993 as a Famicom that could be plugged into a TV's RCA composite video input instead of the antenna: it used the same output as the SFC (and later N64), allowing the same cable to be used. It also addressed the original Famicom's problem of having hard-wired controllers that could not be removed from the set. The console came with two controllers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is design-wise next to identical to the NES2 (NES-101 Control Deck) but the NES2 didn't have an RCA output.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
