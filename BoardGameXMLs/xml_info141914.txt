							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vigil: Blood Bitterness</name>
									
			<description>Plunge into the dark and disturbing story to reveal the secrets of your ancient civilization&amp;rsquo;s relics and exact revenge on the Evil destroying your universe. Ritualistic killings and blood lust blur the line between your own kind and the Evil you seek to annihilate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your ultimate goal is to free yourself from this tormenting place and understand the origin and the purpose of this uncanny Evil. An Evil that annihilates all in its path, it has no shape but seems to follow a precise scheme, drowning everything under a black essence; it is impossible to stop or even to slow down. Since its birth, the universe is slowly disappearing.&lt;br/&gt;Avoid traps, solve puzzles and devour the faces of your slaves for sustenance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engrossing cut scenes bring you every brutal detail as the gothic sci-fi story unfolds and plunges you into confusion. The chilling music, menacing characters and stylized black and white presentation draw you deeper into this gruesome, episodic 3D adventure game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
