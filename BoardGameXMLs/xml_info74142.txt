							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bedlam City: Th&#039; Fuzz!</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is for those of you who just want information on Bedlam City&amp;rsquo;s Police Force, without having to buy the whole 400 page, $35 Bedlam City book. Everything in here can be found in either the main setting book (Bedlam City) or the supplement Citizens of Bedlam, although we&amp;rsquo;ve reorganized it and spruced it up a bit. If you already own Bedlam City and Citizens of Bedlam then you really won&amp;rsquo;t need a copy of this book, since apart from a few illustrations there&amp;rsquo;s nothing new in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The material here will tell you how the Bedlam City Police are organized, what equipment they use, how graft flows through the department, how you would go about bribing a Bedlam cop and all kinds of other useful information. It also contains character write-ups on roughly thirty individual beat cops, ranking officers, detectives and administrative personnel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
