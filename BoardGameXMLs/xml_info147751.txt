							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Penny Patterns</name>
									
			<description>Penny Patterns is played with thirty-six pennies on a board made up of blue and red circles. On each turn the active player flips a penny and places it in a red (inner) circle if it comes up tails and a blue (outer) circle if it comes up heads. Placing in a blue circle entitles a player to go again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to form symmetrical patterns of at least four pennies, and all the pennies on the board must be used. A point is scored for each axis of symmetry in such a pattern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played competitively, but can also be played solitaire, with the object being to beat one's previous best score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in the November/December 1978 issue of GAMES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
