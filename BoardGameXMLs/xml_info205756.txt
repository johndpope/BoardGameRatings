			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Entry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         This RPG item was a submission to the #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge.  It was developed by three different designers in a randomized, anonymous fashion.  For details, and for information on how the versions are structured, see the series RPGGeek entry here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015. All of the entries are available here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Winners and Everything&lt;br/&gt;Entry #15102; Stage One: J Groves; Stage Two: Aaron Kesher; Stage Three: Sean Duncan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:You had a life before The End. It may have been worse; odds are it was better. Whatever the case, who you were is the foundation of what you now can do, though not always in the way you expect. Everyone who's going to be a player in the game should make a crew member. One person will need to play everything else -- they are the &amp;ldquo;Master of the End&amp;rdquo;, and shouldn't make a character, but can contribute suggestions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
