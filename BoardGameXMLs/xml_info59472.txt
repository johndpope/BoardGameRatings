			<description>Each player has 80 number cards, five times from 1 to 16. The cards are sorted and laid out in stacks of equal numbers. One player shuffles all his or her cards and reads them out one by one. All players can now take that number and either start a new stack (if it is a &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;), add to an existing stack (if it is one number above it) or start or add to a helping row of numbers (maximum 5 per player). Cards from the helping rows can always be used, but only from the right end of them.&lt;br/&gt;When all cards are used, the player with the most valuable (highest) stacks is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;According to the rule sheet, this is a 19th century game discovered and edited by Dirk Hanneforth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
