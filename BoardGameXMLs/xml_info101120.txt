			<description>The game consists of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     60 playing cards, each with one of 6 pictures of ostriches performing various feats or being the victim of various misfortunes&lt;br/&gt;     4 declaration cards indicating whether players want to fold or continue&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Chicken&amp;quot; chips that are taken as a penalty when folding&lt;br/&gt;     Start player card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to get either one or two cards of a particular picture, as these earn you points. If you have three or more of a picture, points are deducted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players each get 2 playing cards, which are kept hidden from other players. At the beginning of each round, 2 cards from the deck are dealt face up and 3 face down. After players indicate whether they will continue or fold, a face down card is turned over. This continues until all 5 cards are turned over. At that point, remaining players who didn't fold will receive the cards. Players who folded receive a number of chicken chips equal to the number of face down cards plus one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, having one of a particular picture card is worth 2 points and two of that picture card are worth 6 points. Having three or more is a minus 3/4/5/etc. points. Each chicken chip is minus 2 points. The person with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme is based on the Japanese comedy trio, Ostrich Club.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
