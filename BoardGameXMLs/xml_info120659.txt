			<description>Paint the Line is an abstract for two players that uses Looney Pyramids. It is played on two boards - a 2x6 movement board and a 3x6 scoring board. Three trees each of four different colors are set up on the movement board. The second and fifth squares in the middle row of the scoring board are blocked off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, each player takes two small pyramids of two different colors from the movement board. Players will score points for the two colors they chose at the end of the game. After choosing colors, players take turns moving pyramids on the movement board in order to capture other pyramids. A pyramid is captured when another pyramid moves on top of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pyramids are placed in any empty square on the scoring board when captured. When no more squares are empty, captured pyramids are stacked on top of the other pyramids, but no more than two pyramids can be in a stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players continue to capture and place pyramids until no further moves are possible. At the end of the game, points are scored for groups of pyramids on the scoring board, with larger groups and larger pyramids being worth more points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
