			<description>Le Jeu du Berger (which means The Game of the Shepherd) comes with two different variants the first one is possible from the age of three and is called 'Cours, petit mouton, cours!' (Run, little sheep, run!) and is 100% luck. Here the players have to throw a die and put the sheep on the free space with the same numbers as the die roll. The child who can place all his sheep the first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second version is called 'Petit mouton, rentre &amp;agrave; la maison! (Little sheep come home!) and this one is possible for players aged four. Here all the sheep are placed on spots with a number ranging from one to six one. Now the children roll the die and they may remove a sheep every round but the sheep may only be removed if the number that the sheep is standing on is the same as the die roll. This way the game becomes a memory game. The child who obtains the most cheep wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
