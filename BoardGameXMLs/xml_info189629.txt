							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Admin Toolkit: Damage Drop Table</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the movies, the hero doesn't run around unscathed until that final blow that takes him out of commission. He's getting beat up. Winded. Exhausted. Limping. Remember the first Die Hard movie? What made him heroic was doing what he did despite his inujuries and pain. This light supplement is free for you White Lies players - a nifty drop table to add that little something extra to your fight scenes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make your to-hit roll on this drop table (give one to each player). If the attack roll succeeds, roll damage normally but the condition under the die also applies to your opponent (the Admin can track it). If you roll outside the drop table results, only normal hit point damage occurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you are damaged by your enemies, keep track of which conditions currently apply to you using the checkboxes on your drop table. Some effects have no checkbox and therefore apply immediately rather than linger. If you receive a second condition of the same type, treat it as hit point damage only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of your actions each round, you may attempt a Saving Throw to eliminate one condition currently affecting you. If you find yourself too damaged to be effective, you can take a RECOVER action, which eliminates all your currently checked conditions but is the only thing you can do that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
