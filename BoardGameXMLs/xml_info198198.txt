			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;The third game from Kunpu is bound to stir up some controversy amongst our current health-concerned society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smoking has been labeled as a dirty habit.&lt;br/&gt;Increasingly more places are banning smoking and the price of cigarettes is continuously raised. Tobacco has been villainized to the point that there are specialized clinics and monetary rewards from employers for quitting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But to heavy smokers, cigarettes are a simple pleasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players of this game become heavy smokers trying to smoke as many cigarettes as possible before their lungs turn completely black. Even if you fail to smoke during a round, your lungs may still grow progressively blacker all the same from the secondhand smoke of your peers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is both for those who are proud to call themselves smokers and those who disdain them. Outwit your fellow smokers to puff your way to victory (and an early grave).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets an ashtray in which they place smoked cigarettes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Draw 3 cards&lt;br/&gt;-Players choose 1-2 cards to place face-down on the table (one card must be a cigarette card)&lt;br/&gt;-Players open the chosen cards at the same time&lt;br/&gt;-The player with the highest number of cigarettes wins (unless special cards are involved)&lt;br/&gt;-The winning player can smoke that round (therefore he collects the cigarettes into his ashtray). However, he also must gather tokens that mark the deterioration of his lungs, based on the number of tokens written on the card(s) he played.&lt;br/&gt;-The losing players cannot smoke (they discard their opened cards) but they may receive the effect of secondhand smoke from the winner's played cards. They gather tokens according to this lung cost.&lt;br/&gt;-Refill hand and continue until someone reaches 10 lung tokens (and therefore dies of blackened lungs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate winner (even in death) is the person who smoked the most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
