							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">StarCluster 2 Biotechnology Guide</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The StarCluster Biotechnology Guide opens up new areas of interest for your campaign with an overview of biotechnological science in the StarCluster universe. In this guide, we explore biotech advances tech level by tech level, including genetic augmentation allowing characters to enhance characteristics, add abilities, and change their shape or appearance. The guide then moves on to Androids - completely synthetic people - and uplifted animals, with several common examples. Implanted devices are discussed, along with tissue replacement and cloning. Then the guide moves onto matter transmission, mind transplantation and stasis fields. Next, each tech level's version of cold sleep is described in detail, then food synthesis and hydroponics. At each step, the implications of that technology are examined, including public reaction to the genetically augmented, the ethics and morality of harvesting clones as tissue banks, and the public perception of immortality by mind transplantation, and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Guide will bust your game wide open. The only limit is your creativity!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
