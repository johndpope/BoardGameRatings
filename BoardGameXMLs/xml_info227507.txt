A south that until now was left unexplored by the peoples of Usarm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intrigued by the prospect of riches the Merchants Guilds of Newrk stretch their arms and money into the great southern desert of the Saragubi hoping to find new peoples and new cultures to trade with and to grow more wealthy by.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
