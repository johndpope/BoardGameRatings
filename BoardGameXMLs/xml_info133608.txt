							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Coiffeur-Jass</name>
									
			<description>A trick taking for 3 players or two partnerships played with Jass cards. The game is probably influenced by Barbu. Each player plays a number (8, 10, or more) of different contracts during the course of the game. The biggest difference between Barbu and Coiffeur-Jass is that players are trying to win as many valuable cards by capturing them in tricks. Typical contracts include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Acorns, Shields, Bells, Flowers: Play with the specified suit as trumps.&lt;br/&gt;    Obenabe: Play with no trumps.&lt;br/&gt;    Undenufe: Play with no trumps, but the ranks of the cards are reversed.&lt;br/&gt;    Slalom: Play with no trumps, but tricks are played alternately with the Obenabe and Undenufe rankings. &lt;br/&gt;    Gustav: Play with no trumps; either the first six tricks are played with the suits in Obenabe order and the next six tricks in Undenufe order, or vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;    Joker: Declarer chooses any of the above contracts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Switzerland, you can purchase blackboards that have a Coiffeur-Jass scoring table printed on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
