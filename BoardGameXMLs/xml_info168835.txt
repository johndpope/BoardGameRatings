			<description>A roll-and-move game for 2-8 people.&lt;br/&gt;Players agree on how much monney each player gets at the start of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player bets on which horse they want to race and then race their horse on the racing-track. If two or more players want to race the same horse, players draw which player gets to race the horse of choice.&lt;br/&gt;Horse 1-4 starts on starting-line 1, and horse 5-8 on starting-line 2. All horses use the same goal-line. As a compensation for starting on starting-line 2, the last four horses get one extra die-roll during the race. The race runs for two rounds around the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not allowed to pass the horse in front of you in the same track. You have to pass horses by changing the track and pass on the inside or outside. It's only allowed to change track acording to the arrows on the gameboard. So sometimes you'll be blocked from using a good die-roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Around the track you'll find spots in diferent colors. Each color have their own special-effect.&lt;br/&gt;Yellow: Double-spot.&lt;br/&gt;Red: Miss the next move, and other horses may pass in the same track (there may be two horses in the red spot).&lt;br/&gt;Green: Double the amount of your next die-roll.&lt;br/&gt;Blue: Use only one die next die-roll.&lt;br/&gt;Black: At the next die-roll, move forward only if getting dice of same value. Unless two-of-a-kind, move backwards in the same track according to the die-roll (you are not limited by other horses behind you).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to pass the goal-line after two rounds wins the race and receives the money in the pot and from each player the same amount of money the winning player put on his horse before the race. Maximum bid on a horse is 500.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
