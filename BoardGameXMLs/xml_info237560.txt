			<description>Each player will play as a corporation fostering particular political priorities such as Healthcare, Finance, Military, Foreign Affairs and Education. Each Bill will either benifit you or hinder your opponent. Use your vast wealth and influence to bend politicians to your will. Buy, bribe, cheat, steal and undermine your opponents as you try to gain the most profits.&amp;nbsp;Using influence and lobbying powers, &amp;nbsp;players will compete to influence the passing of bill. The winner is the corporation to have the most money at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
