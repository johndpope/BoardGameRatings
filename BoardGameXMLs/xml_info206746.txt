			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role-playing Adventures with Drunken Fratboys in the Age of AIDS&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Horndogs!&amp;quot; is all about adventures on the modern day college campus as you find it portrayed in such classic films as &amp;quot;Animal House&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Revenge of the Nerds,&amp;quot; but this material also can be used to recreate the characters and situations on the hit night-time show &amp;quot;Beverly Hills 90210.&amp;quot; In other words, we're encouraging players and GMs to enter a world populated by college campus stereotypes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose from six different types from which they build their characters, most of which whom living off mommy and daddy or sports scholarships while trying to squeeze a little classwork into their demanding schedules of getting the most out of their college experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character-types featured in this gamebook are the Frat Boys, Jocks, Sorority Girls, Cheerleaders, Dorm Dorks and Suffering Art Students. GMs and players are encouraged to invent their own character types besides the ones we provide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally published as text in 1994; published in 2008 as PDF (possibly by a third party).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
