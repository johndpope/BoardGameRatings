			<description>Here's your chance to prove how much you know about cars. 120 photos show all sorts of car types from all makes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course it's not just about knowing as many cars as possible. If you're really sharp, you'll also know what's &amp;quot;under the bonnet&amp;quot;. You'll find all of this on the back of the cards: top speed, horse power, acceleration, engine size, number of cylinders and weight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This German game is part of the Quartett series and can be played using Quartett rules. However, the game may also be played with Supertrumf rules by using the different car statistics printed on the back of each card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
