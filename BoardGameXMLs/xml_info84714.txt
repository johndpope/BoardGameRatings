			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you play the title-giving strong man who has to tackle all sorts of strength exercises like bending an iron bar or pulling a truck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Manual (BBC B Version)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In STRONGMAN you will have to take control of Geoff's body as he tries to complete each different event. You will also have total responsibility for the general condition and fitness of Geoff's body, trying to make sure that it is able to cope with the high demands each event will put on it, as well as having the stamina to get right through to the very end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help you with this Geoff's body has been divided into several different areas represented by MUSCLE ICONS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different events will use different muscles to a greater or lesser extent. For example, the arm muscles may be especially important during the log chop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each game level you will have a TRAINING SESSION.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During training you can build up each muscle area ready for the six events to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the gauge in any muscle area reaches zero, Geoff will collapse and you will have to start all over again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
