							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Titans of Empyrean</name>
									
			<description>There are worlds that are ruled by creatures of the sky, great beasts of mythology that have never known anything but dominance.  Generations ago, a rift opened up between these worlds and they became infested with invisible portals that led from one to the other but not necessarily back.  The result was a macrocosm that could not be mapped and in which no one could settle.  Now, thrust together, these great creatures have been locked in an infinite war, for each species believes that it is its world that is the primary and its right to take control of the new Empyrean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a player of Titans of Empyrean, you control a squad of 4 titans placed on a tiny hex battlefield in the sky.  Every moving, it is your responsibility to maneuver your titans into positions of opportunity and advantage.  Each unique titan has its own special ability and is armed with a deck of maneuver cards for use throughout the game.  But be careful.  While these powerful maneuvers can be the key to victory, they also double as lifeblood of your titans.  Without them, your titan's wounds cannot be healed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Position your titans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manage your maneuvers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will your titans control the new Empyrean?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
