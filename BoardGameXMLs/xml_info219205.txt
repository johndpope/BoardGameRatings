							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">APEX: An Otherverse America Sourcebook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the Otherverse America core rulebook details life within the Choicer and Lifer pseudo-nations, this sourcebook details life within neutral-territory America, and focuses heavily on the 22nd Century's premier military: APEX.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;APEX is America's most elite metahuman strike force, which operates independently of the Choicer pseudo-nation, and is based in the Washington D.C. Metroplex. APEX was founded during the 2020s, so the United States military would have access to a post-human army equal to anything fielded by other nations, terror groups and independent operators like RAINBOW Liberty. APEX is a check on the ever growing numbers of metahuman vigilantes, non-governmental organizations, terror cells and private security teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;APEX troops are among the best trained and best equipped in the Americas, drilled extensively in urban tactics, counter-terrorism, and anti-Powered warfare. In addition to exemplary training, APEX troops are enhanced with military grade genemods, combat focused object philosophy indoctrination and the best cyber-enhancement protocol money can buy. A single veteran APEX super soldier is designed to be a match for a full enemy light platoon, despite the huge costs involved in training and molding a soldier to that level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this massive sourcebook are a host of new player races. In the Otherverse America setting civilian genetic engineering is as common as tattooing, and each citizen of 22nd Century America is a species of one, custom designed to survive the rigors of a war-torn, segregated future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New human races have emerged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world's megacorps and America's military elite began using in-vitro gene-cutting to custom build workers and combat troops as early as the 2030s. The same &amp;lsquo;genetic revolution' that gave the world the AIDS cure, the first generation of engineered Powereds and laid the cornerstone of the Covenant pseudo-nation also gave birth to a new breed of slavery. A series of Supreme Court decisions during the 2050s freed many of the &amp;lsquo;engineered' races, and forced an already overstressed America to come to terms with the myriad new sentient species now living among them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
