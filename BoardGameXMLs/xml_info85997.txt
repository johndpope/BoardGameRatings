			<description>Introduction in the game manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a future not too far from now, the human race has become an endangered species, and the planet is now a wasteland of moldering ruins and lonely ghosts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without humans to maintain their creations, all that they had built is slowly begun to rot away.  Everything is silently relinquishing itself to the unyielding forces of nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For as far back as he could remember Seto lived in an abandoned observatory with a mysterious old man.  In the summer of his fifteenth year, the old man peacefully passed away, leaving Seto completely alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the only person he had ever known gone, Seto decided to head out into the world, keeping the old man's last promising words in his heart: You are not alone.  With that, he set out to find others like him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a land that only responds with the lonely echo of his voice, Seto sets out on a journey in the hopes that there is someone, anyone out there ... waiting for him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
