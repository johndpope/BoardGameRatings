			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your players attack the pirates, finding them in the cave at the end of their pirate cove. The pirates are defeated and of course there are buckets of gems and gold and... well... actually... most likely not. Pirates are also businessmen. The point of this is to make money, but you don't make money by just stealing money. You steal cargo. Chances are the cave is full of stolen shipments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And one of the most important resources throughout history is also one of the least thought about. Trees, and the wood that comes from them, are a vital part of a world. Now Trees of Fantasy provides you with 23 unique fantasy trees. Each tree comes with its own stat block, detailed explanation about its special properties, and how it impacts a campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beautifully illustrated by artist Larkin Livesay, this work also includes a host of new mundane items, weapons, armor, staves, variant wondrous items, and variant traps that take full advantage of the trees' unique properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
