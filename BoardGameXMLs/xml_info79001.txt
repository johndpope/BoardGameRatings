							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Growlanser II: The Sense of Justice</name>
									
			<description>Growlanser II: The Sense of Justice is the second game of the Growlanser series developed by Career Soft. It is the first game of the series to be a Tactical role-playing game, and carries on notable features from the first game such as branching storyline points and multiple endings. Due to the nature of these endings dealing with pairing up different characters, the series is often likened to the Dating sim genre. As a direct sequel to the first Growlanser, nearly all of the characters seen in the first game make a returning appearance as both playable and non-playable characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On December 7, 2004, Growlanser II, along with Growlanser III: The Dual Darkness, was released under a single title in North America, titled Growlanser Generations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Growlanser II: The Sense of Justice , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
