Like many legendary items, though, what became of the bracers is not known. Some say they were worn by a master thief and lost in a tomb or that they were stolen from an enchanter. Others claim that a goblin now wears them and is using their powers to gather an army. Whatever the case, if you wish to wear the bracers, you&amp;rsquo;ll have discover the truth, first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bracers of Barakus is a complete and free release from the Across the Realms: Artifacts and Items series from New Realms Publishing.
