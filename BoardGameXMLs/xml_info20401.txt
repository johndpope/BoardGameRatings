							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Steamy Scenes</name>
									
			<description>Players (couples selected at random) act out &amp;quot;steamy scenes&amp;quot; from well known movies, for the audience to guess&amp;quot; A sexier version of &amp;quot;charades&amp;quot; combined with &amp;quot;amorous amateur dramatics&amp;quot; could describe this fun game which will bring out the ACTOR WITHIN. It provides the opportunity to bring a semblance of professional detachment to a scene that some would find sensual, arousing or downright embarrassing. The two acting partners selected at random have 3 minutes to convince the audience of the title of a movie, playing in silence the scene(s) as described in detail on the card. A further 3 minutes is allowed for &amp;quot;charades&amp;quot; type play if the acting is not up to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
