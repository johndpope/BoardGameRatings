			<description>Schachadma (from &amp;quot;schach&amp;quot;, meaning chess, and &amp;quot;adma&amp;quot;, short for admiral) by Klaus W. Schomberg is a chess family game played on a 12x12 board, inspired by chess and battleships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each piece is a ship, with between one and four masts.  Each turn, a player moves or rotates a ship, after which all of that ship's cannons fire.  Enemy masts within range of the cannons are captured; when a ship has no masts left, it is also captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tallest mast on the largest ship represents the admiral; capturing an opponent's admiral wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
