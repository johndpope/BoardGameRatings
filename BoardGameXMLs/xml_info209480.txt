			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A merchant fleet, consisting of the prize ship Beleaguerer along with the Chancellor and Zephyr, is long overdue in returning to Skiff.  Approximately three weeks after the scheduled arrival time, a merchant ship captained by Red Lambert reaches Skiff and has a sailor from the Beleaguerer.  News travels quickly through town about the loss of the prize ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario has exceptionally high production values and is intended to be played with pre-generated characters (included).  It typically is distributed as a ZIP archive including the 27-page RTF adventure, three BMP files (maps), and two TIFF files (large maps).  The scenario has several features to support the Dungeon Master during play, including tracking lists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
