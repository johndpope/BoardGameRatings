							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flood Control Canal</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 48 x 30 inch Battlemap of a Flood Control Canal, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;So this is what is left of Los Angeles after the mega quake?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DramaScape brings a chase friendly map with the flood control canal. Driving through the canal is dangerous due to the many obstacles and can be even more deadly if there is a sudden flash flood threatening to crash into them from behind!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flood Control Canal is an exterior map of a concrete tunnel in a major metropolitan area such as Los Angeles. Flood control canals are usually large and empty. When the canal floods, water is drained away from the city into a nearby lake or ocean. A city bridge has fallen into the canal; meaning that this is map is set after a bridge collapse, earthquake, or a worse disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flood Control Canal is intended for use in modern or post-apocalyptic settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chased into the Canal: Survival in post mega quake Los Angeles is anything but a guarantee. The group is being chased by raiders. With the bridge out and paths behind him impassable due to the raiders, your driver chooses a maneuver out of pure desperation. He guns it down the dilapidated bridge and right into the flood control canal. The raiders are not willing to lose face by giving up the chase and follow the group down. Your driver needs to maneuver through the canal&amp;rsquo;s obstacles such as barricades and destroyed cars, while the rest of the group tries to fight off the raiders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
