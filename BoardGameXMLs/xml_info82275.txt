							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Incredible Shrinking Fireman</name>
									
			<description>The Incredible Shrinking Fireman is a computer game released by Mastertronic in 1986. The game was written by Andy Mitchell and David Kidd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Objective&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whilst beating back the flames of a blazing fire in a vast shrinking plant, Shuffling Sid fell into the jaws of a powerful shrinking machine and, not surprisingly, was shrunk. To unshrink shrunken Shuffling Sid, stretch him! To do this you will have to find the five parts of the Stretching Rack and put them together. After which Shuffling Sid will return to his original size. Not all the objects that you find will be useful. Not all exits will be obvious - try jumping up through the ceiling of some rooms and they will lead into different areas of the factory - and some of your exits will not be open until you have found the right object to let you pass through. But most of all beware of the ghosts and ghouls that haunt the factory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you unshrink shrunken Shuffling Sid?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Incredible shrinking fireman&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
