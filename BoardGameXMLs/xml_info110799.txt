			<description>Power Lines is a tile laying game for PiecePack in which players take turns placing tiles from a communal pool. One player is attempting to create rows, columns, or diagonals in which there are a majority of matching suits, while the opposing player is doing the same except for matching values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the 4x4 grid has been fully filled in, players score points for rows, columns, or 4-tile diagonals in which they have the largest matching set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although originally designed for the PiecePack game system, Power Lines is playable with a standard deck of playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
