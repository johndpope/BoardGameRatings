			<description>Described by the publisher as 'The Word Game of Utter Chaos'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A family game of utter chaos and craziness as players grab letters and shout words, all within a particular category.  Equally challenging for kids and adults.  Categories available for kids and families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once players fill the game board with letters, one person will draw a card with a list of categories. Players then scramble to grab as many pieces as they can by thinking of words that fit into the category and start with each letter. The categories vary in difficulty, so younger players can join in on simple sets like &amp;quot;dessert&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;seen at the supermarket&amp;quot; while more advanced players are challenged by &amp;quot;tools&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;historic events.&amp;quot; You can play until the board is cleared, or until all players are stumped, and the person with the most letters at the end wins. To level the playing field, each letter has a different color on the back &amp;mdash; players can agree to only award points to certain color pieces, adding an element of chance to the outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: Game board, 50 letter tokens, 50 cards (250 categories), scoring pad and pencil&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
