			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Backbreaker is an American football game for the PS3 and Xbox 360. The game allows the player to play as one of 56 built-in football teams, or create their own. There is space to create up to 32 custom teams for the game, as well as team logos, but Backbreaker does not include any NFL licensing. There are several single-player modes including Training Camp, Exhibition mode, Season mode, Road to Backbreaker mode, and the mini-game Tackle Alley. The Season mode allows the player to choose the teams in the league and features a drafting and scouting system. Training Camp includes a number of tutorials for both beginners and advanced players to improve their skills. Tackle Alley is a mini-game where the player controls a running back in their own endzone and attempts to score a touchdown while avoiding tackles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the single-player modes, Backbreaker features both local and online multiplayer. Two people can compete against each other or on the same team in games, or challenge each other in Tackle Alley. The online multiplayer does not support cooperative play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
