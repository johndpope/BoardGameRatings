							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Dogs</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2012 Laika returned, blasting through the stratosphere at several times the speed of sound. Thousands witnessed and recorded her flight before she vanished over Moscow. Over the next several years reports began to come in of dogs pulling people out of burning houses, catching people falling from buildings, or throwing themselves in the paths of bullets. These dogs seemed unhindered by the laws of physics or biology. Most assumed the stories to be hoaxes, and the dogs seem adept at disappearing, but a few people have started to watch their pets with suspension and even fear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During Stage 1 development this game was titled SUPER*DOG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
