							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Sector Defense</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your star sector is under attack.  While your shields hold out, you've got to repel the enemy spacecraft!  As you rotate and thrust your ship, you can use the black hole in the center to hyperspace out of danger, but then again... you might re-enter into even bigger trouble.  As an added bonus, [there is a] two-player option.  You and a friend can have a space war after you practice against the computer.  Color and sound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
