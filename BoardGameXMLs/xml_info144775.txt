			<description>Dai Sai Sou! includes 36 unique robo part cards with different characteristics, providing diversity to create up to 6 robos at once. Part cards have a maintenance gauge, defense, melee and range attacks, and a special ability. Players will use these parts to attack their opponent's robo. In addition, players will be able to use action cards to modify attacks and defend against oncoming bombardment. A dice roll plus your modifiers from the robo part you use to attack and action card will have to beat your opponent's armor for the robo part you attack. A successful hit lowers the opponents maintenance gauge, usually by one level.&lt;br/&gt;Parts will take damage when hit. If a part takes too much damage, they can become inoperable and are at risk of blowing up, leaving you more vulnerable. If a player disables too many parts or destroys the chest part of a robo, then that robo is destroyed. Some may be fortunate enough to collect the necessary cards to perform an ultimate attack that will turn their opponents&amp;rsquo; robo parts into scrap metal. Make sure you're the last one standing in this robo-royale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
