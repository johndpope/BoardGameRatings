							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Art of Defence II</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Art of Defence II, a book of combat related feats. The first Art of Defence detailed 11 feats that deal with different styles of combat. This book provides 32 feats that provide tactical options in combat. The d20 System combat mechanics allow for a great deal of strategy and tactics in battle. Art of Defence II provides feats that can be used by many different character types, not just broad-chested fighters brandishing greatswords. Some feats do apply to basic melee attacks, but many deal instead with tactical movement, leadership and teamwork, attacks of opportunity, or dealing with opponents in unusual ways. It your characters are ever involved in a fight, there's something here for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
