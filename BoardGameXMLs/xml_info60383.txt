			<description>From the first page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This game kit contains a geomorphic representation of a Evil Wizard's stronghold, arrangeable in an endless variety of patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A holding force composed of a variety of evil creatures face a mixed group of lawful adventurers seeking to rescue a maiden fair held deep within the stronghold.  (Kinda gets you right there, doesn't it?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the evil player, you design a labyrinth from the geomorphic sections provided and distribute your deadly forces in secret to impede the progress of the questing force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the leader of the questing force, you must overpower guards (swiftly, to prevent alarms from being given), search out the rooms to find the best approach to reach and rescue the maidon (who also, by the way, happens to be a princess, which is usual in these things).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some rules are provided but it looks like it would be best used as a supplement and background for other RPGs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
