			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Photon Galactic Traders is a free print and play game for 1 player.&lt;br/&gt;It puts you in the captains seat of a Hammerhead class cargo vessel, tasked with transporting goods through pirate infested space to a destination planet. You must choose your crew wisely to achieve this goal, then effectively command them throughout the voyage to ensure your cargo is intact when you finally dock. You will issue firing orders, request scans, change power priorities, assign repairs, adjust speed and you can even take a detour to investigate areas of interest. All the while, pirates will be attacking you in an attempt to knock out your engines, shields and weapons, thereby allowing them to board your ship and loot the cargo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the mission, you will be paid for any cargo you have remaining, but you will also have an bonuses and expenses to factor into your final pay - bonuses consist of bounties for pirates destroyed, or an early arrival bonus if you manage to get there before your ETA - expenses include fines for any neutral targets you may have killed, and repair costs which can be astronomical if your ship is too badly beaten up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was an entry into the 2016 Solitaire PNP Design Contest&lt;br/&gt;Winner - Best Sci-Fi Themed Game&lt;br/&gt;2nd place - Best Advanced PnP Build&lt;br/&gt;2nd place - Best Original Artwork&lt;br/&gt;3rd place - Best Graphic Design&lt;br/&gt;5th place - Best Written Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
