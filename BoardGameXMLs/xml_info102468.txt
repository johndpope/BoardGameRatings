							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Extase</name>
									
			<description>Extase is a computer game that was created in 1990 by Cryo Interactive, and published by Virgin Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It features some puzzles involving a sleeping female android that the player needed to wake up by cleaning its circuit. Each level represented a different level of emotion until the final extase (ecstasy). The gameplay mechanic is based on the &amp;quot;Brain Bowler&amp;quot; minigame in Purple Saturn Day, an 'alien sports' compilation created by the Cryo team under the name ERE and published by Epyx.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The music was designed by St&amp;eacute;phane Picq, and was co-credited to Philippe Eidel, and The Bulgarian Voices. It punctuated each action of the player or each event, becoming gradually richer until the level was finally completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Extase (computer game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
