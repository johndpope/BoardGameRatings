							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Great Empires</name>
									
			<description>In Great Empires you choose one of the great civilizations in history and pit your luck and skill against other greats to prove your mettle! Do you rush your enemy with basic infantry, or do you hold out for your elite troops and your commander? Does your god shine his blessing upon you, ensuring your victory, or do suffer crushing defeat?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll dice, scoring Troops, Elites, and Commanders, while avoiding the dreaded Defeat dice, in an attempt to knock their opponents out of the game! The Blessing die adds another level of excitement, giving players a chance to bask in the blessing of their god, granting bonuses!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get your opponents down to 0 points to win, but make sure to reinforce before you find yourself at 0 points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
