			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes control of a space ship which can travel through space and time. While the ship is in dire need of repair the only hope for the player to escape the enemy Microids and Hoods who are hunting him is to repair his ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do so he has to get four different parts for his ship which have to be build by four different civilizations which are not yet even existing. So the player plants those races on different planets and travels through time to help them develop and master each crisis they meet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the meantime the player has to fight of the enemy race and gather enough fuel for the required time travels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
