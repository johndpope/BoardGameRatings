			<description>&amp;quot;Spill the letter discs into the tray - Race to spell as many words as you can!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A word game similar to Boggle. A 4x4 grid of letters is created using 50 circular discs with letters printed on them which are sealed in a shaker. The aim is to form as many words as possible within the time limit, longer words scoring more points. A blank disc can be used as any letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No designer or publisher is credited. The box lists the game as being &amp;quot;imported by W.H.Smith.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
