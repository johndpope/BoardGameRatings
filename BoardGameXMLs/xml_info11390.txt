			<description>Are there more people living in Vietnam than in Germany? Are the Swiss citizens richer than citizens from Singapore? Is Malta more densely populated than the Netherlands?&lt;br/&gt;You don't know it? Worry not - just guess, poker, bluff to beat the other players. And after each game you know a little more about the countries of the world. &lt;br/&gt;The World Factgame is a game about numbers, facts and data of all 191 UN member states. Each country is represented by a card containing information about geography, population and economy.&lt;br/&gt; Each player receives nine of these cards, and may only look at front displaying the name of the country, it's flag and it's geographical outline. Each player in turn puts a card on the table, trying to put them in rank order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct data revealed.&lt;br/&gt;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
