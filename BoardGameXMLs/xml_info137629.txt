			<description>Nubulus is the classical logical game created by Marek Łukaszewicz in Sepember 2011. This strategic game for two players is played on the board 8x9 squares. It is a transformation of checkers with the difference that the pawns move forwards, right or left, but they capture diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to reach the opponent's side of the board or to eliminate all the opponent's pawns.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 14 pawns at the beginning of the match&lt;br/&gt;The capturing is obligatory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The pawns can only move forwards, left or right, one square at a time, changing the colour of the square.&lt;br/&gt;2. A pawn making a capturing move (a jump) leaps over one of the opponent's pawns. Only one pawn may be captured in a single jump; however, when possible the player must perform multiple jumps in one move.&lt;br/&gt;3. The pawns capture opposing pawns by jumping over them to the nearest square of the same colour. To do this they may only move diagonally in four directions, not to the left or to the right, forwards or backwards.&lt;br/&gt;4. Captured pawns are removed from the chessboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
