			<description>Trivia game in which the goal is to advance on a career ladder (from intern to editor in chief). The players take turns rolling a die. When they land on a normal field, they have to answer the question with the same number they rolled from a card with six questions. When answering correctly, they can roll again. On a &amp;quot;category field&amp;quot;, a player has to answer a question from that particular category to advance on the ladder. The first to become editor in chief wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
