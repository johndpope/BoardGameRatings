			<description>An abstract game played on two chessboards and with stackable reversible counters.  The boards are seen as flip-sides of each other (like sides of a coin), one player starts setup in the center of one side, the other in the center of the other side, with the goal being to have only your markers on the other player's side.  Pieces can move farther and jump more adjacent pieces if they are stacked (up to 3 high).  If pieces are jumped over they are either converted to the other color or eliminated, depending on how many pieces have been jumped over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full rules at: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20070504174755/http&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070504174755/http&lt;/a&gt;://www.luchacabra.com/?p=24&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
