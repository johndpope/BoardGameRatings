			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Regrettable Tattoo players take turns playing ridiculous tattoos on one another. The strategic placement of these tattoos racks up points on the other player's bodies. It&amp;rsquo;s not actually about how many crazy tattoo&amp;rsquo;s you have, but how they are arranged on your body! The person with the least points against them is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regrettable Tattoo is a fun casual card game that takes less than a minute to learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Double-sided hex cards are played on players in a domino like fashion creating an array of weird tattoos. The base game is for 2-4 players with expansions to follow allowing for more players. Or mix two base sets and play with 5-8 players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
