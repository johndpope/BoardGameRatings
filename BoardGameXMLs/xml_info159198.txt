			<description>Trivial Pursuit: TV Edition was released both as this Master Game and as additional cards: Trivial Pursuit: TV Edition – Card Set&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A different edition was released as Trivial Pursuit: TV Edition – 4,800 Questions and Answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Categories include: Classics, Sitcoms, Drama, Kids &amp;amp; Games, Stars, and Wild Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a circular playing piece with six pie-shaped holes. The goal of the game is to collect a pie in each color. The colors correspond to different question categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of a circular track with spaces in seven different colors. Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are &amp;quot;pie spaces&amp;quot;, and from these there are &amp;quot;spokes&amp;quot; of track leading to the middle of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
