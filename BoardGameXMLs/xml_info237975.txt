			<description>The continuation of well-known party hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How many professions starting with the letter &amp;quot;M&amp;quot; can you name in a minute? Who can come up with the longest first name starting with &amp;quot;U&amp;quot;? Who can call the shortest drink starting with &amp;quot;R&amp;quot;? Who will be the first to name a thing that is cheaper than two dollars or an object that can be found only in the countryside...starting with &amp;quot;Z&amp;quot;? Think faster, or else your opponents will get ahead of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think It Up! is a game for parties and family get-togethers. Each turn you draw letter and category cards, then show your great skills of reaction, trying to be the first player to come up with the right word. You do not have to be the know-it-all to win &amp;mdash; you just have to be the fastest thinker!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
