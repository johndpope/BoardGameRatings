							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">King of the Hills: The Battle of Kap-Yong, April 23-25, 1951</name>
									
			<description>Paul Rohrbaugh's first game set in the Korean War! When the Communist Chinese renewed their offensive against UN forces the front line of the Allies once again collapsed. However, the 27th Commonwealth Brigade, comprised of battalions from Great Britain, Canada and Australia, and supported by forces from New Zealand and the United States, held off the Communist onslaught for a crucial three days along the heights surrounding the village of Kap-Yong, allowing the UN forces to regroup and eventually defeat the Chinese offensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will have two 11 by 17 map sections, 280 single-sided, un-mounted counters, and about 10 pages of rules and charts. Graphics are by Bruce Yearian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
