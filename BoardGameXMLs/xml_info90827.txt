			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MotoGP 4 is the fourth title in Namco&amp;rsquo;s motorcycle Grand Prix series. The game is based on the 2004 season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is the most expansive in the series to-date, and includes 79 real riders and 16 tracks from the championship, as well as 3 bonus tracks. There are three main game modes: Season, Arcade, and Challenge. Season mode sets the player in a 16 race circuit where they earn points based on their place in each race. Arcade mode is a single race exhibition, while Challenge mode is a set of 125 tasks that unlock bonus content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MotoGP 4 is a unique blend of arcade and simulation racing, and there are a number of control options that allow players to set which end of the spectrum they race in. New to the series is the Parts Challenge in Season mode. In between races, a mechanic will offer a part up that will improve the player&amp;rsquo;s bike, but they must succeed in a challenge in order to earn it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8 player online play is available for the first time in the series. Players can also match skills in 4 player local multiplayer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
