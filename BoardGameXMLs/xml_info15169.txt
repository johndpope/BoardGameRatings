			<description>This &amp;quot;Age of Battles&amp;quot; series game covers introducing &amp;quot;Europeans against the Mongols!&amp;quot; As per their usual standards of quality, these are an excellent addition for those that wish to involve their many boxes of 'Army Men' into a gaming environment. This 'series' may well become the 'standard' for making MINIS gaming more popular in its appeal to newcomers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invasion of Mongols is a classic step-by-step strategy game, i.e. players make moves in turn by moving their troops on a map and roll dice to learn the results of their actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is dedicated to the events of the Mongol invasion of Rus' in 1237-40. One player commands the princes of Rus and the other leads the Mongol hordes. The game has 3 levels - financial-political, strategic, and tactical. It means that a player collects money, forms an army, leads them in marches, and commands them in a battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
