							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dan Dare Space-Ship Construction Game</name>
									
			<description>Dane Dare is an English science fiction comic hero from the 1950s. Game play is related to Jumbolino where interlocking pieces are put together on the roll of the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players pieces are the outershell of the Dan Dare spaceship and are individually numbered. Each player has an identical and equal number of pieces to construct by the roll of the dice. The combined number on the dice roll (i.e. 2 to 12) designates which piece is selected to be be placed on the game board. How they construct their ship may not be in the same order (i.e player 1 may throw a 7 to enable an engine piece (numbered 7) to be placed on the playing board / Player 2 may then throw a 12 to enable to place the cockpit (numbered 12) on his side of the playing board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player that constructs their spaceship first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
