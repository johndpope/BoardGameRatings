							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Centennial Presidential Game</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's catalog: &amp;quot;These are large and showy games new in plan and style. Played with an indicator... 56 cards giving the Presidents and Vice Presidents of the U.S. with other useful data... Color numbers and pairs the basis of the game... Essentially very different from anything on our list... An instructive novelty.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This antique card game was produced to coincide with the United States' Centennial. In came in a colorfully illustrated 4.5 x 7.5 inch box. The components included a set of 56 cards (each marked with the name of a President or Vice President and historical data), a spinner, and four numbered sheets (two red and two blue with numbers marked in a 3 x 4 grid.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unusual spinner, referred to as an &amp;quot;indicator&amp;quot;, was marked with the numbers 1 to 6 and had two spinning arrows. The publisher was apparently particularly proud of this component, as indicated by the information printed on the back of it:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;McLoughlin Bros.' Indicator. A Complete and Unobjectionable Substitute for, and Improvement Upon Dice, Teetotums, &amp;amp;c. It's various uses. 1st--As a substitute for Dice, spin the Arrows, and play with the numbers at the points of both Arrows. 2d--As a substitute for Teetotums, use the number at the point of the black Arrow only. NOTE--Should an Arrow stop on a line, both Arrows should be spun again.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
