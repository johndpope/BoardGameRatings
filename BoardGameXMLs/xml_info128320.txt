			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flying Mice's StarCluster game gets updated in a big way with the new third edition game. This is the Light Edition, with Chargen, Equipment, and Resolution Sub-Systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Play human, humanoid, alien, robotic, uplifted, or bioroid characters&lt;br/&gt;     Use morphing active plasteel equipment&lt;br/&gt;     Create your own Weapons&lt;br/&gt;     Four different Task Resolution sub-systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New Cluster&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game of StarCluster, you play civilians in the cluster, of any type. You can play Troupe style, with each player having more than one character, or standard single characters. You might be actors traveling in a showboat to backward colonies, or resource extractors stealing valuable hardwoods from a virgin planet, or merchanters trading from planet to planet, or insurance adjusters investigating a rash of spaceship accidents, or detectives unravelling bizarre crimes in a seedy city flushed with neon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humans came to the Cluster 500 years ago in slower than light ships, fleeting an unimaginable catastrophe in their home system. Now they are the dominant species in the Cluster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technology is very advanced in the Cluster. Active plasteel allows devices, vehicles, and even homes to change shape as required. Shrouds allow mental control over devices. Modifications, even radical ones, can be performed before or after birth. Soul Print locks open only to you, no matter what - or whose - shape you wear. Still, most humans in the Cluster are recognizably human. The weirder offshoots tend to drift to the fringes of society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;StarCluster 3 Light Edition comes with four different resolution mechanic sub-systems - StarPerc roll-under percentage, StarKarma diceless, StarNova d6 pool add and roll-over, and StarRisk - where you can play it safe and get a mild success, or roll and chance failure to get a better result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
