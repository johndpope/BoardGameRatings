							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oh...Sir!! The Insult Simulator</name>
									
			<description>The parrot is back from the dead bringing countless new insults for your disposal, Sir! Remember that silly game that parted lovers, destroyed families and turned friends into enemies? Here&amp;rsquo;s its successor that does even more, certainly with more style and more variety. And I have proof! This time you can spread affront to everyone in the world that has Internet access or &amp;ndash; if you&amp;rsquo;re not the most sociable &amp;ndash; you can sit alone and play with yourself. Nudge nudge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So don&amp;rsquo;t let the parrot die for nothing and tell that grumpy old lady that her husband donated organs for a strange woman lying in a pond and that her sister poses nude for some dog. Then meet a retired hipster who admires pictures of a grunting sow, and a fake Russian who borrowed a dead body to put his teacup and crumpets on. It&amp;rsquo;s also the only game that lets you learn what&amp;rsquo;s The Meaning of Life, and that&amp;rsquo;s scientifically proven!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loner&amp;rsquo;s Insult Tournament Mode: Battle your way through numerous unique situations and verbally assault your CPU&lt;br/&gt;Real-Life Friends Mode: Belliger your actual friends on a couch, ottoman, or whatever else you like to rest your fanny on&lt;br/&gt;Imaginary-Friends Mode: Verbally take down strangers from all over the world online, and bring the witty pain across any device&lt;br/&gt;5 Hilarious Playable Characters: Each with their own unique voices, quirky traits and hilarious &amp;ldquo;insult bits&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;4 Conflict Scenarios: Lay down some verbal jujitsu across 4 different testy situations and environments&lt;br/&gt;Contentious Battle System: Employ combos, criticals, continuations and other new mechanics to outwit your argumentative opponents!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
