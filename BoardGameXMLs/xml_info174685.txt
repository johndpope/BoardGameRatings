							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great Dreidel Race!</name>
									
			<description>The Great Dreidel Race is a roll-and-move game contained in The Great Big Box of Hanukkah Fun. Players use dreidels and playing pieces, rolling a die to move them along a track.  Along the way, they may encounter a variety of spaces that will help or hinder them.  Some spaces move the player forward or back, others may cause gain or loss of a turn, some move other players' dreidels, some offer shortcuts.  When landing on a &amp;quot;spin&amp;quot; space, a player must spin his or her dreidel and move to the space corresponding to the Hebrew letter spun.  If a player lands on another player's dreidel, the other player is sent back to the nearest space marked with a candle.  The first player to reach the finish space wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
