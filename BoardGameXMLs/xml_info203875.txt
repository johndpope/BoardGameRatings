							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Poisoner&#039;s Pour</name>
									
			<description>Each round one player will be the Pourer. They will take the Drink Cards and decide where the poison will be placed around the Center Mat. The Center Mat has 5 places to set drinks that&lt;br/&gt;give 0 to 3 Gold to the person that takes from it. Starting with the player on the Pourer's left, each player will take a Drink Card and adjust their Gold level based on where they took the&lt;br/&gt;drink from. Once every player has taken a Drink Card the Pourer will take the last one for themselves. All players will then Reveal which Drink Card they have taken and adjust their&lt;br/&gt;Poison level accordingly. When a player reaches 10 Gold or is the last one standing they win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes Poisoner's Pour tricky is figuring out where the Pourer placed the poison. They can tell you as little or as much as they like and are probably lying when they do. Or are they?&lt;br/&gt;Can you guess where they would place it knowing that they know you are trying to out&amp;shy;think them? Are they counting on you to know that you know they know your are trying to think like them? You just have to take a drink and hope you know them as well as you think you do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
