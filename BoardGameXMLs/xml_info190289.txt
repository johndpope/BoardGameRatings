			<description>An Adventure Puzzle Game for QR Codes. This is a single-player game that uses a set of rules built around movement within QR codes. You are an adventurer in a maze and must escape with the treasure while avoiding the minoqaur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You enter the maze at the open spaces next to the corner-squares on the QR code. A sword, a key, and a cloak are drawn in each of those corner squares. A treasure is placed in the smaller square on the lower-right. The minoquar starts in the exact center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to get to the treasure and then escape (either via one of the entrances, or using the key) without encountering the minoquar. In each turn, you will move or tunnel, then the minoquar will move or tunnel towards you. Movement is tracked by drawing straight lines through the white corridors of the QR code maze. Walls are represented as black lines and must be avoided or tunneled through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
