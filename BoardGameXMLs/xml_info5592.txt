			<description>This is a simple deduction game.  Player's take on the roles of 'Deputies' and attempt to track down the outlaw known as &amp;quot;The Chief&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six Clue cards, distributed at various locations around the board, tell you who is not The Chief.  The remaining outlaws will hinder your investigation. The game is basically a race game to find all of the clues before your opponents and to drag the guilty culprit back to jail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with large cardboard building that are placed on the board. The look of a small western town gives a little flavor to an otherwise bland game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
