							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Holistic: quint sequencing card game</name>
									
			<description>Holistic is an abstract sequencing game that combines set-collecting and trick-taking in a compact 81-card deck. Each card has a number from 1 to 9, and one of nine shapes. Win by taking the most quints, or placing the final matching card in a sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original name of this game is long lost and is mostly referred to as a holistic quint sequencing card game and is there for given the name Holistic for short. One text passage refers to the leviathan chain, but if this is the name of the game or some other principal is still unclear. A suggestion is that this game is better named Quint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Holistic was according to Erik Magus L&amp;aring;ng first played on scientific principles by a party of gentlemen who frequented the Holland House, Arkum Street, Hundon (Borough of St Edmundsbury) around 1728. but the game never became fashionable. To be a member of this group you had to write and published research, trivia games or myths of the souls journey, which is the cause records of it still exists today. The game was much later rediscovered and painstakingly recreated by a historian and game design researcher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is party mention in the book &amp;ldquo;A Short Treatise on the Game of Yellow King&amp;rdquo; published in 1742, in &amp;ldquo;The Principles of holism and its Practice Illustrated on an Original System, by Means of Hands, Numbers and Symbols&amp;rdquo; published in 1862 and in the incomplete manuscripts and personal diary of the above mention Magus L&amp;aring;ng. Holism is the belief that the parts of something are intimately interconnected and explicable only by reference to the whole, emphasizing the importance of the whole and the interdependence of its parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
