			<description>Booktastic!&lt;br/&gt;Family Edition&lt;br/&gt;for ages 10 and up&lt;br/&gt;Features Children's Literature!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Booktastic is a fun-for-the-whole-family game that combines traditional strategic and competitive play with the sharing of literary trivia! Booktastic appeals to rudimentary readers, bookish braniacs, and everyone in between. Because the casual reader questions are opinion-based and have no wrong answers, anyone can play including children and non-readers. During the game players move around a quaint town square of bookstores to buy, sell, and trade books according to a collection card they receive at the beginning of the game. Before each turn, players earn money by choosing question cards. The player with the most valuable collection of books and cash at the end of the game wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
