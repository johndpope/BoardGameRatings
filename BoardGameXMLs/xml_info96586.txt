			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this 9-page PDF, written by Michael Hammes, are twelve items that have an evil or harmful influence upon the greater world around them. As such they are either intended for use only by evil individuals and/or using them always involves harming others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The items in this PDF are intended for use by NPCs within the campaign and to act as adventure and campaign catalysts; that's not to say that the PCs cannot end up using them, but rather that they are intended to provide opposition to the PCs and, in many cases, to be items whose destruction should become one of the PCs? main goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
