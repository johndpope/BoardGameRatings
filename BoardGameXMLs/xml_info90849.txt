			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to earn maximum points judiciously revive France as a puzzle. The board represents the hexagon National (without DOM but with Corsica!). The game consists of many pieces of the puzzle of departments, as well as tokens indicating the prefectures or departmental specialties.&lt;br/&gt;Initially each player draws 5 counties, 10 prefectures and 10 specialties, and each poses its puzzle pieces and a cache behind chips individually. In turn, the players put pieces in the correct spaces beginning with peripheral places (or coastal) and can put together non-coastal places provided they are placed adjacent to the already in place spaces. Thus France will fill the edges toward the center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player may ask the prefecture or the specialty in the corresponding space, provided he/she has needed token and collects extra points. If the player can not ask any evidence, he filed a reserve one of its departments and takes one back into the pile. After playing, the player takes all the puzzle pieces or chips in the pile that the number had (the reserve is used when the original deck is empty).&lt;br/&gt;One space on board alone is worth 10 points (and one prefecture alone or in a specialty only), a department with his or her specialty prefecture reported 50 points, 30 points for the prefecture and the specialty, and finally 100 points by asking the 3 elements of same department. The game stops at the laying of the latter department. A penalty of 10 points is imposed for any pawn prefecture or specialty kept on hand.&lt;br/&gt;The highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
