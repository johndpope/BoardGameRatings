			<description>Palamedes is an multiplatform video game released by the Taito in 1990. The video game was a Japan-exclusive release for all versions except the NES version (which became the only North American release of the game and the series). In North America, Palamedes had to compete with Tetris and Dr. Mario for retail space and sales (because those three games were released around the same time as each other).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Palamedes is a puzzle game requiring the player to match the dice they are holding to the dice on top of the screen. Using the &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; button, the player can change the number on his/her dice, then throw the dice using the &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; button when it matches the dice at the top of the screen, which wipes the target dice off the screen. The player can play in &amp;quot;solitaire&amp;quot; mode against the computer or another player, or &amp;quot;tournament&amp;quot; mode against AI opponents. There are six sides and numbers on the dice, making an attempt to match all the numbers on the screen and eliminating them a challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ports&lt;br/&gt;Ports of the game were published for the NES, MSX, FM-Towns and Game Boy by Hot-B. The Japan-only sequel, Palamedes 2: Star Twinkles, was released in 1991 for the NES by Hot-B. It featured many of the same basic gameplay elements as the original game along with a completely new background for the levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Palamedes (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
