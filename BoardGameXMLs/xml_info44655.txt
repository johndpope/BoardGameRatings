			<description>The H&amp;acirc;rnMaster character generation system gives players a rich H&amp;acirc;rnic experience. Characters may start the game with a wide variety of interesting occupations, and at various levels of experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introductions to religious, Shek-Pvar, and Military occupations are included. Average incomes for all occupations and information about the guild system is included. Character contacts with (potentially) influential people are generated allowing players to explore relationships and advance their social standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;H&amp;acirc;rnMaster uses a realistic interactive combat system that gives players many tactical options to control their combat destiny. The system is elegant, simple and easy to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is largely unchanged from the second edition and migration is easy. For example, the same character sheet is used. Also the Magic and Religion supplements are 100% compatible with 2nd and 3rd editions of H&amp;acirc;rnMaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;H&amp;acirc;rnMaster 3 Mounted combat is now as an integral part of the combat system. SIZE rules are included to make combat with larger/smaller creatures more accurate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BESTIARY&lt;br/&gt;The bestiary includes articles about some unique H&amp;acirc;rnic creatures (Ivashu, Gargun and Yelgri) as well as statistics for many other creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
