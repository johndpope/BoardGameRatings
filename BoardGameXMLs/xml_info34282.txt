			<description>From a copy of the rules put out by Gamesarchives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutral by V.E. MORRILL CO, was produced in 1914. It is a game consistent with current history. The striking difference between Neutral and other games in which tricks and trumps figure a part of, consists of the suit of Neutral Cards representing the United States, played under certain restrictions as described in the rules which are supreme over trumps and all other cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with 48 cards divided into 8 suits. 40 cards represent the 5 principle warring countries; Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia and Austria. The cards of the warring nations are termed &amp;quot;Belligerents&amp;quot;.  Each set of Belligerent cards consist of The Ruler(value 8), General (7), Colonel (6), Major(5), Captain(4), Lieutenant(3), Sergent(2), and Corporal(1).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The United States represented by 8 cards plays the role of Neutral and Peacemaker to all of the warring nations.. Any trick won by the United States is neutralized and theoretically removed from the conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played like most other trump games with players bidding to be able to establish trumps and then win a certain number of tricks. The established trumps win tricks if played on tricks where you have none of the lead suit but Neutral Trumps beat established trumps if they are played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you succeed with your bid you score points, if you fail you score nothing. Each Neutral trick won scores 2 points + 1 point if the ruler card is included in the traick (The US ruler card is President Wilson). Ruler cards won in  &amp;quot;Belligerent tricks scores nothing. Game consists of first to score 50 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
