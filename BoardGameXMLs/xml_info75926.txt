			<description>From Wikipedia &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coded Arms is a first-person shooter video game that was developed and published by Konami for the PlayStation Portable handheld in 2005. Tentatively it was titled &amp;quot;Exploration Based Horror FPS&amp;quot;. The game takes place inside a virtual reality military training simulator, which has been abandoned. However, the program continues to run, generating enemies for the no longer present soldiers-in-training. The player takes the role of one of the many hackers attempting to break the codes of the simulator and derive the most valuable data possible. To do this the player must explore several &amp;quot;sectors&amp;quot; that are infested with various kinds of enemies, including soldiers, giant bugs and security bots. The only way to survive and get the greatest rewards is by destroying the enemies and the bosses at the end of the most difficult sectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
