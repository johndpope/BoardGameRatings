			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;Evil Grows in the Heart of the Ogre Lands&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Age of Dreams, ogres were beautiful creatures who built fantastic cities and ruled over the greatest civilization on all of Krynn. They eventually fell prey to their own decadence--their culture collapsed into barbarism while the ogres themselves degenerated into their current repulsive forms. Recently, however, a new form of ogre has emerged. These titans are gigantic, highly intelligent creatures who claim to hold the key to regaining the ogres' lost beauty and power. Already the titans have begun to reclaim their former position in Ansalon through conquest and slavery!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rise of the Titans contains details accounts of ogre culture, describes the countries of Blode and Kern, provides new hero roles, and introduces rules for playing ogre heroes. It also presents an adventure that takes your heroes deep into the ogre realms to rescue kidnapped Silvanesti diplomats and prevent the titans from spreading their evil across the face of Ansalon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring a story concept by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rise of the Titans is the second in the Battle Lines series of adventures that tie in with the War of Souls novel series. This adventure is playable with the SAGA game rules introduced in the DRAGONLANCE: FIFTH AGE boxed set and with the AD&amp;amp;D game as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
