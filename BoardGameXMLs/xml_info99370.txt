			<description>OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME:&lt;br/&gt;Each teams have to achieve more points than the adversary. The score is calculated according to the table shown on last page, at the end of match. The winner is the team who builds the greater number of bigger squares, given that the score is the sum of the value of the built cubes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP THE GAME:&lt;br/&gt;The players meet around the game board (ex. 4 players: Blue player, Yellow player, Blue player, Yellow player), so that they represent each player&amp;rsquo;s turn. It is a custom that the game should start with a move from the Blue team and to proceed among the players of the teams in clockwise fashion. At the beginning of the match the board has no pieces and the two teams have all their pieces yet to be played respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY:&lt;br/&gt;Each player on his turn can make only one of these operations:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Place of a piece;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Move of a piece;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Pass the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br/&gt;The match ends when all pieces have been placed and, therefore, the teams cannot make further moves. Interestingly, one of the teams will finish it&amp;rsquo;s pieces before the other team and so can only make the movement (or pass) waiting for the opponent team to finish its remaining pieces. This phase is called the closure of the game. During the closure the team with pieces cannot move or pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
