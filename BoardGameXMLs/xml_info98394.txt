							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anima Tactics: Saint Hazael</name>
									
			<description>Publihser Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hazael, the predestined girl, is the only person in the almost thousand years of Abel history that has been declared a saint even before being born. She came into the world marked by one of the prophecies of Grimoire, who foretold centuries ago that Hazael&amp;rsquo;s powers would be indispensable in the darkest moments of the Church. The Saint has an innate talent for invocation and she is capable of calling sacred creatures with the same simplicity that others breathe. She does not possess intrinsic knowledge of rituals, nor does she need it; elements respond to her as though they where her old friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warrior/Mystic - Light Church - Level 55&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summoner Level: 2&lt;br/&gt;Affinity: Light&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innate Abilities: Flight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sacred Charge (Ki, Charge) - +2 Damage. This Charge cause Throw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exorcism (Magic, Effect) - A Dark enemy Unit within Hazael's Control Zone loses 6 Life Points. Effect: 14.&lt;br/&gt;Limit: Once per Turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winged Hurricane (Ki, Effect) - Hazael's controller may move each small based enemy Unit that is engaged with Hazael up to 2 inches away from her. Hazael's Controller determines the direction of that movement as if the enemy Unit were Pushed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wall of Shields (Magic, Dodge) - +3 to Dodge. Hazael gets +2 Armor until the end of the Turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pewter figure is unpainted and unassembled. Requires additional Anima Tactics figures to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
