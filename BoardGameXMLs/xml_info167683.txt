			<description>Oo-Topos is an interactive fiction game released by Polarware in 1987. Oo-Topos was originally published by Sentient Software in 1981 as a text only adventure game. The 1987 re-release added graphical depictions of scenes described by the game's text, which were designed using Penguin Software's in-house software tool Graphics Magician.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pilot of a space vessel is carrying important cargo vital to the survival of humanity. The pilot is attacked by space pirates and forced to land on the planet Oo-Topos. After landing the pilot is captured and imprisoned in a fortress on the alien world. The pilot must escape confinement, retrieve the precious cargo taken from the crashed ship and get off Oo-Topos with it in order to save the human race from extinction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Oo-Topos&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
