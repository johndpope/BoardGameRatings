							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Roleplaying Games for Absolute Beginners</name>
									
			<description>At its most basic, a role-playing game (RPG) allows you to pretend to be a character in a story. This short booklet is a clear, jargon-free introduction to both the concept and the hobby of roleplaying games. 'Roleplaying for the Absolute Beginner' is suitable for everyone, but especially for those who want to explain their hobby to their family and friends, and for concerned parents who have no idea what gaming is about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
