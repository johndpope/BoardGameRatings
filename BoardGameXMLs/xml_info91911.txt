							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fire Truck</name>
									
			<description>Fire Truck is a black-and-white 1978 arcade game. It was developed and published by Atari, Inc. It's the first video game with cooperative gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there is no real &amp;quot;goal&amp;quot; to the game, Fire Truck is considered to be a &amp;quot;racing game&amp;quot; where the two players must cooperate to drive the truck through traffic as far as possible without crashing. While the game can be played with one player, it was clearly meant to be played with two. The front player controls the gas and brakes, while the rear player controls the steering. The cabinet also provides the players with bells and horns, although these have no use in the actual game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Fire Truck (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
