							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hero Kids Compatible Random Monster Selector</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an insert for a GM screen to allow the GM of a Hero Kids game to quickly generate a random selection of monsters for on-the-fly encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This includes all the monsters from the Monster Compendium, so purchasing the official Hero Kids Monster Compendium is highly recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each monster is given a point value based on their stats, which lets you know when you have generated enough monsters for the difficulty of a given encounter. These values can also be used to give an idea of how much the difficulty of an encounter will be tweaked by adding or removing a monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Difficulty value of an encounter based on player counts is also included. These values are generated based on the average difficulty of each official adventure module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
