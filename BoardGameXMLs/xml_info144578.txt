							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cube of Death</name>
									
			<description>Cube of Death is a role playing game that uses geek trivia to resolve actions. This is played with two teams generally of two or three players each. Every round the host draws a card and asks each team a question. If they get it right they get to roll 1d6 damage to the opposing team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team has 30 hit points. The first to run out of points loses the match and is eliminated. Each player can chose a class (thief, wizard, barbarian, etc.) to play and each class has a special ability they can use once per game. There are also special questions that generate special rules (Volley Round, Double Damage, Wandering Monster).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
