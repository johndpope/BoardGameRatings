			<description>Yes you are a robot! Does that compute? Designed as the ultimate fighting machine combat is all you know. Any opponent that faces you in the arena will be put to the test. You cannot and will not be stopped! All other contestants will fall before your next rest cycle. It is time for you to do what you were made for&amp;hellip;FIGHT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Robot brings Metal Hide and Repair Kits to Sen So.  If you like steady resilience and recovery, the Robot is perfect for you.  The Robot is a single player set that can be played against any of the Sen So variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sen So game system uses a unique set of octagon cards and card holders. Players have to set (program) actions before their current action is revealed. All players reveal actions together. This provides fast play for even large numbers of players.  Game scoring provides balance and keeps the leaders on their toes. Players are required to choose their weapons and abilities for each battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
