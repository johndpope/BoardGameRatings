			<description>Destrega is a 3D fighting game that separates itself from other games by creating a Rock, Paper, Scissors type of fighting system. When timed right, you can cancel or overpower your opponent's attack. The game uses two types of fighting styles: close-up hand-to-hand attacks and Relic attacks, which are the long-range projectile attacks. You can also fight in the air, on the ground, and on top of structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fighting style in the game is unique in many aspects. Movement includes the ability to freely roam the current environment. The X button jumps, while R1 causes the player to dash and L1 blocks. The close range fighting system is like Rock, Paper, Scissors where each type of attack is stronger and weaker than another. The Square button results in a quick (but weak) attack; Triangle a slow and powerful one. Circle allows you to sidestep, allowing an attack by slipping behind your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After stepping far back, the charge bar changes from Red to Blue, indicating you can use magic attacks. Just like close range there are three attacks. The Fast (Tiou), Power (Est), and Span (Foh). Tiou travels fast but hits weak, Est hits hard but travels slow, and if you are far away, the attack will disappear. Foh fires a multiple blast and does medium damage. Tiou beats Est, Est beats Foh, Foh beats Tiou. Tiou drains the least charge, Foh medium, and Est the most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also combine magic attacks. Different combinations equal different results. There is a Level 1 attack; Tiou, Est, and Foh (3 Combinations). Then there is a Level 2 attack; Tiou Tiou, Tiou Est, Tiou Foh, Est Est, Est Foh, Foh Foh, etc (9 Combinations). All of which can be reversed (EX: Foh Est) Then the Level 3 attack, Tiou Tiou Tiou, Tiou Tiou Est, Est Est Tiou, Foh, Tiou Foh, etc (21 Combinations). Then There is a Level 4 attack, Tiou Est Foh (any order), (1 Combination), which does a powerful long wide attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The charge bar, located in the top corner of the player's screer, has 4 colors. Red, Green, Yellow, and Blue. Red means magic cannot be used (i.e, when in close-range). When yellow, you can do a level one attack. A green charge bar indicates that any level 2 attack (an attack with two attacks strung together) can be used. Blue indicates a level 3 or 4 attack is possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Charged attacks are also possible. While charging (by holding Triangle, Square, or Circle) holding R1, L1, or X can do added effects. R1 does a charged run that can also deflect magic that is weaker than your current charge bar. L1 does a charge guard which blocks ALL magic until your charge bar is fully drained. You can also block level one attacks by holding L1, resulting in little damage, or press it right before contact and deflect it causing no damage. The X button does a charged jump which results in a higher jump, letting your character reach a platform that couldn't be reached by a regular jump. Or you can hit X to jump and hit Tiou, Est, Foh of any type/level and fire another different set of attacks while in the air. You can also land on your feet after being knocked into the air by tapping L1 while in the air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Modes are 1P Battle (Fight CPU), Story (Fight CPUs based on the story), Versus (Fight 2P), Team Battle (Fight with up to 6 characters controlled by a human or player), Time Attack (Finish game with as little time as possible), and Endurance (Fight as many CPU people as possible. You gain health based on the speed of the battle fought)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Destrega&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
