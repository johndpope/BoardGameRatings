							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Neo-Troops Campaigns</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neo-Troops is played in a generic science-fiction setting with very little background information.  The game assumes that politics, social issues, economic strife, and so forth exist in the milieu but are unimportant to (and unknown by) the varan warriors who exist only to complete missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several campaign support materials are provided on the web site, aside from the rules.  These include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Local Campaign - a summary of missions held over several years (1999-2002), noting mission target, difficulty, date, players, result, and comments.  Several missions were played at conventions.  Minor aggregate statistics also are presented.  English.&lt;br/&gt;     Varan Awards - a list of named varans and their Type and player, how many missions they played in, and what Awards they received.  Varan awards often are curiously named.  English.&lt;br/&gt;     Ropecon 2001 - convention notes about two missions.  These could easily serve as adventures or templates for GMs.  Finnish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incidentally, there also is a board-game implementation named Neo-Hunt and a card-game implementation named Neo-Combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
