							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gray Nebula: Crewmen, Con-Men, and Lawmen</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gray Nebula: Crewmen, Con-Men, and Lawmen is a class sourcebook designed for compatibility with White Star: White Box Science Fiction Roleplaying. It contains three (3) new classes that are fully compatible with the four Standard Classes found in the White Star core rulebook. Gray Nebula also introduces the concept of Roles which further breaks down each class into areas of expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These new classes can be used to &amp;quot;fill in the gaps&amp;quot; for players who have no wish to be Aristocrats, Pilots, Mercenaries, or Star Knights. Or, they can be used strictly as NPCs, at the Referee's discretion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NEW CLASSES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    CREWMAN: Not everyone gets to be the dashing Pilot! Crewmen are mechanics, gunners, security officers, navigators, and any other type of support personnel that serve aboard a starship. On large vessels, with hundreds of workers, they sometimes get lost in the shuffle, but on smaller starships they can become essential and valued members of the crew. &lt;br/&gt;    CRIMINAL: Criminals prey upon the weak and unsuspecting. They take what they want and do as they please. Criminals can be common street thugs, gang members, con-men, thieves, robbers, murderers, slavers, or even worse. A rare few criminals skirt the line between good and evil; an even rarer few actually commit crimes for the benefit of others. &lt;br/&gt;    LAWMAN: Lawmen are tasked with enforcing laws and customs. They can be local constables, criminal investigators, interdiction agents, planetary marshals, or any other type of law enforcement officer. Some former Lawmen become bounty hunters, private investigators, corporate security officers, or personal bodyguards. A rare few turn their backs on the law entirely and become criminals of the worst sort. The latter tend to be hated by other Lawmen who use all available means to bring them to justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MAJOR NPCS&lt;br/&gt;Gray Nebula also includes nine (9) fully statted NPCs (three for each new class). These NPCs come complete with backgrounds and adventure seeds that are designed to be dropped into any White Star campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
