			<description>From the Back of the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increase your awareness with the challenge of Innervision&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique and exciting new board game that tests your knowledge with 4,800 questions and answers in six separate categories: Entertainment, Art/Literature, Culture/Geography, Black History, Recreation/Sports, Nature/Science.  Sharpen your wits--learn about the history and culture of black people and their many accomplishments and contributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game appears to be a Trivial Pursuit-like game but with a different board layout as well as score-keeping pieces.  My set was without instructions but it could be playable with standard Trivial Pursuit rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
