			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some Things Are Not Meant to Be Found&lt;br/&gt;The siren's call of the Council Ruin beckons relic hunters, xenologists, and the brave. She holds secrets buried away for ages and treasures of which man can only begin to dream. The greatest of all her secrets and the most valuable of all her treasures is an object so powerful an entire civilization fell to protect it. But nothing can stay hidden forever....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Shadow Falling, the PCs come into possession of a map suggesting that something of great importance lies in the belly of the mysterious Council Ruin, an alien structure that predates the arrival of the humans. As they endeavor to recover the object, they will have to overcome dangerous obstacles, from the rival Black Wheel Gang to the shadow-shrouded vaasi to the ruin's own PL9 defense system. However, if they can retrieve it, and escape with their lives, they will have done a great service to all humankind. Then again, the end is just the beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadow Falling is a stand-alone adventure using the Future d20 System for characters of 4th to 6th level. The adventure is set on the planet Eos from the Dawning Star campaign setting, nominated for an ENnie for Best d20 Game. However, it can be used in most any d20 science-fiction setting and includes extensive conversion notes. It also features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     6 detailed encounter maps&lt;br/&gt;     A dozen fully described side treks and optional encounters&lt;br/&gt;     2 full pages of printable counters&lt;br/&gt;     New xenomorphs and alien relics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
