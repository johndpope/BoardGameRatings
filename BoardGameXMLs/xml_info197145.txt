							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gloom: The Looking Glass Promo Card</name>
									
			<description>A promotional Story card for Gloom: Second Edition. Also compatible with Fairy Tale Gloom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Promo sleeve includes the following advice:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        During set-up, place up to two Story cards face up in the middle of the table.  As a play, if you meet its requirements, you can claim a story card from the middle, or from another player.  If you take it from a player, you must have more of the required icons than they do.  When you claim a Story card, place it near your family.  You can only have one Story card at a time.  If you claim a second, move the first one back to the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Family must have two marriage Story Icons&lt;br/&gt;        Worth -40.  Also, at the end of the game you only get Self-Worth points for living Characters, reversing all their +/- signs then.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
