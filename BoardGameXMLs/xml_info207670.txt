			<description>For generations, witch doctors have tried to make a resurrection potion. Attempting a variety of herbs, insects, minerals and liquids to construct a potion to vitalize life. The result was called &amp;ldquo;NECTAR&amp;rdquo; .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;ldquo;NECTAR&amp;rdquo; refers to a hand card and element collection game allowing 2-4 players to play at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players play as witch doctors to construct a formula by utilizing all available resources to develop a potion in the sacrificial stage. The players who can formulate the most highly purified potion will win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an unprecedented world of wonders, in which imagination and wisdom will become your catalyst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best part of the game is that you can mix different tools and materials from the fantasy world to produce unexpected results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you love imagining the world and would like to escape from the dull real life for a little while, or just want to have some fun with your family, friends and neighbors, the &amp;ldquo;NECTAR&amp;rdquo; is the best choice for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fire is rising, while the witch doctor is formulating the valuable &amp;ldquo;NECTAR&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each player draws 6 cards.  Players will place one card each from the deck into the sacrificial pot.  Players then take turns, placing one to two cards from their hand on the board.
