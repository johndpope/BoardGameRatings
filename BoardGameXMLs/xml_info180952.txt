							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Seven Men&#039;s Morris</name>
									
			<description>Seven Men's Morris is played in the same way as Nine Men's Morris, with two changes, the first is that each player has seven men and the second is that it is played on a modified board (which is similar to that used by Six Men's Morris, except it a cross in the center).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
