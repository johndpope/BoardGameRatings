			<description>Heroes of Jin Yong (金庸群俠傳), first published in 1996, is a computer role-playing game based on the storyline and characters in Jin Yong's Wuxia novels, developed by Heluo (now Oriental Algorithm System).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the player takes on the role of present-day protagonist, who wakes up one day to find himself in the ancient Chinese Jianghu (martial arts world). The player learns that in order to return to modern society, he must find all the fourteen novels by Jin Yong and be declared champion of the Jianghu. The books are scattered around the Jianghu and the player must interact with many characters from the novels, each with his / her own story to tell. Some characters are friendly and willing to help the player in his quest, while others are hostile and fight with him. The player must learn his own martial arts in order to coerce or persuade others to give him the books. There are a wide variety of martial arts styles and weapons available, including sword, saber, whip, and palm styles. The player can also choose to follow a righteous or evil path through his actions and deeds, with different reactions from characters depending on what path he takes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
