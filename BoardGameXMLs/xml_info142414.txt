							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grave Chamber</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep within the dungeon lies this chamber, apparently containing a number of graves. Even at a first glance something is not right here though. The massive gates were a first hint and even without risking a glance at the skeletons withing the large sarcophagi it becomes obvious that this is not the grave of mere mortals but giants. The shields and weapons hung on the walls, the chests standing in some of the corners all are much larger than one might expect. Even the coins piled high in one place could serve as golden plates in many castles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large brass braziers spread a red glow in the hall although it seems unclear who would refill them once the coals have all burned down. What appear to be large pressure plates on the ground and a few normal sized skeletons spread on the rocky floor do not exactly inspire confidence either. Another massive gate at the other side of the room suggests that this is not the last room to explore down here either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
