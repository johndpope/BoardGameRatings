			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mega Man Maverick Hunter X is an enhanced remake of the 1993 game Mega Man X. The game shares basic gameplay elements with other titles in the series. It is a side-scrolling platformer where players advance through various stages to defeat Maverick robots. There are a number of equipment upgrades hidden through the stages that will improve X&amp;rsquo;s combat abilities, and each boss yields a special weapon to X when defeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a number of updated features, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- improved graphics that place X in 3D side-scrolling environments similar to Mega Man X8.&lt;br/&gt;- Weapon energy refills after every death, instead of every continue&lt;br/&gt;- The ability to fire the Mega Buster even while special weapons are equipped&lt;br/&gt;- Level redesigns&lt;br/&gt;- New plot sequences and character dialogue&lt;br/&gt;- Two difficulty modes: Normal and Hard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The largest change from the original game is the inclusion of Vile as a playable character. Players can go through the entire game as Vile, complete with a unique playstyle. He does not use special weapons like X &amp;ndash; rather, Vile has three weapon slots that can be equipped with loadouts that can be used in each stage. He has a single energy meter to share among these weapons that slowly refills over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
