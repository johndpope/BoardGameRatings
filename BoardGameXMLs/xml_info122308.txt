			<description>Card game for youngsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt some cards. In their turn, a player first spins the spinner. This will indicate, when it stops spinning, one of the five sets of cards included with the game. The sets are titled:&lt;br/&gt;Policeman&lt;br/&gt;Fireman&lt;br/&gt;Ballplayer&lt;br/&gt;Mary Milker&lt;br/&gt;Clown&lt;br/&gt;After spinning, a player must play one card from their hand,  face down, that matches the set indicated. If he does not have such a card, he must still play one and hope the others don't challenge him.&lt;br/&gt;If a player suspects another player is not playing a legal card, that player calls &amp;quot;I doubt it&amp;quot;. If the card was correct, the challenger picks up all the discard pile. If the card was a bluff, the challenged player picks up all the cards from the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has all the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
