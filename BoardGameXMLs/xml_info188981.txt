							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spud Head: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Winner of the October 2015 24-Hour Game Design Challenge! Printed copies will eventually be made available, in the mean time enjoy this PnP version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to create potato heads, earning points. A complete head consists of one eye card (top of head), one mouth/nose card (bottom card) and two ear cards. You can get bonus points if you are able to complete your head with a hat, feet and/or a item (see final scoring).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup:&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle all the cards. Deal out seven cards to each player. Place remaining cards in the middle of the table as a draw deck, leaving space for a discard pile. Determine the first player, and play will continue clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, players draw one card, either from the draw deck or the top card of the discard pile. If they have collected enough head parts to complete a head (with or without the bonus cards), they may place the assembled head face-up in front of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a head it is played on the table, no cards can be added to it or any of its cards changed. At the end of a players turn; if they have more than seven cards, they must discard down to seven cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The numbers in the upper corner of the ear cards help determine if the ears are matching and if the are right side up - as it is possible to use a left ear upside down to finish a head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until all the cards from the draw deck and discard deck are empty; or until no player can complete any additional potato heads. Then using the scoring table below, add up all the points for each player and determine a winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In case of a tie, the player who has used the most bonus cards is the winner. And if still a tie, the player who was able to use the most item cards wins. After that it is a shared victory of Spud Heads!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final Scoring:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;+ 10 Points    Each complete Spud Head&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;+5 Points    With matching ears&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;+ 15 Points    With hat, feet and matching item for hat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;+5 Points    With hat and feet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;+ 2 Points    With hat or feet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-2 Points    For each ear placed upside down&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
