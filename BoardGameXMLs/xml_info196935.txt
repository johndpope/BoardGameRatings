			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Grandiose Disaster is a strongly structured character-centric short-form larp. The organizer (who can also play in the game, depending on their comfort level with handling logistics alongside play) chooses or creates a disaster/horror movie scenario. Players use a set of archetypes to create characters and establish relationships before the disaster hits. Once it does, the game turns to a struggle of survival in the face of incredible, deadly odds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not every character will die, but some death in inevitable. Players whose characters die still participate in the game, whether by taking on narrator duties, playing side characters, or joining the &amp;quot;peanut gallery&amp;quot; to comment on this grandiose disaster as it unfolds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
