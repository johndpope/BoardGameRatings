			<description>&amp;quot;We gotta plan this operation well, amigos! Snake, use your charm on that saloon girl and wheedle out the location of the sheriff's safe. Meanwhile, Tad will get a horse, a rifle and a rope. We also need to find some watches, if we don't want this to fail like it did the last time... Have a last sip of whiskey for courage and let's go! I just hope that the damn' band from Red Creek won't scoop it from under our noses. Much is at stake today&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A relaxing western with a bit of shooting and robbing, but above all with an unbeatable atmosphere, novel ideas and stirring entertainment. A balanced mix of strategy, chance and several unique game mechanics (e.g. throwing &amp;bdquo;bullets&amp;ldquo; at a special target) makes this game the most true western of all times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With your band of Bandits you try to rob one of the Objects in the city. You can gain up to 3 additional Bandits (releasing them from Prison) and gradually build their abilities up to the final Central Bank Robbery. In between you will be robbing Coaches or Trains for Money and shooting other players' Bandits to get to your Objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fun and entertaining game for 2-5 people Nowheresville brings the Western times to your gaming table!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
