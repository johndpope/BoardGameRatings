							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warrior Quest</name>
									
			<description>The game takes place in the sixteenth century in Japan. Japanese warlords fight the power hungry Shogun tyrant for control over the land and its precious commodities. Only you, using your knowledge of the martial arts gained while playing the game, can enter the castle and assassinate the Shogun and end the tyranny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played solitaire or with up to 6 players and it comes with a lot of fun bits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two different 22&amp;rdquo; square mounted boards, one representing the village, the other the castle.  Lots of cards representing characters, encounters and weapons. Four spinners for fight results depending on board and circumstance, 4 different multi-sided dice, fifty red discs, and most retro of all, pointed sticks to write on six Warrior Character ranking pads and one Shogun score pad, all erasable by lifting the transparency with flick of the wrist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
