			<description>A Monopoly clone with a twist... you are never forced out of the game... you just become your descendant, go back on welfare, and keep going.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components restrict the game to six, but any number can play.  Players keep going until a set time limit is reached (I suggest at least 2 hours) or when the there is only one player left in the game (if played without descendants).  If descendants are being used, the game is never ending and can go on indefinitely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The highs and lows of society are portrayed by spaces on the board.  Businesses may be bought and sold, players may get a higher education, join a Co-op, become a thief, enter the military, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An additional random element is in the form of 'Change' cards.  With the draw of a card you can become an alcoholic, get busted and sent to prison, become a parent of quintuplets, etc.  Because there are only 54 of these cards, they seem to come up again and again... expecially when six are playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elections make the game the most fun.  During an election, players are encouraged to put issues to a vote... majority rules.  This allows aspects of the game rules to be changed or outright ingored!  Because of this, interesting things can happen, for example: elimination of taxes or a military coup d'etat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
