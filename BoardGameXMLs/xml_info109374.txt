			<description>From the Kickstarter description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of two decks: the action cards and the event cards. The action cards make up your hand, and the event cards are played at the end of each each round in an attempt to &amp;quot;ghostify&amp;quot; your friends (a.k.a. kill them). Once a player has died, the game is not over for them! Players who die continue playing as ghosts, not able to win, but fully capable of messing with others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in rounds. A round consists of players playing action cards, and a single player playing an event card at the end of the round. Players use action cards to draw extra cards or cause other players to discard in an attempt to favorably control the number of cards in players' hands, their own included. Events target players based on the number of cards in their hand, adding to the strategy elements of the the game. Some action cards also allow players to dodge events the main component of survival in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kickstarter campaign failed to meet its funding goal on 27 November 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
