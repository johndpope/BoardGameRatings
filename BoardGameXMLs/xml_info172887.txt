			<description>Quest for Excellence is a take on the game Scrabble, but it adds a different way of playing. There are these cards, kind of quest cards with questions on. If you get the questions right you score extra points in the game, with a bonus if you collect sets of 3 of the card types, by getting all three questions on a card correct. If you do you keep the card and add it to you set of those cards. There are also no double or triple words score blocks on the board, but point amounts for placing a vowel or consonant on a specific place on the board. The board looks like a Scrabble board, but the scoring just works different. The tiles also have a score amount as stated on the board. I would so think of this game as Scrabble, but with more bells and whistles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
