							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cthulhu Wars: Hound of Tindalos</name>
									
			<description>The single print run Kickstarter gameplay exclusive expansion, Hounds of Tindalos, was offered in Richard Luongs art book Kickstarter as an addon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Sandy Petersen has been gracious enough to allow me to offer an Exclusive Hounds of Tindalos Expansion for Cthulhu Wars! Each 80mm miniature will come with a loyalty card designed by Sandy. Jo Brumby of Fenris Games has collaborated with me to design an amazing Sculpt showing the Hound emerging from a 90 degree angle. This will be an extremely limited run and will be a highly sought after collectors item... I hope. :)&amp;quot; Richard Luong&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Acquire: Pay 2 Doom and 2 Power to acquire the monster loyalty card. Then place the Hound at one of your controlled gates.&lt;br/&gt;Cost: 4 power to summon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat: 4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement: Move one unit at its normal movement cost, then teleport the Hound for a cost of &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; to any gate of his choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special: Cannot be killed unless it is pained into an area without a gate or the gate in its current area is removed by a faction ability and/or spell book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
