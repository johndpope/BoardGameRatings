			<description>UltraCorps is a turn-based massively multiplayer online game of space exploration and combat. Starting with a single planet, you can expand your empire to dozens and even hundreds of worlds. But hundreds of other players are building their empires, too. The universe is so big that you'll never meet most of them except in the game forums . . . but you still compete against them for number of worlds conquered, total power of your fleets, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UltraCorps can also be played as a solo game, and in &amp;quot;PUB Game&amp;quot; mode. These &amp;quot;Private Universe Battles&amp;quot; are for two to 12 players, and can be run at any speed, from weekly turns to blitz. Subscribers can create their own PUB Games, and either invite specific opponents or throw them open to everyone who is registered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may also create solo games. In a solo, you conquer a small cluster, running turns whenever you want . . . to learn without pressure, and, when you know the game, to try to win in as few turns as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because UltraCorps is a browser-based game, all you need is a net connection and any standard browser. You log in at your own convenience, review your empire, check out your neighbors, read your game mail, and enter your commands. At a specified time (typically, once a day) the turn runs, and the next time you log in, you'll see your results. If you think you'll have to miss a turn, you can enter long-term commands for building and movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game rewards planning, tactical skill, and negotiation. There is no &amp;quot;twitch&amp;quot; element. There are random factors in combat, so that a small battle can be decided by fortune . . . but a large one will almost always come out according to the odds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
