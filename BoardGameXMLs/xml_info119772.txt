							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alter Ego</name>
									
			<description>A cooperative deck building game of heroism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You won't see Crime City on any map, but that's how people have come to know your hometown. Sadists, Anarchists, the Mafia, each carving out portions of the city they call their own. Hundreds of innocent bystanders caught up every day in their turf wars, or held under their oppressive thumbs. Precious few have the time, the money, the guts, or the wherewithal to do anything about it. You're one of those few... of course it means you'll have to give up that happy home life, or that cushy job. The paper paints vigilantism in a negative light - you'd be viewed by the community as a monster. But your city bleeds... the city bleeds and it calls your name. Will you answer?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're a vigilante hero, one of the few in Crime City who have come together to put an end to the reign of terror the city's been trapped under. Banding together, you'll fight through a swath of henchmen in order to find and defeat several Arch Villains. But as you get stronger as a hero, you'll have to neglect some parts of your Alter Ego life - your family, your job, and the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you'll play a certain number of cards, and each turn you'll add 1 new card to your deck. Job, Community, and Family cards give you benefits, but in order to fight crime you'll need to play Hero cards instead. As the game goes on, which aspect of your Alter Ego life will you neglect?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Alter Ego is a cooperative game, there may be a competitive aspect (or mode) as well. In addition to defeating Arch Villains, each player has their own private Nemesis which they need to defeat in order to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
