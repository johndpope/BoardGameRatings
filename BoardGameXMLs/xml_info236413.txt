			<description>Heavenly Body is a roll and move game around the theme of fitness and nutrition. Player tokens wear jerseys that contain beans representing weight. Each player begins the game with $200 and 20 lbs. Players move around the board landing on squares and drawing cards that may result in the gain, loss or no change to money or weight. Players can also land on squares that allow them to bet other players on how many of a certain exercise they can do. The object of the game is to have the most money in the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, players must guess the weight of their token within a 3 lb margin of error to receive an additional $50. All weight is removed by paying the bank $20 per lb. All Olympic medals are cashed in for money depending on their type. After all players have finished this accounting, the player with the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
