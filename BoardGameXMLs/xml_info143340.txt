			<description>Publisher Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Backgammon is a two-person game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In FASTGAMMON the computer is one player (its men are O's) and you are the other (your men are X's).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you are a beginner or an experienced backgammon player, FASTGAMMON can help you improve your game. First of all, you now have an opponent that is always ready and willing to play. There is no substitute for experience -- the more games you play the more you learn about backgammon. But there is another unique method by which FASTGAMMON can help you improve your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By selecting &amp;quot;2&amp;quot; when the starting message is displayed, the same sequence of rolls that occurred in the game just&lt;br/&gt;played (the last game for which you selected &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;) will occur again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW GOOD IS FASTGAMMON?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We make no claims that FASTGAMMON plays at an expert level. In fact, good players will notice obvious mistakes that the computer makes from time to time. The game of backgammon has many subtleties, and the algorithm programmed into version 1 of FASTGAMMON is a fairly simple one. There is an advantage that the computer has, however, over human players -- the computer never forgets what it &amp;quot;knows&amp;quot;. Due to oversights, distractions, or haste, human players often forget what they know. This fact is the edge that makes FASTGAMMON competitive against good players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
