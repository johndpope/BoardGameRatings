			<description>&amp;quot;The Zodiac is a mobile entertainment  console, launched on May 5, 2003, and released in October 2003 by Tapwave, a former private company based in Mountain View, California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product was designed to be a &amp;quot;high performance mobile entertainment system centred on games, music, images, and video, aimed at 18 to 34 year old gamers and technology enthusiasts. By running an enhanced version of the Palm Operating System (5.2T), Zodiac also provided access to Palm&amp;rsquo;s personal information management software and many other applications from the Palm developer community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The console sold very poorly. This was especially because of strong pressures from the PlayStation Portable (PSP) from Sony, and the DS from Nintendo. The Zodiac was discontinued in 26 July 2005.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tapwave Zodiac&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
