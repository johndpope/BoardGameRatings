			<description>Teachatot is designed to help children learn simple spelling and arithmetic. Select a picture card and asking the child, whose turn it is, to find and identify the letters making up the word for the picture. Similarly, you could select a number and the child must find the numbers needed to make that total. Get the most right after an equal number of turns, and you win&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the 144 pieces interlock with each other to provide lots of word combinations and arithmetic sums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was first produced in Britain in the 1950's but sank without trace. However, it has now resurfaced in Australia/New Zealand, and has been available there for some time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
