							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Drow Outpost</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The drow outpost is a subterranean fortress blocking a tunnel. This fortress is a true nightmare for intruders as it was built to keep away even the most feared races of the underdark. Those who manage to break the metal gates that protect the entrance will find themselves into a courtyard pierced by arrowslits and, perhaps, this will be the last thing they see. The outpost blocks completely underground cavern and features four levels. At level 0 the barracks are housed, many rooms with arrowslits allow the drow to pour a deadly rain over the invaders. At level 1 more arrowslits rooms are found plus a temple area dedicated to the spider queen. At level 2 the commander&amp;rsquo;s quarters are located, large and full furnished rooms with a library and a meeting hall. At level -1 the jail is found, where the unlucky captive meet his fate. However the drow outpost have a weak point, as the underdark is pierced by galleries and tunnels unknown even to the dreaded drow elves: a couple of secret galleries lead in the very hearth of the outpost but, of course, they are guarded by feared monsters. Some hints to use the outpost follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The PCs must rescue an important NPC from the dreaded drow jail, below the outpost.&lt;br/&gt;    The drow outpost felt under the attack of undead legions spreading from a mysterious well discovered in one of the adjacent caves, many drow have been turned into undead and are attacking the nearby country.&lt;br/&gt;    A priestess of the spider queen seeks an ancient evil artifact into a ruined drow outpost, the PC must stop the priestess.&lt;br/&gt;    The duergar have occupied the drow outpost, and the drow try to conquer again the fortress the PCs find themselves in the middle of the conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
