			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Breakout/Arkanoid clone was released as freeware in 1989. It had the unique gimmick of offering a playing field that was twice as large as your monitor (which the author called &amp;quot;MCGA&amp;quot;, with a resolution of 544x240). This made the game both very difficult and very rewarding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
