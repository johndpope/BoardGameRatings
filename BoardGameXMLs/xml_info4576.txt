			<description>In Dealing with Murder - Fatal Error , 2-6 players get together to try and solve a murder mystery. Each player is dealt a hand of 3 cards that comes from a deck of cards where each card is unique, and has either has some information pertaining to the mystery, or has actions that a player can take. Each turn a player plays a card (reveals evidence) to the discard pile where everyone can read the information. The cards a player keeps in his hand are considered 'withheld evidence'. A player may also play a subpoena card to look at all the cards in a given players hand or to increase their own hand size. Play continues like this until a player thinks they can solve the mystery. They announce their solution (Who, Motive, How) and then reads (silently) the solution. If correct, they win, if not, they are out of the game and play continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is (very slightly) compared to the 'How to Host Your Own Murder' series, in that once the game is played, it cannot be played again by the same players, as there is only one solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box even references said product, by stating that to play 'Dealing with Murder', you don't need to cook a dinner or show up wearing a costume to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
