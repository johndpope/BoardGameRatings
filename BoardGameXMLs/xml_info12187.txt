							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Secret Sound</name>
									
			<description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a team game you&amp;rsquo;ll like the sound of! Pop in one of the CDs and try to guess the sound. Some are easy, like blowing a nose. Others are hard, like putting a magnet on the fridge. Luckily, your teammates can help you out. Maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll draw you a picture, or maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll act something out. But make sure you guess the sound before the timer runs out! With 750 sounds, you&amp;rsquo;ll never play the same game twice! Comes with a game board, eight CDs, eight tokens, a Track Guide booklet, an instruction die, a timer, a rules sheet and 55 Wizard cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
