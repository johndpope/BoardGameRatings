							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Halfling Horde</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five years ago, the newly-minted Baron Eligost was granted a parcel of land in the great plains on the frontier of his liege&amp;rsquo;s kingdom. On the advice of his mentor, the wizard Oxidus, Eligost led a small band of pioneers into the valley and founded the farming village of Round River on the banks of the River Gren. The good breadth and depth and meandering pace of the Gren permitted easy trade with the cities and towns downstream and Round River prospered, quickly doubling and tripling in size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last month, however, just before the winter solstice, a halfling outrider dressed in rough hides and furs rode his pony into the Round River town square and announced that the Broadbelt Horde was returning to winter in its most sacred valley, and that Round River must be abandoned or face complete destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 7th - 9th level characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
