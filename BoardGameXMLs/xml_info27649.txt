			<description>This game is a limited edition re-creation of the fantasy based game &amp;quot;Dragon Quest Dungeon&amp;quot; circa 1990.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three ways to play the game, each with increasingly more depth in the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic game has each player secretly set up his own dungeon with a stand-up cut-out castle between the two players to shield the other from viewing his opponent's dungeon. Each player has 24 square shaped walls that can be placed throughout the dungeon to block the other player from reaching the Dragon Lord.  At the beginning of the game, the players share the starting location and the location of the DragonLord in their respective dungeons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game play mechanics are very similar to &amp;quot;Battleship&amp;quot; in that the dungeon is laid out in a grid (rows and columns) and each player takes turns shouting out a location in the grid which will reveal a clear path or a wall.  The winner is the first player to successfully navigate to the DragonLord of their opponent's dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advanced rules include monster pieces; treasure chests, combat, and cards with text on them that make the game play more immersive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
