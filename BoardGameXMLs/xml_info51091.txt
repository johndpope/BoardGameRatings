							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Treasure Vaults of Lindoran</name>
									
			<description>From the Players' Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Your party has come through the wilderness and mountains surrounding Lindoran to seek after the fabulous treasures of an Elf-King now a thousand years dead.  The protection spells have been weakened over time so that you think that you can get inside of the Vault safely.  New problems have arisen, however, for now there is an ancient red Dragon in the Plaza outside of the double doors leading into the Treasury.  The doors are made of four metals -- Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum -- and a like set of keys hand on the wall nearby.  But first the Dragon must be gotten past...  Perhaps he can be driven off, maybe he can be sneaked past and the keys stolen (for all of the many legends about this place being told in the Mannish areas far to the Southwest tell of magical metal keys which hold the power to enter certain sections of the Vaults) or maybe he can be bribed...  What is your party going to do?  The Dragon isn't going to be leaving, for he has a good-sized hoard taken from the sack of several Elven and Dwarven towns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have enough men and magic to tackle this job?  A lot of healing is going to be necessary, for rumors are that once the Vault is entered, it cannot be easily left; going out is harder than is coming in...  Be brave, may Bes travel on your shoulder.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
