			<description>The object of this game is to transport your trucks and containers from the start to an unloading bay avoiding as many penalties as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the loads are overweight and being caught with an overweight load means going back to the start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are squares to avoid (breakdowns, punctures and out of fuel) as well as some safety squares (truck parks), but the game is, in essence, a a race to get your loads from the start to the finish before anybody else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player plays the Police and cannot win the game - his goal is to hinder the other players as much as possible.  (This is probably best played by a parent or Games Master.  Alternatively, the Police car can be moved by mutual agreement, which makes the game playable by 2 to 6 players.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
