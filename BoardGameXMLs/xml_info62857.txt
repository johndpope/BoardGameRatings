							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nobles of Venice</name>
									
			<description>Nobles of Venice is a rummy game for 2-4 players. Players meld cards in several suits representing different Goods and Industries in Venice at the height of its trade power in Renaissance Italy. Unlike most rummy games with fixed values, a market card is used to track the current value of the Goods cards, which are sold for Prestige at the end of each round in the order set by the number of cards left in hand, giving a strong incentive for players to go out quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was originally designed for Cate108's rummy design contest here on BGG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
