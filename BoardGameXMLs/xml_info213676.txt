			<description>Restore the seasons and build your farm, your way, in Harvest Moon: The Lost Valley for Nintendo 3DS family systems. After a harsh snowstorm leaves you stranded in the freezing cold, you're rescued by a friendly Harvest Sprite, who explains that an eternal winter has descended on the Lost Valley. Now it's up to you to find the Harvest Goddess and bring the Lost Valley back to its former glory in this farming adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose to play as a boy or girl, customise your hair and outfit, and put together the best farm you can! Grow and harvest crops, care for all kinds of animals and brighten the place up by planting flowerbeds. Creating your dream farm is simple, and you can quickly switch between two useful modes depending on what you need to do. Use Cultivation Mode to sow seeds, collect crops and perform other activities, then switch to Building Mode to form new buildings instantly and change or expand the layout of your land!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore the Lost Valley in a fully 3D environment. You&amp;rsquo;ve got loads of control over the land, giving you even more options to make everything exactly how you want it. Flatten the ground to make way for crop fields, dig down into the earth to create pits and ponds, pile up dirt to raise hills and mountains, and carve out paths to new areas of the valley however you like! Collect resources as you travel around the valley, then use them to build new structures around your farm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your farming experience is efficient and streamlined in Harvest Moon: The Lost Valley. With context-sensitive controls, you don't need to worry about equipping the right items at all times: simply go where you need to go and the appropriate tool will become available to use with a press of the action button. If you want to chop down a tree, you only have to stand by it to use your axe! Helpful Harvest Sprites can also aid you with daily activities, so keep your eyes peeled for their friendly faces!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's no end of folk who want to visit you! Look out for visitors in the Lost Valley who are eager to ply their trade. Sell your produce to earn money, then spend it on new tools, seeds and animals to improve your farm and move closer to your ideal homestead. Passers-through might also ask you favours, such as asking you to track down a certain item. Make good on delivery and get to know your neighbours &amp;ndash; you might even find the love of your life! If you meet that special somebody, do your best to win their affection, then get married and start a family of your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thaw out the Lost Valley and build a farm to be proud of in Harvest Moon: The Lost Valley on Nintendo 3DS family systems!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Your farm, your way: plant seeds, care for animals and create your ideal farm&lt;br/&gt;     Shape the land itself by digging pits, raising mountains and creating new paths&lt;br/&gt;     Streamlined controls make it easy to tend to your farm&lt;br/&gt;     Trade and build relationships with visitors &amp;ndash; you might even find love!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
