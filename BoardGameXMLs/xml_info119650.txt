			<description>A compilation of games includes rule sets for Checkers and Tic-Tac-Toe, plus several other games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meet in the Middle: One player uses a &amp;quot;mama&amp;quot; animal, the other uses a &amp;quot;baby&amp;quot; animal.  They start at opposite ends of the board and alternate die rolls until the two animals meet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Sweet Home: All of the animals are divided among the players.  In turn, each player rolls the die and puts the number of animals rolled onto the game board.  The winner is the person who gets all of their animals on first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suppertime!: Players get two animals and have to move them to the barn.  On each turn, the player rolls one die and can split the movement between the two animals in any manner. Landing on a space occupied by another animal sends that animal back to the closest unoccupied colored space.  The first player to get both of their animals to the barn wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barnyard Chase: Each player selects an animal and places it on the opposite diagonal corners of the included checkerboard.  In turn, players roll the die and move clockwise around the board.  First player to pass the other wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
