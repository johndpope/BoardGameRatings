							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Livro de Magias</name>
									
			<description>Translated from the book's intro:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no instrument as powerful as magic, but yet, there is no knowledge that depends more dedication. They say it need a genius to deploy the supernatura, that is not true. But still, a greater than normal Aura is really important to those who wants to know more about the mystic arts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tagmar is a world with a large concentration of mana, the key to magic. Well trained, full of mystic force being can manipulate the mana, distorting reality, creating bigger and lesser effects. The study of magic is basically done in two separate ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The method of Wizards and Bards, who use their inner strength and the world around them to change the enviroment ou the nearby creatures; The method of Priests and Trackers. These mystics channel the magical energies of an being of great power (nature, a God or another divine creature) and use it to create the alterations that give birth to magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
