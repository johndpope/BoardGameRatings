							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cluedo: Die drei ???</name>
									
			<description>Cluedo &amp;quot;Drei Fragezeichen&amp;quot;: This is a variant on the famous whodunnit detective game (called Cluedo in the UK, Clue in the US) especially for younger children to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this variant players move between different places fans of the three investigators will surely notice. 6 different items have disappeared in Rocky Beach, but only one of these has really been stolen. Players try to find out which item was stolen by which person and where. For this you take over the role of the three investigators and their friends - Aunt Mathilda, Inspector Cotta and Uncle Titus. Every character has a special ability which can be used once per game (e.g. move a second time). Just like in the original version, players move on the board. As soon as they enter a room/place, they can ask questions about the crime. Each player has a certain amount of cards in his hand, 3 cards have been put to the side - they say where the crime took place, who the thief is and which item was stolen. It's the players' goal to solve the crime. With the help of questions and your cards, you try to find out as much as possible about the case so that you will be the one to solve the mystery in the end and predict which cards have been set aside.&lt;br/&gt;All items, characters and places are based on the adventures of the three investigators. The place where you can solve the mystery, for example, is the old house trainer in Uncle Titus' salvage yard. Amongst the criminals players can find the investigators' arch enemy Skinny Norris, for example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
