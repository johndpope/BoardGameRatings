							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Night of the Fuufi</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Responding to a distress call in the vast, cold outsystem can lead to adventure, danger, or just plain confusion. In the adventurers' case, all three ensue as they race to rescue a noble who has just had her ship hijacked by pirates. Can the group recover her ship from the ruthless cutthroats? And what is the startling secret of the noble's cuddly pet, which was trapped on board during the violence and which she insists must not come to harm?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night of the Fuufi is a one-page, no-frills adventure for Cepheus Engine and other tabletop RPG science fiction games using a 2D6 mechanic (including The Original 2D6 Science Fiction Game) starring characters of varied career backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
