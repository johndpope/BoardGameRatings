							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Treasure Hunters: Crypt of the Beast Lord</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module is the first in the Treasure Hunters series of modules. They are written so that they can be used as single adventures dropped into your campaign or as the backbone for a Treasure Hunters' campaign. This first module, &amp;quot;Crypt of the Beast Lord,&amp;quot; introduces the Treasure Hunters' Guild and background information that will be relevant during the ongoing campaign. Information and equipment gained from this adventure could prove useful in future modules and in the ongoing war against evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was originally intended for four 3rd level characters, of any good alignment. While having a priest or paladin is not required to play this adventure, both classes would bring added security with their ability to turn undead. A rogue would also be helpful to disarm the numerous traps placed in the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
