			<description>Master Nexus is a connection of words, be it lexicon, geography, history, or famous people. Each player spells out words by placing pegs in holes under the corresponding letters. Each player in turn tries to form a word of one or more letters starting with the last letter used by the previous player. The first player scoring 150 points wins the game. No player should take more than one minute to form a word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a peg-board with 324 lettered holes in seemingly random order, and 324 pegs. The words are not connected as in Scrabble; the players simply fill up available letters on the board, and they cannot create words with, say, T if all Ts have been used. (Not counting the final letter of the last player's word.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
