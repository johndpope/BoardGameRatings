			<description>In a small pond with a population of frogs that is constantly growing, the fight for territory and the best possible location is always, a battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Army Of Frogs is an excitingly, fun board game by the award winning games designer, John Yianni. The game is for 2-4 players (human or AI) with each player in control of a group of 10 frogs, which connect to the other player&amp;rsquo;s frogs to form an island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shape and size of the island is constantly changing as players add and jump their frogs about in an attempt to rally them into one large group to win the game. The player&amp;rsquo;s frogs are also introduced to the island by the other players, who will most definitely add them in difficult locations and use them to block the movements of the other frogs: so winning is not as simple as it may first appear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     local Pass&amp;amp;Play multiplayer for 2-4 players&lt;br/&gt;     6 different AI opponents (yes, six!)&lt;br/&gt;     asynchronous online multiplayer&lt;br/&gt;     15 Game Center achievements&lt;br/&gt;     Facebook integration&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
