			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Motocross Madness 2 is the sequel to the arcade-style motorcycle racing game, Motocross Madness. It builds on the gameplay in the first game, and adds even more features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has over 40 different tracks to play in six different events: Enduro Race, Baja, Supercross, National Race, Stunts, and Pro-Circuit mode. The Enduro Race is new to the series, which drops the players in a wide open environment and has them race towards the finish. Pro-Circuit is a campaign mode where the player competes in a series of races and events to earn money that can be used to upgrade equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The title includes updated graphics and higher resolution textures. An editor program was also added that let players create unique tracks and environments, as well as customize their bikes and riders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like its predecessor, Motocross Madness 2 has online multiplayer capabilities for up to 8 racers at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
