			<description>(Translated from the Japanese rulebook)&lt;br/&gt;In this game, the players are owners of inns, and the goal is to get as many staying guests, earning the most money in a set period of time.&lt;br/&gt;But it's not easy preparing rooms for all those people who have come to the festival in town. Among the normal guests like travelers and merchants, there is the King, the General and even assassins and Demon Lord! It's a chaotic mix of everything.&lt;br/&gt;Each guest has their own condition for staying the night and paying the room. Some are content if you serve them tasty food, some look only for good service and some are looking for a good fight&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;If you can't please the guest, not only will you not get paid, but you have to pay instead, so you'll have to be careful which guests you accommodate. You can push dangerous guests to your neighbour's door, but if you're not careful, you might get one yourself!&lt;br/&gt;The character the players play all have different areas they are good at and bad at. And they, too, are former adventurers, so they have individual skills to attract or deter guests. The one who uses these skills the best, gets the most content customers and earns the most money during the festival will be declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
