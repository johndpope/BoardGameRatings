							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Oni</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once your kind were feared. Limitless in strength, stamina, and shape, you walked the land terrorizing, deceiving and devouring mortals on a whim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then they learned how to forge weapons of steel. Learned how to weave magic. Other gods saw fit to intercede on their behalf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of you retreated from the mortal realm, preying upon those foolish enough to leave their walled cities, or occasionally using your powers to intrude, inciting fear and sating your bloodlust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Others brazenly carved out their own domains, eager for any who would dare to challenge their reign. &lt;br/&gt;A relative few, out of necessity, practicality, or perhaps even genuine benevolence became protectors of mortals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What were you before? What are you now? What will you become?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The oni is not only tough as nails, but can change its shape and turn invisible. As you level up you can choose whether to become tougher, stronger, improve your existing abilities, or learn other tricks like possessing others, devouring souls, smashing your way through anyone or thing that stands before you, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains three files. The first is a letter-sized, two-page character sheet that features a revamped layout. The second is a digest-sized book that contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The oni, with 20 advanced moves.&lt;br/&gt;    Thematic weapons and armor.&lt;br/&gt;    New dungeon gear, like healing saki.&lt;br/&gt;    Three magic items.&lt;br/&gt;    A closer look at some of the moves, as well as ways to tweak the core oni.&lt;br/&gt;    A variant of one of the core moves (in case you prefer roll-and-hold moves).&lt;br/&gt;    Five extra moves that just didn't make the cut.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
