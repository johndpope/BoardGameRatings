							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Odyssey 200</name>
									
			<description>The Odyssey 200 dedicated console was released in 1975. Using the TI single-chip design, the console improved on the Odyssey 100 in several areas. In addition to Tennis and Hockey, the Odyssey 200 featured a third game variation called &amp;quot;Smash&amp;quot;. The Odyssey 200 was also the first video game console to feature either two-player or four-player options.[1] The Odyssey 200 added non-digital on-screen scoring (a white rectangle moved one space to the right each time a player scored a point). Like the Odyssey 100, the Odyssey 200 is powered by either six &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; batteries or a 9 volt AC adapter and uses the same game control knobs as its predecessor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Magnavox Odyssey Series&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
