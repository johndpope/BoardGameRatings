			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pinion resolution uses 2d10 but a 1d20 variant is provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have Primary Stats (Attributes) divided into Body (Strength, Prowess, Physique), Mind (Reason, Perception, Knowledge), and Spirit (Will, Sentience, Potency).  Characters also have Derived Stats including Movement, Toughness, and Vitality.  Primary Stats can be randomly determined or purchased form a point pool; humans have Primary Stats in the 1-20 range with a typical value being 6-7.  Characters have Advantages and Disadvantages which can be purchased from the same point pool used for Primary Stats.  Characters also have Skills with numeric ratings similar to Primary Stats.  However, the Skill lists provided are examples only and the game Skill list will depend upon the &amp;quot;Interlock&amp;quot; (genre expansion module) being used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-trivial tasks are resolved by rolling 2d10 and &amp;quot;rolling under&amp;quot; the appropriate Skill or Primary Stat.  In opposed actions both opponents roll and the one with the greatest difference between their roll and Skill wins.  In unopposed actions the roll must be lower than the Skill by some Task Difficulty established by the Lawgiver (Game Master).  Combat is handled with an appropriate Skill (Shoot, Throw, Strike, Claw, Punch, Kick, Bite, or Fight) as an opposed action (usually by Dodge, Parry, or Block).  Extended rules apply to rapid-fire firearms, multiple attacks, hand-to-hand attacks, and other special maneuvers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
