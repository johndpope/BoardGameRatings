			<description>&amp;quot;A lifetime of fun, finance and fortune.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the instruction manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players go around the board in three tracks according to the throw of 2 dice.  The outer most track (yellow) is the starting Low Income Bracket, the middle (green) is the Medium Income Bracket, and the inside (orange) track is the High Income Bracket.  When a player has the required amount of savings in the Bank, he can progress from one income bracket to a higher one by advancing through the DOOR to Opportunity.  Money can be earned by receiving a salary every Pay Day in increasing amounts depending on the player's degree of education, and also by investing in real estate and skill in managing general finance.  Players have fascinating experiences in banking, savings and loans, interest, insurance, studying in school, receiving scholarships, and in general going through a full lifetime from childhood to retirement.  The first player to acquire the necessary amount of savings in the bank and real estate reaches &amp;quot;Retirement&amp;quot; and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
