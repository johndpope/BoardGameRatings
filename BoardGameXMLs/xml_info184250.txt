			<description>The game consists of 2 items: poles and balls.The balls&amp;rsquo; holes are the connection point of the items. Each of the 2 players picks a colour with its 44 items: 12 balls and 32 poles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RULES FOR 2 PLAYERS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with the player who selects the white items. The player can choose to start with a pole or a ball. Each player plays their turn using only one item at a time: a pole or a ball.&lt;br/&gt;Every piece played must be linked to the pieces played beforehand. As the poles are inserted in the ball holes a three dimensional figure will begin to form. Once an item is placed, no changes or modification can be made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AIM OF THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;A player wins the game if during their turn they manage to:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Insert 3 poles more than their opponent in any played ball&lt;br/&gt;or&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; place in a straight line 4 balls of the same colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given that each ball has 6 holes and each player wins by placing 3 poles of the same colour more than their opponent the winning possibilities are 3-0 or 4-1. The players build up a three-dimensional network where there are different diagonals (2D or 3D) that allow placing 4 balls of the same colour in line. The game is considered a draw when both players use up their pieces and no player can place 3 poles more than their opponent into a ball or 4 balls of the same colour in line. Positioning and placing the pieces of the game in a clever way is part of the winning strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to create a solid structure and to minimise the risk of the structure breaking during the game, we suggest placing the poles firmly in the ball holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RULES FOR 4 PLAYERS&lt;br/&gt;The same rules for 2 players apply. Pairs of 2 players start the game with 44 elements each, playing on alternate turns and interposing one player of each couple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
