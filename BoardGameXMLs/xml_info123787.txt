			<description>Quiz &amp;amp; Dragons: Capcom Quiz Game was a quiz game released in arcades by Capcom in 1992. The game combined some stylistic elements of RPGs such as a fantasy theme and multiple characters with that of board games to create a unique twist to the quiz game genre.&lt;br/&gt;The game plays similar to a board game, where the player is given a predetermined dice roll that moves the player up to six spaces on the board; however, if the player is so given the choice, he can move to a space of his choosing if there is a fork in the road. After landing on a space, the player is given a series of questions (The amount of questions needed to be answered increase as the game progresses) in order to proceed back to the board for another dice roll. The player is given a time limit to answer the question, with points given that vary based on how fast the player answered the question correctly. If the player is successful in answering a question, one of the gems above the enemy's picture will light up, indicating a correct answer. If the player answers a question incorrectly, he will lose a life point. if the player loses all life points, the player must continue within the time limit or else the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also two special spaces on the game board that the player may land on. If a player lands on an inn space, An inkeeper will ask him one question. If the player answers the question correctly, the innkeeper will increase his health by two health points. The other space is an elf space. If the player answers the elf's question correctly, he is granted a special skill which will be used in the next round of play. Occasionally, the elf awards the player with a &amp;quot;short cut&amp;quot; award that takes the character all the way to the final space of the stage currently being played on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Quiz &amp;amp; Dragons: Capcom Quiz Game&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
