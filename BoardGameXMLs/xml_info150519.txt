			<description>Political conflict game based on Japanese animation series Space Battleship Yamato 2199. The name and cover art is inspired from The Plot to Assassinate Hitler, but the game mechanics are totally different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control one of the political factions in the Gamilas Empire. Each faction has a different goal and special action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players take three actions from any combination of Draw new chit, Special actions, and Recruit a character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The drawn chit represent a character or a event. An event is resolved by using the characters. The result affects the victory points of the faction and the stability of the Empire.
