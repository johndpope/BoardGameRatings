			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GI Joe Team is the last hope for preventing world chaos in OPERATION: ROBOT ASSASSIN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Military intelligence has learned that Cobra plans to assassinate all the world leaders and diplomats gathering for summit talks in Switzerland. Their weapon: an amazing, computer-controlled robot, so lifelike it can be disguised as one of the leaders, staff, or security guards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your skill in defusing bombs as well as other explosive situations has earned you the code name Hotshot. Now you must choose which team to join - Wild Bill, Duke, Bazooka, and others who will attempt to infiltrate Cobra, or Snow Job, Quick Kick, Fling and their cohorts, who will visit hotels and villas to see what they can learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your quest to locate and diffuse the robot before it unleashes its devastating power, there are many choices to make - and each decision is up to you! The whole world will discover how skilled you really are, Hotshot as you FIND YOUR FATE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
