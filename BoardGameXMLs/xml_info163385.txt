							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Loremaster</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The loremaster is a gatherer and keeper of secrets. He is often obsessed by the written word, with cryptic and arcane lore serving as his devoted mistress. Holding to the adage that knowledge is power, the loremaster often forsakes material wealth and personal glory for rare or unusual information, an endless quest that brings him ever closer to his unattainable goal: perfection through edification. Often rejecting what he views as the pointless affectations and transitory pleasures of his shortsighted neighbors, the loremaster believes that the only worthwhile goal in life is the acquisition of intellectual might. After all, wealth is spent, passions fade, and the power of the body is limited by age, while the mind&amp;rsquo;s capacity to grow greater with time is infinite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prestige Class: Loremaster.&lt;br/&gt;Build Classes: Wizard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role: Loremasters&amp;rsquo; lives are spent in study, research, and fieldwork. While the first two lend themselves to the loremaster&amp;rsquo;s reputation as a bookish recluse, the latter oftentimes forces a loremaster to seek out the aid of adventurers who, through a mutually beneficial arrangement, might provide a degree of protection to the scholar while he seeks whatever knowledge he is after. For his part, the loremaster provides a wealth of information and arcane firepower to a party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
