			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are some very good reasons why Leverage the show doesn&amp;rsquo;t feature a wheelman, or indeed many moving vehicles at all. As a game of the show, that provides a very compelling reason not to include the archetype in the game. On the other hand, maybe you&amp;rsquo;re not playing an exact copy of Leverage. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re playing some other kind of heist show, where driving isn&amp;rsquo;t just a handy way to change scenes, but is the bread and butter to your heroes.

The Grifters and Masterminds work their magic so at the right moment, everyone is looking the wrong way and then something is either moved out or in. Hackers can move information; Thieves can move a suitcase, a data stick, maybe an extra body. Soon enough, however, you&amp;rsquo;re going to run into an issue of volume: sometimes, you need to move a lot of something, or a big something. That might be the goal of the job, other times you might just need to bring in a howitzer, or a crane, or an elephant for some part of the scheme. And when you need that kind of volume, you need a Wheelman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can read the whole thing here: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://tinstargames.weebly.com/stuff-for-leverage-the-role-playing-game.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://tinstargames.weebly.com/stuff-for-leverage-the-role-p...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
