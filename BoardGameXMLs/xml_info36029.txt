			<description>&amp;ldquo;Tactical Space Ship Combat Mayhem. Advanced Battleships.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a numbered hex grid. Miniatures or chits, marked for facing, are used to represent the spaceships. The players construct their own fleets based on lists of ships and weapon systems. The scenario sets the number of fleet points that each side starts with. Three scenarios are included in the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement and combat are simultaneous, based on simple written orders. Combat occurs from the last space a unit enters. The written combat orders consist of indicating the weapon system fired and the mapsheet grid number being targeted. Damage inflicted depends on defensive equipment of the target ship (fields, screens and jammers) and the type of weapon used. Nukes and missiles caused fixed amounts of damage, while energy and projectile weapons have diminished capacity at longer ranges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statistics are given for nine types of base ships, ranging from the lowly Transport (used for scenario victory conditions) to the burly Battlestation. Ships are rated for cost, move, hits, number of shields, and number of weapons. Some types of ships can carry Fighter Squads. Ships can be equipped with three types of shields: Albedo Screens (protect against energy weapons), Intertia Fields (protect against projectile weapons), and Jammers (protect against missiles.) Weapon systems that can be purchased include Lasers, Rail Guns, Missile Launchers, Missiles, and Nuclear Missiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
