			<description>Deinze is a small city in the little country called Belgium, it has alway's been small.&lt;br/&gt;But it has a rich History and had important rolles in the history of Brugges, Ghent, Courtrai and Oudenaarde.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has been created as part of a project to make people more aware of these historical events and for people to get to know Deinze&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to be the first one to get, with the golden ring, to the Castle of Ooidonck. This by collecting the ring from 1 of the treasurechests or stealing it from an other player. Before you can enter the castle, you must also collect a key to open the gate. Moving is done by rolling 2 dice in combination with paying cards for the directions you want to go. Cards are collected when you stop your movent on a square with a Jayceelogo, that will grant you a combination of direction cards as a reward,  or you can get 2 direction cards by skipping your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has been made in a very limited run of 300 pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
