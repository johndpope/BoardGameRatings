			<description>Object of the Game is to be the first player to collect at least one of every Tidal Pool Animal Card to fill your sand pail. You can win the game with 6 different animal cards or 5 animal cards and a Treasure Pool card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then follow, taking their turns, to the left of the starting player. Play moves clockwise around the outside track with the larger &amp;quot;squares&amp;quot; by rolling 2 dice. If doubles are rolled, that player may take another turn. You may only enter a Tidal Pool path by landing on the arrow marked Enter. When you enter a Tidal Pool path you may use only 1 die to move your piece. If you land on one of the squares in the path with an arrow pointing at the animal cards, you may pick one up and put it on your Sand Pail Card. You may get more than one of the same animal cards. They are good for trading or dealing with a sea gull snatching up your animal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
