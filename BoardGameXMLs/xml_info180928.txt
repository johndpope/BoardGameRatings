			<description>Welcome to the world of Artificer! Artificer is a deck-building board game with a twist. You must buy (and forge) new cards to put into your deck, but you must also buy ingredients to make artifacts from recipes. Once you have made an artifact, it remains in play and you may use its special ability for the rest of the game! You earn prestige for making artifacts and for buying titles once you have met their requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
