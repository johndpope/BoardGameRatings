			<description>This is Game #24 in the Games on Half a Checkerboard Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a fusion of Turkish Checkers with the Tafl family of games.  The game combines the jump capture and promotion found in games in the Checkers family, with the win conditions found in games in the Tafl family, with modifications made to both families of abstract strategy games, to work on an 8x4 board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Turkish Checkers family comes orthogonal sliding and jumping, and promotion of pieces for the Defending side.  The King side of the game borrows the goal of exiting off a side of the board from the Tafl famil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
