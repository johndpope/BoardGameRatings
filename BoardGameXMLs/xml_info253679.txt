			<description>It's a big feast in the magical kingdom of Turinia, where you take on the role of an ever-hungry halfling that goes to the market to gather all sorts of wonderful ingredients from elves, dwarfs, pixies, trolls, orcs and wizards, so you can cook up dishes that will have every creature in the kingdom licking their fingers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Festo! is a very joyful and exciting board game for the whole family, with simple rules but tons of exciting decisions that will want to make you play the game many times over. Players try, over the course of 4 rounds, to try and gather as many ingredients as they can by placing their servants by the different races in the game. But here's the catch, every round consists of two phases in which the players roll 3 dice that determine which races are available this turn or not. Some races might be totally unavailable because of this, and players will have to decide how many of their servants they want to place in both phases. Once this is done, majorities will determine who gets what.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will be the cleverest of all halflings? Play Festo! and find out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
