			<description>Donkey Konga 3 (ドンキーコンガ3 食べ放題！春もぎたて５０曲♪ Donkī Konga Surī - Tabe-houdai! Haru Mogitate 50 Kyoku?, Donkey Konga 3: All You Can Eat! Spring 50 Song Mix) is a music video game in the Donkey Kong series by Nintendo and Namco. Before the second installment was released in North America, Nintendo and Namco had already started plans for the third game in the series, which was eventually released in Japan in early 2005. It features all new track and mini-games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Donkey Konga 3 features a total of 57 track, over 20 track more than the first two games. 35 of these tunes are the usual classical, pop, and game selections, but an extra 21 tunes from Nintendo Famicom games are included. Unlike the previous Donkey Konga games, Donkey Konga 3 was only released in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Donkey Konga 3: Tabe-houdai!
