It tells the story of Mel, who meets a new personality core and faces an undiscovered threat to the Aperture facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1952, in the early years of Aperture: Science Innovators, Cave Johnson&amp;rsquo;s scientists experimented with whatever they wanted. Not everything worked as it should have though, but that wasn't going to get in the way of the progress of Science! Mel unfortunately took part in a faulty test called the Aperture: Science Innovators Short-Term Relaxation Vault, falling asleep for years. When she finally wakes, the voice of Cave Johnson tells her she needs to escape the facility by using a new device called the Aperture Handheld Portal Device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;What happened to me?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Main Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    22 levels, with an estimated gameplay time of ~6-10 hours &lt;br/&gt;    Custom Story with 350 separate in-game voicelines &lt;br/&gt;    Over an hour of custom music with the Free soundtrack included &lt;br/&gt;    Huge amount of custom assets &lt;br/&gt;    27 steam achievements &lt;br/&gt;    Standalone mod (You do not need Portal 2 installed to play) &lt;br/&gt;    Free to Play (You must own Portal 2) &lt;br/&gt;    Logic based puzzles, not execution or timing based puzzles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
