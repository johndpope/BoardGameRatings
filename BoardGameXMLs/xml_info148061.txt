			<description>Arma Tactics THD (also known as ARMA TACTICS) is a simulation video game for Nvidia Shield, developed by Bohemia Interactive. The game was released on May 2013. This is a new spin to the classic ARMA series making the game a turn-based close-combat strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;ARMA Tactics&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arma Tactics THD takes the best from the popular strategy genre... and goes mobile. The finest assets used in the critically acclaimed Arma series on PC now come to life on the Android mobile platform, in one of the best looking mobile games to date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arma Tactics THD is a turn-based close-combat strategy game, where the player takes control of a four-member Special Forces team. There are no given strategies, rails to move on, or paths to follow; it&amp;lsquo;s up to the player to decide how he will play through both the story-driven missions and generated missions with randomized objectives. Whether using stealth or a more direct approach, players will need to use their strategic thinking and use both basic and advanced weaponry while facing many different opponents - ranging from unorganized local militia to smart and skilled mercenaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With highly re-playable missions, weapons to unlock and whole campaigns to be regularly added, Arma Tactics THD offers many hours of intense ever-changing action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
