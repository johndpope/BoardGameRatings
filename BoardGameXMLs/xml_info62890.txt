							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">A-HAH! Memoritz</name>
									
			<description>A-HAH! Memoritz is a collection of games that can be played with a deck of 40 oversized cards. The cards are numbered 0 to 9 and the numbers come in four different colours. The cards also display 20 pairs of colourful pictures of everyday objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games were developed with the specific intention of using them with people with dementia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games that can be played with the cards are:&lt;br/&gt;1) Quick Match&lt;br/&gt;Cards are scattered face-up and players try to locate matching pairs as fast as they can.&lt;br/&gt;2) The Memory Game&lt;br/&gt;Cards are scattered face-down and players take turns to turn over two cards to try to locate matching pairs. &lt;br/&gt;3) 1-2-3&lt;br/&gt;PLayers are requested to find 2 to 3 cards that add up to a specified number. &lt;br/&gt;4) What's This?&lt;br/&gt;Not so much a game as an activity - players are asked if they recognise images on the cards and this is an opportunity to engage players in conversation.&lt;br/&gt;5) A-Hah!&lt;br/&gt;One card is chosen as the A-Hah! card and put aside. The remaining cards are dealt to all players and players try to form pairs with their cards. Players take turns picking cards from the player to their left to try to form matched pairs. The first player pair all his/her cards wins. The player holding the A-Hah! card is the loser and everyone points at him and says &amp;quot;A-Hah!&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set was published at the same time as another similar set, A-HAH! Fruito.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
