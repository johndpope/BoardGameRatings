			<description>Timecop (タイムコップ) is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game that is based on the movie of the same name. Intending to be a semi-sequel, this game offers many stages not shown in the major motion picture. Levels ranged from the historical hot spots of the past (e.g., 1920s New York City, European front of World War II), the present day, and even a dystopian Los Angeles of the distant future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the game was only released for the SNES, the game was also developed for the Mega-CD/Sega CD, with a short demo being distributed in May 1995 alongside the European Sega Pro magazine. Despite being fully completed by the developer, JVC pulled off the Mega-CD version publishing and it remained unreleased. In 2007, a complete version of the game was eventually released on the Internet by the Mega-CD version coder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timecop_%28video_game%29,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timecop_%28video_game%29,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
