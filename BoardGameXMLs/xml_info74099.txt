			<description>Simple Disney-themed recognition and dexterity game for children. The cards of the game are distributed among two or more players. They then take turns to flip up a card from their stack. When a pair is flipped up in sequence, all players must reach for the &amp;quot;QUACK&amp;quot; card in the middle of the playing area. The one who grabs it gets all the upturned cards to add to the bottom of their stack. A player with no cards is out of the game; the goal is to collect all cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that this is not the same game as that which is called Quack Cards.
