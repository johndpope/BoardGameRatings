							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Archetypes of Yuggoth</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enhance Your Brain Power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The eldritch, the strange, and the weird are often relegated to the domains of villains and NPCs in fantasy, with the good guys being the ones who stand in the way of the dark things that remain just beyond our perception, which we can never truly understand. But sometimes, it can be fun to take on the mantle of the otherworldly, and to embrace the alien terrors of the cosmos. Each installment of Weekly Wonders: Eldritch Archetypes contains five archetypes for eldritch characters&amp;mdash;those that are weird, alien, and otherworldly, who don&amp;rsquo;t fit in with normal society&amp;mdash;as well as a cleric domain devoted to a specific mythos entity or race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this book, we focus on the Mi-Go, also known as the fungi from Yuggoth, a strange race of alien creatures that are best known for their ability to harvest and preserve brains, still alive and sentient, within strange jars, to benefit from their knowledge. From H.P. Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s The Whisperer in Darkness and The Fungi from Yuggoth, this deceptive and uncaring alien race is a staple of the Cthulhu mythos. Whether they mention the mi-go directly or not, each archetype in this book builds on themes of brain harvesting, deceptiveness, alien technology, and fungal biology. This book contains the following archetypes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Yuggothian surgeon, an alchemist archetype that slowly transforms into a fungal creature, and can numb victims with a touch.&lt;br/&gt;    The brain mage, an arcanist archetype that stores his spells in harvested brains, and can use captured brains in a variety of eldritch manners.&lt;br/&gt;    The fungal stalker, a hunter archetype that gains a mi-go companion, and can borrow skills from harvested brains.&lt;br/&gt;    The agent of Yuggoth, a rogue archetype with a focus on fleshwarping and a fungal anatomy.&lt;br/&gt;    The servant of Yuggoth, a witch archetype who stores spells in captured brains, and gains access to a variety of mi-go themed hexes.&lt;br/&gt;    A bonus cleric domain devoted to those who adhere to the strange religion of the mi-go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
