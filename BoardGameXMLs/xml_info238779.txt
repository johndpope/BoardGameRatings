							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">One Night in Coryan</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a move unprecedented in the history of Coryani politics, Pollux Pulcher val'Assant&amp;eacute; forsook his Val family name and all his rights and privileges thereto. Instead, he married into the Gracchi family, perhaps the most powerful human family in the Empire. The newly-minted Pollux Pulcher Gracchi now seeks to become the leader of the Plebian Assembly, second in power only to the Coryani Senate and the Emperor himself. Of course, the only way business gets done in the Assembly is through the tireless efforts of a legion of pages, who carry messages, perform errands, and clean up &amp;quot;messes&amp;quot; of all sorts. Your new job as one of Pollux's pages should be very interesting indeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: A full set of pre-generated characters appropriate for this adventure is included, but some or all of the players may instead bring their own characters. This adventure is designed to introduce players to the city of Grand Coryan, capitol of the mighty Coryani Empire, and to provide an explanation of current events in the campaign, especially the Coryani Civil War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a LIVING ARCANIS INTRODUCTORY adventure, designed for 1st to 5th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
