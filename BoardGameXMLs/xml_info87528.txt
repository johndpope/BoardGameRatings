			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the sole survivor of your race, your goals are to explore a maze of caves in search of the 64 fragments of a parchment containing all the knowledge and culture of your people, and capture enough animal specimens to repopulate the surface of your planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 256 screens to explore, four rooms at a time. Once the player has gathered all the animal specimens and found the parchment fragment, a gate opens to another set of four rooms. The player controls an ovoid spaceship. The player need to step out of the ship to pick up items and to fire the stun gun. Each set of four rooms has stun gun ammunition (enough for the current group of rooms), a key to unlock the chest containing a parchment fragment, energy stations for healing (some stations are faulty and actually drain energy) and several creatures to capture. Once a creature has been stunned, the player need to get back to the ship quickly to pick it up before the effect wears off. There are also all sorts of dangerous hazards in the caves, like acid drops from the ceiling, magma geysers, dangerous flora...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was one of the few arcade computer games of the era to have a savegame feature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
