							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Newton&#039;s Noggin</name>
									
			<description>Isaac Newton did much more than sit under apple trees and use his head to catch falling apples. Many regard him as one of the most influential scientists in history. His seminal work, the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which is Latin for &amp;quot;Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy&amp;quot;, laid the foundation for classical mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Newton's Noggin, 2-4 players manipulate ideas inside Newton's head to formulate the concepts necessary to write the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. Problems will need to be solved or worked around. Other players' ideas will impede your progress. The player that contributes the most ideas to Newton's masterwork wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin the game with 30 ideas represented by wooden cubes in the player's color and six basic Think Cards. Players must use the limited number of cards they have to place and maneuver ideas on the board to form Concepts - various geometric shapes - that make up the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematical. Players will need to manage their hand size and contents in an effort to obtain the most valuable Think Cards possible without exceeding their hand size. Think Cards played to manipulate ideas do not count towards the player's maximum hand size, but careful management and planning is required because the cards used by a player during their turn return to their hand over time in subsequent turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
