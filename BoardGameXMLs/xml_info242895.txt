							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shogi: 4 Players</name>
									
			<description>This is a web-published DIY 4 player version of shogi, a game also called Japanese chess.Each player sets up pieces as usual on the 4 back-rows of a shogi-ban (shogi board). In the center are 3 sets of a row of 9 spaces, one each to be shared between each possible pair of players. That shared row acts as a fifth row of a board shared by a given pair of players; only those two given players may nter or cross through the space. As usual orientation of a piece marks ownership. All standard rules of shogi apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a 3 player version, one player's partial board is simply eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is clockwise. To use Western terminology, a player whose &amp;quot;king&amp;quot; is checkmated at the start of their turn-- whether by a single player-s pieces or by a combination of players' pieces-- is eliminated. The &amp;quot;king&amp;quot; is removed from the board&amp;quot; and thereafter that player's turn is skipped. The last remaining player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
