							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TRADITION OF GLORY: A Game of Naval Adventure during the Age of Nelson.</name>
									
			<description>INTRODUCTION&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1795 and France is gathering their Forces for their Armies and Navy in a grand attempt to conquer Europe. It is also a time of revolutions, imperialism, piracy and political intrigue. In this game, you start out as a young Officer serving in the British Royal Navy. As you complete missions, you will gain experience, honor and hopefully promotions. In time, you may command a Ship of your own. This game is for fans of the Nautical Fiction Series of Horatio Hornblower, Richard Bolitho and Jack Aubrey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;br/&gt;In TRADITION OF GLORY each player creates a Player Officer starting out in what will, hopefully be, a long and glorious career in the Royal Navy. During, play, Player Officers (POs) will be assigned to Ships and conducting a variety of Missions as they move along the Career Track Game Board. The Career Track consists of Ports, Sea Travel and Ship Duty Assignments. These Assignments will result in a variety of situations and encounters including Naval Battles, Port Assaults, Land Skirmishes, Shore Bombardment as well as a variety of other Missions in which the Player&amp;rsquo;s Officer must resolve. The outcome of these Encounters and Situations determine whether the Player&amp;rsquo;s Officer advances along the Career Track. While the Officers conduct Challenges, they might gain or lose Merit Points, which are used to improve their Attribute Ratings and Rank. The Player Officer with the Highest Rank after reaching the Ending Space on the Career Track, is the Winner. If this is tied, then the Officer with the most Merit Points remaining is the Winner. If this is tied then the Officers may conduct a Duel to determine the Winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
