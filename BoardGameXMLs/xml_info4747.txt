			<description>Milton Bradley produced 8 mystery party/role playing games (in the vein of How to Host a Murder) in 1987.  They were all called &amp;quot;Life of the Party&amp;quot; games, four mysteries and four murders.  The back of all boxes indicates that these are also copyright Jamie Swise Games, as that outfit produced several of their own titles (and several, if not all, of these) a few years earlier.  Copyright date below is based on the Jamie Swise date on the invitations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Episode: Who Stole the Stars (1987)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is 1939, and we are in Hollywood.  A select group of guests has been invited to the posh Bel Air home of producer/director Benny Sahlinsky for a screening of his new multi-million dollar epic, Come with the Rain.  Until tonight, Sahlinsky has allowed no one else to see the film.  The film began around 9:00 pm, but guests arrived earlier for champagne and hors d'oeuvres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the film, an unexpected event took place.  Just as the film was building to its final scenes, a Mopey Mouse cartoon appeared on the screen.  The final reel of the film was missing.  A search of the house has turned up nothing.  The final reel included the two most important scenes in the movie, and it was the only copy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
