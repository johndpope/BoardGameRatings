							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Second Look: Barbarian</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first book in the series is the barbarian. The number one thing added to the barbarian in this book is spellcasting using warcries based on the Constitution ability score. Included is a ranger/paladin style barbarian crier as well as a more cleric style as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab your great axe, it&amp;rsquo;s time to unleash your war cry! Charke Publishing is proud to release Second Look: Barbarians. Long the haven for your lonely d12s, Second Look: Barbarians brings new prestige classes, feats and rules for this under-utilized class. Defy the elements with the Nature Walker; Define autonomy with the Barefoot Barbarian; Delve into the mystic secrets of the war cry with the Singing Barbarian! Written by Mark Charke, Second Look: Barbarians is sure to be a must-have for any 3.5 enthusiast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second Look: Barbarians offers 7 new barbarian classes, 11 new prestige classes, the caber as a weapon, 19 new feats, 5 new ways to rage, more than 3 dozen war cries which function like spells, superstitions and totems in this 72 page volume. The Second Look series reviews 3.5 system classes and prestige classes, reinvents and expands on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People who play barbarians, play them because they love barbarians. A trouble maker always at a social disadvantage, the barbarian has always had unwritten flaws. Raging is more a liability than a blessing when compared to the Fighter&amp;rsquo;s Weapon Mastery. The potential for 2 extra hit points are only good comedy to these savage warriors who shun armor and fight recklessly. Here in this book the Barbarian is given more options, more firepower and toughness more appropriate for drawbacks assigned to this class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
