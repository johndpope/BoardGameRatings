			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All aspects of the d20 game &amp;ndash; Fantasy, Modern, Future, Past, and anything else that comes along &amp;ndash; present a system of character representation known as ability scores. From those scores, a&lt;br/&gt;character achieves modifiers used to increase skills, attacks, spells, and other intricacies of the game. In reality, people are much more complex than this, and it is the goal of every RPG designer to create additions seeking to improve the original design and add more realism to the game they play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And sometimes they just look for an excuse to add more feats.  Whatever works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attribute Feats was designed for use in any of the d20 genres and represents a system of traits and flaws with bonus feats gained through ability score combinations. They can also be&lt;br/&gt;modified to suit the particular style, genre, or other concepts of your campaign as desired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
