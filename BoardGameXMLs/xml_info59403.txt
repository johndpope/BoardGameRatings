							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Encyclopaedia II: Dark Bestiary</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to the second volume in the Monster Encyclopaedia series, a collection of tomes designed to bring you a massed horde of brand new enemies and allies for any D20 game. Within the Dark Bestiary are over 200 new creatures dedicated to evil and chaos, just waiting to be unleashed. Whatever your adversarial needs, you will find them within these pages, be tempted by the wassernixe, tormented by the whispering presence or terrified by the titanium dragon. Hordes more monsters both deadly and disgusting await but beware, every creature within these pages is dedicated to pure evil...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each monster is fully detailed with artwork, provided with its own set of statistics under the 3.5 edition of the d20 rules and with descriptive text for a Games Master to read out to fearful Players when they first encounter it. Monster listings are provided alphabetically, by Challenge Rating and by type and sub-type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a selection of monsters spanning the full range of Challenge Ratings, from the insidious blood gerbil at CR &amp;frac12; to the world destroying orbeiron at CR 61, and featuring eleven new demons, nine evil elementals and nine new dragons, the Dark Bestiary is a must for any Games Master who likes to put his Players through the mill and any Player who feels they can rise to the greatest challenge.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
