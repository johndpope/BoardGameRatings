							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Kraken Screams for Sacrifices</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For decades, a kraken has tormented the port town of Massalia. When the kraken&amp;rsquo;s scream echoes across the waters of the bay, the town has one week to deliver a child to the kraken&amp;rsquo;s ravenous jaws. Once again the time has come, and with a heavy heart, the mayor has convened a lottery to choose which child will be sacrificed to protect the town. But this time, a party of adventurers has heard the scream as well, and with any luck, they may just be crazy enough to think they can find a way to kill one of the strongest monsters in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 4th - 6th level characters; adaptable for 3rd - 12th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
