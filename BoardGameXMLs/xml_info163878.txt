							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeon Book of Raguoc</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;This is the gamemaster's book (Raguoc's book) for Acirema containing dungeon scenario designing advice, spells, treasure, equipment and monsters for the RPG and some more background information on the Acirema mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book and the player's book were published for free PDF distribution on the Obscure RPG Appreciation Day 2014 with a permission from the designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Prologue:&lt;br/&gt;This booklet is not meant to be read by all the players! To keep the game interesting only the player acting as Raguoc should read this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Read this dungeon book through slowly and thoughtfully to get most out of it and be able to use your skills for creating an interesting and exciting world of adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If some situation or game element seems tricky at first, try it out in practice to work out the idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
