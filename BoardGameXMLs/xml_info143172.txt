							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Polarity: where there is no middle ground.</name>
									
			<description>Designer Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polarity is a 2013 Game Chef contest entry. As part of the contest the game had to follow a specific theme and use at least two special ingredients. For 2013 these ingredients are all black and white icons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is dark; the lights went out years ago. Why did it go dark? No one really knows and no one really cares. All that matters is that when the light left they came. There wasn't time to wonder why at that point. There wasn't time for anything except the fighting to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where did they come from? They came from within. They were there inside the good and pure things, just waiting for the lights to go out. The came from within and when they came they corrupted. The corrupted the flesh of the host and then spread to others. Like one rotten apple in a bunch the corruption spread and it continues to spread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The corruption didn't get all of us though. Some of us still wear the mantle of humanity. Under the cloak of darkness we fight back. Those who survived the corruption within gained strength from it. Strength of the mind. Some call it mental power, psychic abilities or even magic. Most just call it power. Power to fight back. Power to beat them. Power to re-light the darkness. Welcome to the world of Polarity. This is a game of black and white, a game of sides where the light fights against the darkness. It&amp;rsquo;s a game of Us vs. Them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Themes of Polarity:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polarity is designed to be a GM driven RPG where the GM will frame scenes for the player or players. The game works just as well with just one player and a GM as it does with multiple players. The GM creates scenes and every scene should include some form of conflict. The conflict resolution system is an opposed die roll system. The system uses 2d6 and when a player rolls they have to choose one die to be UP which helps your total and one die to be DOWN which hinders your opposition. There are both simple single roll mundane conflicts and multiple roll epic conflicts. One thing that may different from other RPGs you know is that Player vs. Player conflict is a valid and possible option, though it the players choice on whether to include it or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
