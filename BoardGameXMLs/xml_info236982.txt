							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy</name>
									
			<description>A game I made&lt;br/&gt;For a certain kind of person&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To hurt them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy is a punishing climbing game, a homage to Jazzuo's 2002 B-Game classic 'Sexy Hiking'. You move the hammer with the mouse, and that's all there is. With practice, you'll be able to jump, swing, climb and fly. Great mysteries and a wonderful reward await the master hikers who reach the top of the mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To quote Jazzuo himself: &amp;quot;The hiking action is very similar to way you would do it in real life, remember that and you will do well&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climb up an enormous mountain with nothing but a hammer and a pot.&lt;br/&gt;Listen as I make philosophical observations about the problem at hand.&lt;br/&gt;Between 2 and &amp;infin; hours of agonizing gameplay, depending. The median time to finish for my playtesters was 5 hours, but the mean was closer to &amp;infin;.&lt;br/&gt;Lose all your progress, over and over.&lt;br/&gt;Feel new types of frustration you didn't know you were capable of.&lt;br/&gt;Magical reward awaits hikers who reach the top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
