							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crysis 3</name>
									
			<description>Players take on the role of Prophet as he returns to New York in 2047, 24 years after the events of Crysis 2. He discovers the city has been encased in a giant Nanodome created by the corrupt CELL corporation. The New York City Liberty Dome is a veritable urban rainforest teeming with overgrown trees, dense swamplands and raging rivers. Within the Liberty Dome, seven distinct and treacherous environments become known as the Seven Wonders. Prophet is said to be on a &amp;quot;revenge mission&amp;quot; after uncovering the truth behind CELL's motives for building the quarantined Nanodomes. The citizens were told that the giant citywide structures were erected to protect the population and to clean these metropolises of the remains of the Ceph forces. In reality, the Nanodomes are CELL's covert attempt at land and technology grab in their quest for global domination by means of debt enslavement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Crysis 3&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microbadges:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Crysis Series fan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
