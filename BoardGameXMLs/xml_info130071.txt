							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ach, du dickes Gummibärchen</name>
									
			<description>A licensed game by Haribo, the makers of gummi bears. Its a sort of three card monte for children. A yellow, a green and a red ball made out of a plush material are hidden under three blue plastic cups. The cups are moved around and the players must guess where each colour ended up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box back: &lt;br/&gt;At the gummi bear three card monte championship all players look concentrated how one of the participants moves the cups that hide the three coloured balls around. Who is really observant knows under which cup there is the green, the red and the yellow ball and can win. But it is not rare that the players make wrong guesses!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
