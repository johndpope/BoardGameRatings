							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hunt the Wumpus</name>
									
			<description>A game of hunting the Wumpus. Each player is a hunter trying to be the first to kill the beast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 7x7 array of terrain tiles. The Lair of the Wumpus is placed in the center and the hunting camps are at the four corners. The remaining spaces are randomly placed terrain tiles (clear, forest, swamp, and rocky.) The hunters start in their individual hunting camps and the Wumpus starts in the Lair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player holds a hand of five cards. Cards are played to attack the Wumpus when a player is in the same square as the beast. The opposing players have the opportunity to play Evade cards to help the Wumpus evade the attack. Terrain only affects combat. Each type of Evade card is more successful in a certain type of terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
