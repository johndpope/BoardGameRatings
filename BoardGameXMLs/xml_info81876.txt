							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ivory Tower</name>
									
			<description>A strategic domino game for 2 to 5, played with traditional Western Dominoes.  Designed to provide a tense, tactical, and strategic game in a quick time frame, played solely with dominoes, that does not require pencil and paper or any other components for tracking score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Ivory Tower, players strive to construct their own ivory tower and make it the most impressive in the group by placing dominoes with sequential pips following specific rules and scoring based on numbers of dominoes included in this personal &amp;quot;tower.&amp;quot;  A few extra dominoes are available for purchase in the &amp;quot;shop&amp;quot; each turn, leading some playtesters to affectionately refer to Ivory Tower as &amp;quot;Domino Alhambra&amp;quot; (which is not inaccurate in terms of the feel, but the novel and simple game mechanics actually create a fast and tense game that generates the kinds of difficult decisions and turn angst that is more akin to games like Battleline, Lost Cities, and the Keltis series).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the number of players, varying configurations ranging from Double 6 to Double 9 dominoes are used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
