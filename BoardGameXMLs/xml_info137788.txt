							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Moraff&#039;s Revenge</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moraff's Revenge is a Roguelike game where the player will choose a race and class and then attempt to reach the bottom of a 70 level dungeon.  The top level of the dungeon has a town where the player can rest and resupply.  The players will explore the dungeon which is shown in a first person perspective on the right side of the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By defeating monsters the player is able to gain experience, however they must sleep at an inn on the top level of the dungeon in order to gain a level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end goal of the game is to drink from the fountain of youth, which causes the game to loop.  A new 70 level dungeon is built and your level is set back to 0 but you keep all of your earned stats and items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
