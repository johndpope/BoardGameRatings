			<description>Unruly! is a party card game for all ages, where the object is fairly simple, but the rules are constantly changing, and the laughter is infectious!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In theory, winning the game should be easy.  You just have to play a complete sequence of 3 Thing Cards, but getting there isn't so simple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several obstacles that can, and will, get in your way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules change with every player&amp;rsquo;s turn - rules ranging from silly to downright hilarious!  Breaking a rule comes with a Penalty.  Players draw a Penalty roll, with the results ranging from losing just one card, to losing everything and having to start from scratch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are Event Cards like &amp;quot;Switch places with another player&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Take a Hike&amp;quot; where everyone leaves their cards and moves over one place. These are great for messing with the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And there are Unruly Cards, which players can use at any time, when they catch another player doing the behavior or action listed on the Card, forcing the other player to make a Penalty roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re kept on your toes 100% of the time.  You always have something to do, even when it&amp;rsquo;s not your turn. Your plans and progress can change with the drop of a card or an errant scratch of your head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Competition can be fierce, yet you&amp;rsquo;ll laugh so hard that everyone will feel like a winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
