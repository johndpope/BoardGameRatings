			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DJ Max Portable: Hot Tunes is a compilation music video game for the PSP. The game includes songs and features from DJ Max Portable and DJ Max Portable 2, and was designed to be a beginner-friendly version of the games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hot Tunes allows players to choose from a number of different songs. Each song has a preset note configuration that scrolls from the top of the screen, and the player must press the buttons in time to the notes in order to build combos and complete the songs. Notes can either be single points or drawn lines, the latter of which require the player to hold the button down for a period of time. Successfully hitting enough notes engages Fever Mode, which increases the score multiplier and note values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a combination of Portable and Portable 2, and features a number of different play modes. The player can choose to have songs set in 4B Lite, 6B or 8B modes, which correspond to the number of buttons present in the songs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A limited print of 2000 Collector&amp;rsquo;s sets were produced which include a limited edition wooden case, calendar, original soundtrack, 2 booklet posters, and 8 mini posters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
