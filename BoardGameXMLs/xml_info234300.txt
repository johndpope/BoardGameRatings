			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monstrous Pages for Shadow of the Demon Lord!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They come in the night, the wretched and unclean, an unholy mob intent on murder and plunder. Their white bodies, eyes dark with hate, appear human, but they surrendered their humanity long ago and now are little more than monsters. The troglodytes steal supplies, carry off victims, and butcher everything they leave behind, smearing their bodies with the blood of their kill and lifting their voices into hooting cries to mock the wails of those they make suffer. Time and again, the peoples of the world above have tried to dig out these subterranean dwellers, but no expedition, no matter how well funded or supplied, has ever managed to clear them all away. The troglodytes always return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wretched and Unclean examines the lost and inbred descendants of the Men of Gog, called troglodytes by the people they harm. Inside these pages, you&amp;rsquo;ll find the secrets of this lost race of mankind, their motivations and their habits, along with a bevvy of new variations to bring them to the forefront of your campaigns!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
