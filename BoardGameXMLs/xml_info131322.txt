							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Battling Wager Game</name>
									
			<description>Power Rangers, the evil Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd have sent out the Evil Space Aliens and Putty Patrol Warriors to destroy Angel Grove. It&amp;rsquo;s up to Power Rangers to put a stop to Rita and Zedd&amp;rsquo;s diabolical plan and save Angel Grove before it&amp;rsquo;s too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose their favorite Power Ranger and use their battle die to knock down Evil Villain character pieces by tossing their Battle Die down a Battle Ramp. Players battle each other by placing wagers on how many Evil Villains their Power Ranger will knock down on their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lighting Bolt Tokens are used by players to place wagers on their Power Ranger. The Tokens are each worth different value amounts to estimate the number of knocked down Evil Villains the player's Power Ranger Battle Die will knock down on their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles consist of two players battling on a player's turn. Each will wager using their Lighting Bolt Tokens. The winner of the battle will note how many Evil Villains were knocked down. As an added bonus for when players are going, each round they may place their Power Ranger character piece on the Battle Tray in one of the marked spots. If they are successful in knocking it down on their turn, they'll receive an added bonus if they win the wager.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play continues until each of the players have gone, then a round has been done. Players play three rounds. After three rounds players tally up their scores. The player with the highest score is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
