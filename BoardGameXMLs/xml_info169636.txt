			<description>Save Kalos.  Work as a team - but look out for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are the concerns in Exalted of Kalos.  Monsters pour from the wilderness, trying to overrun the land.  Your group, the mightiest heroes in Kalos, must stop this invasion.  After the invaders (and at least one deadly &amp;quot;boss&amp;quot;) are routed, only one of your number will be granted the title &amp;quot;Exalted of Kalos&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exalted of Kalos finds the sweet-spot in between several gaming styles.  It is easy to learn, even for beginners.  At the same time, experience and tactics play a vital role.  EoK plays much like a &amp;quot;board collapser&amp;quot; cooperative game - where the players work together against automated challenges.  However, it also gives each individual their own agenda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players each take control of a character with their own strengths and weaknesses.  Players must manage power and timing to make the most of their turns.  This is crucial, not only in surviving as a group, but in making themselves stand out individually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
