			<description>Rampage 2: Universal Tour (also known as Rampage: Universal Tour) is the third game in the Rampage series. It is a direct sequel to Rampage: World Tour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;George, Lizzie, and Ralph have been captured for the world to see. George is held at New York, Lizzie is imprisoned in Tokyo, and Ralph is stored in London (references to King Kong, Godzilla, and The Werewolf of London, respectively). Scumlabs, who has just rebuilt their facilities in Salt Lake City, causes another accident that results in three new monsters: Curtis, a mouse, Boris, a rhinoceros, and Ruby, a lobster. Players choose one of the three original monsters to rescue. The player then uses the characters in the part of the world where the rescue is held. They work as a collective to break buildings, eat people, and destroy cars and this creates competition among players. When a player (literally) unlocks Ralph, Lizzie, or George, then they become playable characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Rampage 2: Universal Tour&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
