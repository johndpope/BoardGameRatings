							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Net Book of Riddles</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Net Book of Riddles contains about one hundred riddles and answers, almost all suitable for nearly any style of game.  Most are genre agnostic though some are definitely of a fantasy nature (they could still be used in a non-fantasy genre, however).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book has been published under two names.  The first version was Net.Book.Riddles with two editions, which then was standardized into The Infamous Net.Book.Riddles! Version 3.0b.  These initial versions used a standardized format block that included a unique &amp;quot;entry&amp;quot; number, a submission date, an e-mail address for the submitter, author notation, and a title - followed by the riddle and answer.  For many of the riddles, the standardized data element entries were Unknown or None.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The document subsequently was reformatted to remove all of the standard data elements, presenting only the riddle and the answer.  This later version was titled The Net Book of Riddles and, confusingly, often was called Version 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
