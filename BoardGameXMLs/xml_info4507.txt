			<description>Card game similar to Touring was published in a form fitting box with 75 cards:  39 mileage, 10 take off, 10 weather, 15 hazards and 1 Lucky Lindy.  Based on the historic flight of the same year, hazards include forced landing, storm,  fog, engine trouble, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inventor was a flier in the US Navy and also made gliders and models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Came out in the same year as the similar game Lindy, the New Flying Game by Parker Bros., apparently the subject of a lawsuit by Nucraft against Parker Bros which the latter won. This caused the Nucraft game to have a far more limited production and thus their game is far more valuable to collectors today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Not so sure about this interpretation. A note on the rules for&lt;br/&gt;     Nucraft's game Crash game indicate that Parker Brothers bought&lt;br/&gt;     the rights to the Lindy game from Nucraft. So it would seem&lt;br/&gt;     that Parker bought out Nucraft and shelved their version of&lt;br/&gt;     the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the lawsuit Nucraft issued a different game called Crash, The New Airplane Game. It seems to be a Parcheesi type game played with three planes per color and a four color spinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nucraft Toys ended in 1933 when the company started operating under the name of its founder Paul K. Guillow.  The company Paul K. Guillow did not produce any games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
