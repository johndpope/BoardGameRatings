							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zypods</name>
									
			<description>A new collectable miniatures game geared towards younger players (ages 8 and up).  Each player has an avatar figure which is hidden inside one of several &amp;quot;zypods&amp;quot;: nesting-doll like containers which have a top and bottom half that represent different fighting creatures.  When the creature is defeated, the zypod is &amp;quot;cracked&amp;quot; so that the pod nested inside comes into play.  The game ends when one player finds the other's avatar and defeats it in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial set will have 90 different creatures to collect, creating thousands of possible top/bottom combinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
