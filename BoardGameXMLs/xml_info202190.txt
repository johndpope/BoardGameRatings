			<description>A Storytelling Game of Lost Love&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clicks &amp;amp; Hums &amp;amp; Sirens &amp;amp; the Sun is a storytelling game for two people. It's about lost love, reconciliation, and house music. To play, you'll need a copy of this game and 7 regular, 6 sided dice. If you're downloading a story game, you probably already have a bunch to hand. If not, go raid the Monopoly boxes. We'll wait.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of you will take the role of the guest. The other will take the role of their love, who appears in the guests memory as they reminisce in the midst of a dancing throng of people. Decide who's whom between you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come up with a name for your character, and a little description. Decide on how they look, what their all-time-favourite-album-you-have-to-hear-right-now is, how they feel about The Force Awakens  anything that'll help you get a grip on them before you play them. Don't tell the other player any of this. It'll come out in play. You can be any gender or sexuality you want, but it's assumed that the characters will be attracted to each other, even if they wouldn't normally be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story of the game takes place over the eight hours between the dusk and dawn on a warm September evening. The game should take one to two hours to play in real time.The location is a big-ass house with an even more ludicrously oversized garden. The house and the garden are, both now and in the guests memory, full of people attending the party. There's a rave in the garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the night, the guest will remember eight key scenes from their doomed relationship, one for each hour that they're at the party, which they'll improvise with their love. The scenes are divided into the high (the good part of their relationship) and the comedown (the bad part)&lt;br/&gt;After you've played each scene through, you get the chance that you never get in real life. You get to remix the night. You can trigger plugins and replay through the scene with a new set of complications, hopefully coming out at a better outcome  or at least one you can be at peace with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
