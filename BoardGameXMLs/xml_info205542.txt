			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Immortal Raven Lord may transform all of humanity to ravens by simply touching them. Miracle Princess may break the curse of the raven. Unfortunately, she was imprisoned in one of the towers in the Castle of Raven Lord. One day, the Brave with the power of bluebird, in order to rescue the imprisoned princess, opens the gate of the castle. He explores the rooms in the corridor carefully, trying to find a way to defeat the Raven Lord. Will he succeed? Or will the Raven Lord continue his dominion over the kingdom?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Castle is a fantasy-themed two-player game, with one playing the Raven Lord and the other playing the Brave. They may move around the cloister to collect magic stones to control the five towers or use grimoires to cast powerful magic to interfere with the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving your character wisely grants you the most helpful magic stones, while casting magic at the right time helps you gain the upper hand over your rival. After four rounds, players earn magical powers for dominating the five towers and through the rewards from the secret chambers. The player with the most magical powers wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
