			<description>From the publisher's website: &lt;br/&gt;The rats? Why complain? What good will it do? What are you gonna do about them? One day, there was nothing, and the next, they were everywhere. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t like they crept up on us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was the plague. That&amp;rsquo;s what it was. Hit every city like a hammer. They had to burn everything. They burned the clothes, they burned the corpses. They had to burn everything. Left entire barrios like blackened scars. And that&amp;rsquo;s when the rats moved in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They say the rats brought the plague themselves with their black magic. Made way for their move. That&amp;rsquo;s what they say. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if its true and I ain&amp;rsquo;t saying as such, but that&amp;rsquo;s what I heard. I don&amp;rsquo;t want them looking for me,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;flashing their teeth at me. They&amp;rsquo;re a part of the city now and that&amp;rsquo;s that. Like the haffuns, they&amp;rsquo;re just here and there&amp;rsquo;s no getting rid of them. So, why bother?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Me, I say keep them. Never been so quiet since they moved in. Got rid of all the filth that was running around here. Don&amp;rsquo;t see no more gangs, do you? That&amp;rsquo;s because the rats got rid of them. No more of that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sure, I pay them. Why not? If I don&amp;rsquo;t, I&amp;rsquo;ll get them gangs back. Better to have the rats than the gangs. And at least them rats understand respect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash; Robin Jestes, Copper Merchant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Reign of Men does not know what to think of them, but one thing is certain: the &amp;quot;ratmen&amp;quot; are here to stay. They are also the sixth race in the Wicked Fantasy Series, reinventing the classic generic fantasy races with a wicked twist. The ratmen--or &amp;quot;roddun&amp;quot;--have made themselves a home in the Reign of Men... but do they have the will and cunning to stay?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wicked Fantasy: Scourge of the City includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    FULL COLOR AND FULLY ILLUSTRATED!&lt;br/&gt;    New Ratmen Racial Traits&lt;br/&gt;    New Rules for &amp;quot;Mischiefs,&amp;quot; the roddun street gangs that rule the Lower City&lt;br/&gt;    Gemstone Magic: A trick the roddun &amp;quot;picked up&amp;quot; from the Wicked Fantasy dwarves&lt;br/&gt;    New Wizard Archetype: the Junk Wizard&lt;br/&gt;    New Ninja Archetype: the Street Assassin&lt;br/&gt;    A New Prestige Class: The King Rat&lt;br/&gt;    A Robust System for City Control&lt;br/&gt;    And More!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
