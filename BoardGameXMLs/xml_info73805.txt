							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Silent Hill: Homecoming</name>
									
			<description>[User Summary]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silent Hill: Homcoming is a survival-horror game, the sixth in the Silent Hill series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this episode, the player controls Alex Shepherd, a soldier who comes back to his hometown, Shepherd's Glen. There, he learns that his brother Joshua is missing, and Alex vows to bring him back. This quest will bring Alex to Silent Hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is typical of the genre, mixing puzzle elements (to advance the story) with action sequences where Alex must fight the various monsters that are in his way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compared to previous episodes, Homecoming introduces some new features. As a soldier, Alex is a more powerful protagonist, with a higher variety of combat moves. Also, the player now takes an active part in conversations and has to pick between several lines of dialogue. Finally, the player now has total control of the camera.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
