			<description>Koncern (&amp;quot;Company Group&amp;quot;) or, formally, Aktiespelet Koncern (&amp;quot;The Company Group Stock Game&amp;quot;) was Aristospel's contribution to the financial games of Sweden in the period 1950 to 2010. Alga held the licence for Monopol and also published their own Finans. From Lemeco came Kapital and Kärnan would eventually publish Börsspelet/Aktiespelet while Olsen decided to publish Yuppie. A similar game was Marketing from Tre Ringar and also Invest from Harlekin. And this is not the definitive list! All in all, a self-respecting Swedish games publisher needed a financial game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Koncern is the usual Monopoly-like game were players move around by dice rolls and buys and sells stocks and bonds etc. The publishing year is an estimate made on company historic grounds (the companies that features in the game, that is).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An interesting feature is that the companies in this game were to an high degree part of the Handelsbanken sphere of influence, while competitor Lemeco's contemporary game Kapital connected to the sphere of S-E-Banken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
