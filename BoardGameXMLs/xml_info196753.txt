			<description>Hey Yo, listen up chico. 2 Count! is a pro wrestling micro card game for 2 players. Players are trying to get the biggest &amp;quot;pop&amp;quot; from the audience by performing the better move/hold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a deck of 9 cards that make up their wrestlers moves set. These moves all have a numerical value that indicates how valuable that move is to the wrestler. These decks are shuffled and then each player will draw 2 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After drawing cards players will assess what they have and potentially what the other player has and then choose 1 crowd reaction card. Crowd Reactions are used as a &amp;quot;bet&amp;quot; and go to whomever wins each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a count of 1, 2, 3 each player slaps down one of their 2 wrestler cards and the higher value wins the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The catch (can) is that the highest moves in a wrestler's deck all have a different back to them so the opponent knows when you draw these cards. There is a also a hidden cheat card that each player has that will beat any of the higher valued cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 8 quick rounds the wrestler who garnered the most crowd reaction is the ultimate winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 Count! uses a mix of betting, card counting and reading the other player to create a fast playing card game for any wrestling fan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
