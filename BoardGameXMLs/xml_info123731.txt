			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Authored by Lucas Pope, this 15 minute game casts you as a newspaper editor told by a repressive government to choose stories that increase people's loyalty and increase your paper's readership.  Your family is being held for 'protection' by the state and their fate depends on your success.  Will you choose pro-government and bland stories or will you spice up the news with the state's failures and rebel successes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game presents a list of story headlines that scroll up on the left of the screen like a news feed.  These can be selected in three sizes to be laid on the newspaper front page to the right.  Once a deadline hits, the paper is published and scored, with adjustments to circulation and state loyalty of the people.  The government provides a set number of days before the paper and your family are evaluated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
