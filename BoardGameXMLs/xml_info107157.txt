							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Canyon Climber</name>
									
			<description>from the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vast beauty of the Grand Canyon would take away your breath if you were viewing it from the safety and comfort of the canyon ledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine how you&amp;rsquo;ll feel at the bottom of the awesome pit as you try to work your way up from the canyon floor thousands of feet below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Colorado River roaring at your feet is the least of your worries as you attempt to blow up bridges and scale walls that would make the most experienced mountain climber tremble. Surefooted mountain goats will stalk your every move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But don&amp;rsquo;t lose hope...unless, of course, you&amp;rsquo;re scared of heights! For safety is just a jump and a ladder away. Or, so it seems. The natives are restless, so don&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if you find several arrows -- or a not so friendly Indian -- heading your way. And, as you leap over treacherous peaks and gorges, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to look up from time to time...for you must always beware of birds bearing bricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s that?? Blue sky ahead!! You&amp;rsquo;ll dance for joy as you reach the top of the majestic ravine, now at its most peaceful and serene...or is it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play CANYON CLIMBER and experience the excitement, the challenge, and the dangerous thrills of the great outdoors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
