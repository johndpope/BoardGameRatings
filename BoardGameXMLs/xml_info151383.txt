			<description>A game that featured in the British Disneyland Annual for 1977.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple Goose-type game. Mickey Mouse wants to go out in his car but his friends want to go with him. He has to wait until one friend arrives (and he looks very cross as he waits by his car). Players move by a die roll and must obey the special squares. The first player to reach square 30, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
