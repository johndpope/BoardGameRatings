			<description>Shibboleth is a five round micro strategy game for 2-4 players. In Shibboleth you play as a member of one of eight socioeconomic classes living in a city that is in the middle of a bloody revolution. In each round just like in each revolution throughout history there is a class that leads the revolution, a class that does the dirty work, and a class that is blamed for the hardships of the past. These three classes will be random each round. With 512 different possible combinations each revolution may be similar to events from history, or completely original. Players will have to use deceit and cunning to bide their time and escape to freedom, or turn on one another and join the revolution. Each round takes 3-5 minutes to play and is completely unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
