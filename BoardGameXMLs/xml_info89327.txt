			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game Master's Guide for the Promotion of Cruelty to PCs is a sourcebook for all those GMs sick of playing a lawful neutral or chaotic good alignment, adjudicating fairly and fudging die rolls so that a player's character might live. Ever wanted to play a chaotic neutral, lawful evil or even chaotic evil GM? This book gives you the chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Containing some of the nastiest acts a GM could perpetrate during a game session, it describes in detail how one can go about manipulating and torturing PCs while staying entirely within the rules. The Game Master's Guide for the Promotion of Cruelty to PCs is a sourcebook of challenge and frustration. You're the GM and you make the rules, but players get to know a GM's style after a while. This book will catch your players unaware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than put this book down thinking that your players will become so frustrated that they'll give up and leave, remember that the element of surprise is one thing they love about the game. They might become frustrated, but any good GM will give in eventually - and that's when your players will smile and say, &amp;quot;Why didn't I think of that?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
