							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Guerra do Yom Kippur</name>
									
			<description>Wargame based on the Battle of Deversoir in the Yom Kippur War, 1973. This game was inspired by the 1975 SPI's Chinese Farm and was published only in Brazil in the early 80's, along with SPI's Wurzburg and Strike force 1 (A Batalha das quatro horas), as part of a collection called &amp;quot;Todos os Jogos&amp;quot; (only these three were wargames, however). They came all together in a ziplock and no boxed versions were available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
