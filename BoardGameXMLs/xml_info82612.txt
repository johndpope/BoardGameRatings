			<description>New Adventure Island (高橋名人の新冒険島, Takahashi Meijin no Shin Bōken Jima, &amp;quot;Master Takahashi's New Adventure Island&amp;quot;) is a 1992 platform game by Hudson Soft for the TurboGrafx-16. The game was released shortly after Super Adventure Island, making it the fourth game in the overall Adventure Island series. It was followed by Adventure Island III for the NES and Game Boy, Super Adventure Island II for the Super NES and Takahashi Meijin no Bōken Jima IV, a Japanese exclusive for the Famicom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plot does not deviate much from most other Adventure Island games: While Master Higgins and Tina are leaving the church after getting married (Presumably after the events of Super Adventure Island), a shadowy figure called Baron Bronsky and 6 of his underlings kidnap Tina and 6 island children. The player's job is to guide Master Higgins through 6 worlds with 4 levels each (The last being a slightly smaller level with a boss) to rescue the children, and then finally defeat Baron Bronsky in his fortress to rescue Tina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was rereleased on the Wii's Virtual Console service in Japan on December 2, 2006, in Europe on February 16, 2007 and in North America on February 19, 2007. It also made its way on the Japanese PlayStation Network on July 15, 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;New Adventure Island,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
