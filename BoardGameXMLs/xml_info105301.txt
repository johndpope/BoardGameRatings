			<description>Familiengefl&amp;uuml;ster, which is aimed at families with small children, is about the wishes of the different family members. The game starts with family members writing down their wishes by finishing a sentence on a randomly selected card, such as &amp;quot;You will ... together with me.&amp;quot; Then, they select a family member who should fulfull their wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the next round, they try to communicate their wish by drawing it on the back of another player. If they can communicate their wish correctly, they gain a happiness card; otherwise, they gain an out-of-luck card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, all players vote on which wish is the best, to determine a &amp;quot;family wish&amp;quot; that should be carried out before the next game of Familiengefl&amp;uuml;ster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
