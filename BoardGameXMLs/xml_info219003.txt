							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dust Tactics: Spetsnaz Kill Squad â€“ &quot;Killers&quot;</name>
									
			<description>Spetsnaz is an acronym of Spetsialnogo Naznacheniya, or &amp;lsquo;Special Purpose Force&amp;rsquo;. These are soldiers capable of accomplishing special missions that regular units cannot. The &amp;lsquo;Killers&amp;rsquo;, the Spetsnaz kill squads, are just that. These men can overcome any situation they are put in, no matter how dangerous or desperate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Spetsnaz Kill Squad is called into action, it&amp;rsquo;s to make sure that there are no survivors left, no building still standing, and no enemy vehicle in one piece - and to leave no evidence of who did it. They are the most ruthless soldiers in the SSU, with the possible exception of the famed Steel Guards, many of whom are former members of a kill squad anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Killers use regular Sino-Soviet Union weapons and equipment, mixed with a few extras of their own, but it&amp;rsquo;s the way they use them that makes the difference. Their preferred weapon is the Avtomat Kalashnikova 45 (AK-45) assault rifle, the future weapon of all SSU infantry. The Killers back these up with Sulphur Jet flame-throwers, DPM machine-guns, and two RPG-1 anti-tank launchers. Every Killer is also armed with a standard-issue Spetsnaz machete, the signature weapon of these troops for close-in and personal killing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spetsnaz Kill Squad primary&amp;rsquo;s objectives are eliminating enemy infantry and leaders, light and heavy vehicles. They excel at these jobs. As long as it involves spreading mayhem, you can count on these men!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
