			<description>A solo card game in tribute to the genre of Squad Level, Suicide Mission, Ensemble Cast, Survival, War Movies such as: Sahara, Saving Private Ryan, The Big Red One, The Dirty Dozen, The Desert Rats etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 Decks: &lt;br/&gt;-    Soldier Deck - these are the soldiers you start with and some you acquire along the way.  Most soldiers provide 1 to 3 skills (from a total of 18). &lt;br/&gt;-    Aid Deck - these are help and friends you acquire during the game.  Most aid cards provide 1 to 2 skills. &lt;br/&gt;-    Mission Deck - this is the one main objective you are trying to achieve in the last game turn. Most missions require 4 specific skills to complete. &lt;br/&gt;-    Encounter Deck - these are the foes and difficulties you encounter along the way. Most encounters require 1 to 3 specific skills to overcome them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start:&lt;br/&gt;-     Draw 12 soldiers.  You may discard up to 4 soldiers and draw replacements. Soldier cards are kept face up in front of you. &lt;br/&gt;-    Draw 4 aid cards and put them in your hand. &lt;br/&gt;-    Draw 1 mission card and place it face up. &lt;br/&gt;-    Draw 14 encounter cards.  Place these face down in a row leading up to the mission card. This is called the encounter row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn has 3 Phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.    Aid Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     Draw 1 aid card and put it in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.    Encounter Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     Flip over the next card in the encounter row and see what skills it requires to be overcome. &lt;br/&gt;-     Check your soldiers and aid cards to see if you have those skills.  If you are missing one or more skills, a random soldier is killed. &lt;br/&gt;-     If you needed to use one or more aid cards discard them. &lt;br/&gt;-     If you completed the encounter successfully roll 1D6: on a roll of 5 or 6 a random soldier is killed anyway (these are dangerous missions). &lt;br/&gt;-    If all the encounters are finished, the squad faces the final mission. When facing the final mission you may draw an extra 2 aid cards. &lt;br/&gt;-    You only win the game if the final Mission is completed successfully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.    End Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     Max hand size is 5 aid cards.  Discard excess cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play a maximum of 30 turns. To win complete the last mission, and have at least 1 soldier survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
