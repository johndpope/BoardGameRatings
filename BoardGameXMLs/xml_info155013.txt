			<description>From the game's rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;ADD-TOO is a game where the player places his diamond next to a diamond already on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 45 diamonds, each of which is colored orange and blue, with a number on each color anywhere from one to ten.  Colors always must be matched, but numbers can either be matched or played to make scoring combinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to play all diamonds from the hand as quickly as possible in either matching or scoring combinations.  Players left with diamonds suffer penalties.  Each player, therefore, tries (1) to play out all diamonds from his hand as quickly as possible and (2) to make as many scoring combinations as he can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hands are played until a game of 200 points, or some other predetermined count is reached.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
