			<description>Roll and Move in which each player has two playing pieces which start from different positions. The first player whose second piece catches up with his/her first piece is the winner. &lt;br/&gt;The active player rolls two dice, using the lower result for the first, the higher result for the second piece. There is a limited amount of decision-making; a result can be forfeited or one die can be re-rolled (but then both pieces have to be moved). When a player rolls a double, he/she has to move both pieces and roll again. As soon as the second piece of a player has reached the starting line of the first piece, he/she can also make use of a blockade piece which can be removed (and employed against another player) on a roll of &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
