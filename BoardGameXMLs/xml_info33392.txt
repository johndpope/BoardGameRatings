			<description>This is a word game that can be played with any number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is composed of three dice with letters and one die with numbers - there are four letters or numbers with their own color on each side of the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the dice are rolled, in the allotted time (3 minutes), players try to make a word with the twelve visible letters . Points are given with each letter of the word receiving the value of its like-colored number. In addition to basic 3-6 letter words, the scorecard rewards bonuses if the player can come up with an animal, a name of a town, a word that is 7+ letters, and a word that is composed solely of one color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game lasts eight rolls of the dice, with one category on the scorecard being completed with each roll. The player with the highest score at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
