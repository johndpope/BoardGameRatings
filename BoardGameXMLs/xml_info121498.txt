			<description>The goal of the game is to find a gem from Finnish province called Ostrobothnia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a die and move their button forward trying to find a gem called Star of Ostrobothnia. During the trip players flip tokens and cannot know what they will find. Players can crash to the knife, which is humorically a some kind of symbol of Ostrobothnia, and have to answer a question which asks knowledge of Southern Ostrobothnia. Players can open a token with a gallant hat and it amuses with aphorisms and grumbles. Players can also drift to a prison with Isoontalon Antti and Rannanj&amp;auml;rvi, which are famous characters of Ostrobothnia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game players move their buttons in earth, sea and air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
