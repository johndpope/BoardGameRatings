							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Get Castro!</name>
									
			<description>The players represent various elements of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) seeking to assassinate Fidel Castro back in the fifties and sixties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a custom deck of 57 cards. There are seven types of cards: Method, Conspiracy, Location, Save, Event, Propaganda, and Spy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players attempt to play melds of cards of the same type. Once you have three melds in play (one each for Method, Conspiracy, and Location), you may make an Assassination Attempt die roll to see if you kill Castro. If the roll is not successful, you lose some or all of your melds and the game continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Save and Event cards can be used to require an opponent to discard a meld. Propaganda cards allow a player to draw additional cards. Spy cards allow you to look at an opponent's cards and steal one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Winning: Be the first player to Assassinate Castro. If Castro is not killed after the players have gone through the deck twice then Castro survives and all the players lose.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
