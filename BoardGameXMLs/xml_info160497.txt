			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do your heroes have a good idea what's coming next during their big adventure?  Do you need something to throw them off balance? We have the series for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes your heroes are not looking for Comic Book Style Mega-Events and want stories that are &amp;quot;one and done.&amp;quot;  Scene Stealers are single serving adventures for, SUPERS! Revised Edition, that can take place over the course of a single gaming session.  While they are very easy to use as a single serving of Superhero Action, Scene Stealers are also an excellent way to break up an ongoing adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this issue, your Supers are attempting to stop Cold Kill, from hijacking an armored car. If our heroes manage to stop this chill blained menace, can they get their second wind and stand against an even greater threat?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High speed chases, sinister villains, and motor scooters...  Do your heroes have what it takes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
