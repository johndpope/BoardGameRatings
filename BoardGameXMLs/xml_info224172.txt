			<description>This is a fan-made Imperial adventure. The players playing as a squad of Stormtroopers in the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the prologue:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;11 Years Ago&amp;hellip; A Stormtrooper squad led by a young officer stand outside a homestead. The young officer shouts for the family inside to come out. A teenager emerges with his hands up. His face is streaked with tears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Please don&amp;rsquo;t kill my family mister,&amp;rdquo; he cries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Your parents inside, child?&amp;rdquo; the officer asks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The boy nods and a sadistic smile spreads across the officer&amp;rsquo;s face. He raises his flame thrower and sets the homestead ablaze. As his family&amp;rsquo;s screams fill the air, the young man lunges at the officer. The officer strikes the teenager with his gun butt, creating a large gash on his forehead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nothing personal,&amp;rdquo; the officer shrugs to the boy. &amp;ldquo;I could have taken them alive&amp;hellip;but I just enjoy killing too much. Nothing like the smell of traitors burning in the morning.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
