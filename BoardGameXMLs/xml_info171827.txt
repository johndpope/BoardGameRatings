			<description>The cards are divided between the forces of good and evil i.e. He-Man and Allies against the cohorts of Skeletor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 4 cards and another card is revealed. If you card is a 'Good' character, the first player must play a 'Bad' character to win the trick and vice-versa. Players draw a new card and the top card of the deck is revealed again, and play continues. The player who wins the most tricks after the last card is revealed from the deck, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
