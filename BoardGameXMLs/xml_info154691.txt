							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wilderness Ablaze: A Solitaire Game of the French and Indian War</name>
									
			<description>The Wilderness Ablaze is a semi-historical simulation of the French and Indian War in the American Colonies during the Mid-1700s. Players assume the role of the Commander of Forces in the American Colonies in the turbulent times where both France and Britain are seeking to increase their nation's territory and power. Can you defeat the French by capturing Montreal and preventing them from capturing British settlements?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: As the Commander of British Forces in the American Colonies, you must protect the British Settlements and attempt to capture the Key French Settlements of Quebec, Montreal and Toronto before the Campaign Deck runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME FEATURES: The game features a fun and simplistic method for resolving solitaire combat tactically, rules for Heroes that can make an impact on the outcome of battles, and lots of colorful game counters. If you enjoy movies like &amp;quot;Last of the Mohicans&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Pathfinder&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;The Northwest Passage&amp;quot;, you will enjoy this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
