							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crabs Adjust Humidity: Volume Five (unofficial expansion for Cards Against Humanity)</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume Five of the unofficial 3rd-party expansion to the hit party game Cards Against Humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When we first created Crabs Adjust Humidity, they said we were crazy. &amp;quot;Doomed.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I like to think we weren't, at first. But it's too late now, for us. Far too late. All we can do now is complete the ritual, and hope that when the Old Ones come, they pass up our shrunken, withered husks in favor of more... succulent meat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To that end, we bring you Crabs Adjust Humidity: Volume Five. Here's another 112 cards, stuffed to the gills full of blasphemy, vitriol and the foul gibbering of the irredeemably insane.&lt;br/&gt;Includes: 80 white cards, 32 black cards&lt;br/&gt;Professionally printed on linen-finish, casino-quality cards.&lt;br/&gt;100% compatible with Cards Against Humanity.&lt;br/&gt;Custom serialized hologram on every box, so you know you're not getting a counterfeit.&lt;br/&gt;Loves you just the way you are.&lt;br/&gt;Best if used by 07-23-3015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
