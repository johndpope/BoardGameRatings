			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shining Force CD is a turn-based tactical RPG and is part of the Shining Force series. The player will control his characters within each battle and direct them to engage the enemy on a battlefield grid. The game is comprised of four books. It begins by compiling the two earlier Game Gear games; Shining Force Gaiden and Shining Force Gaiden II into the first two books. Once the player completes these two books, they are allowed to play Books 3 &amp;amp; 4. These are totally new scenarios involving some of the same characters as Books 1 &amp;amp; 2. There are a total of 53 tactical battles within this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
