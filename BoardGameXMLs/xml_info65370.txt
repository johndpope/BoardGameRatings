			<description>A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played with 1/72 scale miniature figures or paper figures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;On June 6, 1944, the liberation of France began. Americans, and their allies, launched a massive amphibious assault on the beaches of Normandy. The attack took the Germans by surprise. In some places the Allies faced light resistance. But on Omaha Beach the Americans faced a fearsome German defense consisting of concrete bunkers, mine, barbed wire, machine guns, and artillery.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is scalable for various sized playing groups. The Germans receive one bunker and the Americans receive three squads for each lengthwise foot of mapsheet depicting the beach. There are no German soldier figures - just American landing craft and soldiers versus German bunkers, artillery, and obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
