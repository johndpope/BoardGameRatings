			<description>This game is based on a tv quiz show broadcast in Italy. A player will play the presenter, while the others the competitors. The game develops in 3 contests: the Curtain, where players in turn try to guess the character hidden by 16 tiles removing as few ones as possible, the Poll, where players try to guess the exact percentage of a national poll and the Big Quiz, where players try to answer a question on a exclusive selected subject between news, culture, science, show business, sport and advertising. Finally, each player has to answer to a question choosing between three different categories, namely music, history or literature/sport/show business, in order to double his own score or lose all the points scored. The player with the highest score, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
