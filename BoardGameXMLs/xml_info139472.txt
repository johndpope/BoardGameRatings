			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Beyond the Wall and Other Adventures. This is a simple set of rules similar to older versions of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular fantasy roleplaying game. The game is designed to be easy to learn and fast to use during play. There are many such games available. Beyond the Wall is different for two reasons:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Flavor - Beyond the Wall can model most kinds of fantasy stories, but is particularly well-suited for a certain kind of fantasy literature best exemplified by Ursula K. LeGuin&amp;rsquo;s first three Earthsea novels and Lloyd Alexander&amp;rsquo;s Chronicles of Prydain. These are mostly stories of low fantasy about young heroes finding their way in dangerous situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Out-of-the Box Play - While the core rules of Beyond the Wall are similar to those of the numerous other games based on the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular fantasy roleplaying game, it does&lt;br/&gt;offer something that the others do not: tools to play the game almost immediately and with little prep. Using special Character Playbooks and Scenario Packs, a group of players with a single gamemaster should be able to play the game with absolutely zero prep in about three to five hours, from making characters to tasting a glorious success or a bitter defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game still works perfectly well for traditional playstyles, but we made it as a vehicle for quick, on-the-fly play, as we often found ourselves wanting to be able to sit down and play a roleplaying game without all the fuss that is normally involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
