							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chain Reaction 3.0: Swordplay</name>
									
			<description>Where's my machine gun?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Chain Reaction came out seven years ago the unique Reaction System took the gaming world by surprise. That led to CR 2.0 and now CR 3.0 which you can get free at our website. But hey, that&amp;rsquo;s all about modern guns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But our gamers wanted more. They wanted &amp;ldquo;old school&amp;rdquo; combat where arguments were settled at the tip of a sword.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s what Chain Reaction 3.0 &amp;ndash; Swordplay is all about. Hand to hand combat with sharp cutting and sticking weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So we&amp;rsquo;re giving away this companion rules set for you to use. That&amp;rsquo;s right, giving away as in it&amp;rsquo;s free. All the latest mechanics that can be used for ancient, medieval, and fantasy hand to hand combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because we want you to try the Origins Award winning Reaction System which Two Hour Wargames is built around. What is the Reaction System?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not for everyone. If you like total control of your forces then just keep walking because you&amp;rsquo;ll hate it. But if you want realism where you control yourself and your forces succeed or fail based on your leadership skills then you&amp;rsquo;ve come to the right place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just try it and if you like it then there&amp;rsquo;s a whole world of games covering a variety of genres and periods waiting for you. And you STILL can use any figures you already have!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And if you don&amp;rsquo;t like CR 3.0 &amp;ndash; Swordplay it&amp;rsquo;s all good. Because really it&amp;rsquo;s all about playing games that you like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just play the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
