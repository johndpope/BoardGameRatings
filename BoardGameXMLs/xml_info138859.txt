							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sledge Hammer</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Need a big bad biker for your campaign, well here&amp;rsquo;s one for you, Sledge Hammer isn't much for talking, he lets his fist do his talking or anything he can grab to beat some punk down is fair game, he also thinks if he and his brothers in the Hell riders jump on a guy, the guy should have had more friends. Sledge also has to prove he is the baddest, toughest, meanest S.O.B around knowing he has nearly invulnerable skin and pushing the amount of damage he can take to the utmost extreme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the most part he's meant to be a razor edged face (good guy) but can easily be tailored as a villain for your campaign needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
