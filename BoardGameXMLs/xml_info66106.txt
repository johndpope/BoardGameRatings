							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Thoughts and Actions: Daredevil</name>
									
			<description>A wild Party game that is tame enough to play at almost any adults only party, but goes the distance for even the most non-vanilla players. It is intellectually and physically challenging for both couples and singles, and is overflowing with thought provoking and sexually stimulating challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for all Genders and Preferences&lt;br/&gt;Includes non-gender specific game play that allows for comfortable play among homosexual, bisexual, and heterosexual players. The cards have been carefully written so that all contact events can be played with your monogamous partner whether or not he or she is on your team. For non-monogamous players, there has never been a better ice breaker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great for Team Competition&lt;br/&gt;Split the party into teams and let the battle begin. Play girls vs. the boys and find out which gender is sexually smarter and braver. Or break down the teams and go couple vs. couple to discover which couple has the best sexual relationship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great for Couples&lt;br/&gt;Every Thought card is carefully designed to engage the party in constructive conversations regarding the most common sexual and relationship problems. Every Action card was designed to reveal the most common sexual fantasies of both men and women. Playing this game with your spouse might just stoke the flames and teach you something about your partner that you never knew before playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great for Singles&lt;br/&gt;From college students to retirees, anyone who admits to being a sexual being can learn something from playing this game. In one hour of playing this game, you'll learn more about your sexual compatibility with other players than you could in a solid week of blind dates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Directions:&lt;br/&gt;Divide the players into teams. Separate the cards into the four decks of &amp;quot;Thoughts&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Actions&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Sex Survey&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Daredevil&amp;quot;. The first player on the first team chooses one card from the four decks and completes the challenge. If the other team thinks they have a better answer they may challenge. Each completed card counts as one point. Daredevil card points are marked individually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one deck is fully depleted and each team tallies their score to determine the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
