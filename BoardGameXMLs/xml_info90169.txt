			<description>The Dungeoneer: The Adventuresome Compendium of Issues 1-6&lt;br/&gt;A compendium of The Dungeoneer, Vol. 1, Nos. 1 to 6&lt;br/&gt;Issues #1 to #6&lt;br/&gt;1979&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edited by Chuck Anshell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cover art by Paul Jaquays and Aaron Arocho.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the inside cover, 1st paragraph:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would guess that the whole idea behind the publishing of a magazine is that someone has a concept that they would like to market and make money off of before somebody else thinks of it. Unfortunately, that's the way with most things in life. It's probably even one of the ideas behind this magazine, mercenary as it may seem. However, a lot of people publish magazines because they have an interest in something that inspires them enough to write about it and publish it. I hope that that's what you'll see in this zine. We here at The Dungeoneer want to put out a magazine that is purely a DM's publication, dealing with D&amp;amp;D, working it as sort of an optional supplement and as a place for the discussion and clarification of rules as we and others see them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
