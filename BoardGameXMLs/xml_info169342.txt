			<description>From the the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A great new card game based on Pick Up Sticks.  Pile the cards and take turns picking up as many cards as you can.  Can you move your card without shifting the stack?  It's fun--it's quick.  It's Pick Stick Oh!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick Stick Oh! is a new twist on the classic Pick Up Sticks, played with cards rather than sticks.  Players are dealt cards and then take turns tossing them into a pile.  Each card must overlap another card.  After all the cards are placed, each player takes turns trying to take a card off the stack without shifting any other cards sideways (lifting up is okay).  Cards have point values from 1 to 5.  If a player takes a red 2 or 3 successfully, he or she gets another turn.  The player with the most total points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
