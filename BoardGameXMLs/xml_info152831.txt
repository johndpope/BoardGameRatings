							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythweaver Solitaire #1: A Dwarf&#039;s Tale</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This solitaire adventure serves as an introduction to Mythweaver: Legacy. Welcome! I hope that you enjoy your stay in the Splintered Realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure assumes that you are playing a dwarf fighter built on 20 Character Points, the dour fighter Grimsby. While you aren&amp;rsquo;t required to play Grimsby, this adventure assumes you will play a solo dwarf built on about 20 CPs, and that you have the [Mythweaver: Legacy] core rules on hand. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have those rules, you can still play this adventure; Grimsby&amp;rsquo;s character sheet appears on page 2, and every entry tells you what to roll; so, as long as you have a pencil and a 12-sided die, you are good to go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
