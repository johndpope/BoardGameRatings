			<description>An early attempt to make Duplicate Bridge into a game you can play in your house yet test yourself against experts who have played the hand before you do.&lt;br/&gt;Two packs of playing cards but each card has a different back design&lt;br/&gt;Two rule books&lt;br/&gt;A pad of bidding slips&lt;br/&gt;A book with the analysis of the hands provided&lt;br/&gt;An indicator to show the dealer and vulnerability&lt;br/&gt;Each playing card has an indication on the back. Check the game number you are about to play, then check the back of the card and deal it to the player indicated. Do this with all 52 cards and everyone should have a hand of 13 cards. Bidding then takes place and the hand played out.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the hand, you can check analysis book to see how 'experts' bid and played the hand. Points are scored during each hand. First each pair might score points for bidding correctly. Then points can be won for making the correct lead to trick one. And finally you can score points for making the final contract. Interestingly, whatever the bidding, the hand must be played in the contract that the 'experts' suggest You can even complain to John Waddington (the publisher) if you feel your opposition bid in such a way, you did not have a fair chance of reaching your correct contract.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
