			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nothing Is As It Seems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The real history of our corner of the universe is much more vast that anyone can understand. People believe that first there were amoeba, then there were dinosaurs, and then the glorious human race &amp;ndash; more intelligent than any creature that has ever lived. They also think that they&amp;rsquo;ve reached the pinnacle of evolution and that technology will usher in ever-new ages. It is a comforting story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach of the Chthonian Star brings many mysteries to life. Lost things are found in dark places and horrifying creatures awaken. Are you prepared to peer behind the curtain to discover the truth? What will you do when what you find isn&amp;rsquo;t what you&amp;rsquo;d hoped? After all, ignorance can only be bliss for so long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Void is an original Lovecraftian hard sci-fi horror setting, and this sourcebook reveals the secrets of the solar system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secrets of the Void:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Explores the secret history of our solar system.&lt;br/&gt;    Reveals the mysteries of the Chthonian Star.&lt;br/&gt;    Discusses the Old Ones, god-like beings who sleep and wait&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;    Explores important alien races, such as the Elder Race, the Mi-Go, and the Great Race.&lt;br/&gt;    Introduces five different cults, including the Children of the Void and Primoris Nox.&lt;br/&gt;    Explores secret places, such as Kadath and R&amp;rsquo;lyeh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
