							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stranded No More</name>
									
			<description>A solitaire game where you play as Captain Oscar Locke, a stranded pirate, whose luck just turned around. Another crew of pirates has landed on the island where you were stranded by your mutinous ex-crew. This new crew of pirates are here to bury their treasure; leaving their boat unmanned just off the coast. You could try to man the ship yourself but with no gold to spend, what's the point? Capture the treasure before it's buried and make it to the ship to sail the high seas with your newly claimed booty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game of exploration, players will use various resources coupled with dice rolling to battle the pirates and animals they will encounter as they move throughout the island. If players can manage their inventory and time, they might be able to get off the island alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
