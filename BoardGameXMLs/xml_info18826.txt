			<description>A miniature table top pool game for kids.  The game has ten numbered pucks in place of pool balls, two spring loaded cue sticks, and a triangular frame like in real pool to help set up the ten numbered pucks in a triangle.

This is to play &amp;quot;skid-tac-toe,&amp;quot; and a few of the other games.  There are a total of 8 Games in the rule book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
