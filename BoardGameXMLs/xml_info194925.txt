			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have a variety of atypical Attributes, all with numeric values distributed from several points pools.  Characters have three sources of Wisdom - Skybound, Earthbound, and Waterbound; these range from 1-10.  Characters also have Cardinals, or pairs of opposed Attributes.  The first pair is Ice and Fire; the second pair is Dawn and Twilight.  Characters have six points distributed between the two opposites.  Action resolution utilizes a dice pool based on a Wisdom source with the result compared to a Cardinal score.  The roll is modified depending upon circumstances.  Dice rolls result in narrative events supporting the success or failure of the attempted action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published as a series of posts in the online forum hosting the competition in which it was entered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
