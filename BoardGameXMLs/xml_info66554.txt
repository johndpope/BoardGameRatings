							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Shell Game</name>
									
			<description>The Shell Game is played with 4 or 5 cowrie shells, as is traditional in Indian games. The game comes with several sets of rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Version 1 - players throw 4 shells and score various points according to whether they fall dark side or light side up. For example, if all shells fall light side up, ten points are awarded to each player who grabs a shell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Version 2 (Ramudu - Sita) - players throw 4 shells with each possible combination representing a character from the Ramayana. Players need to collect one of each result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Version 3 - players place one shell (the striker) on the table and throw the other 4 onto it. Play then progresses through a complex series of challenges involving striking the other shells with the striker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
