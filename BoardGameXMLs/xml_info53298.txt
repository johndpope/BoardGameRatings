			<description>From the front of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Goldfinger Adventure Module is designed to be played with one to four players plus the Gamesmaster. The rank of the character(s) sent on the mission depends on the number of players. If one person is playing, the character should be of &amp;quot;00&amp;quot; rank. If two are playing, they should either both be of Agent rank or be one Agent and one Rookie. If three or four people are playing, the characters should all be of Rookie rank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It should be stressed to overeager players be-forehand that,. while there are some similarities, this adventure does not parallel the movie. Any time the players begin to voice the opinion that this is the movie, you should warn them again that such an as-sumption could lead to disaster not only for their character but for the world at large. This is, after all, a Bond adventure, which means there is more than just gold smuggling at stake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
