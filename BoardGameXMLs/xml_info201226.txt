			<description>In the Cubic World, cube men get their excitement from racing their Cubecars around the track. But it is a dirty and deadly sport and sometimes not all the cars survive to finish the race and win the coveted trophy! Players take actions to change gears and move their cars to avoid dangerous bends and hazards in the hope of reaching the finish!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player selects one of 8 different cars to use in the race each with their own special powers on one of two different tracks. Then in turn order they select one of the 8 actions on the four action cards and flip the card over revealing two different actions. Players must ensure that their movement is not too fast for their current gear selection (spin off) or too slow (stall) and if they do so they will miss their next turn. Corners have gear limits and if a car attempts a corner in a higher gear the car will take damage. Too much damage to a car and they will be out of the race permanently! The first over the finish line is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
