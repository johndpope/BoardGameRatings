							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Polly Pocket Pollyville Card Game</name>
									
			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;Travel with Polly and her friends to explore 18 fun-filled locations in Pollyville.  Along the way you'll stop at their favorite places: the Pet Shop, Pizzeria, Zoo, Beach and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure starts by collecting three cards to complete a scene.  The first player who matches four scenes wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: Each player starts with seven cards.  On each turn, a player draws one card, then lays down any matches they have (of 3 cards).  If a match is laid down, the player draws three new cards.  The player can continue to lay down matches and take 3 new cards until they can make no more matches.  To complete the turn, the player discards one card.  Cards cannot be picked up from the discard pile, but that pile is reshuffled to become the draw pile if that pile is depleted.  First player to complete 4 matches wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
