			<description>Each player begins with seven face-down cards, four of which he is allowed to peek at. A card will display one of the following prime numbers: 2,3,5,7,11,13,or 17. A round lasts seven turns. On each turn, a player either exposes one of his cards or exchanges it for a card that is in the draw deck or discard deck. The object is to collect the most primes without duplicating any. Scoring is based on the face values of the un-duplicated cards. Play a few rounds until a designated point total is reached.
