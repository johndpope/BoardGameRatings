							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bimini Run</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Kenji Ohara! The diabolical Dr. Orca has struck again. He has kidnapped your sister Kim and sped off to his island hideaway. You've got to find her! If you don't, she's doomed -- and if Orca's B.A.M. technology succeeds, so is the entire human race!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speed after her in your powerful off-shore power boat and race head-to-head with evil Dr/ Orca's armada of off-shore racers. Dodge powerful waves of hard-to-hit helicopters and battle land-based warheads. Slugging it out with Orca's army is no picnic, but the real test of nerve is the Bimini Zone, the ghoulish warp in time where nothing is quite as it seems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's an endless challenge. Like the Bimini Zone, the game is never the same twice. You'll need all your courage and cunning to succeed -- or the whole world is doomed to extinction!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User written&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A maritime third-person shooter, the player controls the driver and gunner on a powerful speedboat, racing through an archipelago map to accomplish different missions, which are transmitted to the boat via radio. The details of the map and the locations of objectives are randomized in each play. In two-player mode, player 1 handles the driving of the boat while player 2 is a dedicated gunner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
