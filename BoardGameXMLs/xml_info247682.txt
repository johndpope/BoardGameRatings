			<description>Age of Musketeers is a game in which you will be able to build your own city in the age of musketeers by freeing the Faraway Lands from various kinds of monsters. Together with d'Artagnan, Milady and other heroes from Dumas' novels, you will build sawmills and wineries, streets and fountains, flower beds and statues. It's up to you whether to solve conflicts peacefully or by fighting epic battles, spend most of your resources on developing sciences or on the construction of new blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Help your neighbors, create alliances, trade - there are plenty of opportunities for cooperation with other players in the game. The colorful graphics will help you feel the charm of an old town with a little bit of magic about it, and become a wise sovereign, good neighbor and fearless warrior. D'Artagnan or Rochefort? Athos or Milady? Mordaunt or Vicomte of Bragelonne? Porthos or Aramis? You can choose each of them. They are all waiting for you in the Age of Musketeers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
