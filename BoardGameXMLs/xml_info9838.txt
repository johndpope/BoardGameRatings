							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Campaign!: The American Go Game</name>
									
			<description>Subtitled &amp;quot;The American Go Game.&amp;quot;  Campaign! was published in 1961 to reflect on the War Between the States.  The game board is made up of squares 18 long and 15 wide, with various &amp;quot;battlefields&amp;quot; interspersed among the blocks.  Each player starts with 72 wooden discs.  Each turn, a player rolls the dice and adds discs to his or her lines, attempting to surround the battlefields in order to get the points assigned to each battlefield. The battlefields are worth different points to each player, depending on the size of the battlefield and the distance from the player's home base.  The back of the board includes brief descriptions of the major battles of the Civil War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
