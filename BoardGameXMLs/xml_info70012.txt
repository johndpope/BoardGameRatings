			<description>Art Express is a mix between a drawing game and a reflex game where everyone plays together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game unfolds as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives a card on which are recorded seven common names, a name compounded, and a verb phrase. For the first round, participants will have to draw in less than 30 seconds the first word of their card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The start is given through the hourglass, and when a player has finished his drawing, he returns his paper and rushes to catch one of the chips placed in the center of the table by focusing on the strongest. Once the time fully elapsed, latecomers should stop drawing and rushing on the chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All drawings will now be unveiled simultaneously and each participant can take one he thinks he can guess. Each player wins the number of points indicated on the token, if and only if an opponent manages to guess the drawing. To avoid distortion, the person who guesses also pockets of points, so no cheating!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following rounds are conducted in the same manner as the first and the game ends when each participant drew all the words of his card. At the end, the player with the most points is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
