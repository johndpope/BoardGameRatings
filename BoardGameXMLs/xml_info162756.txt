							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Triviata the Opera Trivia Game</name>
									
			<description>From the instructions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECT OF THE GAME: To answer opera questions in six categories, then move your token to Valhalla for a chance to win the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My recap: One player rolls the die, moves his pawn and answers the appropriate opera question from a card read by his opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions are in the following six categories:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lives of Opera Composers&lt;br/&gt;Female Singers&lt;br/&gt;Male Singers (and a Few Conductors)&lt;br/&gt;Music, Characters &amp;amp; Plots--Questions about the Opera&lt;br/&gt;Opera Companies&lt;br/&gt;The Media--Recordings, Quotes, Films, Plot Sources&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the question is answered correctly, the player rolls and moves again to another question. If answered incorrectly, play moves to the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, answer a question correctly in each of six categories, move to Valhalla by exact roll of the die, answer one last question in the category picked by the the opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sounds like Trivial Pursuit for the Opera buff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains 6 pawns, one die, score pad, trivia cards, roll-up board and the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
