			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;A math game for children about doing math fast and doing it right. Use your mad math skills to crawl your way up the ladder to the victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game:&lt;br/&gt;Player tries to get three bargaining chip with the sum of 5 (10, 10, 10, 12, 12)&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;Each player has three of the same color button to play and 5 white sums for the demarcation. Instigator of the first game to move his checkers dice shown by die arrow in the degree of opening ahead and leave this piece into the box. In the next round he will throw a new piece, etc. When the players all three pieces are the board, he can move in turn any one of his pieces shown on dice slightly forward.&lt;br/&gt;Now in turn, the player must calculate carefully using fingers or what ever indicated by the figures in the sum and to see if it would be 10 or 12.&lt;br/&gt;- Eg, 3 + 2 + 5 = 10 or&lt;br/&gt;4 + 6 + 2 = 12&lt;br/&gt;When getting the right sum, the player will set the piece on the game board accordingly in the tagging column.&lt;br/&gt;When a player has gone to the same space as friendly piece at the end, he starts from the start. So play continues until one player has received the sum of all five.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
