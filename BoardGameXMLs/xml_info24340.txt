			<description>A really quirky Red, White &amp;amp; Blue capture &amp;amp; replacement game (no points are scored) where the winner is the first player to have all his men in play on the board, however this is achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game the player&amp;rsquo;s men are called Purim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once laid the Purim are neither &amp;lsquo;jumped&amp;rsquo; or moved - but may be &amp;lsquo;returned to that player&amp;rsquo;s pot&amp;rsquo;. The key to this game is &amp;lsquo;Red, White, Blue. Red, White, Blue,,,etc&amp;rsquo;. Remember that &amp;amp; you cant go wrong. Recommended Ages 7+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
