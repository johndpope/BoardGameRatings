			<description>Choose-your-own-adventure in a hilariously inappropriate social card game.  One Drunk Night...is a social card game where players compete to help the Storyteller craft his/her adventure.  &lt;br/&gt;    In this game, the Storyteller plays his/her own &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot; (but absentminded) twin who you can always count on for lively, unfettered, often highly immoral tales.  The Storyteller begins by choosing one of two &amp;quot;Beginning...&amp;quot; cards to start the adventure.  The other players choose one &amp;quot;...Middle...&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;...End&amp;quot; cards from their hands to continue the story and play them face down.  The submitted cards are shuffled and read aloud by the Storyteller.  The Storyteller then chooses the card he/she wants to use to continue the story, (i.e. choose-your-own-adventure).&lt;br/&gt;    The player who submitted the chosen card receives one point if a &amp;quot;...Middle...&amp;quot; card was selected and two points for an &amp;quot;...End&amp;quot; card.  Play continues with the same Storyteller until an &amp;quot;...End&amp;quot; card is selected, adding to the last selected card each time to grow the adventure.  After an &amp;quot;...End&amp;quot; card is chosen the adventure is read aloud and play rotates to the left.  Players decide the end conditions (e.g. x amount of points, time limit, y amount of rounds, etc.) and the player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
