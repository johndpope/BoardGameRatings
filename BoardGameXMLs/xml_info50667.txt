			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WELCOME TO THE SECRETS OF MOROCCO! This book provides players with a civil, geographical, cultural, political, and Mythos tour of Morocco during the 1920s and 1930s. Morocco will seem like another world, with its cultural differences and its customs being foreign to many Westerners of the 1920s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The country is vast, and not every city can be covered in depth. This supplement details the political capital, Rabat, the economic capital, Casablanca, as well as Marrakech, one of Morocco&amp;rsquo;s grandest cities. It provides broad outlines and maps for several other cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morocco is a country of many languages and cultures. Some of the earliest settlements date back to the 12th century B.C. The earliest of these, a port city named Lixus, appears to have been settled by both Berbers and Phoenicians. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Spanish and French control the whole of the nation, while the majority of its native inhabitants find their overlords alien. Investigators of the 1920s are quite likely to experience culture shock, unless they have traveled in such areas previously. The keeper should take advantage of this whenever possible. Exposing investigators to the sights, smells, sounds, and practices of human cities can be as adventurous as the exploration of unknown cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
