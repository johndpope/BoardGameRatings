							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sugar Rush</name>
									
			<description>Created in response to an almost-four-year-old's request for a board game based on her favourite movie, Sugar Rush is a relatively simple racing game designed for children, based thematically on the fictional video game Sugar Rush, from the Disney movie Wreck-it Ralph. Players assume the role of a racer, setup at the starting line, and then take turns rolling dice for their movement around the race track. Each racer has a unique ability that they can charge-up during the race and then use to their advantage. Racers can also gain Power Ups, which are drawn from a randomized deck of Power Up cards. First across the finish line gets 8 Gold Coins, second place gets 5 Gold coins, and third place gets 2 Gold coins. The racer with the most coins at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
