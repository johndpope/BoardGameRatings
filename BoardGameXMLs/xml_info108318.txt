							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Barbie: Vacation Adventure</name>
									
			<description>The game is played using a side-scroller platformer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Wyoming, Barbie spends her time going on a camping trip. In her California home, she spends her days lounging in her apartment building. In Iowa, she goes to the local county carnival to help find an escaped pig. In Florida, she goes to the beach and plays volleyball and scuba diving. In Texas, Barbie plays with horseshoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a part of the Sega Club collection; it is designed for younger female gamers in mind. On most of her trips, she travels with her best friend Midge, who the second player controls in two-player games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Barbie: Vacation Adventure&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
