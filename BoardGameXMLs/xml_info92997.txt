							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fiddlers End</name>
									
			<description>Fiddlers End is a roll and move game.  Players win by either making their way around the board to the bus on square 90, or collecting three Home cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players collect a card whenever they land on a Fiddlers End square.  These can be taken from the pack or from an opponent.  Cards are kept face down and only three may be held at any time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, there are also Police cards.  If anyone obtains three of these they are automatically out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box: &amp;quot;Fiddlers End - a Game for All the Family - Fun on the Run&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
