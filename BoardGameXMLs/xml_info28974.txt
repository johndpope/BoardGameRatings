			<description>&amp;quot;Put down your Xbox and flush away your Wii because Chav Master has arrived, and times are changing in the world of gaming!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a new kind of party game where winning can only be achieved by losing, and losing at everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players go head-to-head in a battle of bad behavior, collecting as many A.S.B.O&amp;rsquo;s (Anti Social Behavior Orders) as they can, in order to prove that they and they alone are worthy of the ultimate Chav Master title, and the Holy Grail of Chavdom - the Golden A.S.B.O!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep hold of your A.S.B.O&amp;rsquo;s and your closer to the goal. Lose them and you must hand back your electronic tag, because your out of the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six rounds of classic parlour games get a 21st Century kick up the arse, and 3-12 players take a stroll through the deepest, darkest corners of Chavdom. Only one emerges victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It takes a real loser to win..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chav Master is a compendium of party games and the contents include:&lt;br/&gt;6 x 'Court Summons' style invitation&lt;br/&gt;6 x 'Electronic Tag' style straps&lt;br/&gt;6 x Classic party games with a 21st Century twist (includes several components including playing cards)&lt;br/&gt;1 x Pack of A.S.B.O's&lt;br/&gt;1 x Golden A.S.B.O.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
