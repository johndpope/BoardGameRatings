			<description>This is a made-in-China variant of ludo in which players get 3 pieces and have to get them from their base to the central spot. &lt;br/&gt;The number of spaces to move is much less than in ludo and there are spaces that might move the player's pieces forwards or backwards. Fairly nasty is the space on the home stretch that forces the piece to move backwards into the path of other pieces. &lt;br/&gt;The game has a military theme and pieces are toy soldiers in different colours. I would guess that while each colour has 3 soldiers, the poses you get might vary from box to box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
