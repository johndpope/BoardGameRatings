			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six people balance the end of the world on a knife's edge.  A runestone from the Reichsmuseum Germania has lead them to the Third Reich's latest secret military project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World War II is not over, and here in 1951, the world is decaying. Europe is ravaged by the Fimbul winter, and the Germanic war machine is unstoppable. The United States is fighting for survival while Nazi countries are preparing for an invasion of North America, and the Soviet Union exists only in remote Siberia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Balkans, brave men and women fight against the triumphant troops of the Third Reich. They are the last hope of the world. A civil war has broken out and for a while it seemed that the master might lose. Now the SS Troops Jernn&amp;aelig;vne has struck down most of the resistance, and Feltmaskal Rommel now leads the fight against the rebels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SS-Obergruppenf&amp;uuml;hrer Reinhart Heydrich wants to bring a new weapon to the front line from the Norwegian urfjeld. His handmen from the occult Ahnenerbe, with their work, will speed up the final battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six men who believe in good are the only ones who can stop Operation J&amp;ouml;tunheimr. They are connected by hatred of Hitler's destruction. Soon they will be balancing the fate of the world on the edge of a knife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is distributed as five PDF files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     24-page scenario&lt;br/&gt;     2-page &amp;quot;welcome&amp;quot; handout (print-and-play)&lt;br/&gt;     13-page character summaries (print-and-play)&lt;br/&gt;     1-page character orientation (print-and-play)&lt;br/&gt;     20-page handouts (print-and-play)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
