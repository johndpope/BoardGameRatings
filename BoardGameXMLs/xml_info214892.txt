			<description>Numerous dangers await you as you set out on the journey to the final tower.  The sharp teeth of the shark are wating for you to fall into the water.  Challenge your friends - see who can outwit the shark and reach the finish first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:  The players move forward from tower to tower, across numerous gangplanks, by throwing the dice.  Beware!  At any moment the shark can move into action; the gangplanks will fall through and the players will be in the water.  The player who gets to the final tower with the most counters is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
