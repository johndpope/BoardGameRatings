			<description>The greatest new game of wit, psychology, and bluffing since the invention of poker. Four unique playing boards. Players compete for points, while each player knows what card his opponents holds! Full of surprises, strategy, coincidences and laughs as players try to out-wit each other. Anyone can win points... but it's how you play your cards that counts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to outwit opponents to win highest &amp;quot;point cards&amp;quot;, thereby accumulating the highest score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Standoff is unlike most games in that players do not take turns. To begin, any player turns over the top card from the stack of &amp;quot;point cards.&amp;quot; Each player then competes for that card by selecting one of the cards in his hand, placing it face down in front of him. After each player has done this, they turn over all the cards played. The player with the highest number is awarded as many points as is indicated on the face of that point card. Point card is then placed in a discard pile and the next point card is revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues with each game ending after all 11 cards held by players have been played. Two of the 13 point cards will not be revealed in each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
