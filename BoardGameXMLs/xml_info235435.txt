			<description>Lorna Ritten has just learned of Alfred Cypress, the grandfather she has never known. Lorna has always wanted to find out more about her biological family, which has always been a mystery. Her grandfather&amp;rsquo;s attorney Phillip Brandt tells Lorna of an inheritance, which includes one of her grandfather&amp;rsquo;s many mansions and its contents. Her desire to know more marks the beginning of a very unique and potentially dangerous situation. Lorna has no idea just how important this actually is to her and will be to others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Lorna is studying some of the inheritance documents before visiting the mansion, she realizes there are items that hold key information hidden throughout the mansion. These include maps and a main key concerning Alfred&amp;rsquo;s work, as well as more about Lorna&amp;rsquo;s biological family. And even though she realizes she is being watched and is possibly even in danger, she still wants to move forward. With this in mind as you begin the game, imagine Lorna has called on you as her friend to help secure these items from the Cypress Mansion and then get out as quickly as possible. You will encounter others who are also trying to acquire this information, so you need to be careful and trust no one. The mansion itself also has many surprises to make your mission even more exciting&amp;mdash;and dangerous. You will need to use the resources available and pay attention to everything. Regardless of what you face, you must continue to acquire what is needed to help Lorna in her quest to learn the truth, gain the main key, and then get out safely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of Cypress Legacy: The Board Game is to collect the revealed Inheritances, find and retrieve the Security Access Key, and then escape the mansion by reaching the FINISH space on the game board. Use any cards available in your inventory to help you through the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use Weapons, Skills, Assets, and Classified Prototypes to become the first player to escape the Cypress Mansion with all required Inheritance items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
