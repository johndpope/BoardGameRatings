							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wacky Wizard Game</name>
									
			<description>Wacky Wizard is a game in which players assume the roles of unfortunate victims of a looney wizard.  Changed into one of six types of animals (bats, spiders, snakes, etc), the players must gather the ingredients necessary to break the spell over them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking turns to play, players move their pieces on the board based on the flicking of a spinner.  Ingredient discs are placed at the edges of the board and a player's piece must land exactly on the spaces to collect the items.  To break the spell over them, the creatures need to collect two different ingredients with their own symbols (e.g. a Turtle would require an Eye of Newt and a Fingernail of Newt).  If the spinner lands on the Wacky Wizard symbol, the player draws a Wizard Spell Card, which will turn his or her playing piece into another creature (and thereby changing his or her winning conditions).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to break the enchantment over his or her piece wins and ends the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
