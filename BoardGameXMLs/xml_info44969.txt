			<description>From the back of the adventure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Guess Who They're Callin'?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ghost is missing! After being seriously injured in the battle with the rebellious manitou Knicknevin, the secretive leader of the Agency's Western Bureau has apparently been kidnapped from the Great Maze boomtown of Gomorra, California. Whoever's responsible has it in for the Agency, and while nobody's naming names, more than a few fingers are pointing toward Nicodemus Whateley, new leader of the twisted and degenerate Whateley family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action starts in Gomorra, but solving the mystery of the Ghost's disappearance takes the heroes on a trek halfway across the Weird West, facing more than one enemy who would love it if the Ghost stayed lost. More than the life of the Agency's strongest leader is at stake. Events could expose one of the deepest secrets the Union government - with shattering effects on the nation!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghost Busters is a 64 page adventure for the Origins Award-winning Deadlands: The Weird West roleplaying game. This tale o' terror also provides you and your posse a chance to take a hand in shaping the official course of events in the Deadlands Universe - and earn a spot in the enduring legends of the Weird West. All the details on this are at the end of the adventure, Marshal. So lets saddle up and see if your posse has what it takes to be the real, the only Ghost Busters!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
