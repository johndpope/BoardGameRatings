							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The International Pro-Am Sailboard Game</name>
									
			<description>Designed and published by the sailboarding community in 1988, Pro-Am pits players (sailboarders) against each other as they race around the board collecting sponsorships, forging a career, and testing their knowledge on sailboarding. The game can be played on three different levels, from the experienced sail boarder down to the first timers and non-sailboarders who play on the 'Learner' level. Nicely outfitted with plenty of sponsorship options, career directions, and 'sailboards' pieces, the game delves deep into the world of sailboard racing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
