			<description>This is a very old track game for children in Christian households. According to the rulebook: &amp;quot;... its moral tone will commend itself to all those who desire to place in the hands of their children a game teaching the good results sure to follow an upright life&amp;quot;. A spinner is used for movement. You must follow the directions of any space you land on that has any, which will either send you forward or backward an additional number of spaces. The first player to reach the &amp;quot;Honest, Honored and Upright Citizen&amp;quot; space wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
