			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the Flame is a Storytelling Adventure System for Promethean: The Created. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially a kit to running this story for your troupe, which means only you, as the Storyteller, should read it. Like a kit, To the Flame contains all the parts to build a story. The tools you use to build it are the World of Darkness Rulebook and Promethean: The Created, as well as the usual paper, pencils and dice. When you get your troupe together, you&amp;rsquo;ll use these parts and tools to build a story, but how you put everything together is up to you. It depends on what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to do, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a stand-alone scenario designed for an evening or two of entertainment or a story in an ongoing Promethean chronicle. The only right way is whatever is fun for you and your troupe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treatment&lt;br/&gt;To the Flame is a story about a town&amp;rsquo;s attempt to overcome tragedy once its past comes back to haunt it. Newton, a small rural community, lost a sizable portion of its population in a great inferno. During the same period a mysterious monster, known locally as Moth, terrorized the village and is believed to be the source of the fire. The conflagration flared up one night after part of the local coal-burning power plant collapsed, sending sparks shooting into the nearby woods and spreading the fire into town. By the following morning, most of the town had been incinerated, and the death toll reached nearly a hundred. Now, sixty years after the first fire, Moth is back and Newton&amp;rsquo;s citizens are terrified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
