			<description>Shifty Homepage at the Designer's Site&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shifty is a square board connection game, where the goal is to create a chain of orthogonally and/or diagonally connected stones between two opposite edges of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique feature of Shifty is that on your turn you must either place a stone orthogonally adjacent to at least one friendly stone or you must move any friendly stone, by a chess queen's move, to any empty intersection orthogonally adjacent to fewer friendly stones than the intersection it started on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result you must often forego adding a stone to the board, and instead &amp;quot;shoot&amp;quot; a stone already on the board to a strategically key spot. This sharpshooting dynamic is the source of the game's strategic interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
