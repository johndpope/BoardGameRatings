			<description>ALLEGRO is a music game requiring no previous musical experience, but may be of value in learning the rudiments of musical notation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameboard - with an outer track depicting 28 composers and a central wheel containing a list of actions (forfeits / bonuses etc).&lt;br/&gt;28 Composer cards - each depicting a composer and matching one on the board. Each is colored coded to represent the lengths of different musical notes and has a number from 1 to 6. Each card also has a short biography of the composer, but this is not relevant to the game.&lt;br/&gt;6 playing pieces - each representing a different musical instrument (harp, violin, trumpet drum, piano and saxophone)&lt;br/&gt;1 colored die - each face has a different color and musical note&lt;br/&gt;1 numerical die - D6&lt;br/&gt;Paper money - in 6 colors - each with a musical symbol and name (as for the composers and colored die).&lt;br/&gt;Money converter card - this gives the relative value of the each color of paper money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players throw the two dice which determine a position (composer) on the board to which the players playing piece is moved (i.e. 5 Green is Dvorak). Money is also earned according to the same dice roll - 5 Green means that 5 pieces of green money are received.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Composer is owned by another player then a forfeit must be paid. If not the Composer may be bought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During his turn a player may also purchase up to 10 pieces of music from each Composer that they own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A supplementary action (forfeit, movement or bonus) is also determined from the inner wheel based on the same dice roll (5 Green for example is &amp;quot;Pass to Bach&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play proceeds in such a way - move, receive money, purchase a composer/pay a forfeit, purchase works, central wheel action - until one player has purchased 6 Composers - one in each color and amassed 10 pieces of music from each of the composers owned.&lt;br/&gt;An advanced version of the game introduces a quiz book round in which players are also asked to attempt a definition of a musical phrase or term. A correct answer results in earning more money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
