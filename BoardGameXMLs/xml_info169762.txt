			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capsule is a single-player survival game, which is best played in dark room with headphones. Players will navigate a hostile landscape, learning about their surroundings, and that way live through a typical sci-fi story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You wake up inside a small capsule, trapped, with no view of the outside world. You will use the radar screen and the capsule's simple controls to try and find out more about your surroundings and what has happened. And more oxygen and fuel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was developed by Adam Saltsman and Robin Arnott.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note that the game is not recommended for anyone with misophonia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
