							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orsagrigg&#039;s Tower</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built on a rocky bluff overlookng the road south, Orsagrigg's Tower has served many roles in its long history. Watchtower, keep, prison - and now it stands as a lonely outpost of a distant empire, guarding the borders against enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orsagrigg's Tower is a printable dungeon floorplan compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl game. It can be used as a standalone gameboard, or combined with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orsagrigg's Tower is a multiple level set, comprising 5 battlemaps (each depicting a different floor)&lt;br/&gt;Ground Floor - Standing on a rocky bluff, the ground floor of the tower sits beside a road, and is surrounded by scrubby plants. The ground floor features entrance halls, mess rooms and the Captain's office.&lt;br/&gt;Cellar - Below the ground floor are the cellars - neatly divided into storage areas for food, and storage areas for prisoners. And for prisoners that know something, there is an interrogation cell.&lt;br/&gt;First Floor - Spiral stairs lead to this level, where the garrison will find a small armoury and sleeping quarters for the men and officer. &lt;br/&gt;Second Floor- This floor is surrounded by a long gallery where soldiers patrol, looking through the loopholes for signs of attack. A guardroom allows those not on duty to rest.&lt;br/&gt;Roof - The large open area of the roof is exposed to the elements, and makes an ideal vantage point for viewing the surrounding area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
