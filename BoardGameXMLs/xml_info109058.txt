			<description>The Great War (1914)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the summer of 1914. The Archduke Franz Ferdinand (heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) and his wife have just been assassinated in Sarajevo. In retaliation for this offense, Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary has declared war on Serbia, an ally of Russia. This sparks a world of controversy and very quickly large military powers such as Germany, The Ottoman Empire, France, and Great Britain join in the fray. Two allegiances emerge, The Central Powers &amp;amp; The Allied Powers, with one goal in mind: WAR!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have the economic aptitude and tactical know how to help your nation survive The Conflict and rescue a world in peril. Are you brave enough to face tanks, planes and other modern warfare in order to lead your alliance to victory? &amp;ldquo;The Great War&amp;rdquo; has begun, and ready or not, you better lace up your boots and prepare for battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Conflict is a global-strategy based game designed around the economic and military conditions of Europe in 1914.

After selecting a nation, players take turns completing their objectives during each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: The Conflict requires players to strategize both economically and militaristically in order to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Military units will vary per nation, based on the technological restraints of the nation and its overall capability for growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planned release date is 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
