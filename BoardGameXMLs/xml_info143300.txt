							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lane Backgammon</name>
									
			<description>This is a game in the Backgammon family, playable on a Byzantine Chessboard.  The game is similar to regular backgammon, except pieces start out in home area, and are divided up into a number of lanes, rather than all fitting into one lane, as is seen in regular Backgammon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player attempt to get all their pieces go around the board and have them land on enemy home spaces to bear off.  Players may only do this if they have all their home spaces empty.  When hit, pieces go back to their home spaces, rather than off the board on a bar.  Players start with 4 pieces per lane (row), and have a total of 16 pieces to start per side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
