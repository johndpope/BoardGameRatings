			<description>From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Snooker Champion is an attempt to capture the essence of professional snooker in a replay simulation, where the strengths and weaknesses of the players become subtly apparent from continual playing of the game.&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed in two parts, the basic game (taking about 10-12 minutes to complete a single frame) with a wealth of in-built data reflecting the players&amp;rsquo; differing styles of play, and the short game (about 2-3 minutes per frame) to enable &amp;lsquo;best of 31-frame&amp;rsquo; matches to be replayed in a reasonable short time.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play a snooker match, you have to select two player cards and agree on the version you want to play: basic or short.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on your choice, you simulate the snooker game by &amp;quot;potting&amp;quot; balls, or in this case: simulate potting attempts by rolling the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the short game, a match is decided by a couple of die rolls on various tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the basic game, much more dice will be rolled before a winner is crowned. You may choose the the level of risk you want to take, roll two dice and look up the appropriate table, which tells you the outcome of your attempt. Table results will also enable you to try snooker attempts and escaping from snookers. A special display card will tell you how many red balls are left in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For both versions, knowledge of the real snooker rules are helpful to understand the game and the various tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
