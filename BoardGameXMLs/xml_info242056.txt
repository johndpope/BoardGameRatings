			<description>A fast-paced squad combat game. No hard to learn rules or references to look up. The only thing to learn is how to best use your different units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two players choose a leader each (who have passive abilities to boost their team), then a 2nd unit, then are given a 3rd each at random.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn, the player progresses each of their unit's turn meter (by moving the respective cube along the ready track) until they have a unit ready to attack. Each Hero has special abilities and attacks, creating an interesting strategy to every team. Each ability has a value (either damage, heal or alter turn meter) that the player activates and chooses to target. There are no dice or cards, just the strategy of who to attack, or do I use my ability now or save for a combo with another character?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players win by defeating all three of their opponents units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternatively, more than 2 players can fight in a free for all, where each player is out for themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fancy testing out a squad or playing by yourself? There is a Boss character you can play against that will require all your wits to take down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Print and Play is available ahead of an upcoming crowdfunding campaign&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
