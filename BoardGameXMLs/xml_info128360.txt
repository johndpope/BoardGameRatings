							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">4 Feats for the Invisibility Spell</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes rules supplements read like the world-setting bible of frustrated novelists. While solid world- building is a useful skill, you don't always need four paragraphs of flavor text to tell you swords are cool, magic is power, shadows are scary, and orcs are savage. Sometimes a GM doesn't have time to slog through a page of history for every magic weapon. Sometimes all that's needed are a few cool ideas, with just enough information to use them in a game. Sometimes, all you need are bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bullet Points are a line of very short, cheap PDFs each of which gives the bare bones of a set of related options. It may be five spells, six feats, eight magic weapon special abilities, or any other short set of related rules we can cram into about a page. Short and simple, these PDFs are for GMs and players who know how to integrate new ideas into their campaigns without any hand-holding, and just need fresh ideas and the rules to support them. No in-character fiction setting the game world. No charts and tables. No sidebars of explanations and optional rules. Just one sentence of explanation for the High Concept of the PDF, then bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The High Concept: Feats that expand the function, utility, and tactical options available to casters who take the iconic invisibility spell (as well as greater invisibility and vanish, and in some cases invisibility sphere). This is the latest in a series of products to celebrate the &amp;quot;Summer of Bullets&amp;quot; event!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The feats included are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Focused Invisibility: You can focus your invisibility spells through objects.&lt;br/&gt;    Lingering Invisibility: You can make your invisibility spell hang on for just a few seconds longer.&lt;br/&gt;    Invisible Aura: Your invisibility spells even make magic auras invisible&amp;hellip; at least sometimes.&lt;br/&gt;    Unsensed Item: You can cast invisibility spells on objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
