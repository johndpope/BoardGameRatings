			<description>This Maori Stick Game is called 'Ti Rakau' in Maori.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is played with two people or, at a more advanced level, four people. Each player needs one pair of wooden sticks. Players kneel on the floor across from each other and hold their sticks straight up, ends touching the floor. In unison, they perform a series of movements with their sticks, tapping their sticks together or against their partner's, progressing to throwing a stick to their partner and catching the one being thrown to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to keep going for as long as possible without dropping your sticks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last person who hasn't dropped a stick is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
