							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Future Warfare: Cloning and Genetic Manipulation</name>
									
			<description>User Summary: Supplement for d20 Modern and Future dealing with the use of cloning in campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book deals with cloning, genetics and the microscopic world. Clones and genetic modifications are purchased much like equipment. They have a purchase DC, progress level availability and may have purchase restrictions. Unlike equipment, a lab is required, the process takes a certain amount of time and there is a chance of aberrations in the subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you purchase a clone, you purchase a basic clone and possibly one or more upgrades. When you purchase a genetic modification it is applied to a fertilized embryo (which may be a clone) or, if you have access to genetic re-sequencing, it may be applied to an already grown subject (such as an infant, child or adult, who may be a clone).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
