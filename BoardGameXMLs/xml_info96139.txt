							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Pennywell Hangmen</name>
									
			<description>Website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;New York - the city that never sleeps, is the setting for this 1920s Call of Cthulhu scenario. Bare witness to the dark mysteries and horrifying secrets as the sinister denizens of the Big Apple bite back! Suitable for 3+ players over 4 to 5 sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Website Teaser Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Christmas has come to New York and in Uptown Manhattan snow falls on carolers, singing on a corner to a gathering crowd. Children exchange volleys of snowballs as in the distance parents call them in with dusk falling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shadows deepen, the sewers stream and from a Harlem tenement music spills on to the streets. Across town in Hells Kitchen the restaurants are bustling, and so too are the bars &amp;amp; clubs south in Greenwich Village - the season of goodwill is doing brisk business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Times Square a mighty pine sags underneath the weight of glittering decorations and sparkling lights. Beside it a flatfoot stands guard, eyeing the warmth of the nearby taverns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a bone chilling wind and across the Hudson River is Hoboken and further inland we find the sleepy village of Pennywell. After a quiet night at the &amp;lsquo;Crown &amp;amp; Cross&amp;rsquo; the resident publican Harold Baker watches with interest the movements across the fields before him. The last of his regulars are gone and he pauses a moment, curious at the soldiers darting about in the distance. Pennywell has been home to a Barracks since the Great War and tonight all is not quiet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bright evening stars illuminate a commotion as the distant figures can be seen running to and fro. The publican laughs as his wife joins him - &amp;ldquo;I think the Army boys might have had one too many eggnogs, they&amp;rsquo;re running about like headless chickens&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Surely they won&amp;rsquo;t be out training on a night like this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cracks of rifle shots blow in with the freezing wind, before a terrifying scream followed by a sudden silence. &amp;ldquo;Lord in heaven&amp;rdquo;. The door is quickly shut and bolted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The publicans wife shudders and peers through curtain into the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;You know what Harold, I don&amp;rsquo;t think they&amp;rsquo;re training!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is available as a free download from Yog-sothoth.com or the LoST Wiki.
