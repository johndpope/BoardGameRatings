							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Worst Type Of Person</name>
									
			<description>The Worst Type Of Person is an adult party game that lets players amuse each other with their humor and creativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this entertaining game, players use one of the descriptive cards in their hand to create the funniest person they can by matching it to a person on a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose from their hand a description on a card to make the funniest and most ridiculous, ludicrous, absurd, inappropriate, preposterous, and and &amp;ldquo;worst type of person&amp;rdquo; they can. Then all of the players discuss why their choice, or another players choice is the &amp;ldquo;worst&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players decide which other player they think made the &amp;ldquo;worst person&amp;rdquo;, and award them their played card. The player with the most awarded cards at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will have fun playing their cards and laughing at the cards other players play. But the most fun comes from the hilarious discussions players will have about their choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The description on your card may not seem to be the worst at first, but a clever or creative explanation can make your description the worst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Making funny matches with the cards is entertaining, but the group discussion of everyone&amp;rsquo;s choices is where the game really becomes fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games are fairly short if played for only 1 or 2 rounds. With short games, players can more easily leave or join the game. Short games also allow other players to join in easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Worst Type of Person is available in 2 volumes at The Game Crafter for $19.99 each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
