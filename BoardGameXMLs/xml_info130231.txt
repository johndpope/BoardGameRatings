							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flames of War: Blood, Guts, &amp; Glory â€“ Tank Battles in the Lorraine, September 1944-January 1945</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hello, and welcome to Patton's Third Army! The road to victory lies straight through the Lorraine, a stretch of land perfectly suited to mobile tank warfare. The American army and its allies have been steamrolling through France and the Low Countries. The end of the war seems so near with the Germans barely able to put up a fight. But the Allied advance has slowed as supplies and fuel become scarce. Furthermore, the Allied strategic and logistical focus has shifted to the north as Montgomery pushes for a bold attack to Arnhem. However, Patton won't play second fiddle to Monty's offensive and has stored up enough supplies to launch a small attack of his own along the Moselle River in the Lorraine. As an American company commander you are part of this offensive when you take your force from Blood, Guts, &amp;amp; Glory into combat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
