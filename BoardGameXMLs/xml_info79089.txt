			<description>From Back of Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How the West was Fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear... When men were men, women were women, and sheep were scared!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Al Lowe, author of Leisure Suit Larry, abuses the Old West in computerdom's first Comedy Western: Freddy Pharkas, Frontier Pharmacist.&lt;br/&gt;And you get to live that legend... the tall-but-twisted tale of a man raised as a gunslinger, who gave it all up for his first love: pharmacology!&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1888; the setting, post-Gold Rush California. As Freddy Pharkas, Frontier Pharmacist, you uncover a treacherous plot to turn your once-thriving metropolis into a ghost town. With pestles and pistols, you defend your bucolic burg from one catastrophe after another: arson, stampedes, hired guns, riverboat gamblers... even terminal flatulence!&lt;br/&gt;Al Lowe has stolen...er, immortalized... every HollywoodWestern cliche and character, adding his own perverse twists to produce his funniest game yet! You'll meet the pretty-but-shy Schoolmarm, the Madame with a Heart-of-Gold, the faithful Indian sidekick (Srini Lalkaka Bagdnish), and a cast of the most memorable characters ever to grace your monitor's silver screen.&lt;br/&gt;So come on, buck-a-roos! Strap on your spurs, saddle up your Palomino, and:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Point-and-click your way through sagebrush, livestock, cacti, buzzards, &amp;amp; swinging saloon doors... just like at the movin' pitcher show!&lt;br/&gt;-Drink your own mistakes from an authentic, working, late 19th-century laboratory!&lt;br/&gt;-Unlock your hidden potential with your very own copy of The Home Medical Advisor (1881 Edition)!&lt;br/&gt;-Learn (and quickly forget) the real words to The Ballad of Freddy Pharkas!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
