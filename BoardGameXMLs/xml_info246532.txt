							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rick and Morty: The Pickle Rick Game</name>
									
			<description>As you might expect, Rick and Morty: The Pickle Rick Game is based on the &amp;quot;Pickle Rick&amp;quot; episode of Adult Swim's Rick and Morty. One player plays as Pickle Rick as he tries to escape a heavily armed compound, while the other player takes on the roles of both the Russians and Jaguar as they try to stop him. The Pickle Rick player uses weapons cards to dole out damage and Air Vents to get out of jams as they try to get to the rooftop. The game includes both Pickle Rick and Jaguar miniatures that are moved across a dynamic board made up of tiles that are constantly being added, rotated, and flipped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adding to the off-the-wall fun is the game's packaging: It looks like a pickle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
