			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game for quick-thinking, problem-solving, profit-seeking creative types... and YOU!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When it&amp;rsquo;s your turn, you play the role of a rich and crazy investor. And even crazy investors know that the way to make money is to identify a problem and solve it. The good news is that you have been hearing a lot lately about a problem that needs solving. The bad news is that you have no idea how to solve it. That is why you have gathered a think tank of innovators together (yes, these are the other players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose one card from each pile to reveal the problem. Now that everyone knows what the problem is, it is up to the innovators to figure out why it exists and how to fix it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In two minutes or less, each Innovator must draw a prototype for a new, creative product to solve the problem &amp;ndash; without using words. When time is up, they will give you the prototypes to review.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose two that you would like to learn more about. The Innovators that drew them get a chance to &amp;ldquo;pitch&amp;rdquo; their product to you.  After hearing the pitches, choose one product to invest in. The Innovator who came up with the product wins the round. Hooray! Give them in investment chip so they can keep track of how many rounds they win &amp;ndash; because it matters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, it is the player to your left&amp;rsquo;s turn to the be the Investor and you are the Innovator. And so on. The person who wins has the most investment tokens when you&amp;rsquo;re tired of playing is the Innovator of the Year. Yes, they should totally put that on their resume!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
