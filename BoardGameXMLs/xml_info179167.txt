			<description>Hello and welcome to Lost Idols! In this fast-paced collecting card game, you are one of several hunters looking for the Lost Idols of Tiki Island. The first person to collect all six wins. Good luck and happy hunting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with the same six-card hand. One each of numbers 1-6. The remaining cards, including the Wild Card, are shuffled and placed face down as the draw deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each round, each player chooses a card to play. When a player has chosen, they will place that card face down in front of them to show the other players they are ready. Once all players have chosen a card to play, each player flips their card over to reveal what they have chosen. Highest card wins the round. When players reveal their hand, the winner keeps their card face up in front of them. The remaining cards go into the discard pile. At the end of each round, all players draw another card from the draw pile so everyone has six cards in their hands at the beginning of each round. When there are no more available cards in the draw pile, reshuffle the discard pile and use as the new draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sound easy? Not so fast!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are some special rules when playing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Number 1 card always beats a Number 6.&lt;br/&gt;    A number 3 card gives you the ability to choose to keep your number 3 card or trade for your opponents 1 or 2 card.&lt;br/&gt;    Wild card always wins the round and can be played as any number of players choosing.&lt;br/&gt;    If two or more players play the same number card, they cancel each other out. If there are only 2 players, neither player wins and the next round is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
