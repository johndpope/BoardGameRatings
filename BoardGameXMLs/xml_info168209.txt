							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monsters of the Hydra</name>
									
			<description>Adventurers seek to slay a nine headed hydra that has unleashed a myriad of monsters into the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game contains tiles, chits, cards and dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players win the game by either defeating the lead nine headed hydra and/or the head vampiress. The game is lost when all tiles are placed unless using the optional rule for infinite enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To defeat all of the monsters, the players can gather weapons from the item deck by buying them at a shop or by using spells from the spell deck. Some items can also be found when defeating enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
