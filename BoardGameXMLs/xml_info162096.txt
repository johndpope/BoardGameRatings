			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With your adventurers growing up it only makes sense that their surroundings should also grow. Such is the case of Andju Village which is being controlled by the newly created Viscount of Andju, Sir Dimek of Rastinstein. Sir Dimek has launched an ambitious building project with the intent to make his village a trading powerhouse. This area can be utilized as a base of operations near the frontier and be a safe haven for a party of explorers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for any level of adventurer.  This setting is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
