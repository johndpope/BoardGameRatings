			<description>A card game that is similar to the traditional playing card game of Racing Demon. One player is the Bookmaker and offers odds on each of the horses in any one race.&lt;br/&gt;For the race, cards are turned over and the horse named advances along the 'course'. And there are wild cards that affect the race; Jockey Falls, Little Brown Dog, Whip, and Spur.&lt;br/&gt;There is no skill at all apart from betting wisely or, if you are the Bookmaker, offering the right odds so that you can make a profit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
