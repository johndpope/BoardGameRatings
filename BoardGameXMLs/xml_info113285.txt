			<description>Princess on Ice sees you jump, spin and pirouette your way to fame as you follow the fortunes of Kelly, Gabrielle, Alyssa and Madison - four young ice dancers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plucked from obscurity by a mysterious dance trainer our heroines are trained and in turn audition for the Princess on Ice Tournament, the most prestigious ice dancing event of the year.  Follow the girls through their journey as they dance their way through the world&amp;rsquo;s premier ice skating stadiums perfecting all the moves and striving to impress the judges. Do our four dancers have what it takes to be crowned &amp;lsquo;Princess on Ice&amp;rsquo;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game play is based around rhythm and action using the stylus to follow dance prompts on the lower screen. Tap circles before the time runs out to skate, follow arrows as quickly as you can to spin, touch matching shapes as they meet to jump and tap shapes before they disappear to step. Your skater will react on the upper screen to how well you are doing in the game. Drop too far down the &amp;lsquo;heat&amp;rsquo; meter and&lt;br/&gt;she will stumble losing valuable points with the judges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to all the ice dancing fun you can totally customise your character with fashionable accessories, clothing and headwear. There are hundreds of different combinations across the four characters giving a unique look for each. As you progress through the game you will also be rewarded with a whole host of un-lockable extras including new levels, accessories, special moves and storylines adding yet more life and fun into the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-    4 unique characters to play each with their own storyline and skating skills&lt;br/&gt;-    10 different Ice Stadiums to unlock and dance in&lt;br/&gt;-    Customise your characters with clothes and accessories&lt;br/&gt;-    Unlock new levels, special moves and storylines&lt;br/&gt;-    Share clothes and accessories with friends using the DS wireless connection&lt;br/&gt;-    2 player wireless gaming action&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
