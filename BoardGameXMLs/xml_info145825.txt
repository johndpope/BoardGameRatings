							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Will o&#039; Wisps</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on will-o&amp;rsquo;-wisps. While these mysterious creatures of the swamplands are mostly known for their tendency to lead victims on wild goose chases into dangerous situations, the fact of the matter is that Pathfinder will-o&amp;rsquo;-wisps are built more for mobile beaters with ridiculously high attack, damage, AC, and maneuverability (plus constant invisibility) than they are for being elusive or tricky. While all of these will-o&amp;rsquo;-wisps can certainly hold their own in a fight, we aimed to capture a bit more of the essence of the wisp. The first result was the wispling (CR 2), a smaller, weaker version of the will-o&amp;rsquo;-wisp that can instill fear on opponents with its unnerving touch and ghostly lights abilities, and then bask in that fear with their feast on fear ability. The next new will-o&amp;rsquo;-wisp is the dark guide will-o&amp;rsquo;-wisp (CR 9), whose guidelights ability compels those who see it to follow it, regardless of where it takes them. These corrupted will-o&amp;rsquo;-wisps feed on death, more than fear, and lead travelers to early graves in order to sup on their last breaths. Finally, the devil&amp;rsquo;s eye will-o&amp;rsquo;-wisp (CR 13) appears at first to be a simple cloud of illuminated marsh gas, but, in fact, has numerous powers, including its maddening witchlight and its terrifying ability to split into multiple creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
