							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Escapades</name>
									
			<description>An adult charades games with a risque flavor.  Colored chips with 1 through 12 are selected to create teams.  Men draw from red chips, women from white.  First couple chooses the top card to act out.  Points are scored by having the other players guess the Escapade.  The faster others guess your charade, the more points you score.  If the Escapade is not guessed within 7 minutes, no points are scored and the next couple picks an Escapade card and begins.  The first team to score 15 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
