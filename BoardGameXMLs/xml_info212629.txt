			<description>&amp;quot;The stolen items will be taken by me... no, us!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;The knights would like to take the honor, ... no, they want just a public interesting. Additionally, they are very sly for all. They can take the credit from other knights for the own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a collecting card game.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a card pile with a same card set. Each player draws 5 cards, and places 2 cards on the front from them as scoring cards for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, each player places one card to the stolen item from a hand clockwise, and the knights pick up them. But please take care of, only the LAST PLAYED PLAYER to the stolen item can take it and get the points.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
