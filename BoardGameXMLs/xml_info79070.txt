							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Campaign Vicksburg</name>
									
			<description>It is the end of April 1863 on the Mississippi River. After disastrous Union campaigns at Chickasaw Bayou, Steele Bayou and Greenville, General U.S. Grant now elects to bypass the Confederate fortress city of Vicksburg. Instead, he will take his Army of the Tennessee and march down the Louisiana side of the Mississippi River.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anxiously expecting a Union thrust somewhere across the river into Mississippi, Lt. General John C. Pemberton and his Confederate army occupies a strongly fortified position extending both north and south of Vicksburg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Grant&amp;rsquo;s crossing of the mighty river there will be no turning back...for either side.&lt;br/&gt; Game Details:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HPS&amp;rsquo;s new Campaign Vicksburg has 57 scenarios, including the historical battles of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Chickasaw Bayou&lt;br/&gt;-Port Gibson&lt;br/&gt;-Raymond&lt;br/&gt;-Jackson&lt;br/&gt;-Champion Hill&lt;br/&gt;-Big Black Bridge&lt;br/&gt;-Milliken&amp;rsquo;s Bend and the&lt;br/&gt;-Vicksburg Assaults of 19 and 22 May 19&lt;br/&gt; &amp;quot;What-if&amp;quot; battles include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Grant Assaults on Snyder&amp;rsquo;s Bluffs&lt;br/&gt;-Redbone Church&lt;br/&gt;-Grindstone Ford&lt;br/&gt;-Ingraham Heights&lt;br/&gt;-July 6 Final Assault on Vicksburg&lt;br/&gt; The Campaign Game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The campaign is played over a large area from Snyder&amp;rsquo;s Bluff south to Port Gibson, and from Vicksburg east to the state capital of Jackson. On the advance, the Union player can choose among several strategic pathways with the ultimate goal of capturing Vicksburg. The Confederate guardians of the &amp;quot;Hill City&amp;quot; can elect to act purely on the defensive or counterattack instead. The choices are yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At each stage of the campaign, players choose operational decisions that will result in a tactical battle to be played out on an expansive map, providing room for maneuver. The campaign is non-linear, with both offensive and defensive operational options available to each side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Publisher's Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
