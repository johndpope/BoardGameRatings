							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Little Polar Bear Memory Game</name>
									
			<description>The Little Polar Bear Memory is based on the traditional game of memory and can be played that way, with players turning over cards, two at a time, trying to find as many matched pairs as possible through luck or by remembering the location of the cards.&lt;br/&gt;The game has 30 regular picture pairs and 12 special Little Polar Bear cards. This addition makes five variations of the traditional game possible. Some of these are easier to play; some are more challenging and difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
