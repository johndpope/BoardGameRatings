							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ace Quiz: Pop Music</name>
									
			<description>More interesting Quiz card game than usual. As you play, there is a code to take you to the next card, and so on until you have eight cards all connected. However, if you have been 100% correct you will see that the last code is the code for your first card. If it isn't then you must work out where you must have given a wrong answer or more wrong answers if 2 or more cards are incorrectly answered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player to get a correct set of eight cards, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
