							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fairy Tale Road Rage</name>
									
			<description>A cut-and-assemble board game printed in the end-papers of &amp;quot;LittleLit&amp;quot;, a collection of fairy tales as depicted by independent comic book artists.  The game, by &amp;quot;Jimmy Corrigan: Smartest Kid on Earth&amp;quot; author Chris Ware, is a fairly simple roll-and-move progression where players &amp;quot;drive&amp;quot; the various denizens (Big Bad Wolf, Frog Prince, Grandma) of a blighted, suburban fairy-land in an effort to gather like-colored &amp;quot;story chits&amp;quot;.  The chits are assembled on a separate board for each character, and &amp;quot;will complete a story of amusing and rakish details- particularly if read aloud, and with dramatic relish.&amp;quot;  Certain spaces, when landed on, have special, game altering effects, such as &amp;quot;Heisenberg Attack&amp;quot;, which forces all players to switch characters with the person to their right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;One person play: All rules are the same, though exchange between other players is, obviously, impossible.  Do not despair; someday you will grow up to be a famous cartoonist and all of the kids who made fun of you will have miserable jobs and be desperately unhappy, but you will get to draw stories for lots of money about how you still hate them all.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
