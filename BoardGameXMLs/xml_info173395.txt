			<description>From the Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to a sneak peek/quickstart for Nefertiti Overdrive. This product is intended to introduce you to Nefertiti Overdrive in advance of a crowd-funding drive to bring the actual game to life. This product provides condensed rules,&lt;br/&gt;pre-generated characters and an introductory adventure. It has minimal art and no maps. The crowd-funding campaign is intended to raise enough money so that the final product has more art and maps, as well as to pay for editing and graphic design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Nefertiti Overdrive, you are the greatest heroes of the 25th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt. You have assembled from across the Old World, your fate leading you to Thebes and the service&lt;br/&gt;of the Kushite Pharaohs. This royal house is threatened both by the powerful Assyrian Empire &amp;ndash; perhaps the greatest military force of the age &amp;ndash; and an upstart pretender from Lower Egypt, intent on taking the Double Crown of United Egypt. Can you &amp;ndash; the legendary warriors of this age &amp;ndash; protect the royal house from conquerors and traitors? Can fists, steel, and will triumph over naked aggression?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
