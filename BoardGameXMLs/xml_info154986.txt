			<description>Meta is an abstract game for two played on a 4x4 grid of 16 squares.  Each player has four pieces of a different color or shape, one each labeled with one of these letters: M, E, T, A.  Play begins with each player's pieces lined next to each other in the board's middle two rows, spelling out M-E-T-A.  Players take turns moving their pieces to one empty adjacent square, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.  The first player to move all of his pieces to the furthest row and spell M-E-T-A wins the game.  There are variations depending on how to start the game and whether to use the letters, and in which direction the letters should face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
