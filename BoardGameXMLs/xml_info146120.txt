			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some years ago, Azrenar, a cleric of Maramaga, Scythe-mother and Queen of Rot, petitions the king of Maerh-Varza to build a great temple to the ancient goddess. In great fury, the king seeks to put the offensive cleric and his followers to the sword and nearly succeeds. His follower&amp;rsquo;s dead bodies line the roads to Maerh-Varza and the cleric Azrenar curses the king, declaring bloody vengeance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Azrenar hides deep underground and he and his remaining followers find an ancient temple deep within the earth, one formerly held by evil dwarves centuries before Maerh-Varza was built. But when Azrenar takes over the temple, his mind is enraptured by the Reaping Stone, an ancient artifact once held by the Midnight King, a powerful wizard-priest of Maramaga&amp;rsquo;s order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now channeling the power of the Reaping Stone, Azrenar has created a deadly supernatural disease, one capable of animating those who die of the horrible wasting disease. Will the spurned cleric turn Maerh-Varza into a zombie-infested metropolis or will the players find the cure in time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
