			<description>There are 10 different games in this box with three classic games (f.e. the naval battle) and seven more unknown titles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even / Odd:&lt;br/&gt;is an interesting tactical game, where players take turns to move numbers on a squares adjacent to occupied squares. The goal is to catch the opponentby playing in a box completely surrounded by occupied squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The crossword puzzle: &lt;br/&gt;according to a original rules, each in turn wrote two more letters on a grid to score as many points as possible by lengthening words or creating new ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The secret message: &lt;br/&gt;game of deduction and letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The architect:&lt;br/&gt;Players move into a house of four levels, while building stairs, doors and windows. Each piece can contain only three elements. Once a player can no longer build or move, he lost the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The yacht race is an attempt to adapt a set of sailing race mode pen and paper. Interesting but tedious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
