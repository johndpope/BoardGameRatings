			<description>Board game Football is a simulation of the real sport football (soccer). Each player has 11 figurines (10 players and one goalkeeper). In one move player rolls two dices, black determines how many fields one figurine moves and white for how many fields moves the ball. The ball can be moved only if a figurine of a player is next to it. When figurine player is moving  - it can push the ball with it. At the end of its movement ball can be 'shot' to another own figurine or into the net. When the ball figurine enters the 'goal' that is score. The opponent puts the ball on the center of the board and begins new action. Players agree on how long the game lasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
