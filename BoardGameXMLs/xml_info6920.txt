The players alternately raise new forces (represented by the playing pieces) and maneuver them across a map of North America, using them to attack the other player's forces and to achieve their strategic objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PARTS LIST: Each copy of the game includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One 22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; game map&lt;br/&gt;One sheet of 200 cardboard playing pieces&lt;br/&gt;One 32-page booklet of rules and support material&lt;br/&gt;Two 6-sided dice (not included in the magazine edition)&lt;br/&gt;One game box (not included in the magazine edition)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
