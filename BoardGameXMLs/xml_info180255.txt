							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Toshiro â€“ The Daimyo</name>
									
			<description>Toshiro is an Ancestor of the Katanaka Clan, an old Daimyo of times past. As his title would make one think, he is a general that supports minions to tremendous levels while also being a pretty competent fighter on his own. With his personal upgrade he can also bring some summoning into any crew, allowing him to summon Ashigaru and Komainu who also happen to work great with him. Also, his Feudal Ties ability lets him hire Punk Zombies in any crew he is in, giving more access to Ten Thunder crews to Undead models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
