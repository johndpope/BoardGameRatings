			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This project was created from the desire to repair the obviously broken weapons listed in the Second Edition Corebook. These weapons are severely unbalanced, with some weapons being vastly superior than others. This is something this project seeks to ameliorate. To reach this goal, a special point system was created to make each weapon roughly equivalent to each other. This system was then not only used to re-create the weapons presented in the Core Book but also to add entirely new and interesting weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;This fan-made publication uses a point system to rebalance weapons from the Exalted Core Rulebook.  It also offers new weapons balanced using the same system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
