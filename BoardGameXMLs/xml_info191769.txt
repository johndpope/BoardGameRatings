			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;Players form a circle and each hold a note (humming, singing or whistling according to their ability). A player takes in a deep breath and then sounds their note for as long as they can, starting their breath when the player to their right starts their note. This forms a moving chord around the circle.&lt;br/&gt;Using this as a background and an inspiration, players take turns to tell brief stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
