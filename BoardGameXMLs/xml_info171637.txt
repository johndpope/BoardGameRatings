							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fritz und Franz: Die beiden Ausrei√üer</name>
									
			<description>Up to two players play the two runaways Fritz and Franz. The other players play the brother, sister, wench or servant, who try to catch the runaways. The runaways get a headstart and start at space 6. Every time a pursuer gets on the same space as a runaway, he gets 2 gamecoins. At space 7 the drawing of a card decides, which way to follow. Only Fritz and Franz may choose their way. On several spaces, the players get benefits or obstructions. If Fritz or Franz are the first to arrive at space 60, both runaways have won the game. If a pursuer is the first to arrive, he wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in the 1920s. It seems to be inspired by &amp;quot;Max und Moritz&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
