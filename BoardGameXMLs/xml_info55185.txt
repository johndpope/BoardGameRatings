			<description>From back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is suitable for use with all forms of Traveller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Money...&lt;br/&gt;...makes the world(s) go round - and the sole purpose of every corporation, Imperial or otherwise, is to get their hands on as much money as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your money...&lt;br/&gt;...is what they want. Whether you're interested in buying a Megaboing Grave Pogo Stick from FAMILLE SPOFULAM or a geneered 'dragon' from HYPAGENE, their only purpose is to separate you from your hard-earned cash. Sometimes, they don't care what they have to do to get it...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Supplement...&lt;br/&gt;...is packed with descriptions of 101 corporate bodies, their backgrounds, motivations and key characters, each with one or more adventure seeds to engage your Traveller players - from simple money-making schemes to corporate corruption and boardroom back-stabbing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
