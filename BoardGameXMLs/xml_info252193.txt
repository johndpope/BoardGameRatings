							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Forbidden Caverns of Archaia 5E</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new FIFTH EDITION megadungeon from Barrowmaze author Dr. Greg Gillespie!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lost city of Archaia - an ancient ruin sunken into the earth - lies deep in the badlands. In recent years, caravans from Eastdale have come under attack from orcs, goblins, and worse. Some say these blood-thirsty warbands have made lairs in the deep caves and ruins. Sill others say the ancient halls are filled with magnificent treasures left by the Archaians. Are you brave (or foolish) enough to delve The Forbidden Caverns of Archaia?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THe Forbidden Caverns of Archaia (FCoA) is a 296-page classic old school megadungeon for use with the Fifth Edition of the World's Most Popular role-playing games. THe pages of Forbidden Caverns are crammed full with new material, maps, amazing art (including special surprizes by former TSR artists), as well as an amazing colour cover art by Ex-TSR artist Erol Otus that matches Barrowmaze Complete 5E as a sister-book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Forbidden Caverns of Archaia will keep your players on their toes and your campaign going strong for years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FCoA is brought to you by the Old School Renaissance (so don&amp;rsquo;t forget your 10&amp;rsquo; pole).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
