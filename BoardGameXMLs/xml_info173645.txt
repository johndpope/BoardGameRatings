							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hollow Mage</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The frail, almost skeletal frame of a Hollow Mage belies the miracle of life that lies beneath the skin. Relying as they do on primal energies to nourish them, Hollow Mages reinforce the fact that the vastness of space-time is filled with beings of infinite variety, not just of appearance, but of nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These amazing and powerful beings are the definition of uniqueness. Even Hollow Mages that choose simple lives as farmers or merchants are likely to know at least a couple of Feats, even if not learned Epics. Those that devote themselves to the study of manipulating Aether are well known as some of the most powerful Epics on post-Fall Earth. They have an innate talent for space-time Feats in particular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second in a series of mini-expansions for the Breachworld RPG, the Hollow Mage is a unique and new character race, fully integrated into the fabric of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this supplement:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Hollow Mage character creation stats&lt;br/&gt;    Detailed background and origins&lt;br/&gt;    Discussion of disposition and culture&lt;br/&gt;    Detailed description, with new illustrations&lt;br/&gt;    Two new Perks and one Complication for use within the RPG&lt;br/&gt;    Five quick-stat Hollow Mage characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
