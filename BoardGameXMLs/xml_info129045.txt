			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy Roleplaying in Worlds of Epic Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curumir wiped blood from a gash over his eye as he peered through the fog and gloom of the pine woods. Storm clouds were gathering, casting a deathly darkness over the boughs surrounding him. The sweet smell of sap filled his head. If he weren't fleeing for his life, the place would almost seem pleasant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He'd been hounded for days, and his pursuers were gaining ground. A vast cracking noise split the darkness, and a huge inhuman monstrosity, slimy grey skin mottled with black scales, charged out of the dim wood. A great snarl erupted from the beast's tusked maw as a group of ragged-clothed bandits rushed up behind it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Give up the staff, wizard&amp;quot; growled the leader, inching forward, gripping a poisoned blade in one gnarled fist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curumir muttered an oath, and stepped forward. Eldritch flames instantly leapt up the length of his blade, casting a greenish glow across his attackers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;There will be blood spilled tonight, Ranalf&amp;quot; Curumir spat at the bandit king. &amp;quot;But it will not be mine.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a cry, Curumir rushed forward...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter a world of fantastic adventure, where your destiny is limited only by your imagination.
