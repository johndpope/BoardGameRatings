			<description>The eldest hand proceeds to make his announcement, or pass; the succeeding players have then the opportunity of over bidding or passing. If the eldest hand thinks he can get five tricks with Clubs for trump, he announces, &amp;quot;five in Clubs&amp;quot;. If the second player undertakes to make five tricks with Diamonds for trump, he supersedes the first, and may in his turn be superseded by the third engaging to get six or seven Levees, or play Little Misere. The fourth hand, or dealer, may also supersede the third hand by announcing Picolissimo, or eight Levees, or any of the other chances lower down on the table. When a player has once declined announcing, he cannot afterwards do so in that hand, but if he makes an announcement, and it be exceeded by some other subsequent announcement, he may, in his regular turn, increase his first announcement if he chooses. If all pass without announcing the hand must be played, and he who takes the least number of tricks wins. In this hand there is no trump. Any player whose announcement are the highest can, if he pleases, call for a partner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The privilege of calling for a partner extends only to announcements number 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 and the other being bids to play solo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The eldest hand leads first, and the hand is played and tricks taken in the same manner as at Whist. Honors in this game count the same as at Whist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player wins his announcement, he receives everything in the pool, and from each player the amount named in the table of payments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
