			<description>Froggammon is based on the game backgammon and is designed for younger players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of modular lily tiles. In the middle there is a large central tile connecting four paths of six lily leaves. Each of the paths is closed by a larger starting area where a player places six pieces of his colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to hop through the water lilies and get all of your frogs to you opponents&amp;rsquo; lily pads. On one leaf there can be multiple pawns of the same player. Another player can only put his pawn on a leaf when there is only one pawn of an opponent. In that case the pawn of the opponent has to start over from his starting tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is stored in a handy storage case with a handle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
