			<description>The intent of this small set of wargaming rules is to allow the players to recreate a portion of this battle using miniature figures, scenery and models. Unlike most wargaming rules, all the players in Mog &amp;rsquo;93 play the American forces. The Somalis run themselves on &amp;lsquo;auto-pilot&amp;rsquo;, using a simple scheme of die rolls&lt;br/&gt;to determine where they appear and their actions. The Americans check to see if they get hit any time they perform an action based on the number of armed Somalis who have LOS. These rules assume that&lt;br/&gt;you have some basic wargaming experience, as I have no inclination to write out wargaming basics such as what LOS is and what does and does not constitute cover, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The author&amp;rsquo;s basic scenario assumes that the initial stage of the mission is complete: The Delta operators have captured and secured the targets, who have been loaded on the vehicles and sent off on their way back to base. The first Blackhawk has been shot down and crashed. At the beginning of play, Rangers and Delta Operators (and SEAL and air force personnel as well, if you have the figures) are on the ground, trying to make their way to secure the crash site and prepare for extraction. What happens from there is up to the players and the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will control a &amp;lsquo;unit&amp;rsquo; of American special forces soldiers, typically either a unit of Delta operators or Rangers. The term &amp;lsquo;unit&amp;rsquo; is used because you&amp;rsquo;ll have to decide how many models will form a unit &amp;ndash; it can be as large a stick of Rangers (12 models), to as few as two models each if you have a lot of players. My advice to you is to allow each player 4 to 6 models, maximum, as he will need to keep track of ammunition and wounds for each model.&lt;br/&gt;The Somalis will come into play as &amp;lsquo;mobs&amp;rsquo;. A mob will consist of one or more Somali models, armed, unarmed, or a mixture of both. The Somalis are on autopilot. They are moved according to a protocol described herein, but otherwise perform no actions other than to be on the battlefield, assuming to be firing in whatever direction they are facing at any Americans who happen to be in their LOS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
