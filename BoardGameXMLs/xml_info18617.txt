			<description>From the box :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The most fascinating game you can play with friends. Take one card from each of the four categories: ethical, serious, surprising or intimidating disclosures. Are you willing to admit to your partners that the statement on one of your cards applies to you? If so, read the card out loud and win a token! Then for an additional token, try to guess who would be willing to admit what you just admitted. Nothing to confess? Take four new cards for your next turn. TOP SECRET - your guarantee of laughter, fun and excitement.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consists in revealing shocking secrets about yourself and trying to find out who would also agree with you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
