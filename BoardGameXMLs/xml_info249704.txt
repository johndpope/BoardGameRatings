							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Librarian Unbound Hybrid Class</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Librarians are guardians of powerful and magical relics, and often undertake globe-spanning adventures to recover items, and store them in their archives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Feats and Archetypes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The librarian is the consummate scholar and sage. Hybrid bard occultist's, there is almost no subject or object that they cannot glean some arcane or historical insight into. Besides their unparalleled knowledge, librarians have the ability to use a limited number of spells each day by using ancient books of lore as arcane implements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unbound, Why?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has come to our attention that some didn&amp;rsquo;t feel the original Librarian was up to the task of adventuring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After careful consideration and retesting we found many other classes were better suited to the Librarian&amp;rsquo;s role than the Librarian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;ldquo;unbound&amp;rdquo; is like an unchained rogue, barbarian or summoner; a re-adjustment of the class to better suit it&amp;rsquo;s original goal, as well as make some quality of life improvements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
