			<description>How well do you know your nearest and dearest? There's a dangerous myth that once you know all there is to know about your partner, that's all there is to know!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perfect Partners is a humorous myth-shattering party game of love, friendship and blush, designed to test exactly how well you know your other half. Boys, do you know what her most embarrassing moment was? Girls, are you ready to admit whether you find his jokes funny?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players split in teams, usually by couples. In turns, you draw one question card from the corresponding deck (boys or girls) and read out loud the question given by the die roll. Then, all partners write down what they guess their mates would answer before they actually do. Finally you go team by team answering the question and revealing if it matches what the partner has written. Be prepared to be open and honest and don't spare your blushes as it could win you valuable points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there is a match, you score the question. Simple yes-or-no questions score 1 point, multiple given choice score 2 points and open-answer questions score 3 points. Round ends and it's turn for next player. After a set number of rounds, the team with the highest score wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
