			<description>This is a deluxe version of Tiddeldy Winks with a bowling variant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be played as the regular game in which players try to be the first to snap all three of their winks into the cup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or the Target Tiddeldy Winks variant can be played using the target board and cup, which are neatly set into the box bottom so that the cup is roughly flush with the target surface.  In this variation the first player to 100 points wins, with higher points being achieved by the concentric rings of the target or the cup itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tiddeldy Winks Bowling game is what makes this unique.  In this variation the target/cup remains in the box, but a cover is placed on the cup.  Atop that cover sits a red bowling pin with a separate wide circular base.  Nine white pins are placed on the marked circles around it, forming the ten pins of a standard triangular bowling arrangement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to snap their winks and down the pins.  Ten points are awarded for the red pin, and one for each of the white pins.  The player with the highest total after ten rounds of three winks snapped wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
