							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oracles of Porphyra</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oracles are beings that have had divine power thrust upon them, given abilities they only half-understand, and magic powers developed through will and instinct, rather than learning. The theme of their power is called a &amp;lsquo;mystery&amp;rsquo;, associated with a concept of existence, physical or metaphysical. They can develop powers associated with this mystery, known as Revelations, which allow them to attack, defend, or understand the world as it relates to their mystery. They are spontaneous casters that need not memorize their spells, having a small group of spells that they cast competently, in greater numbers than most spellcasters. As a result of the imposed power upon them, each oracle bears a curse, which also gives them some advantage, as time goes on. Oracles are often obsessive in nature, focused on their own personal mystery, but are an invaluable addition to any intrepid group of adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within these pages you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     the Deadmagic Oracle archetype.&lt;br/&gt;     Apocalypse mystery&lt;br/&gt;     Sigils mystery&lt;br/&gt;     Shifting Sands mystery&lt;br/&gt;     Wastelands mystery&lt;br/&gt;     and Miajer, the Prophet of the End Times (male human oracle of Ul'Ul 3)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
