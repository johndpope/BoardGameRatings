			<description>Subtitle: Roleplaying in a world of art and madness&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;ImagiNation presents a world in which the realms of the imagination and the physical world have been brought into violent proximity to one another. The mainland of the British Isles has become infected with a nameless &amp;lsquo;something&amp;rsquo; that has caused people&amp;rsquo;s nightmares, dreams, obsessions and fancies to take a very real and dangerous form, locking&lt;br/&gt;them within a landscape of their own minds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Britain no longer meaningfully exists. What remains of the uninfected British population is confined to the islands around the mainland, a &amp;lsquo;safe distance&amp;rsquo; across the water from where this strange phenomenon has taken place. Northern Ireland has joined up with Eire through necessity as much as anything else and the largest remaining, unaffected population is to be found on the Isle of Wight in the south.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Britain is lost. Its population is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lost, but still there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The country is still there, the buildings, roads, factories and schools underneath the overlay of people&amp;rsquo;s imaginings, sometimes shaping and inspiring them. The people are still there, too &amp;ndash; those who survive their own nightmares, drifting aimlessly, caught up in their own fictions, living, psychic batteries giving form and personality to their dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some are aware. Lucid dreamers. Able to shape the world around them. Some of them, typically children or those with particularly strong imaginations, shape the world around them much more strongly, subsuming and controlling the imaginations of others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collectively, people&amp;rsquo;s imaginations are channelled and formed by the media they consumed before the disaster. One might find talking rabbits at Watership Down or any number of local legends and rumours brought to life from serial killers and vampires to dragons and ghosts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Britain is blockaded by a multinational task force and ex-patriots who, if they choose to return to the islands, may never leave again. What&amp;rsquo;s left of British money and power is devoted to holding this quarantine zone and working towards a solution. The problem is that very few people are immune, only the mindless, or those who were already broken in some way. Monstrous, terrible things are being done in the name of saving the country. Those few individuals who can enter the zone of effect without being warped, twisted or subsumed, those who can control this new, mutable, amorphous reality are particularly valuable. Sent into the mainland they search for answers, try to rescue people and just try to make sense of what has happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play the part of one of these scouts. Part of a team probing the worst excesses of the collective unconscious, looking for answers, looking for a cure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
