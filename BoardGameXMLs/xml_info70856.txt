							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lumines II</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Lumines II is a sequel to the puzzle game Lumines. The game was released in November, 2006 in Europe and North America, and in February 2007 in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay in Lumines II is very similar to its predecessor, Lumines. The object is still to move blocks of four different colored squares across the board; while trying to create a single square of the same color. This all must be done before a &amp;quot;timeline&amp;quot; crosses the screen deleting the squares that you make. Deleting four or more squares will add a bonus multiplier to your score. (Refer to the Gameplay section of Lumines for more details).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no Infrastructure gameplay in Lumines II. The game is visually similar to Lumines Live and the PC port of Lumines during both gameplay and in the menus.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Lumines_II,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
