			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Better than a pinball game; better than a maze game; this fast action game is for the new gamester as well as the true gamestar.  Choose the &amp;quot;easyball&amp;quot; play level to start and get the hang of playing.  You score by deftly controlling a fleet of paddles off which ounce multi-colored balls and travel through changing bumpers, multi-point gateways, and across flashing zones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you have mastered &amp;quot;easyball&amp;quot; shift up to the &amp;quot;bumperball&amp;quot; level of play.  Everything gets tougher and you really have to &amp;quot;move out&amp;quot; to score.  The action is fast and continuous, and the colors, sound, music, and Hi-Res graphics are truly arcade quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two player option and 100% machine language, of course!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
