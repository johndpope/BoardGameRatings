			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Destiny - A Decision Driven Roleplaying Game is a narrative roleplaying game that eliminates dice in favor of narrative action developed by the GM and the players.  This is not, however, a simple system.  Action resolution relies upon clearly defined mechanics which should support the interpretation of descriptions by group consensus.  Each action generally contrasts the character's &amp;quot;Determining Focus&amp;quot; against the situation's &amp;quot;Choice Density&amp;quot;, in other words--how important is the choice to the character, and how difficult is it to resolve?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules give a list of possible modifiers based on narrative elements impinging upon the situation.  These all add or subtract to a base number in increments of 5 (or 3, if a &amp;quot;less gritty&amp;quot; campaign is desired).  The composite score is then compared to a &amp;quot;Success Table&amp;quot; ranging from -12 to +22; the entry on the table determines the degree and type of failure or success.  Because this mechanism is complex and time-consuming, an &amp;quot;evil short cut&amp;quot; is provided that eliminates the group consensus in favor of GM fiat (even so, the short cut is not a necessarily simple process).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remainder of the rules concern processes that allocate character attention and ability, methods for calculating strategic benefit, and gaining and spending resources (generally speaking, these are abstract concepts like Karma).  These aspects have, for a narrative game, an atypical focus on math and bookkeeping.  Character creation is considered in great detail.  Alternate options (variant rules) are provided in a brief section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
