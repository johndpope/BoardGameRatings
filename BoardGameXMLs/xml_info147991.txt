							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">65 foot Yacht</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 24 x 10 inch map of a 65 ft Yacht, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes enjoy the party like it is your last night on Earth. Because it will be.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The yacht is a three-deck floor plan of a modern day weekender motor yacht. This product includes image files for your virtual tabletop (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The yacht is meant for use in modern settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The yacht can be used in many ways. A rich player character or group of characters could use it as a mobile base in a modern setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One idea is to use the two top deck plans (The open top and closed top) for a chase scene. Perhaps the player characters are coast guard or law enforcement trying to bust a bunch of drug running criminals. They gather evidence in town at a drug bust and it leads them to the docks. The criminals make a break for it in their yacht, and the group commandeers a yacht to chase after them. Can they catch the criminals and put an end to their drug smuggling?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps the group is invited to a weekend party at an island. The party borders on an orgy with lusty men and women giving into their most carnal desires and alcohol and drugs flowing freely. The great time ends prematurely, when some of the guests end up as dead as sacrifices by their host. The group might be captured to be sacrificed and witnesses the host summon a demon or horror beyond their imaginings. It quickly consumes the host and his bodyguards. The group needs to quickly escape their bonds as the demon or horror chases after them. The climax is on the yacht with the group needing to shake the demon off the boat or defeat the demon with any weapons they have on board the boat to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
