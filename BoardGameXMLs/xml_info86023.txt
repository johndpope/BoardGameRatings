			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kinect Joyride is a launch title for the Xbox 360&amp;rsquo;s motion control peripheral the Kinect. The game is a cartoony racer that is operated by using a steering motion in front of the Kinect sensor. Joyride was initially intended to be released as a free-to-play downloadable racing title for the Live Marketplace, but was changed to its current form when Project Natal was in development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worldwide Cooperation &amp;ndash; Joyride has the unique feature of community tasks. Players around the world will work together to meet overall goals that unlock additional game content. Each race played will contribute to these tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exciting Races &amp;ndash; The game includes a few different race modes, including a standard race and trick race. In the trick race the players attempt to collect items and perform the most tricks in a set time period. Both game modes are available both on- and offline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unique Racing Experience &amp;ndash; The players do not control acceleration of their vehicles; they only steer and boost the karts. Boosts are activated by thrusting the hands forward, and replenished by drifting or doing tricks (twisting the body). Coins can be collected along the track, and power-ups can be used to disable opponents&amp;rsquo; karts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
