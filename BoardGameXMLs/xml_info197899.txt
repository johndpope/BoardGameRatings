			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blockbusters from Macsen Software is based on the well-known television series of the same name. The TV game is a Central Production made in association with Mark Goodson and Talbot Television.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blockbusters was a highly popular British TV show (though originally based on an American format) hosted by Bob Holness. Students, one single and one team of two, would compete to answer questions to fill in hexagons on a grid. Each hexagon was filled with a letter, and the answer to the question started with that letter. If a team answered a question correctly it would turn their colour (white or blue) and they could then choose the next location on the grid, leading to the famous catchphrase &amp;quot;Can I have a 'P' please, Bob?&amp;quot; (having a Pee is British slang for urinating).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is for the single student (playing white) to connect from top to bottom, a minimum of four spaces, and for the pair of students to connect from left to right, a minimum of five spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning would allow the team to progress to the Gold Run, where a single student (the pair would alternate if they won multiple times) would attempt to cross a more complicated version of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This computer version is cut down in several ways. Firstly, the grid is only four by four. This is presumably because it is a two-player only game (there is no AI, nor is there a possibility to play 1 vs. 2 - there is only one 'buzzer' button for the blue team), so it would be unfair to handicap either player with having to complete an extra space. Secondly, there is no Gold Run (a seperate single-player Gold Run game was subsequently released).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can select the number of games to play in a series, and a skill level (which alters the time allowed to answer). The game reveals the question word by word and either player can 'buzz in' to answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
