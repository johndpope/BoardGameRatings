			<description>Who knows the Biggest, Fastest, Loudest, Smallest, Longest Everything? The Family Game Where Players Put Things in Order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sort it Out! is a fast-paced game where knowing just a little about something can help you win everything! It is a party game based on ordering items in lists (e.g. celebrities by year of birth). A card of colour-coded list items is drawn, and the players slot like coloured tiles into position in a plastic holder. The reverse of the list card shows the correct order. By answering questions you move around the game board.  The first one to cross the finish wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the travel edition of Sorts, for 2-4 players rather than 2-6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
