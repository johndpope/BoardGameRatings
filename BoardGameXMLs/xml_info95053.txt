			<description>Some people are normal, some are special, and some have tiger blood in their veins! If you&amp;rsquo;re tired of pretending you&amp;rsquo;re not a bitchin&amp;rsquo; rock star from Mars then, grab some friends from your pool of magic assassins, and get ready to crush some fools in your underwear!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sheen It! is a card game for 3 or more players ages 13 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sheen It! is a game in which players compete to create the most epic sayings out of Charlie Sheen-isms. Combine cards that contain elements from Charlie&amp;rsquo;s best quotes to create your own new sentence or phrase. If the Judge thinks yours is the best, you score. Be the first player to reach 10,000 points and you can truly say you are WINNING!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
