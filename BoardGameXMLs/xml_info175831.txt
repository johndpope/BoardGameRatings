							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Buongiorno, Signorina</name>
									
			<description>Buongiorno, Signorina is an Italian style reaction game for 2 to 6 players aged 8 years and up. Shuffle the cards and deal them face down to each player, so that each player has approximately the same number of cards. Don&amp;rsquo;t look at your cards, but place them face down in a deck in front of you. Then you continue in a clockwise direction. When it&amp;rsquo;s your turn, draw the top card from your deck. Reveal it by turning it away from you, so that you are not the first one to see it. That way, no one can accuse you of cheating! Place it in the middle of the table. Then each take it in turns to place your card on top of the card previously laid. Continue doing this until a card demands an action. Tip: the faster you turn over your cards, one after the other, the more fun it becomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which cards demand which actions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pasta: &lt;br/&gt;As long as pasta appears, nothing happens. The sort makes no difference whatsoever. The neighbour on your left plays the next card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re: As soon as one of the four Kings turns up, salute him very quickly. Move your flat hand to your forehead and touch it with your fingertips. It makes no difference whether you use your right or left hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Signorina:&lt;br/&gt;As soon as one of the four Ladies appears, quickly call out &amp;ldquo;Buongiorno, Signorina&amp;rdquo; (pronounced Buonchorno Sinnjorina).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mandriano:&lt;br/&gt;As soon as one of the four Cowherds appears, quickly blow a kiss. To do this, simulate a kiss on your fingertips and symbolically blow it away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cavallo:&lt;br/&gt;As soon as one of the four Horses turns up, like lightning, bang your flat hand down on the card(s) in the middle of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is how the game ends:&lt;br/&gt;The game ends as soon as one of you has no more cards left. Have you laid your last card in the middle of the table? Then you&amp;rsquo;ve almost won. But Attenzione: if instead of showing pasta, it demands an action, then you must carry this out quickly and correctly. Therefore, make an effort so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to take all the cards from the middle of the table. Did everything go well? Complimenti &amp;ndash; you have won!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
