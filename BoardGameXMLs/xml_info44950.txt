			<description>Hate and Spite&lt;br/&gt;Kobolds are a common sight in many campaign worlds; deemed by most adventurers to be a minor nuisance at best. Certainly, most experienced adventurers would question the need to study kobolds in any great depth, but then, few have faced the full might of a kobold clan and lived long enough to warn others of the peril they offer. The Slayer&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Kobolds offers insight to all adventurers in the&lt;br/&gt;culture and society of this vicious race, enabling them to track down, engage and wipe out dozens of these murderous beasts. It can only be hoped that such efforts will be enough to stall and drive back a race that is, almost literally, numberless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No race in any campaign world, however, exists solely to provide cannon fodder for allegedly heroic adventurers. The Slayers Guide to Kobolds redresses this imbalance by giving Games Masters the information they need to make kobolds a solid and coherent part of their campaign. No longer will&lt;br/&gt;players merely scoff and draw their swords when they meet a group of kobolds within some ancient ruin. Finally, kobolds will have the respect they have always deserved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
