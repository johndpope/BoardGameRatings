			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Madagascar, hidden in the foliage of the dense jungle, secluded and shy, lives an extremely rare chameleon family. All members of this family are either orange, green or purple. Through elaborate and time-intensive observations, researchers now have discovered how the chameleons come to their extraordinary color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cham&amp;auml;lange is an unusual tactic game for 2 people. Each player draws a chameleon color (orange, green, or purple) secretly without showing it to his opponent. The third card is put aside and unknown to both players.  Each player is trying to get as many chameleons in his color as possible in the course of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Therefore it is necessary to play the egg cards in the colors red, blue and yellow cleverly. The egg cards have the values of 1 &amp;ndash; 3. If two cards with different colored eggs are laid on one another, the already lying card is reversed. From the mixture of the egg colors the new chameleons originate. If, for example, red and blue eggs lie side by side, a purple chameleon is produced. The chameleon, which is produced by touching the eggs, is marked with a stone, in our example the purple one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever could collect the most eggs under his chameleon color wins this extraordinary game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
