			<description>Diamond Trust is a two-player, turn-based, simultaneous-decision strategy game about diamond traders operating in Angola in the year 2000.  Over the course of eight in-game months, diamonds accumulate in various regions to be taken by the highest bidder, and whoever brings the most diamonds back from Angola wins.  Outfoxing your opponent is your main tactic, but bribing and spying mechanics complicate things.  When agent loyalty waivers, your hidden information can be revealed to your opponent without you knowing that it has been revealed.  On the other hand, you might know that one of your agents has been bribed by your opponent, but does your opponent know that you know?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many ways, Diamond Trust plays like a tightly-crafted board game, but by leveraging two separate views of the world (on two wireless-connected DS units), it also does what no board game can:  secretly reveal one player's hidden information to the other player without the first player being aware of the reveal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tom Bailey's interactive music changes based on what's going on in the game, but it also functions in an &amp;quot;endless music generation&amp;quot; mode if you close the lid and plug in headphones or speakers.  Never the same music twice, and you can listen for many hours before you'll hear all the great moments that his music has to offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
