			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two of the kingdom&amp;rsquo;s baronies have been at odds and occasionally outright war for centuries, in a blood feud that lost all meaning generations ago. Things have recently changed as the heads of the two noble families have arranged a marriage between the heirs to their baronies, in a move to secure peace and prosperity to the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular adventure has two sections. The first is an event based part of the game, where the players proceed from one event or scene to the next in a straightforward manner. Each scene or event is self-contained, but has links to the previous and the upcoming events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The latter half of the adventure, when the characters are finally ready to confront the villains of the adventure is a more classic dungeoncrawl, with pits, traps, monsters and treasure. Make sure you familiarize yourself with both before you start the adventure for your group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure itself is written for 4-6 3rd level characters, but is adjustable for other levels of play as you see fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
