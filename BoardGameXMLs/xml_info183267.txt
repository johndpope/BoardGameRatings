							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scene of the Crime</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can You Stop A Conspiracy From Destroying Your Town? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your small hometown has always been fairly quiet-that is, until plans are revealed to build a huge new mail there.  At first you're as excited as everyone else.  But then you overhear a mysterious conversation that makes you suspect that something fishy is going on.  The town council is meeting in just a few hours to decide whether to approve the final plans for the mail.  Should you go to the police and tell them what you heard?  Or would it be better to speak up at the town council meeting yourself?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
