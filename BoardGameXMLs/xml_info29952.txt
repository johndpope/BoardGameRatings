			<description>An abstract 2-player game in which the objective is to create a line of 5 counters . The twist here is that the counters are placed in a series of 5 boards of differing size that are formed to make a pyramid, hence the name &amp;lsquo;Quinamid&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are simple, with any one of  3 options available to the player : &lt;br/&gt;a)    Place a counter in a vacant space&lt;br/&gt;b)    Rotate a board (including those boards &amp;lsquo;above&amp;rsquo; it) through 90 degrees&lt;br/&gt;c)    Move a board (including those boards &amp;lsquo;above&amp;rsquo; it) one &amp;lsquo;position&amp;rsquo; in any orthogonal direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important rule is that the subsequent player may neither move NOR rotate a board which was moved or rotated by the preceding player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take it in turns to make their move until one of them reveals a line of 5 counters, this being in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As players use option c) above they will &amp;lsquo;cover&amp;rsquo; boards below, thereby hiding the contents. It follows therefore that there is a bit of memory required to recall what was under the various boards if you are to use it to your advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game is often completed in 2 or 3 minutes so replay value is high. It is often better to play a &amp;lsquo;best of 5&amp;rsquo; series to employ different strategies, so that would take around 15 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game should appeal to players aged 8-80. It could be played whilst waiting for a meal to be prepared or as a post-prandial diversion with other players spectating and giving out &amp;lsquo;advice&amp;rsquo; ! Easy until they themselves have a go !!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components are sturdy, with the counters and boards being made of good quality wood, and the package comes in a nice wooden presentation box of dimensions 7&amp;rdquo; x 7&amp;rdquo;, making it portable and suitable to be played on the train, the beach or at picnics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Boardspace.net (real time, AI option)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.quinamid.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.quinamid.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
