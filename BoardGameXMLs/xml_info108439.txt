			<description>Card game with an STD prevention, sexual wellness and sexual pleasures theme. The goal is to collect 69 pleasure points. This can be reached by getting involved into different kinds of sexual activities.&lt;br/&gt;Each player represents a male or a female character. During the game, a player can get a relationship with an opposite sex card (no same sex possibilities in the rules, although it might be adapted). In each turn, a player plays three cards and draws three new cards. Cards can be played on oneself or on opponents or their partners. Card effects can be positive, as in having sex or making up etc., or negative, blocking others. When a sexual act card is played, one or two dice are rolled and the result is added to the pleasure point total of the player, until one of them has reached a total of 69 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
