							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ion Guard (ICONS)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intergalactic Ordinance Network (ION) Guard is a heroic peacekeeping organization that has served to protect and defend the intelligent species of the many sectors of the Universe for the last billion years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dedicated to protecting sapient races against disaster, villainy, and intergalactic criminality, the ION Guard is a force for justice with an illustrious history, whose members have acted as investigators, peacekeepers, law enforcers, mediators, defenders, and aid workers throughout the Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Guardsman- wearing the iconic golden ION Fist that has become synonymous with justice for many intergalactic inhabitants- is a cosmic powerhouse, capable of bringing the vast forces of an artificially harnessed singularity to bear against the enemies of peace, justice, and life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the Universe they strive against evil and darkness. Though powerful, they are spread all too thin: they are but small lights, beacons of hope in the vast darkness enfolding the stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To be a Guardsman is to serve the Universe and a cause far greater than any one individual. To be a Guardsman is to wield incredible power with awesome responsibility. To be a Guardsman is to bravely face tremendous foes and staggering odds, no matter how overwhelming, when fighting the good fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let evil fear the ION Guard!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
