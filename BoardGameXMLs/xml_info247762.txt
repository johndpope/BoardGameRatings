			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a list of 100 books on myths and legends that players might find on a bookshelf. The books are mostly suitable for a modern setting, as many were first published in the 20th century, although some are older.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The books cover myths and legends from around the world with an edge towards European and Celtic mythology. All the books listed are genuine books, some of them by well known names in the field. Whether or not the books have any in-game value other than decorative is up to the GameMaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entries have the book's name, author, if known, and in some cases other details. They can be used to pad out a bookshelf with other genuine material, although it is unlikely that any one person would have books on the whole range of subject material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some examples are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;67. Myths from Mesopotamia: Creation, the Flood, Gilgamesh, and Others by Stephanie Dalley (Translated by)&lt;br/&gt;68. Myths of Crete and PreHellenic Europe by Donald A. Mackenzie&lt;br/&gt;69. Navajo Legends by Washington Matthews&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
