			<description>Spurn is a three-player game (inspired by Néstor Romeral Andrés&amp;rsquo; Spuzzle) designed for play with a Shibumi set.  It uses a 4&amp;times;4-holed board, and balls in three colors (white, black, and red).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim: Be the last player to create a group of four or more balls of your color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules: The 4&amp;times;4 board starts empty. The players, White, Black, and Red, take turns placing one ball of their own color on the growing pyramid.  If you create a group of four or more of your balls, you are eliminated, and will add no more balls to the pyramid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
