			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A vs tactical card game for 2 players. Players choose two fighting schools and have cards in hand with numbers. The cards need to be held in number order, and some of the cards might have to be revealed to the opponent; hence guessing what the other one has is part of the game. Players take turns playing cards and taking over threat foci, by cleverly choosing numbers on the cards that the opponent cannot counter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player to either deal 6 deadly wounds or 13 normal wounds to the opponent wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
