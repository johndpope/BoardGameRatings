			<description>In Die Panzerknacker (The Safe Crackers), the players attempt to get loot from safes by breaking the secret codes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with 18 loot cards, 18 secret code cards, and four dice. At the beginning of the game, all the cards are placed face-up on the table, then the dice are rolled. Three of the dice (colored blue, red and yellow) show different numbers ranging from 1 to 18. The fourth die shows three &amp;quot;up&amp;quot; arows and three &amp;quot;down&amp;quot; arrows. If the &amp;quot;up&amp;quot; arrow is rolled, the players should consult the code card that matches the highest die rolled; otherwise they should consult the card that matches the lowest die rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The code card shows a puzzle that uses the remaining two dice, specifically a table that involves some calculation with the numbers to find the right loot. After a player has determined the correct loot, he takes the corresponding card from the table. If he has picked the right card, he gets to place the card in front of himself. The first player to collect five cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
