							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bionics</name>
									
			<description>Since 2012, the Bionics book has been included into the core Icar version 4 rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For some, humanity is not near enough the top of the food chain. An extra step needs to be taken, beyond that which can be easily made by fitness regimes. Humanity can be augmented by technology. Any un-natural augmentation of a human is known in the group term Bionics, regardless whether they are biological based or machine based improvements. The person with the augmentation is referred to as an Aug in this section. Bionics is split into three distinct sections. Borgware involves completely replacing limbs such that the Aug looks like part of a machine. Cyberware goes under the skin, sometimes replacing limbs but normally such that the enhancement does not change the appearance of the Aug. Bioware produces flesh and nerves that is woven onto the body of the Aug. Can change the appearance of the Aug, but rarely does. A more detailed description of each is included at the start of each section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
