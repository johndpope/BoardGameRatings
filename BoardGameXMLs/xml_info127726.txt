			<description>The challenge comes from having to fill a 9x9 grid so that every row, column and 3x3 box within the grid contains the digits 1-9. Sudoku is a highly addictive blend of logic and lateral thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sound easy? You&amp;rsquo;ll change your tune after your first round of Sudoku!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules of Sudoku are simple. The numbers have no numerical or arithmetic value; they represent symbols that cannot be repeated. Enter digits from 1 to 9 into the blank spaces of the board. Every row, column and 3x3 subsection of the grid must contain one and only one of each digit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Sudoku puzzle has a unique solution that can be reached logically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four levels of difficulty, based on how many numbers are provided when you start the puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EASY: 34-36&lt;br/&gt;MEDIUM: 30-32&lt;br/&gt;HARD: 27-29&lt;br/&gt;GENIUS: 24-26&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play 50 puzzles per level. Select Statistics to see how many per level you have completed and your best and average time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
