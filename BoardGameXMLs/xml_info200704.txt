							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Orchestra</name>
									
			<description>In The Orchestra players take upon roles of a starting conductor. The aim of the game is evolving to the best one there is. You complete your musical works and control as many musicians as you possibly can. &lt;br/&gt;You have to collect musicians for you to play (music) your music pieces.&lt;br/&gt;You gather your musicians by combining cards, place them on the right spot in the Orchestra and collect extra bonuses by placing them on important places.&lt;br/&gt;So, who wil be there first on the right spot?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many more possibilities to gain extra points, block your opponent and steel points. There is also the possibility to gain points (or to lose them) on the timeline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The artwork for this fantastic game is designed by Joris van Beusekom and will be crowdfunded august 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
