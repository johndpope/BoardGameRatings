							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Micromech Melee</name>
									
			<description>Microgame submission for 2015 Geekway to the West Design Competition.  The game is a two player card game that takes about 15 - 20 minutes to play.  It utilizes a deck of 22 cards--20 tactics cards and 2 Cool Down cards, as well as a range location card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the first part of the game, each player drafts eight tactics cards which are added to a Cool Down card to form his or her hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the second part of the game, players simultaneously choose tactics to send their micromechs out to attack.  Attack, ranged attack, defense and speed values are determined not only by the card played, but also by the cards that have been played previously.  Cards can only be replenished into the hand by playing a Cool Down card.  First player to incapacitate his or her opponent is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
