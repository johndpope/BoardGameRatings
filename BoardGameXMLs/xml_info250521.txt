							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Encounter With the Edan Sha</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of bandits called the Edan Sha are active in the shady parts of the city. Perhaps they stole from you, or maybe you were hired to defeat them. Whatever the reason, you find yourselves fighting against the gang. Little did you know that they had an ace up their sleeve!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An encounter with the Edan Sha! This encounter is made up of a droppable scenario, built around the group of the Edan Sha and the Helmed Horror that Hegemon bestowed them with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be used as a prelude to King to an Empty City&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
