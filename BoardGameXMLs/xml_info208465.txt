			<description>'AireCards' is a game first played at the AireCon Board Game convention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players fill out their AireCard by distributing 1000 points between 5 categories, although no two categories can be the same value. Collect 3 lives (tokens) and a custom AireCon dice (the 6 replaced by the AireCon logo) then you're all set to go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are easy, walk up to another player, challenge them and then roll your dice - then compare values in the matching category on your AireCards. The highest value wins and takes a life from the other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can't challenge someone that just challenged you, and you can't challenge the same person twice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the convention, hand in your AireCard and all the lives you've collected, whoever collected the most lives wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
