							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hugga Bunch 3-in-1 Match and Hug Card Games</name>
									
			<description>This is three children's matching games featuring the Hugga Bunch characters. All the games use the same deck of cards. In the first game, you try to match the card pictures on your cards with the mirror image pictures on your opponents cards. The first player to get rid of all of his or her cards wins. In the second game, players try to match their cards with cards on the table using color or number. The object is once again to get rid of all your cards first. The third game is like the second only designed for solitaire play. In all the games, the special Hugga Bunch cards are wild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
