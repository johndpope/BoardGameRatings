							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">101 Fantasy Riddles</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nothing says &amp;quot;ADVENTURE&amp;quot; in a Role-Playing game like a good riddle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien's book &amp;quot;The Hobbit&amp;quot; had riddles. The &amp;quot;Princess Bride,&amp;quot; had riddles. Even Monty Python's &amp;quot;Quest for the Holy Grail&amp;quot; spoofed riddles.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many monsters love to ask and answer riddles. (Especially dragons.) NPCs may ask riddles to test an adventurer's worthiness. Magic doors and chests may offer riddles as a way to grant access, avoid traps. The possibilities are endless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains over one hundred fantasy style (J.R.R.Tolkien like) riddles. It is designed for use where ever fantasy riddles might by appreciated. The riddles in this book are a compilation of classical riddles combined with dozens of new and original riddles added by the author. Riddles vary in difficulty from very easy to fairly difficult. Most riddles are in singsong rhyme similar to that used by Tolkien in his book the &amp;quot;The Hobbit.&amp;quot; All riddles in this book refer only to subjects found in typical medieval/fantasy realms and are suitable for thinkers of all ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
