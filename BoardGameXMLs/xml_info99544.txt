			<description>Party Gras, billed as &amp;quot;Bourbon Street in a box&amp;quot;, is a game of drinking, groping and flashing.  Players are given strings of beads, which they can lose to, or acquire from, other players by way of instructions on the spinner or spaces on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In true Mardi Gras fashion, bead exchanges are most often accomplished by flashing other players, or having other players flash you.  The rules state that this involves baring one's chest, but also suggest that guys may be &amp;quot;a bit more creative&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The base mechanic is &amp;quot;spin and move&amp;quot; as the player's pieces (shot glasses) move along a winding track.  Players must follow the directions on the spinner and board.  The person holding the most strings of beads when any player crosses the finish line is the official winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
