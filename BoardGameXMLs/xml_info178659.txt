			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover the Magic of the Trolls!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many different approaches to magic, and different groups are able to master it in different ways, creating strange and exotic spells that others would never dream of. Trolls are no different in this regard, and while many of the trolls in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game are not very well inclined towards magic, trolls in other fantasy media are rife with strange, primitive rituals and shamanistic traditions, the flavor of which we attempt to capture with the spells in this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains 11 new spells for a wide variety of spell lists, all of which are thematically linked to the primitive (but no less effective) magic of trolls. Burst of vigor can grant powerful regeneration in combat, or improve the target&amp;rsquo;s existing regeneration, but comes at the cost of weakening the target when the spell ends. Create cave allows you to create an extradimensional cave from any rock surface, an ability especially useful for victims of the curse of sunstone, which causes the target to be petrified in direct sunlight.  Perhaps the most potent troll spell, heart regrowth allows creatures with regeneration to remove their still-beating heart and hide it away somewhere, allowing them to regenerate from their heart rather than their corpse, should they die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re looking for unique and exciting spells for your trolls or similarly savage NPCs, or just want to expand your wizard&amp;rsquo;s ever-growing spellbook, the magic of trolls is not to be overlooked!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
