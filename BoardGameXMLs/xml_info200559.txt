			<description>Game of Thones: Intrigue at King's Landing is a print &amp;amp; play card game for 3-4 players based on the hit TV series Game of Thrones, where each player represents one of the great houses of Westeros struggling for dominance and to ultimately claim the Iron Throne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, each player chooses one scheme that they are trying to fulfil.  Players then make deals, conspire and back-stab to either support or oppose these schemes.  Helping another player with their scheme may be easier, though if they are successful that player will gain a powerful ability that may be used against you later in the game!  Players must also be careful of opening up support of their schemes to the wrong house, as a well-timed betrayal can leave you losing everything to an adversary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Schemes also award armies, gold and power to those who are most successful in carrying them out or preventing them from coming to fruition, all of which contribute towards the award of four prestigious titles as well as your claim to be ruler of Westeros!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
