			<description>Spider-Man and his team of superheroes vs. Doc Octopus; Who will win this tension-filled race? With a lot of luck and daring play you can help Spider-Man and the superheroes overcome their foe. Be careful - risky play isn't always rewarded!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spider-Man vs Doc Octopus is a roll-and-move game where the players each have to reach the finish before Doc Octopus does. Each turn, a player decides how often they want to roll the die (up to four times). However, if they roll an &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; in any of their attempts, they do not get to move. Instead, Doc Octopus advances a number of squares equal to the number chosen at the beginning of the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
