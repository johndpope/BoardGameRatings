							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MacGuffin Alphabet</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;T is for the Twisted Mind of Stefan Jones . . .&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Twenty-six ways to get get into and out of trouble in a variety of space age and later settings! Whether it involves deciphering intelligence reports disseminated in comic books or being brainwashed by the most comfortable bed in the world, you'll find over two dozen good excuses to torment your players within.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A MacGuffin is an object of desire for someone, somewhere - perhaps they only wish to purchase it, but more likely they're willing to lie, steal, and murder to acquire it. Most MacGuffins are plot filler to justify the action, but these are interesting.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;If you want a mysterious aristocrat to hire a small team to 'acquire' a copy of a musical meme hazard; if one of the heroes has found a pretty trinket that's going to start a war the next time he's seen wearing it in public; if you just want to mess with their heads . . . try the MacGuffin Alphabet!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
