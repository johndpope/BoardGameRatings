			<description>You will need:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 6-sided die&lt;br/&gt;Paper and pencil&lt;br/&gt;An egg timer/sand timer&lt;br/&gt;A token for each player (optional)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a pair of the tiles. Player one places one in front of them, and rolls the die. The die roll tells them which letter will be in play this game. 1 = top letter, 2 = second letter down, and so on. (Optional: Place a coin or token next to this letter to mark it, or write it on your paper.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player one sets the second tile down to the left of the first. They roll the die again, and the letter from the second tile is chosen as with the first. Player one then takes the second tile and overlaps the first, so that the two active letters are side by side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player two determines their active letters the same way. The timer is started, and players list as many words as possible that start with the left letter and end with the right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When time runs out, the player with more words scores the difference in the number of words between the two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If player one makes 10 words and player two makes 7, player one scores 3 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the next round, each player must rotate a tile, change the order of the tiles, or perform any combination of the two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player to 20 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To increase the intensity, increase the required number of letters per word to 4, 5, or 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created by indigopotter for Reprint's contest, February 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
