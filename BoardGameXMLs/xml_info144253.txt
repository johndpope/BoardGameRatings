			<description>AMERIKA takes place in an &amp;ldquo;alternate time-line&amp;rdquo; reality to explore the possibilities of what could have happened if certain events during the war had a much different result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose to either be Axis forces invading America, or Allied forces attempting to defend America long enough to achieve a technological edge and turn the tide of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most unique part of AMERIKA is the ability of commanders to build their own custom invasion force. Following the army build rules, each side can customize their force to suit their own strategy. They also control how the forces are deployed at the start of the game. The balancing factor is a victory point time limit and a growing defensive force. The attackers must move fast!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 20&amp;quot; X 30&amp;quot; map depicts the United States and surrounding areas as it was around WW2. Areas are broken up into Land Territories, City Zones, Nuclear Research Sites, and Naval Landing Zones. The Allies must defend their 20 major Cities from Axis occupation in order to continue fielding their defensive forces. However, they must also keep the enemy from capturing the 2 research facilities across the U.S. so atomic research can be harnessed and Victory Points earned. Axis forces are tasked with simultaneously cutting off Allied supplies and capturing nuclear technology for themselves to crush the last remaining opposition to Axis world domination. By attacking America from both sides at once, coordination and decisive action is a must!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AMERIKA also introduces veteran game players to a variety of new units like jet fighters and self-propelled anti-aircraft guns, while keeping each unit type&amp;rsquo;s rules easy enough for beginners to master. With just 8 unit types in the game, purchasing and combat move fast and are resolved simply using a battle board. All 8 unit-types are unique to this game and cannot be found elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
