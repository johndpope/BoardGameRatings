			<description>from the game website:&lt;br/&gt;Some came to answer the call of the hero; that inner voice that speaks of chivalry, altruism, and goodness. Others, t'was the search for knowledge or power that brought them here. Darkness and blood are the coin of some, souls steeped in deeds too terrible for the light of day. Still others, lost to the mists of time, find themselves as strangers in an even stranger land. All, however, have one single thing in common; they now walk the lands called the Waypoint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
