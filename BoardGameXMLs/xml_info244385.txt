							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tank War (1983)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your opponent watches closely as the battlefield unfolds, and you both carefully plan strategies for the pending conflict.  Suddenly, both laser tanks fire to initiate movement.  You begin to thread the way through your home territory, avoiding obstructions and buildings, as you proceed toward enemy ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outscore the rival tank by destroying enemy buildings as well as placing direct hits on your opponent during one-to-one combat.  Higher skill levels will add additional targets, mountain ranges, and landmines to the battle zone for increasing excitement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;one of three skill levels, with a new battlefield created for each game, provides a new challenge for both players every time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tank War may be played using your VIC-20 keyboard or paddles, and will work on all standard VIC-20 memory configurations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
