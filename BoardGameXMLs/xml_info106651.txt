			<description>Burning Force (バーニングフォース) is a shoot 'em up arcade game that was originally released by Namco in 1989 only in Japan. It runs on Namco System 2 hardware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a cadet named Hiromi Tengenji, who as part of her final training she battles high-tech enemies on a futuristic motor scooter. Hiromi Tengenji's most recent appearance in the gaming world has been in Namco X Capcom, where she is partnered with Toby Masuyo from her own game, Baraduke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is similar to Space Harrier, though the levels are divided in four sections and there is no vertical mobility making the game different in its own right. In the first two sections the player controls Hiromi on the scooter, which can move to the left and right, as well as braking and accelerating. The scooter can also shoot the standard bullets and missiles. The third section is a boss level, and the vehicle is in this case a flying ship which can move in all directions. The fourth section is a bonus stage, and the player has to collect as many numbered balls as possible for bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Burning Force&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
