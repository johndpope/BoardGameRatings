			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Cavalry is coming!&amp;quot; And the cavalry is 55 of the most powerful war machines ever built.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BattleTech Reinforcements provides completed record sheets for all the primary BattleMechs of BattleTech Technical Readout 3025. From the 20-ton LCT-1V Locust to the 100-ton AS7-D Atlas, Reinforcements has your record sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These record sheets were issued twice, despite being obsolete on re-issue because of the changes in how BattleMechs were constructed. They're also fairly lightweight, as they only cover the primary variants of those 'Mechs listed in the BattleTech Technical Readout: 3025, something that would change with future record sheet packs. The artwork on the cover's nice, though.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
