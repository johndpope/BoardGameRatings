			<description>For this expansion, a new meeple is added: a black camel. During the game, the owner of this camel is known as the Caravan Leader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, the black camel is placed on the Caravansery (6); it does not have an owner at this point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you execute the action in the Caravansery, take the black camel at the end of your turn and put it in front of you; you are now the Caravan Leader. You remain the Caravan Leader until another player executes the action in the Caravansery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are already the Caravan Leader before you execute the action in the Caravansery, you receive the bonus of the Caravan Leader: After taking 2 bonus cards, you don&amp;acute;t discard any cards from your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
