			<description>&lt;br/&gt;This is a game about a five year mission, a world where special effects never progressed beyond painted Styrofoam blocks and cheap double-exposures. The 70's were still The Future and Klingons had smooth foreheads. The idea of a Star Trek movie was a laughable proposition and nobody thought twice about planets full of Nazis and space hippies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventures take place in Episodes, over the course of a Season. If you're comfortable with the Shatnerian school of acting, can spontaneously hum snippets of the original soundtrack during appropriate scenes and have no problem with outrageous accents, this is the place for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this game is to create something relatively quick and dirty, simple to set up and fast to run, using the Microlite20 system for accessibility and to allow access to the vast amount of pregenerated d20 content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
