			<description>All About Town: The Game of the Racine Area is a localized monopoly clone where the players move around a board trying to acquire 8 travel cards while stopping at popular locations in the Racine, Wisconsin area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player&amp;rsquo;s pawns, money, game territories, travel cards and surprise cards all contain advertisement from local area business.  The box also contains 2 sheets of 12 coupons for free goods and services from local businesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The layout of the game board and other game components could easily be changed for any other city that wanted their own board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In fact, the family on the cover is playing the game on a board with a completely different design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
