							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Adventure Shorts, Volume Two</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What if while planning a route to their next objective your player characters discover another route that they&amp;rsquo;re told will save them a day&amp;rsquo;s travel time? Would they take it? They might have a pleasant walk through a little-traveled area of the woods, or they might discover the Cult of Myrkul waiting for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure shorts volume two contains two encounters, written for fifth edition of the world's most popular roleplaying game. The first encounter, Shortcut, can be played as a stand-alone or as a lead-in to the second more detailed encounter, Obsidian Temple. We&amp;rsquo;re trying something new this time by providing balanced encounters and treasure for a party of five characters from levels two through five. If played together the encounters are expected to last for about a two or three-hour gaming session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in Adventure Shorts Volume One, these encounters include enemy NPCs, monsters, traps, obstacles and treasure to challenge your players&amp;rsquo; fifth edition characters. Along with each encounter is a map that can be used to set up your own player grid. The encounter titles are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Shortcut&lt;br/&gt;    Obsidian Temple&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
