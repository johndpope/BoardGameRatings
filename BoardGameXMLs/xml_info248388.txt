			<description>2 or 4 players play the soccer game. All other players are betting on the outcome of the game, using the Toto-slip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pawns are placed on the spaces marked with an &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;. Movement is only forward and is determined by the roll of a die. No pawn may land on a red space. A goal is achieved by entering the opposite goal with a pawn. If a pawn gets on a space that is occupied by an opposite pawn, the opposite pawn is taken from the board. It may reenter the game on an &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;-space by the roll of a 6. If a 6 isn't used to bring back a pawn, it can be used to move a pawn and roll again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends, when there is no pawn left on the playing field. The team with the most pawns in the opposite goal wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
