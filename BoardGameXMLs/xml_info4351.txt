							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Global Summit: The Peace Game</name>
									
			<description>Cooperative card game in which the players represent nations at an international summit pledging economic, political, and social resources to ward off threats to world peace. There are 66 Resource cards of the three varieties in various denominations, 24 Domestic Event cards, and 18 Chaos cards. A game turn consists of drawing Domestic Event cards (which cause Resources to be drawn, discarded, or redistributed), turning over a Chaos card (which threatens the peace and requires an amount of a certain type of Resource to avert), and either passing the Chaos card to the next round or collectively playing Resource cards that total the amount required by the Chaos card in order to neutralize it. If, in ten turns, ten Chaos cards can be neutralized *and* each nation has total resource points equal to or greater than it started with, the players win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was the first and possibly only one produced (in a limited edition of 500) by Pittsburgh-based Borderland Games, whose name and house logo were derived from the classic fantasy novel &amp;quot;The House on the Borderland&amp;quot; by William Hope Hodgson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
