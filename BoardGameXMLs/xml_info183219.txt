			<description>From the box: &amp;quot;Practice number recognition and basic addition with this fun apple-picking game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Apple Addition, each player uses a two-sided card shaped like an apple tree.  There are two way to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Level 1 - Pick &amp;amp; Match Apples:  Each player takes an apple tree card showing several numbers.  Players then take turns randomly choosing an apple marker from the box.  Each marker shows a number of apple seeds.  The player must correctly count the seeds and then, if it matches a number on their card, place it over the number.  The marker is then flipped.  If the player counted correctly and the number matches, the marker stays on the card.  If the number does not match one on the player's card or the player counts wrong, the marker goes back in the box.  If the player draws an apple with a worm, he or she must put an apple from his tree back on the box.  An apple core causes loss of a turn.  First player to cover all the numbers on his or her tree wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Level 2 - Apple Addition: Each tree displays three addition problems.  The game is played by the same rules.  The first player to find the answers to all three math problems wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
