							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood Money</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood Money was, when released, probably the hottest arcade shooter around. The Amiga release cosisted of two 3.5&amp;quot; disks, of which the first only contained the opening sequence and catchy music, which featured a tagline: &amp;quot;the biggest unanswered question is 'where is the money?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play&lt;br/&gt;Upon starting, the player had access to two worlds: a metal world in which he would steer a helicopter and a water world in which he operated a submarine. The game was a scrolling shooter, and scrolling was bothhorizontally and vertically. The player had to shoot his way through, earning money with each kill. However, contact with boogies costed energy, or sometimes they would plainly steal some equipment. In between worlds, the player could use his blood money to purchase new equipment (better weapons etc) to face the challenge of the next world. Besides water and metal, there was a fire world (jet fighter) and an ice world (space suit astronaut).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
