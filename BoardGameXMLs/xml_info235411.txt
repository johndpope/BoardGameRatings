			<description>Ekklesia is a variant of Careers. The players set their own victory conditions. A player may choose to pursue faith, love, joy or a combination of all three. The total number of &amp;quot;points&amp;quot; earned in the 3 categories must total 50. Money is only a means to achieve these goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players move their pawns arrond the board. Movement is determined by a die. Some spaces events influence the players movement, gains them money or cause them to spend money. Other spaces cause the players to draw a card and follow the instructions printed there. The players try to fulfill their goal by going through any number of different detours. On finishing a detour, the player gets a movement card, that he may use instead of rolling the die at a time of his own choosing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who gets to his pre-set goal first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
