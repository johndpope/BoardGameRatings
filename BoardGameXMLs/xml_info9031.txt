							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wildstorm: Set 1</name>
									
			<description>Wildstorm Chromium Set One is the first card set published by the newly created Wildstorm Cards. It hit the stores in 1994. The set comprised of 100 chromium cards, 9 refractor cards and 15 autographed cards.  It features artwork from Wildstorms fledgling artists including Jim Lee, Scott Clark, J. Scott Campbell and Brett Booth among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The flip side includes details of Wildstorms main heroes and villains, and included a set of 10 stats per character which can be used to play a game. This game is currently available for play on gatling Engine. The adaptation features both the chromium front of the cards and the flip side with the stats with a customized card back based on the Set One logo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stats featured on Wildstorm: Set One eventually evolved into the popular Wildstorm Collectible Card Game. Although published by the same company, these two games are not compatible with each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     CCG Workshop (no longer available)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
