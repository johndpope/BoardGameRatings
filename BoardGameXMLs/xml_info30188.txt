							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Harpoon, The Real Whale Hunt Game</name>
									
			<description>The gameboard is a thirty-six by thirty-six grid that represents a large body of water. The grid is divided into four quadrants. The players start with a small whale boat that is placed inside an individual&amp;rsquo;s factory ship. Each player places one&amp;rsquo;s own factory ship at an individual start space at the edge of one&amp;rsquo;s own quadrant. One of the whales is placed on one the four spaces in the center of the gameboard. Players, in turn, move their factory ships according to the number indicated on the spinner. If spinner points to a picture of a whale, then the whale moves according the number on its spinner. A player must separate the whale boat from the factory ship when the whale and the factory ship are in the same quadrant. Whale boats have their own spinner and they move slower that do the factory ships. When the whale boat and the whale are on the same space, the whale has been harpooned and the player scores a point for killing the whale. The whale boat must be moved back into the factory boat and another whale is brought into play. The last whale brought into play is white and it is worth two points. The player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
