			<description>Subtitle: An Adventure Campaign for Supers! The Comic Book RPG&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Multiverse is in danger of being destroyed, again, when an Errant Mystical Avatar rampages across time and space in a mad fit of rage. Your players must pursue him across time in such notable periods as the Time of Abraham Lincoln, The Arrival of the the Most Famous Space Man in All Comic Book History, and The King James Jesus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only do that have to pursue the Mystical Avatar through these time periods, but they may just have to figure out how to put things back together, if they want. What the results of all this meddling in the Multiverse will do, is up to you, but no doubt it will be a rollicking good time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was designed for the rules presented in the Supers! the Comic Book RPG from Simon Washbourne, but you could just take the story and apply any mechanics if you want, I won't care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
