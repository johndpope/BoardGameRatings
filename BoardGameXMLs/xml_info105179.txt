			<description>Open End is a communication game about newspaper headlines. At the start of each round, a partial headline is given, and each player guesses in which newspaper category the headline belongs: literature, feuilleton, media, business, travel, science, panorama, politics or sport? After a consensus has been reached, the first points are awarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players then continue with each of them writing an ending for the partial headline. One of the players, the reader, collects the sentences and reads them all aloud. The players then vote for their favourite sentences, which awards points to the creators of those sentences. More points will go to the most compelling answer than to the correct answer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
