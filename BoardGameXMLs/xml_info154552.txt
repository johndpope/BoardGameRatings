							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Police Precinct: The Kit</name>
									
			<description>The Kit is a collection of Expansionary items for Police Precinct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There have been several variations of &amp;quot;The Kit&amp;quot; over the years.  The original Kit was designed for owners of the 1st Edition, then came one that focused on the needs of the 2nd Edition owners, and several versions have come since.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically the Kit grows with each new expansionary item that is released (as it is added to the package).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FULL MONTY:&lt;br/&gt;Another type of Kit came out in early 2016 known as &amp;quot;The Full Monty&amp;quot;.  This one was (and still is) designed to help owners of the 1st Edition to Upgrade toward the 2nd Edition by swapping-out certain components:&lt;br/&gt;The board (This is the 2nd Edition Board which includes The Unterbelly)&lt;br/&gt;All of the Characters (This is the 2nd Edition Character array which includes 8 new characters and perfect gender balance)&lt;br/&gt;All of the cards (both the larger cards and smaller, including the very popular 2nd Edition Event Deck)&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook (The book supplied with The Full Monty is the Revised 1st Edition Rulebook which was the inspiration and template for the 2nd Edition book)&lt;br/&gt;As an added bonus, the Full Monty also includes a copy of Crooked Lawyers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STILL IN PRINT:&lt;br/&gt;To see the versions of &amp;quot;The Kit&amp;quot; that are still in print from Common Man Games, visit the CMG website.  Specifically this page...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.commonman.com/2e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.commonman.com/2e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EARLY VERSIONS:&lt;br/&gt;Looking back in time, here are the first two versions of the Kit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1st Edition Kit INCLUDES:&lt;br/&gt;The Heat (mini-expansion)&lt;br/&gt;Rioting Gangs (Booster-Pack)&lt;br/&gt;Mad Men 5-Pack (Booster-Pack, minus one card of the original 6-pack)&lt;br/&gt;Promo Cards (Rocket Launcher &amp;amp; Dirty Bomb)&lt;br/&gt;And...&lt;br/&gt;The Revised Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2nd Edition Kit INCLUDES:&lt;br/&gt;The Heat (mini-expansion)&lt;br/&gt;Rioting Gangs (Booster-Pack)&lt;br/&gt;Mad Men 5-Pack (Booster-Pack, minus one card of the original 6-pack)&lt;br/&gt;Promo Cards (Rocket Launcher &amp;amp; Dirty Bomb)&lt;br/&gt;This Kit is exactly like the 1st Edition Kit except that it does NOT have a Revised Rulebook (because the 2nd Edition will come stocked with the 2nd Edition rulebook).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Anyone who owns Police Precinct should own the Kit too!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
