			<description>Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment Road to Recovery contains one playing board, one die, 36 cards, six player tokens and 30 department cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the Game Players must collect 4 department cards(3 of which must be Admitting, Dietary and Operating Room) by having landed in each of the department spaces. The play then proceeds to the Business Office for check out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start of Play Each player selects a token. Players roll the die, with the player rolling the highest number moving first. If two or more players tie, they roll again. The player with the first turn rolls the die again and, starting from the Start Space, moves the token the indicated number of spaces. The move will end on a department space or a situation space. When a token lands on a department space, the player collects that specific department card. If the player lands on a situational space, they follow the directions on that space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With each die roll, a move can be made in either direction around the playing path. Backtracking--a combination of forward and backward moves on one die roll-- is not permitted. A player must always move the number of spaces shown on the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continuation of Play Play continues with players moving the tokens along the playing path. A player landing in one of the &amp;quot;Roll again&amp;quot; spaces continues the turn by rolling the die again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a token lands on a space occupied by another players token, the player landing may &amp;quot;steal&amp;quot; any one of that players department cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a token lands on a &amp;quot;Pick a Card&amp;quot; space, they must pull the top card from the Card pile and follow the directions on that card. After play, the card is returned to the bottom of the pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning the Game After a player has collected the required department cards, the player's token must make its way to the Business Office to win the game. The token must land in the Business office space by exact roll of the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
