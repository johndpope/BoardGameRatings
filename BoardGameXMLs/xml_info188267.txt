							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Erinyes and Horned Devils</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Worst Hell Has To Offer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The erinyes and the horned devil are perhaps the most terrifying and iconic devils, representing both the fallen angel, in the form of the cruel and torturous erinyes, and the classic devilish imagery of a bat-winged, horned, oversized muscular humanoid, in the form of the chained devil. Despite this, neither of these two great infernal warriors received any mythic treatment in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Mythic Adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents game statistics for the mythic erinyes (CR 10), which projects an aura of truth that painfully punishes all those who lie within its presence, can keep victims alive long after they should be dead, and can even torture a creature so thoroughly that if it returns to life after being killed by the mythic erinyes, it does her bidding. It also presents statistics for the mythic horned devil (CR 20). These fiends can wrap their spiked chains around a victim&amp;rsquo;s throat, using the chain like a leash to magically control their victim. Their chain can also rend a victim&amp;rsquo;s very soul, along with its body, and much, much more. Finally, the book includes detailed summoning rituals that allow characters of any class to summon mythic erinyes and mythic horned devils, at their own peril.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
