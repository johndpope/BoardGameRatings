			<description>In Paws 'N Claws, your goal is to work your way from the outermost track of the playing board to the inner areas, eventually entering the judging and placing first in the show. Along the way you must demonstrate your breeding and training by correctly answering questions about dogs and cats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three categories and two levels of questions, which are determined by the roll of the dog and cat dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also the possibility you will have to bark or meow or make some other noise or gesture by drawing Claw or Paw cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a bit tricky but careful observation and maneuvering will solve it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
