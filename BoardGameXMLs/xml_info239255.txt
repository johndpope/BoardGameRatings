							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eye of the Sun Episode IV: An Uneasy Peace</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eye of the Sun Trilogy presented the story of the Metatheran Cartel, and of the emergent heroes of Cularin. Faced with a threat to their way of life, the citizens responded with gusto, taking risks they had never dreamed of before. This galaxy far, far away suddenly seemed very different to its inhabitants. If the Cartel &amp;ndash; who had seemed somewhat slimy, if relatively harmless, before &amp;ndash; could offer such a meaningful threat, then what might the rest of the world be hiding?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our story opens two days after the events of LFA103: Eye of the Sun Episode III: Revelation and Refutation. The celebration of Cularin&amp;rsquo;s 200th anniversary was disrupted by Velin Wir&amp;rsquo;s announcement that the Cartel would be making its presence more known in Cularin. Now, the celebration resumes, and all the heroes who assisted in the ousting of the Cartel from Cularin proper are in attendance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario may not be complete as released; probably it is a partial recreation of the original interactive event performed (at least in part) after the fact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
