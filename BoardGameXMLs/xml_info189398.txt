							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Panzer Grenadier: Iron Curtain – Maple Leaf Brigade</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1951, Canada created a brigade to serve as its contribution to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization&amp;rsquo;s defense of West Germany against potential Soviet aggression. Initially designated as the 27th Infantry Brigade, the unit would go through a number of re-namings and re-structurings over the years that followed until the withdrawal of Canadian troops from Germany in 1993.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Composed of long-service volunteers rather than the conscripts who manned other NATO formations, the Canadian Brigade set a standard for excellence in the Alliance&amp;rsquo;s ground forces, and would eventually be assigned a &amp;ldquo;fire brigade&amp;rdquo; role in planning for a potential ground war against the Soviet Union.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron Curtain - Maple Leaf Brigade introduces the Canadian Army to Panzer Grenadier. It&amp;rsquo;s part of our Iron Curtain setting, looking at a Cold War turned hot in the early 1950&amp;rsquo;s. There are 88 new playing pieces showing the Canadian Brigade in its configuration of that era, with a complete armored regiment and a small helicopter squadron as well as its tough infantry. Plus you get a set of 10 scenarios to use them (that&amp;rsquo;s as many as some publishers will give you in what they call a &amp;ldquo;complete&amp;rdquo; boxed game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron Curtain - Maple Leaf Brigade is a supplement for Panzer Grenadier: Elsenborn Ridge. It is not a complete game: ownership of Elsenborn Ridge, Iron Curtain - Hammer &amp;amp; Sickle and Road to Berlin is necessary to play all of the 10 scenarios included. Iron Curtain - Maple Leaf Brigade also includes 88 laser-cut and mounted playing pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
