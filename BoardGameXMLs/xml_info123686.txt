			<description>From the website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Farm. Fences. Folds. Friends. Fun!&lt;br/&gt;Baa! is very cute triangle-tile-based board game which is originally designed, illustrated, manufactured and published by Joshua Chao on June 15th, 2011.&lt;br/&gt;Players explore the farm and place their fences on it to create folds as the game progresses. The more sheep a player can have, the more score a player can get. But not so easy...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay in short:&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn he places a triangular tile (farm) from his hand connected to tiles already on the table first to create a landscape. After that he places a fence  on the connecting side of to farms to hurd sheep optionally. Fences cannot be placed next to trees. Taking a new farm from the stack ends his turn and the next player is on.&lt;br/&gt;If an area is completely surrounded with fences regardsless of colour (a fold) after playing a fence scoring is forced. A fold must contain at least one sheep and a shed and cannot cannot contain empty spaces. Sheep are owned by the player with the most fences alongside the fold (draws are possible). Whites get you 3 points, grays 2 and blacks 1. Sheep next to a fruit bush earn you 1 bonus point.&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when a player has used all his fences or when the stack of farms is depleted. Player with the most point in total wins. Draws are decided by the amount of fences left in a player's hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
