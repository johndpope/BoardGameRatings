							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mysterious Castle</name>
									
			<description>Mysterious Castle is a retro stylized game that blends together elements of roguelike games (such as Zangband, Dungeons of Dredmor, Diablo), along with tactics games (such as Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre). This tactics-roguelike combines a randomly generated sprawling world, with fierce turn based combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Select a party of characters and pit them against a procedurally generated world made up of treacherous forests, caves and, of course, mysterious castles! Turn based combat based on (but not limited by) the award winning and ubiquitous SRD 3.5 standard provides endless tactical possibilities, as you go up against parties of Orcs, Undead, Dark Elves, Demons and more! Collect amazing items to wield in battle, study old tomes to increase your skills, and gather mushrooms to brew into powerful spells. An incredibly minimal interface devoid of the clutter so common to roguelikes lets you perform both simple and complex actions with ease. Lighthearted coffee-break combat or meticulous powergaming, the choice is yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
