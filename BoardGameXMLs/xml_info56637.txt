			<description>[From the back of the book]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Live Fast&lt;br/&gt;In the Big Apple, New York City, the most exciting place on earth. The city that never sleeps, packed with more places to go, more things to do, and more people to feed on than anywhere else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Live Free&lt;br/&gt;Above the law, above society, above everyone's judgement but your own. You are the ultimate predator. Intelligence combined with powers far beyond that of normal humans means you can go where you want, do what you want, and answer to nobody.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Live Forever&lt;br/&gt;You'll never grow old, and you'll never die. Night after night, year after year, decade after decade. You'll watch normal human lives flit by in an eyeblink. That is, unless you run afoul of an enemy, and you've got plenty of those. All of humanity would destroy you if they knew what you were. Monstrous beings, worse than any possible nightmare, will hunt you as prey. And the most deadly foe is your own Kin, the other immortal beings who, like you, pose as human while they live the . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NightLife&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
