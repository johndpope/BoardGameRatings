			<description>Yes, you are an Archer! You have sharp eyes and a steady hand. Distance is your ally and few can avoid your deadly shots. If you can see the target you can hit it. You have many targets to choose from; it is now just a matter of which one to start with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Archer brings 8 unique cards and introduces the full set of Aim cards to Sen So.  If you like ranged combat and keeping your foes on there toes, the Archer is perfect for you.  The Archer is a single player set that can be played against any of the Sen So variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sen So game system uses a unique set of octagon cards and card holders. Players have to set (program) actions before their current action is revealed. All players reveal actions together. This provides fast play for even large numbers of players. Game scoring provides balance and keeps the leaders on their toes. Players are required to choose their weapons and abilities for each battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
