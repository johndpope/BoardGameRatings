			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to my conversion of the Street Fighter setting, using the incredible, ass-kicking, fu-power slinging Feng Shui rules. Within these pages, you will find everything you need to create a campaign of street fighters using the Feng Shui rules. Special rules for fighting styles, rankings on the street-fighting circuit, and stats for the sixteen legendary World Warriors. Also included are rules to make Feng Shui feel more like Street Fighter: light and heavy punches and kicks, dizzies, and tournament street fights where the guy goes down, shakes it off, and gets back up for &amp;quot;Round Two! Fight!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve avoided filling in backstory here. There are at least three variant takes on the story of Ryu, Ken and the other World Warriors, not including the movie (because nobody ever does, really). Each has its good points, and each has its own variations of style. With Feng Shui for backup, coming up with nefarious plans for Shadoloo should be a snap, and really, between that and an endless series of tournaments, challenges and grudge matches, you&amp;rsquo;ve got a kick-ass game of Street Fighter covered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You won&amp;rsquo;t find the Feng Shui rules in here. It&amp;rsquo;s a perfectly good book, part of a perfectly good system, and if you don&amp;rsquo;t already have it, go out and buy it! If you care enough to find a fan-written Street Fighter game, I can virtually guarantee that you will find something to love in Feng Shui.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game owes a massive debt of gratitude to White Wolf&amp;rsquo;s original Street Fighter Storytelling game. While it&amp;rsquo;s more than a bit dated, and has its moments of frustration and clunkiness, it&amp;rsquo;s still a wonderfully energetic and focused attempt to take on this larger-than-life world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
