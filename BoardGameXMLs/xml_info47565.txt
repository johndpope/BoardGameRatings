							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Children of the Atom</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homo Sapiens Superior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stinking muties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blessed and cursed with super-human abilities, the ranks of mutantkind are constantly growing, constantly expanding.  An apprehensive world holds them at arms' length, wary and suspicious of the unknown.  An uncomfortable air of mistrust clouds their dealings with normal men, and an even more sinister air of hatred hangs over the dark places in men's hearts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only through understanding can humanity pierce this murky veil that separates men from mutants.  Knowledge drives away the fear of the unknown.  And so, TSR proudly presents Children of the Atom, the complete, up-to-date guidebook to homo sapiens superior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Acanti to Wolverine, from the Alliance of Evil to the X-Men, every significant mutant and mutant group known is described in detail. A bonus short adventure, Dreamdchild, is also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most far-reaching revolution in history is taking place in our genes.  To survive, we must understand the children of the atom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Children of the Atom consists of a 96-page roster book and a 10 1/2&amp;quot; x 15&amp;quot; pull-out map.  This game accessory is designed for use with the MARVEL SUPER HEROES Advanced Set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
