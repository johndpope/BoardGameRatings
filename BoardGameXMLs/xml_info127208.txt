			<description>Bluffjack is a hybrid of poker and blackjack.  It borrows the bluffing and betting against other players from poker, and the trying to get close to 21 without going over from Blackjack (21).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players are dealt one card face down, and one card face up, and players wager.  Then players get cards, and try to get close to 21.  After this players will engage in another round of betting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bluffjack offers the chance for players to win if a player went over 21 and everyone else folded.  However, if all players remaining players went over 21, everyone loses, and their best are set aside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
