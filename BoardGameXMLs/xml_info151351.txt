			<description>&amp;quot;Znamenitost&amp;quot; means Celebrity in Russian. It's a quiz game with a unique mechanic that provides infinite questions, and you don't need a game master to play it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 different kinds of decks (24 cards per deck, 96 total).&lt;br/&gt;1. Facts: each card represents a fact from a biography (for example, &amp;quot;She wrote a book&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Something is named after her&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;She was imprisoned&amp;quot;, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;2. Professions, such as &amp;quot;politician&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;actor&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;soldier&amp;quot;, etc.&lt;br/&gt;3. Alphabet: each card is a letter, which should be the first letter of someone's name, surname, pseudonym, or nick name.&lt;br/&gt;4. Countries, such as &amp;quot;USA&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Germany&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Russia&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round one of the players chooses a deck, reveals the top card and reads its text aloud. Then everybody tries to name a famous person that matches the task of the card. The fastest player reveals the top card of one of the remaining decks, and now the players try to name the person who matches two criteria, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, if the cards &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;She wrote a book&amp;quot; were revealed, it's possible to name Julius Caesar, Winston Churchill, Clive Barker, or any other person with the first &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; in his/her name (or surname, or nickname) and known as an author. If nobody could name a person after the next card was revealed, than the player who had correctly named the previous person wins a round. You cannot reveal more than 4 cards (one per deck): if someone has managed to name a person with 4 cards, he wins that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played till one of the decks is depleted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;96 cards (24 per deck)&lt;br/&gt;2 blank cards for your own tasks&lt;br/&gt;rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
