			<description>From the Publisher's Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This futuristic world features flying cars, friendly robots, and inhabitants that live in tall cities of glass and steel. Atomic City is a large city brimming with growth and potential. However, corruption has spawned, and it's up you and the Vehicular Strike Force to clean up the city. You will take on the role of Agent Pam Rodgers, a new agent within the Vehicular Strike Force. Atomic City Adventures - The Case of the Black Dragon will put you through a series of missions in which you battle evil robots, corrupt corporations, and criminal masterminds. You start the game on foot and hoverbikes, but you will eventually progress to full-blown flying jetbikes, battling villains both on the ground and in the air. In each mission, you will discover new weapons for yourself and your vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
