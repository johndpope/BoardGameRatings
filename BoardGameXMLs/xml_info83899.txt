			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a lean and quick Role-Playing Game. It's heavy on collaborative storytelling and very light on rules. Like the film style it takes its name from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cinema V&amp;eacute;rit&amp;eacute; the Game is missing a lot of the trappings of its older, more complex siblings. There is no thick omnibus of powers or setting information. There are no charts, weight tables, or extensive lists of weapons and gear. Enough about what the game doesn&amp;rsquo;t have, what it does have is a task resolution that requires only a pair of 6-sided dice that can be found damn near anywhere. It has extreme versatility; capable of adjusting to any setting or trope you care to stick to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is also very mobile. The film style the game takes its name from is able to move to locales normal film productions just can't. Hollywood requires hundreds of people and tons of equipment and props to get a set ready for filming. CinemaV&amp;eacute;rit&amp;eacute; is able to tell its story with a single shoulder camera and small sound rig. This game shares that same portability. All you have to do is grab a pair of six-siders, some scratch paper and a pencil or two and you can set up a game anywhere. You might want to bring along a couple of friends as well, or else you'll find yourself in a corner booth at your local diner talking to yourself. No one really wants that kind of attention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
