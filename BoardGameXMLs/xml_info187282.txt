							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fall Gelb</name>
									
			<description>(from the introduction:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fall Gelb is a simulation of the campaign between the Axis and the Western Allies in Europe in 1940. It consists of amalgamated components of Game Designer's Workshops Europa series of military simulations, including Fall of France, Their Finest Hour, Narvik and Spain and Portugal. It uses the current rule set from Fire In the East, with some modifications, plus completely new (unofficial and experimental) air, naval and political rules. It models the strategic and operational options open to the Wehrmacht as its focus turned to the Western Allies.&lt;br/&gt;They may choose to repeat historical options, or find a new and more successful strategy. The scenario opens with the German Army redeployed after the dlsmemberment of Poland. The OA for both sides is historically accurate for that period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fall Gelb is intended for use by Europa buffs who have wanted to get their hands on a simulation covering the campaign in the West using available Europa components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Rules (v1: 11 pages, v2: 23 pages)&lt;br/&gt;    Orders of battle (v1: 7 pages, v2: 16 pages)&lt;br/&gt;    Tables (v1&amp;amp;v2:1 page)&lt;br/&gt;    Ship status sheet (v1: 6 pages, v2: 7 pages)&lt;br/&gt;    Strategic display (v1: 2 pages, v2: 3pages)&lt;br/&gt;    Port chart (v1: 6 pages, v2: 7 pages)&lt;br/&gt;    Air Wing Display (v1&amp;amp;v2: 2 pages)&lt;br/&gt;    Task Force Composition Chart (3 pages)&lt;br/&gt;    Air Units Dummy  Sheets (v2 only: 2 pages)&lt;br/&gt;    Atlantic Chart (v1&amp;amp;v2: 2 pages)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
