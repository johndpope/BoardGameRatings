			<description>You're poised on the emerald pitch at Eden Park for the Final of Rugby World Cup 2011. It&amp;rsquo;s the dying moments of the game. The score is deadlocked and the crowd is screaming. The ball is passed out to the back line: the outcome hinges on what you do next!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five Men Standing is for both lovers of the glorious game, and those who have never held a Rugby ball in their hands. Fast paced, competitive, and with no sissy turn taking, this is a game of frantic action and fun! &lt;br/&gt; Each player controls a set of 5 Rugby players, drawn from 2 of the teams competing in the 2011 Tournament. How you manipulate, position, and toss these players will determine the ultimate victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--- How To Play ---&lt;br/&gt; Each player takes a team of five Rugby player figures in their hand, then yells:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Touch! Players cup their figures in both hands, then reach out and bump hands with their opponent&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br/&gt;Pause! Players withdraw hands from their opponent&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br/&gt;Engage! Players release their figures onto the playing surface&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The figures will bounce around and land in one of four stances, from best to worst: Standing, On Side, On Back, Face Down in the mud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your aim is to yell Stop! when you think you have a combination that will beat your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your first throw wasn&amp;rsquo;t great, don&amp;rsquo;t just sit there moping. This isn&amp;rsquo;t your grandma&amp;rsquo;s tiddly winks, this is Five Men Standing Rugby! Speed and skill count, so grab the figures you want to throw again and see if you can improve your combo. Just remember, you can&amp;rsquo;t pick up figures that are Face-Down in the mud. Those blokes are out of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And be fast, because your opponent will be doing the same and might yell Stop! first...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combos are based on Poker, with a couple of twists, and are ranked on the provided Score Board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you win a round, you take a Rugby ball token. When they're gone, the player with the most tokens wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's also Advanced Scoring Rules for Legends, solitaire rules, and you can add more players by buying more Country Team Packs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
