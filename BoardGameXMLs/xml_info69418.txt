			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;The second installment in Yu Suzuki's Shenmue series, this game is a direct continuation of the story in the first Shenmue game, and contains chapter 2 to 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the immense critical acclaim the first game had received in the west, the sales in Japan were poor and Shenmue II sold very badly in Japan. As the game was slightly more successful in the West, the game was ported to Xbox in Europe and America only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translated box back:&lt;br/&gt;Shenmue, to a different region&lt;br/&gt;More than 1000 characters, vast fields, and an impressive world scale to see for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;Contains movies of famous scenes from Shenmue I &amp;ndash; fully playable for those who have yet to play Shenmue I.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;English box back:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Epic Quest in a Modern World&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seeking answers and vengeance, Ryo Hazuki arrives in the bustling metropolis of Hong Kong.
