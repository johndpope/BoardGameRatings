							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mark of Heroes Campaign Cards Promo Set</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This card set was offered to participants in any Mark of Heroes organized play event, but cards were available only in person at certain &amp;quot;kick off&amp;quot; play conventions (Gen Con or Winter Fantasy).  Advertised as a &amp;quot;set&amp;quot;, the cards were available one at a time.  Cards could be &amp;quot;played&amp;quot;, as noted on the card itself, to gain some advantage in the organized play program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Promo set included seven cards from 2004:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Heir of Trace or Rune&lt;br/&gt;        Heir of Life of Dusk&lt;br/&gt;        Heir of Welcome and Watch&lt;br/&gt;        Heir of Gust and Path&lt;br/&gt;        Heir of Beast and Blade&lt;br/&gt;        Heir of Forge and Sigil&lt;br/&gt;        Bane of My Enemies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
