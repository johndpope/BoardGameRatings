							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Norsaga: Kickstarter Promos</name>
									
			<description>Four cards that expand Norsaga: Odds and Endings from the associated Kickstarter campaign:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Immortal - Guardian: Thrice-Woke Omhar&lt;br/&gt;Immortal - Guardian: Ulwilda Fading&lt;br/&gt;Immortal - Guardian: Agmind the Intrepid&lt;br/&gt;Immortal - Guardian: Soul-Catcher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Immortals -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These special double-sided heroes form their own deck, and one is dealt to each player at the start of the game. Before you can call on your immortal, you have to unlock them by proving your lineage. Spare inheritance markers are used to track progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a hero of the appropriate color is added to your family tree, you advance the marker. Reach the top of the track and the immortal flips to their unlocked side!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlocked immortals have varying abilities. Guardians can be moved onto your existing heroes at the start of your turn, altering their traits. Watchers remain on the sidelines but provide free first-generation embellishments every other turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, the inheritance marker from your unlocked immortal is swapped into your saga, giving you greater flexibility towards completing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
