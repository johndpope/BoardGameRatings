			<description>website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;A solitaire adventure for low level humanoid characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you know how to fight? Or could a goblin girl with a trident take you down? Find out when you visit the Shadowhand Battle School on Trollworld in this solo adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This is a short adventure for any humanoid character who uses a melee weapon like a sword. You are not allowed to use a missile weapon in this adventure. It is written for Tunnels and Trolls 7.5 edition, but may be used with any edition of the rules. You may need a rulebook, paper, dice, and your character sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even the best of warriors require training--in fact, the best warriors are constantly training and retraining themselves. In the western lands of the Dragon continent on Trollworld, it is known that the best training can be gained in the schools run by the legendary Shadowhand Brotherhood. Even the Death Commandos of the Goddess are happy to train in a Shadowhand academy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have been offered one free lesson at the local training school. You bring your weapons and armor and arrive early in the morning to see the Headmaster. The lesson you get this morning will be free, but in the future you may wish to bring some gold along in order to pay for further training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
