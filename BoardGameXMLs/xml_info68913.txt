			<description>The game board depicts a colorful spiral. Each of the six colors has six base fields from which a spiral &amp;quot;arm&amp;quot; leads to the center of the board. The colors don't &amp;quot;belong&amp;quot; to any player. Instead, any player can use playing pieces in any color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two rule sets included: &lt;br/&gt;In the &amp;quot;dice game&amp;quot;, players take turns rolling four dice. With the results, they can put playing pieces on free spaces in the spiral. One die can be used to jump over another piece which is then returned to its base. When a player has occupied certain positions, he/she is awarded a number of scoring chips. The player with most chips at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;board game&amp;quot; is a push your luck game. The pieces, which contain numbers from 1-6, are placed on their bases, face down. One piece of each color is flipped over and put on the corresponding position in that color's spiral. &lt;br/&gt;A player can now flip over pieces and move them into their position until he/she flips over a piece that is larger than a previously played piece in the same color. In that case, all pieces that were jumped over are moved back to their bases (behind the un-flipped pieces, in numerical order) and it's the next player's turn. The same scoring applies as in the dice game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN - corrections welcome. The rules aren't easy to understand)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
