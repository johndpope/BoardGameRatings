							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">I Spy Treasure Hunt</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out of all the I SPY games, this feels the closest to the book. They have used the same models, sometimes even the same shots and many locations are the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two mysteries to solve in Smuggler's Cove, namely, to find two treasures hidden by two different pirates. The player has to play I SPY riddles (find hidden objects) in order to collect map pieces. As usual, all found objects move on the screen and a noise - in this case, piratey or sea shanty type of music - is heard. When the player has collected enough pieces, they can assemble the map to get another riddle which leads them to the treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
