			<description>Elish Multiverso (Elish Multiverse)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Official Site&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This New Edition cut out every rule from the base manual, concentrating on the setting and the storytelling mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book starts the player to the world of Dima, his three empires, with their problems, their history and their politics. It gives a great deal of information about what are the philosophical and intellectual foundations of the many races that populate the world of Elish, their religions and what flows through these magical enchanted lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each page has lots of ideas, drawings and details to match up games or prepared at the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intent is to unleash the imagination and try not to restrain it with cold rules and tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Elish Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
