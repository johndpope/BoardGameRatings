							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Grand Illusionist&#039;s Delusion</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tome of Absence is a powerful spellbook of illusion magic. Many of the greatest illusionists throughout history possessed the tome, but most hid it someplace secret, died at the hands of a rival magician, or simply disappeared. The tome has a dark secret: it feeds on the spirit of its owner, using the  magician&amp;rsquo;s own life to fuel his or her illusions, eventually killing its master and trapping his or her soul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tome's previous owner, Albrecht Sparrowing, once lived in a mansion outside Dinton, but he disappeared thirty-five years ago. Looters have explored the mansion, but none have returned. For many years the mansion sat, dilapidated and ignored. Recently, the townsfolk of Dinton have noticed lights coming from the mansion and the worn-down exterior was restored to its former grandeur, seemingly overnight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 5th - 8th level characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
