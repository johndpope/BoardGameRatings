			<description>Sengoku Ace (戦国エース), also known as Samurai Aces, is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up arcade game released by Psikyo in 1993. It was the first game by Psikyo and was designed by Shin Nakamura, the creator of Aero Fighters (Sonic Wings) and the company's founder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The science fantasy story of Sengoku Ace resolves around the six Feudal Japan characters sent on a mission to stop an evil cult and rescue the shogun's kidnapped daughter, princess Tsukihime (Moon Princess), before she can be used as a sacrifice to resurrect their demon god. The game features 21 endings, different for various characters and 2-player pairings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sengoku Ace was followed by two sequels, Sengoku Blade: Sengoku Ace Episode II in 1996 and Sengoku Cannon: Sengoku Ace Episode III in 2004.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sengoku Ace&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
