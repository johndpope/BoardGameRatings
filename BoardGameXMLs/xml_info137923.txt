							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Get Blue with Mango-Force Battle Action!</name>
									
			<description>Get Blue is a kinetic, magnetic table-top game comprising of tiles and discs. A Starter Set has four tiles and five discs. Tiles have a magnet inside. Discs have a metal core. Players score points by spinning their discs, connecting to and knocking over a tile. If a disc connects to but does not knock over a tile, players loose points. The Red Tiles are worth one point. The Blue Tile is worth two points. The Flame Spinner is a double point disc. (Points are doubled if you capture or are reversed captured.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
