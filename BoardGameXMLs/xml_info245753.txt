							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Genesis: Battle of Champions â€“ Tactical Collectible Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Genesis is a Tactical Collectable Card Game, which combines concepts from collectable card games such as deck building, collecting, and rule text on the cards, along with familiar concepts of tactical games. The tactical aspects of the game come through the addition of the arena, a 5x6 board where the core of the game takes place on. You and your summons get to move around the arena each turn, and you may cast spells or attack your enemies based on the distance and the direction you are facing. Also, with alteration cards, players can actually change spots in the arena into walls, holes, or buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
