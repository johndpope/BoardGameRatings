							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Consetta and Her Wheel of Fate</name>
									
			<description>One player is familiar with the rules and acts as &amp;quot;Medium&amp;quot; and tells the fortunes of the other players, who must participate via various cards (there are several kinds, with numbers, symbols, and questions/answers) and their placement on an illustrated board that implements a kind of zodiac.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a fictional backstory of the Gypsy Princess Consetta of course, and the artwork of William Longyear is featured everywhere from the box cover to the instructions to the board and all the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
