							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">My Little Panzer</name>
									
			<description>My Little Panzer is included in issue #18 of the Dork Tower comic book. The background is that Ken (one of the characters) and the rest of his wargaming club have fallen asleep and are sharing a dream. In the dream, they are in the French countryside with cute little versions of World War II tanks running around shooting at things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls a wargamer who is trying to collect as many cute tanks as possible. The tanks are controlled by the player to the right of the active player, and can shoot at wargamers or at other tanks. The game ends when a wargamer collects one of every type of tank or when the wargamers wake up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optional rules allow for a campaign game, a mecha unit (the PanzerKampfer), and a version in which the players control the tanks and are actively trying to shoot everyone else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
