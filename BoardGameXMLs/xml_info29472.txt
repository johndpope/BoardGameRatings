							<name primary="true" sortindex="2">&quot;Trek&quot; The Road Map Game</name>
									
			<description>From the box:  TREK appeals to the wanderlust inherent in most Americans -- to &amp;quot;hit the road&amp;quot; and find out what lies over the hill or around the next bend; to see how the other fellow lives; and to just get away from it all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start the play, the players agree first on the TREK. It will usually start from the home town.  It can end anywhere.  If you live in the north, you may want to go to Florida and back. If you live in the east, you may want to go to the west coast and back.  The maps provided cover the entire United States on a scale so large that all but the smallest towns are shown.  They are the latest and most accurate maps that Rand McNally can provide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each may follow a different route or all may follow the same route, but success may depend on who selects the shortest and fastest route.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player spins the arrow on the spinning board at least on complete revolution and proceeds as directed, sticking his pin/auto into the map to mark his position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delays, accidents, and detours affect only the player involved.  Other players proceed according to their own directions as indicated by the luck of the spin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Really, directions are hardly necessary.  The game is so like a real TREK that once you get into the spirit of the thing and use the imagination, you will meet the emergencies as they arise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
