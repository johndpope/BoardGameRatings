			<description>From the introduction: &lt;br/&gt;You're on a road trip. You think you know what you want. But the other players know what you Really Need.&lt;br/&gt;It's a GM-less RPG where you make your own road movie in the vein of:&lt;br/&gt;    * The Sure Thing&lt;br/&gt;    * Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&lt;br/&gt;    * Fanboys&lt;br/&gt;    * Harold &amp;amp; Kumar Go To White Castle&lt;br/&gt;    * Tommy Boy&lt;br/&gt;    * Bolt&lt;br/&gt;    * Vacation&lt;br/&gt;    * Little Miss Sunshine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key ingredient of these movies that it tries to capture is that almost always &amp;quot;the point of the journey is not to arrive.&amp;quot; The characters think they want something, and that's why they go on this trip, but we know that their goals are superficial, and what they Really Need is something else: love, family, freedom. And, to immerse ourselves in the feeling of being that kind of character, we let the other players pick our Real Need for us, and they don't tell us what it is. We try to figure it out on the trip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a one-shot for 2-5 players that takes 2-4 hours to play - the more players, the longer it will take. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
