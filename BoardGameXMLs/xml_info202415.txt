			<description>German cycling racing game, the board game is two sided, one side takes place in Denmark though since it was published by a company that also rents holiday cottages in Denmark, the other side of the board represents a fishing trip in Norway. The B-side is played with pedestrians, not with cyclists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with 4 card board cyclists and 4 card board pedestrians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won by the player whose figure crosses the finish line first. On side A of the board the players use cyclists and race to the finish line with a role &amp;amp; move mechanics, side B is similar but here the players use pedestrians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
