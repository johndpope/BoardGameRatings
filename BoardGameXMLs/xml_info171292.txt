							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lantern Bearer</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The worst evil the elves ever discovered was what had become of their elven kin who became corrupted by both demons and the strange energies within the bowels of the earth. These elves were transformed into what are now known as the drow. In response to these wicked threats, the elves founded the Lantern bearers. Members of this secretive organization state that their goal is &amp;ldquo;to be a light against the coming darkness.&amp;rdquo; In plainer terms, they seek to contain and eliminate the drow, and especially to conceal the shameful truth behind their corrupt relations. With the terrible secret of the drow revealed, other races have trained as lantern bearers as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prestige Class: Lantern Bearer&lt;br/&gt;Build Classes: Ranger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role: Lantern bearers are specialists in tracking and facing down creatures of darkness and evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
