			<description>A Monopoly variant, but does not simply rename the squares like most variants. More property sets are present, as more 2 property sets exist. In addition, properties sets are not arranged in increasing value order but rather randomly (in terms of cost, they're semi-logically sorted by environmental themes)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a final twist, the railroad points are replaced by canal entrances which lead to a plus shaped set of spaces. When landing on an entrance, you are relocated to the center of the plus shape and must draw a card to determine the direction you must exit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other changes involve no utilities, only one kind of event deck (not counting the canal cards), and a good park fund (basically the Free Parking fees variant)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
