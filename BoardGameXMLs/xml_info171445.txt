			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A stage-styled platform game based on the comic book Urusei Yatsura by Rumiko Takahashi. The player controls Lum running around on various stages, jumping over holes in the floor and climbing ladders in order to reach the top where she can be rescued by an alien ship. The game starts at Kindergarten level, and for each level, Lum gets slightly older, advancing towards current time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translated from the box back:&lt;br/&gt;A big earthquake has struck Tomobiki high! The school's on fire!&lt;br/&gt;The earthquake has caused time glitches, and I'm being warped from the past into the future.&lt;br/&gt;And this isn't the school, but my old kindergarten!&lt;br/&gt;Avoid the fire and jump over the crushed floor!! I must reach the UFO at the top!.&lt;br/&gt;I must warp back to the time where my darling is, and marry him in the future!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits:&lt;br/&gt;Rumiko Takahashi: Original work&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
