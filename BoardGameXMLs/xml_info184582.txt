			<description>Team Time is an educational game designed to teach young children matching, counting and visual discrimination.  It was included in the Get Ready for Kindergarten! book and game set by Sharon Hinchey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a pile of matching coins or markers.  The game board depicts a busy playground full of children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his or her turn, each player spins the spinner, which will point to a picture of a combination of colored pants, shirt and hat.  The player must then find a child on the board with a matching outfit and mark the child with a marker.  In order to make the game more difficult, a time limit can be set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns spinning and marking children until all are marked.  The player with the most marked children wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
