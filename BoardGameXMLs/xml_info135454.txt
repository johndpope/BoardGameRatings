							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs</name>
									
			<description>Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a survival horror video game developed by The Chinese Room and produced and published by Frictional Games. The game is an indirect sequel to Amnesia: The Dark Descent, developed and produced by Frictional Games. While set in the same universe as the previous game, it features an entirely new cast of characters and time setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features several interlocking storylines. Some take place in the past, some in the present, and some are overtly real while some may be imagined. Set in London on New Year's Eve, 1899, the game's protagonist is Oswald Mandus, a wealthy industrialist and butcher. Upon the beginning of the game, he awakens from a fever that has unknowingly lasted for several months, after returning from a &amp;quot;disastrous&amp;quot; expedition to Mexico. Throughout the game, he hears the voices of his sons, Edwin and Enoch, calling for him as they lead him through the different areas of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
