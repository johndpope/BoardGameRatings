							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ruined Urthe: A Djarhun Expansion</name>
									
			<description>The Demon Tzerar had slain Gharad and taken the Book of Avrakar.  The entire land of Djarhun has been put into chaos.  Lakes of fire have consumed most of Djarhun, and only Durach remains...broken.   Tzerar has proclaimed his domain be called Urthe, where he rules with a ruthless hand.  Wars have raged for centuries to try to regain the lands.  Technomancers and Mages have been wiped out in separate wars that only solidified Tzerar&amp;rsquo;s power.  Gems have lost almost all value and the few that live, just try to survive on what they find.  The great City of Elidor has been long forgotten, as Tzerar&amp;rsquo;s castle now rests in its place.  The world, that was known by all, would surely be lost if not for one thing &amp;hellip; none of this happened yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the land of Ruined Urthe.  The expansion, to the Djarhun fantasy board game, can send Heroes on a journey 1,000 years into the future of Djarhun.  Explore the land that will come to be &amp;hellip; if only you do not get to the Book of Avrakar in time.  This land holds new secrets and foes, as you travel the wastelands in search of artifacts that will aid you in the present.  Along with a new board to explore and updated rules, there are also new cards to add to the adventure...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Hero Cards (11)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Market Cards (36)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Treasure Cards (110)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Quest Cards (190)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Djarhun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
