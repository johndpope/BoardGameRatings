							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Raid on Bananama: The Bad Boys Game</name>
									
			<description>A two-player game based on the Bad Boys comic series published in Warhawks magazine #2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the invasion of Bananama, the forces of the U.S. have taken El Presidente into custody... or have they?  You play either the forces of the 'Bad Boys: American Special Forces', or 'The Cartel', the elite drug runners of the Third World.  Each side wants El Presidente... the U.S., because he's been helping run drugs; the Cartel, to kill him before he talks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding El Presidente will be difficult because of his duplicates, but if either player can get the real one to his HQ, he wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
