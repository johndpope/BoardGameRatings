							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Curse of Cruz Cabal</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out of the Frying Pan, Into the Jungle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When legendary adventurer and treasure-seeker Victor Greenwood calls with an offer you can't refuse, you don't refuse. After all, who could say no to a week-long trek through the steaming, danger-infested Amazon jungle in search of an ancient, priceless relic rumored to hold supernatural powers? Well, you MIGHT have said no if you'd known about the walking dead, tortured spirits and the insane black-magic wielding witchdoctor. And you DEFINITELY would have said no if you'd known about the demon, the haunted lost city and the deathtraps. But that's the problem with hindsight - it's always 20/20 when you're looking back from death's door...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's Inside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Curse of Cruz Cabal is a complete adventure for Horror Rules, the Simply Horrible RPG, a horror comedy game of ridiculous proportions. This 32pg supplement is packed with everything you need to play, including Bad Guys, Cast, backstory, artwork, maps, Plot Pushers and enough Sequel Suggestions and Plot Twists to turn it into five adventures instead of one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
