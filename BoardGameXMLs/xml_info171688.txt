Under cover of darkness the companions will break through the ring around Songren, the besieged invaders, flee to the quaint Ice-Pirates, find the legendary oracle Bendat&amp;eacute;in and then set out to search for Grahmdor, the legendary hero. Only he can save Grenstal from the Valrami! &lt;br/&gt;The trail leads into the wild mountain country Valruns the midst of the enemy's country, and from there to the seat of gods of the Fire. The agents of the Panthers of ice on their heels, completely on their own in a snowy, hostile country, the adventurer, the only hope for the endangered homeland. &lt;br/&gt;Insist the fire's five tests?
