			<description>Bieten is a trick-taking card game best played with 3 to 5 players using a 33 card German suited pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bieten means bidding or betting. Each player is dealt just three cards, and points are won for the best heart, best leaf, best pair or triple, best sequence, and winning the last trick. Players can bet on any of these points: if the other players concede, the bettor automatically wins the point; if they contest the point its value is increased.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the play, the score for each player is calculated and added to their previous cumulative total:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For winning a figure on which there was no bet - 1 point&lt;br/&gt;    For betting a figure which everyone calls good - 1 point&lt;br/&gt;    For winning a figure which was bet and hold, but to which no one said three - 2 points&lt;br/&gt;    For saying three to a figure which was bet and held, if everone says good to the three - 2 points&lt;br/&gt;    For winning a figure on which a raise to three was held - 3 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player who held the Weli but fails to score for any of the five figures loses one point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone's score starts from zero, and the game ends when any player's score reaches or exceeds an agreed target score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
