			<description>Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Basic gameplay is very simple, with three main sections of gameplay changing though the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Events&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the player may choose between 12 different types of all-terrain vehicle and race on 20 different tracks in a variety of types, including Training, Freestyle, Cross Country Endurance, MAXXIS Nationals, Stadium Supercross and Pro Career, as well as various multiplayer modes. Each of the different game types have different objectives the player must accomplish in order to succeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, in Freestyle, the player must get as many points as possible by performing stunts off ramps, but in Pro Career, the player must win different races to advance in the game and unlock new tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Race modes&lt;br/&gt;There are three different race modes that can be accessed through the track selection screen. These cannot be selected during Pro Career mode, and not all modes are available during certain Events.&lt;br/&gt;Practice&lt;br/&gt;Race in this mode to practice on any of tracks the player has unlocked. Practice races have an unlimited number of laps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lap attack&lt;br/&gt;Lap Attack is available for 1-player only. This mode allows the player to improve his lap time by racing against a &amp;quot;ghost&amp;quot; of his own ATV driver. As with Practice mode, Lap Attack mode has an unlimited number of laps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;ATV Offroad Fury,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
