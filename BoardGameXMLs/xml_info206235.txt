			<description>Description from the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde have identified their suspects. It's up to you to track them down and solve the case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the first player to nab three suspects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;File tiles are arranged face-down in a 4x5 grid. Each player takes a Case Lead Tile and places it on their Detective Desk Mat. Suspects are lined up nearby. Each suspect has three evidence symbols on its base. On a turn, players may look under one tile to find evidence symbols without showing their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of a turn, if a player thinks she knows where two Evidence file tiles are, which, along with her Case Lead Tile match a suspect, she may nab the suspect instead of searching under a tile. To nab a suspect, declare which suspect you are accusing. Then, flip the corresponding Evidence file tiles over. If correct, the suspect is placed on the Detective Desk Mat on a numbered space. If the player is mistaken and the Evidence file tiles do not match, they are flipped back over and play continues, but the opponent has now seen where two tiles are. The first player to nab three suspects is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
