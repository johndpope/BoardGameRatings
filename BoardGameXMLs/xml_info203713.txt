			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gates is a competitive, turn based board game with strong aspect of deck building and managing unruly creatures. All of this in an original world of magic and heroes. The first board from the Basic Set is adjusted for two players, where they must fight over limited resources of mana and outsmart an opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To cast a spell a player needs mana and a card. Every spell has its own effects, sometimes divided into few verses. So you are in control on how much mana spent and which effects you wish to unleash upon your opponent and the battlefield. Anyway, imagine a situation where your silly enemy throws a fireball in your face. What could you do? Of course, there is an interrupt option, why not. Or you could summon a creature that will cover you with its own body. Erect a wall of stones to block the missile. Or cast your own fireball and make it clash like in Dragon Ball series!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate goal of this duel is to defeat everyone foolish enough to compete with you. Unless you fight against one one the Legendary Beasts, which means you need to cooperate as a team to defeat this monstrosity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
