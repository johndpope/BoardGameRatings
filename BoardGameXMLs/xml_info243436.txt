			<description>Overview and Theme: In Resilience, you will lead your armies to capture lands for your chosen banner, trade resources with your neighbors, negotiate terms with your allies and your enemies, build mighty strongholds and battle those who stand in your way! You will choose the actions for each of your armies that will in turn, change the shape of the land and the outcome of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal: The game of Resilience is played with 2 to 4 players, each attempting to be the first to build a level 4 stronghold and become the winner of the game. The levels of a stronghold are as follows: 1-Keep 2-Wall 3-Moat 4-Victory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game Board: The game is played on square land tiles that are laid down between the player's war camps. The land tiles are one of three types, Desert, Plains or Forest, each having a different land value associated with them. The more land value a player controls, the higher they can build their stronghold to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the land tiles have mountains that limit where a player's commander can move to and may be rotated by the players to alter the game board, benefiting or hindering a player's strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-Play: Each player has 3 commanders that they use to move around the game board and interact with the land tiles. On each player's turn, they may use each commander once to claim land tiles, use special abilities or battle opponent commanders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle: Each commander has an army that is made up of 1 to 3 army cards. Army cards may be; Infantry, Archer, Cavalry or a Diplomat. In a Rock-Paper-Scissor fashion each player reveals cards, one at a time, from the commander army to battle: Infantry beats Cavalry, Cavalry beats Archer, Archer beats Infantry. The diplomat serves as the wild-card; when used in battle, both players are forced to roll a 6-sided die to determine the victor of that particular fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trading: Players may trade away land tiles they control to other willing players, and in return, they re-collect army cards that have been discarded or resurrect fallen commanders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fun fact: No player can truly be eliminated. Even if a player looses all of their commanders and land tiles, they can always accept trade from other players, bringing them back into the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
