			<description>A biathlon-themed roll-and-move trivia game with a dexterity component.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game: Be the first to complete the course on the board three times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How it is played: &lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling the two dice. If their pawn is on a ascending slope space at the beginning of their turn, they roll only one die. They move their pawn according to the die roll. &lt;br/&gt;If it lands on a grey space, nothing happens. If it lands on a green space, an action card is drawn and the action performed (move pawn backwards/forwards a certain number of spaces, lose a turn etc.). &lt;br/&gt;If it lands on a yellow space, a question card is drawn and the active player has to answer a biathlon-related question. If they succeed, their pawn advances five spaces. If they fail, they go back five spaces.&lt;br/&gt;If the pawn lands on a blue space, they have to go back to start.&lt;br/&gt;If a player rolls the same number on both dice, they gain a fan token, which grants them extra movement in round three.&lt;br/&gt;Since the game is about biathlon, there is also a shooting exercise that takes place after rounds one and two: Players have to hit a target with a wooden marble, using a wooden catapult. Generally, each player has five shots per round to hit the five targets, but shooting cards may allow them to reload. Each missed target means extra spaces to complete in a penalty round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
