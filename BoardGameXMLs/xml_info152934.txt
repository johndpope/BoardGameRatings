			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A train is racing up the scrolling screen in a bizarre world. In that world, everything is symmetrical, with the train tracks being the symmetry axis. However, sometimes, the landscape will be off and the player must tap the area where things are not symmetrical to correct the situation. Should the train get past that point before the player has managed to do that, and a life is consumed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game becomes progressively more complex as the train races faster and the landscape becomes more complex. Should things become too frantic, an emergency brake is available, but it must recharge between uses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
