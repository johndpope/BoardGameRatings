			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It all started in the Hylbu Valley, where an old man became a god. He had spent such time becoming one with nature and leaving behind his earthly cares that he had magnificent powers over spirits and animals alike. Those who lived in peace with nature in the valley saw his god-like powers and worshiped him as their local protector. He was called Ricky Tick-Tock. His high priest traditionally gave up his or her name, the better to become one with the land. As Tick-Tockâ€Ÿs followers protected the land, the land protected them, and their harmony deepened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
