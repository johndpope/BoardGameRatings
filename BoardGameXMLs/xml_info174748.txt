			<description>Pocket Sports Gridiron is a fast dice rolling game that see two teams attempting to drive to the end zone when they have possession of the football.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to complete a pass or run into the end zone for a touchdown, without your opponent&amp;rsquo;s defense preventing the play. As the game only uses dice, there is no need to measure yards or mark a line of scrimmage. Think of the game as a highlights package of your team on the offense drive. They either score or your opponent takes over on offense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Quarterback die will be the central die. Rolling this will choose the play 'called' by the QB. The subsequent die rolled next will be one of the other passing/running positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WR , TE , &amp;amp; RB all have different plays on each die face with an 'intensity' value that the DEFENSE must match to prevent the play being successful. There are Field Goal options, Flags for penalties, Sacks, Intercepts, Fumbles and an Audible Play option (for PRO MODE)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 5 team cards to be used for an optional PRO MODE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Light, compact and portable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
