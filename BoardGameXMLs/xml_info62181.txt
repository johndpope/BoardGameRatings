			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Say Goodbye to Ranger Prestige Classes Forever!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you tired of every Ranger having Track and spell abilities? Do you wish you could drop the Ranger's Combat Style ability for something else? Perhaps Favored Terrain or a Bonded Companion is more to your wilderness tastes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sentinel is a new core class for fantasy d20 games that uses an innovative progression system, similar to the d20 modern talent tree system. This advancement system allows for ultimate customization of your character beginning at 1st level. With 79 unique special abilities and a list of another 54 feats that can serve as special abilities, you will wonder how you ever played d20 without a system like this. Choose from 133 different feats and abilities like Advanced Favored Enemy, Detect Enemy, Ear to the Ground, Aura of Protection, Speak with Stone, Environmental Attack, Lay Hands, Mastery of Surprise, Inspire Bloodlust, and many others to create the wilderness champion of your dreams. With this supplement you can create a traditional ranger, you can switch out a few of his abilities, or you can even switch all his special abilities out for others. Become a master of beasts with abilities like Beast Trainer, and Vermin Handler. Use your Charisma to protect yourself and empower your allies with abilities like Aura of Courage, and Inspire Rage. Become closer to nature and improve your hunting skills with the Favored Terrain, Survivalist Guide, and Hunter-Gather abilities. These and more than 100 other innovative and well balanced special abilities are available in this supplement to help you craft any ranger concept you might have without ever taking a prestige class again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start Customizing Your Ranger at 1st Level With the Sentinel!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement comes in two formats. The onscreen version fully embraces the advantages of electronic publishing and features plenty of color, artwork, internal and external hyper-links, and other features to facilitate onscreen viewing. A printable version of these rules is also included in the download. The printable version has no artwork or fancy layout design. It is raw text in 12 point font, designed to be merciful on your ink cartridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
