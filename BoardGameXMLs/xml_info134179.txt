			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Britain&amp;rsquo;s favourite playground game as a board game!  Can the Runners make it safely across the playground avoiding the Bulldog?  The Teachers can help, but if the Runners get caught it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;British Bulldog&amp;rdquo;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further details:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player moves the Runners by rolling a number die and a direction die, whilst the other player moves the Bulldog a number of squares restricted by how many Runners have been caught to date.  If all the Runners make it safely across the playground without being caught that player is the winner; if the Bulldog catches all the Runners then that player is the winner.  Additional Teacher Squares offer protection for the Runners as the Bulldog cannot enter or pass through these squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game introduces elements of both chess and draughts, and combines luck with strategy making it an easy game to learn but with additional depth for older players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
