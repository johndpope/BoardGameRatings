			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is set in the Spinward Marches Sector in what is known as the &amp;ldquo;Golden Age&amp;rdquo; of the Third Imperium &amp;ndash; 1107-1116. This setting &amp;ndash; and the events in the Spinward Marches Sector - are described in detail in many Classic Traveller publications published from 1979 onwards. Possession of this background material on the Spinward Marches is useful but not necessary for the playing of this adventure, as the minimum of background information is provided in this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EPIC is the first of a &amp;ldquo;Golden Age&amp;rdquo; trilogy of 3 EPICs, set in the Rimward portion of the Spinward Marches in 1108 &amp;ndash; at the height of the Fifth Frontier War between the Outworld Coalition and the Third Imperium. Each adventure can be played as a standalone, or all three as a mini-campaign. This adventure, and the mini-campaign as a whole, concentrates on the trials and tribulations of the characters in District 268 that, although small scale, are epic in their own right. The story of District 268 in the 5th Frontier War has been overshadowed by the massive fleet and siege engagements that took place in Vilis, Lanth, Regina and Jewel subsectors to Coreward. In these adventures, the characters could be destined to play a pivotal role in the war on a supposedly secondary front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is possible to think of this adventure as being similar to the key episodes in a season of a TV series. Unrelated episodes can be slipped in between the key ones, but eventually the story will reach the series finale. Of course, there may well be another series, and so other adventures will follow this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
