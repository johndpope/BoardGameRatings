			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goblins Damned is a mini RPG humor. In this game players interpret goblins weaklings who die for anything! Characters begin with rolled randomly and their characteristics are now ready to play! Probably he will die in the second or third battle. Then you generate another goblin and the game continues! Suffice to say that is a brother, son, nephew, etc. that came to avenge!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With its four rule pages, Goblins Damned is perfect for when not much else to do. It's a fun game where not to laugh. Especially if you use the rules opcinais as Goblin Voice (where the player earns a bonus of +1 to stay while speaking with the voice of goblin) and Error Goblin (where a fall in the data, the goblin EXPLODE!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
