			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you slowly open your eyes the world seems out of focus. The room dips and sways sharply as you raise yourself up off the ground, your arms shaking under the weight of your own body. As the blur twists and bends in reaction to your ear-splitting headache, you sense the taste of dried blood and dirt on your lips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chamber comes in to better focus as you stagger to your feet, and you frantically spin around to see your possessions scattered about you, discarded as if they had no meaning. You are bathed in a light from above that burns brighter than the sun, causing you great pain as you look towards it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You struggle to clear your mind and try to remember how you came to be here, but that's just the problem: your mind is already completely clear, blank even, and you have no memory of what brought you to this strange place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you look past the circle of light in which you stand and into the darkness that surrounds you, as the ringing in your ear subsides, one thing is certain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are not alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cavern of the Damned is an introductory adventure developed for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. It is designed for a party of five 1st level characters, taking them up to 2nd or 3rd level upon completion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This package contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The original adventure in full color PDF format.&lt;br/&gt;    A &amp;quot;printer friendly&amp;quot; version in black and white.&lt;br/&gt;    An archive containing all the game maps in high resolution.&lt;br/&gt;    An archive containing all the game maps in high resolution with the location markers and secret rooms omitted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
