			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contact is a 30 minute social game for 4-16 friendly players. It focuses on physical contact between participants; testing imagination, communication, and intuition&amp;mdash;An ice breaker meant to challenge social boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players gather in a circle and take turns interacting with new partners.  Each pair finds a way to make physical contact that hasn't already been done in the game. If they succeed, they each earn 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives a quirk card that tells them one way they must behave during the game (e.g. &amp;quot;Avoid Eye Contact&amp;quot;).  If you can guess a person's quirk, you received a point, and they get a new quirk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when everyone has partnered with everyone else once.  The person with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: This was game was a submission to the Golden Cobra Challenge 2014.  However, it is much more of a social/party/ice-breaker game than a role-playing game, and has been added as such to BGG with the permission of the designer.  The rules for the game are available on the Golden Cobra Challenge website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
