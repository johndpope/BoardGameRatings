			<description>This small, but very competitive game on the first clash between the French-Piedmontese army and the Austrian one in May 1859 during the first phases of the campaign known as the Second Italian War for Independence, is an almost skirmish battle fought on the country roads and the fields near Voghera, on the road from Piedmont towards Milano. It was an harsh battle, where the Austrians got the numerical advantage but didn&amp;rsquo;t have the confidence to use it as it was due for a victory.&lt;br/&gt;The simple, but not simplistic rules integrate movement and combat, several readiness status for the various leaders and troops present on the field of battle, fire and melee rules, morale, territorial gains and so on. The sumptous graphics for both the map and the counters make this one a joy for the eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;1 8.5&amp;quot; by 11&amp;quot; map &lt;br/&gt;64 counters &lt;br/&gt;Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;Charts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Released as Print-n-Play in June 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
