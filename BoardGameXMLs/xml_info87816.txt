							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Advanced V.G.</name>
									
			<description>An updated version of the first game which adds three new playable characters, a storyline which features Yuka as the main character (who has a clone), and includes a pair of &amp;quot;True&amp;quot; bosses, the genetically engineered &amp;quot;Hybrid&amp;quot; warriors K-1 and K-2. This game would later be re-released on the Sega Saturn and PlayStation with updated graphics and sound. The only major difference between the two versions is that the Saturn version retains the &amp;quot;Graphic Mode&amp;quot; setting which allows the viewing of the hentai scenes. This option was omitted from the PlayStation version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following characters are introduced in Advanced V.G.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Satomi Yajima (八島聡美, Yajima Satomi?) is a young woman who lives with her younger brother, Daisuke. She earns money for living expenses and school tuition by working part-time jobs while caring for Daisuke. While she is an honest, straightforward person, she is also practical and realistic when it comes to situations involving money. This is because they have no other living relatives to provide for them, Satomi is often forced to take various odd jobs simply in order to make ends meet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Ayako Yuuki (結城綾子, Yūki Ayako?) is the star attraction of the SoTO, a techno/rave dance club and restaurant, where she dazzles visitors with her flashy dancing. While appearing on the surface to be nothing more than a good-looking &amp;quot;Party girl&amp;quot;, Ayako spends a great deal of her free time providing volunteer services to the needy and homeless. She also makes a pastime of luring out rapists, muggers, and stalkers and then beating them to within an inch of their lives, because they do unjust things to women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Erina Goldsmith (エリナ・ゴールドスミス, Erina Gorudosumissu?), also known as Eririn, is a full-blooded American born and raised in Osaka. She is loud, outspoken, and fond of bawdy humor. She owns and operates her own restaurant, The Rival, and fights in the V.G. tournaments in hopes of bringing her paternal grandmother from the United States to live with her in Japan. Erina practices no particular martial art, but instead fights using improvised methods derived from years of street brawling which she took up to vent her anger at her treatment by others due to a kind of prejudice commonly shown by Japanese towards foreigners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Variable Geo&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
