							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ars Metamagica</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've played the third edition and the subsequent iterations of the World's Most Popular Roleplaying Game since about the time they were put on the market. I've read oodles of splatbooks and adventures related to the game. One of the more interesting and frequently expanded upon concepts are metamagic feats. It seems that just about every new supplement had to have at least a handful of these feats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metamagic feats let casters modify their spells. Want a summon monster spell that lasts longer than normal? Apply Extend Spell. Want some extra firepower? Apply Empower Spell or Maximize Spell. In a hurry? Apply Quicken Spell. Sounds like fun, doesn't it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, sounds (like appearances) can be deceiving. In my experience, metamagic feats are seldom used. Players don't take them. Feats are precious commodities, after all, and spending a feat for an effect of limited utility can be a hard sell. What's more, the inclusion of metamagic rods combined with the all-too-common Magic Shop Syndrome pretty much makes metamagic feats obsolete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coolness that should've been metamagic feats has long rankled me, so I decided to do something about it. Thus, this PDF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
