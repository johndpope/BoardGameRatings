			<description>Based on the hit BBC television program of the same name, 'It's a Knockout', versions of which ran concurrently in countries across Europe.  Contestants competed in silly obstacle course type games, usually wearing equally silly costumes.  Regional heats culminated in the winners representing their countries in international contests known as &amp;quot;Jeux Sans Fronti&amp;egrave;res&amp;quot; (Games Without Frontiers).  The board game was originally created in Britain in 1974 and became the Australian Toy Association's game of the year in 1986.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move around a playing board until they land on one of the 'games' that include variants on tiddlywinks, target shooting, blow football and bowling. The position that players finish in the sub-games determines the amount of points that they receive.  Each player has a &amp;quot;joker&amp;quot; that can be played before any one game and they get double points for that game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest number of points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed for children, but is enjoyable when played by adults that remember the television program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
