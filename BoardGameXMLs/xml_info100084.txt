			<description>Torchlight returns! The award-winning Action RPG is back, bigger and better, with Torchlight II. Runic Games, located in Seattle, is a veteran team composed of the designers and leads of projects including Diablo, Diablo II, Mythos, Fate, and Torchlight, which won the Game Developer's Choice Award for Best Debut of 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Torchlight II captures the quirky charm and furious action of the original, while expanding the world and including the features players wanted most. Torchlight II is fast, fun, and filled to the brim with action and loot. Adventure solo, or online with your friends!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CO-OP ACTION&lt;br/&gt;The most exciting new feature of Torchlight II is the multiplayer component. Play with friends old and new, using the free matchmaking service. Together you'll discover expansive outdoor areas and ominous caverns; random dungeons teem with a huge variety of all new monsters and villains, powerful magical loot, and quests to complete. Journey through vastly differing locales, enjoying all new weather features, time of day events, and a new and more deeply developed story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKSTORY&lt;br/&gt;Years ago, the Heroes of Torchlight saved the world from the ancient evil, Ordrak. Now someone has stolen the essence of his power, and is using it to upset the balance of the six elements. After witnessing the destruction wrought by this terrible artifact, you'll begin a quest to uncover the villain's identity and avert disaster. The trail leads from the beleaguered Estherian Steppes, through the war-torn Mana Wastes and the haunted ruins of an ancient dwarven city, before descending to a realm where no mortal has set foot for thousands of years - and where an even more terrible evil struggles to unleash itself into the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Game Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
