			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A truly horrid bad guy deserves to be kitted out accordingly. Evil doers are not constrained by the same rules as many adventurers. To them, using vile spells and items is an everyday activity, so they would certainly have items to assist them in their foul endeavours. The items presented in this ebook are primarily for evil characters. While not all of them are actually evilly aligned, they all have effects that would make goodly characters hesitate before using them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ebook is crammed with cool toys to give extra clout to the evil guys in your campaign, or to offer them protection from the those pesky holy weapons that seem to be an essential part of every PC&amp;rsquo;s gear. And if your PCs are the ones dwelling in grey areas, they will find plenty to intrigue them in these pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take a dip into the dark side bran tub and see what you pull out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ebook contains 45 items for those that do not let their conscience get the better of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wondrous Creations 10: Evil is a magic item sourcebook compatible with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and suitable for GMs and players of any level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
