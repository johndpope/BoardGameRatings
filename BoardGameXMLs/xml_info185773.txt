			<description>From the game document:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is meant as a salute to the computer game upon which  it is based. It is an unsanctioned, unauthorized homage, a parody of Phantasy Star Online: Blue Burst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game adapts a Computer Roleplaying Game to a tabletop format.  It assumes that players will not be familiar with standard tabletop gaming.  Character creation involves selecting a Race, Selecting a Guild, and generating starting Attributes.  The seven Attributes are meant to mimic the computer game.  Characters also develop a MAG (Mobile Android Guardian), as in the computer game.  The Guild selected determines which Techniques a character will have for use during combat.  Advanced Techniques use a fairly simple tree structure for access.  The remainder of the document discusses missions (adventures), how actions are resolved, and how combat occurs.  These mechanics are fairly simple and typical of tabletop games in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
