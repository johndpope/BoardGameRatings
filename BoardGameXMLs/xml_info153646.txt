			<description>A card game of witches and potions! You are a witch of the classic green skinned, pointy hatted variety, in competition with your weird sisters for that iconic status symbol: loads of warts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card is an ingredient, and the cards interact based on their colors. As you add them to your cauldron, they have various effects, and when you have all four colors present, your potion goes POOF! If you had the right stuff in there, when the fumes clear out you'll be wartier than ever. All your sisters will be jealous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that's not all. In the heap of entrails and goop lie some of those most dreaded ingredients: healthy vegetables! Toss them into your opponents' cauldrons to spoil what would otherwise have been an absolutely disgusting brew, or, if you've got just the right color balance, you can use them to set your potion off with only minimal side effects!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is three rounds. Each player gets 1 poof per round and may play 1 card per turn unless a card allows otherwise. When a player has poofed, their cauldron is reheating and is closed until the next round, so they may only play cards into other players' cauldrons until then. Cards may add or remove cards from cauldrons, cause players to draw or discard cards, give or take away warts, and plenty more specific gameplay-manipulating effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number of players for one deck can be 2-6, although larger numbers of players can be supported by simply mixing in an additional deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
