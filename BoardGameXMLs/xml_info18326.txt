			<description>From the Introduction: &amp;quot;Napenaltowaksche is the skirmish level portion of the Flintlocks and Tomahawks system.  The setting is mid 18th-century New England, New France and the Old Northwest.  Where a choice had to be made between playability and realism, the choice was made toward ease of play so that the result is closer to a caricature rather than a historical simulation.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game name is spelled both Napenaltowaktsche and Napenaltowaksche by the designer throughout the booklet.  It's Lenni Lenape (Delaware Indian) for &amp;quot;They will be scalping each other,&amp;quot; and I don't think the Lenni Lenape much care how you spell it so long as you pronounce it correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a skirmish level miniatures wargame, where one figure represents one person.  The game was sold either simply as the rules alone (with basic character cards and player aids to photocopy), or as a full kit with felt and wood terrain, eight painted miniatures (4 Indians, 4 colonists), chits, character cards, player aid cards, movement stick, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics contain a fair bit of randomness.  A chit for each figure in the game is put into a cup along with three &amp;quot;end of turn&amp;quot; chits - draw a chit to see who moves next.  The player owning the active figure rolls a d6 and adds its current Competence (which starts at 6 and drops as you take wounds) to get a number of action points available for a turn.  Moving one cm takes 1 AP, while loading your flintlock takes 12 AP, tracked on your character card in groups of 4 AP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a figure is fired at and the shot comes reasonably close, they must make a reaction check to see what they do.  This can range from running away to holding your ground to firing wildly to charging into melee - the more wounded you become, the more likely you are to run away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are given for aiming and firing, melee, line of sight through the dense woodland, other terrain, etc.  This is overall a lighter set of rules rather than a true simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
