			<description>from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Focus Group is a roleplaying game scenario, designed to be played within a three hour time-frame. The game uses pre-generated characters, and would suit either tabletop style roleplaying or a semi-LARP style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main conflict in the game is the players versus the scenario, but some character versus character conflict has been written into some of the pre-generated characters. Extra characters have been included to allow for some choice on the part of the GM or players - the game has been put together for one GM and anywhere from 3 to 8 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Scenario Premise:&lt;br/&gt;The Player Characters (PCs) are a cross-section of average Americans, brought to the BCNCB studio to view a new programme. They are to give their opinions about the show as part of the network&amp;rsquo;s research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
