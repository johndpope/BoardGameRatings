			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; UNAVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has officially been announced by the publisher or developer, and remains in development. Therefore, some of the game information may change in the future. Until this game is released, please do not submit images for it, nor add new releases. Press Kits are an exception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rune: Ragnarok is an open-world sandbox game set in a dangerous Norse universe where gods, beasts, and the last remaining humans struggle to survive. It was foretold that during Ragnarok, the gods would fall and the Nine Realms would be consumed by frost and fire. This was foretold&amp;hellip;but this is not what happened. The Nine Realms are frozen and crumbling under the weight of war while the gods live on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rune: Ragnarok blends intense Action-RPG survival gameplay with savage PvP and PvE battles. As you journey to end Ragnarok, you&amp;rsquo;ll fight gruesome undead vikings in brutal melee combat, raid enemy structures, collect resources, and craft the most powerful weapons the realms have ever seen. You&amp;rsquo;ll explore vast lands, build ships, sail through dangerous waters, and make sacrifices to your god in exchange for blessings to help you end Ragnarok.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cooperative PvE multiplayer allows you to form clans with your friends to raid, loot, and end Ragnarok together. Or, engage in brutal PvP combat and destroy your enemy&amp;rsquo;s base. Regardless of your chosen path, it is up to you to defeat giants, dragons, beasts, and the undead to end Ragnarok. It is only through the complete and utter destruction of Loki and his minions that the world will be reborn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you ready to take down a god?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
