							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">All Star Wrestling Power Slam VCR Wrestling Game</name>
									
			<description>Players watch clips of wrestling matches from the old AWA league attempting to play a card that matches the move about to happen (there's a 3 second delay to allow players to choose which card to play)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A correct answer will allow that player to move his marker 2 spaces to the 'pin' space on the game board. If the card played has 'go for the pin', then if that player gets the next 2 card plays correct, they win. Game can also end when someone moves their marker to the pawn space&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
