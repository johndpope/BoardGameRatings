							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chub Gam 3D</name>
									
			<description>Chub Gam 3D is claimed to be one of the earliest freeware first person shooter games. The game features the adventures of a Harrier jet pilot after his plane crashes and is invited in by the eccentric creatures Chub and Rex. However, rather than settling down for the night as asked, the pilot discovers Rex's shocking secret project. The game is claimed to have won many awards, a traceable one being its inclusion as one of MPI World's &amp;quot;Top 52 Free Games of '98&amp;quot;. A director's cut was later released by ChubGamSoft with several improvements, including cutscenes. and it was supposedly sold in Brazil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pie in the Sky (game engine)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
