			<description>From the box cover:&lt;br/&gt;It's summertime at Adriatic coast. Beautiful girls from all over the world came to enjoy sea, sun and good fun. And here they are... who will have more success? Local guys Roko, Stipe, Ante, Borna, Sale... or maybe you?&lt;br/&gt;In this easy learning standalone card game player takes a role of &amp;quot;GALEBAR&amp;quot; - summertime playboy who competes in winning over lady tourists of most intriguing desires. (Based on true stories from Adriatic beaches.)&lt;br/&gt;Deck consists of 94 cards (36 Ladies, 30 Approaches, 11 Places and 17 Events). When a Lady comes into play, each GALEBAR plays one of his available Approaches. Depending on Lady's Interests (Romance, Sex, Fun and Money), active Place and Event, each player counts his score. The player with the highest positive score wins over the Lady. The end winner is the player with the most Ladies won during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
