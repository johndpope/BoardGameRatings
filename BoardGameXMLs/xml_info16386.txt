			<description>The game is a round trip through Switzerland, departing from and returning to Z&amp;uuml;rich.  Distance is determined by die roll and there are no branches in the route, the only option being to choose to travel clockwise or counter-clockwise.  Each player has six place cards, and if he or she stops at a place owned by another must pay that person one chip or miss a turn.  The winner is the player with the highest total of chips plus bonus points gained by early completion of the journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publication date is not specified but is probably early 1960s.  The box cites both Franz Carl Weber/Jouets Weber (Swiss toy company and chain of shops) and Otto Maier Verlag (later Ravensburger: the box is printed &amp;quot;Ravensburger Spiele Nr. 23&amp;quot;).  Otto Maier published a different game of the same name in 1891.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
