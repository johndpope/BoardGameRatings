							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Donald Duck&#039;s Haunted Mine Game</name>
									
			<description>Children's game published by Whitman based on a Disney story featuring Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse, Goofy, and Pluto.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with six matching pieces laid face up in front of them.  A pool of path tiles, plus Escape and Lost playing pieces are placed face down in the center.  In turn, each player draws a tile from the pool.  The first tile must be a path tile and is placed face up in the center of the table.  After that, drawn path cards must be connected to a path card already played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Escape tile is turned up, the player instead places one of their character cards on the path.  They are played as a path card but become a dead end.  The Escape tile is returned to the pool and mixed in after use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Lost tile is turned up, the player instead removes one of their character cards on the path (if they have one) and returns the tile to the pool after use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get rid of their six pieces wins.  If all paths are blocked before this happens, the player with the most characters used wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;34 Playing Pieces&lt;br/&gt;66 Path Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
