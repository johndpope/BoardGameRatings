							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fruit Case</name>
									
			<description>In Fruit Case, players attempt to collect sets of fruit to fill their baskets. Points are awarded for complete and partial sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 108 cards with identical backsides. On the front are the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    12 each of six different fruits&lt;br/&gt;    24 baskets with two fruits (blue background)&lt;br/&gt;    4 wild pineapples (purple background)&lt;br/&gt;    2 baskets with 3 fruits (purple background)&lt;br/&gt;    2 bombs (purple background)&lt;br/&gt;    1 rotten apple with a worm (purple background)&lt;br/&gt;    3 tree cards (brown background)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tree cards are laid face up in the middle, with at most one less than the number of players. Each player receives a two-fruit basket to start with and all other cards are shuffled. The starting dealer lays out, face up, a number of cards equal to the number of players. In turn, beginning with the dealer, each player chooses a card and places it in front of them. A player not wishing or unable to take a card instead takes one of the trees (if one is available in the middle). This tree may be returned to the center on a subsequent turn in order to take any fruit from the discard pile (instead of taking a card from the middle).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each basket starts with two or three fruits already in it. A fruit card can only be added to the basket if that fruit is not yet present. Once a basket has all six fruits, all of its cards are stacked and turned sideways. Any number of baskets can be worked on at one time, but a fruit cannot be taken without a basket to go in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pineapple is a wild fruit, but each basket can only have one. If the bomb comes up in a deal, the entire turn is skipped and all cards from the middle are discarded. The rotten apple results in the dealer discarding one entire incomplete basket of theirs, if one exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each round, the dealer role passes to the left. The game ends when there are not enough cards to fill the center. 5 points are awarded for each complete basket, with 1 point for each fruit card added to an incomplete basket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are also included for longer and shorter variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
