			<description>Hoops is an Nintendo Family Computer basketball game that takes place in the ghetto. The game is done in a half court style with the player having a choice to disable or enable winners outs. Unlike professional basketball, a player can commit as many fouls as he wants and never has to worry about being fouled out. There is also an around the world mode that allows players to focus on making baskets without worrying about the charging, pushing, and traveling fouls that are found in the standard mode of play. However, the scoring system is disabled during the &amp;quot;around the world&amp;quot; mode. This forces players to rely on their knowledge of the game to determine who is winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Hoops (video game) , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
