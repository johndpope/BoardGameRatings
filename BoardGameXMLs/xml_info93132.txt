			<description>A roll-and-move game from the 1960s.  Players attempt to negotiate their horse-shaped playing pieces around the course collecting penalties and awards as they go.  All faults are noted on the scoresheet and the player with the least faults wins.  There is an advanced version which is against the clock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
