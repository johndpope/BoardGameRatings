							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pucks in Deep</name>
									
			<description>Pucks in Deep is a ice hockey themed card game for terrible players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike many of the party games you&amp;rsquo;ve played before, Pucks in Deep is specifically designed to be as vulgar and disgusting as your beer league teammates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is simple. Each round, one player asks a question from a Puck card and everyone else answers with their funniest Ice card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside each Pucks in Deep box is 460 Ice cards and 90 Puck cards for a practically limitless amount of ice time. A referee card is included in each game box as well, and trust us, it's super satisfying to finally be able to put the ref in the box for a change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
