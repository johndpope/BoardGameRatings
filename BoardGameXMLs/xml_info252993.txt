			<description>Capture all the excitement of Miraculous with the fun and fast-paces collectible card game Throwdown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With everything you need to play included in this set, you become the character. Be the Miraculous Ladybug, Cat Noir, or Hawk Moth. Equip your character and disarm your opponent to gain the greatest advantage. Call upon help from Kwamis (Magical Companions) to either devastate or regenerate each other's decks. Surprise with your signature attack but beware of Hawk Moth's traps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THROWDOWN! is a turn based card game that uses the Draw-Attack-Discard system or D.A.D.s. During the game you will have a character, a deck, and a discard pile. First you need at least 2 or more people to play and each person will need to have their own character card and deck. The objective of the game is to attack your opponents deck. You do this with your character card and cards you draw from your deck. You win when their deck is completely depleted. No matter how many people play you will always attack the person to your left, so until you get down to two players you cannot attack the person that attacked you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting up to play is easy just place your character card next to your deck and your discard pile will go on the other side of your character. Flip a coin to see who goes first, then follow 3 easy steps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STEP 1 DRAW - On your turn DRAW a card from your deck and place it in front of your character card. &lt;br/&gt;STEP 2 ATTACK - Your character must ATTACK on your turn and will automatically defend your deck on your opponents turn. Total and resolve conflict damage. Follow any additional rules on the card.&lt;br/&gt;STEP 3 DISCARD - Now discard the card in play and put it into your discard pile, it is now your opponents turn and they follow the 3 easy steps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
