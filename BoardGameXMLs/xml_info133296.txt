			<description>Final Fantasy Dimensions is a role-playing video game, developed in the style of the 1992 16-bit game Final Fantasy V. The game uses the Active Time Battle system. Like Final Fantasy IV: The After Years, the game will be released in an episodic format, and players are free to play episodes in whichever order they like. Finishing certain episodes may affect events in later episodes. Players command a party of five with the party members changing in each episode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a Job System as a base of its battles. The game allows players to change job while still retaining skills that have already been acquired. Cross a certain amount of AP, and the player's current job will learn a job-specific ability. That learned ability can be set even if the player changes to a different job. Players are limited in how many abilities they can set at a given time. This limit rises as the job's level rises. The game also has &amp;quot;Fusion Abilities,&amp;quot; which players can form by setting combinations of certain abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jobs available from the beginning for all the eight main characters are Freelancer, Warrior, Monk, Thief, Red Mage, White Mage, Black Mage, and Summoner. Each episode introduces a new Job, which is unlocked after completing the episode. The unlockable jobs for the Warriors of Light are Dragoon, Bard, Memorist, Knight, and Devout, while the jobs unlocked for the Warriors of Darkness are Ranger, Dark Knight, Dancer, Ninja, and Magus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Final Fantasy Dimensions&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
