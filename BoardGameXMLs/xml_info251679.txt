			<description>Owl Solve That! challenges players to use any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to create equations that equal a solution card in their hand. The first player to create an equation earns points. One point is earned for each number card used from the board to create the equation. The speed element of creating your equations before your opponents add an extra layer of challenge and competition to the game&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five number cards are placed face-up next to one another on the game board. In turn order, a player chooses one of the three solution cards in her hand and uses the number cards to make an equation that totals to the number on the solution card. She receives a point for each number card used in her solution. Opponents can score two bonus points for finding a solution before she does. Number cards and solution cards are replenished, turn passes to the next player, and the game ends when a player reaches 25 points.&lt;br/&gt;-user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
