			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Need an organization to be your party&amp;rsquo;s arch-nemesis? Need a secret group to recruit your players? Need an organization to hire your characters to save the world?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course you do, you&amp;rsquo;re a game master, and as long as there are stories to be told there will be a need for secret societies and organizations. But have no fear, as your friends at Healing Fireball Publications are here for you with our latest product - Two Bit Tables: Secret Societies and Organizations. This collection of four tables allows you to generate a large number of secret societies and organizations as well as the names these organizations give their members and the names of their lairs or lodges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
