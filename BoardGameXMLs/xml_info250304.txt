							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trapped! Bermuda Triangle</name>
									
			<description>An infinitely replayable escape game for 1 to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Bermuda Triangle! Unfortunately, the stories are true, and you find yourself trapped in a parallel dimension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joined by other unfortunate adventurers, none of you remembers when you arrived, but you have a strange sense of D&amp;eacute;j&amp;agrave; vu. Have you done this before?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A giant stone obelisk stands before you, etched with various unusual symbols. You have a feeling that the secret to your escape hides beneath the ocean waves...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round consists of three phases: (1) rotate the &amp;quot;first player&amp;quot; card to the next role, (2) remove timer cards from all decks, and then (3) each role completes their turn in order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turns consist of each role taking 3 actions. Players work together to explore the triangle and remember the 91 symbols on the bottom of the ocean tiles.  There are 2 symbols per ocean tile. The appropriate symbols must be remembered and secured by player pawns to lock-in the escape pillars in the corners of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 91 symbol cards with 10 symbols per card, and each symbol is represented in the deck 10 times so that each card has exactly one symbol that matches when paired.  That one symbol is available at each pillar to lock in for a limited number of rounds.  If not locked in it is replaced by another symbol or if no more are available, players are trapped forever within the Bermuda triangle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;91 Symbol Cards&lt;br/&gt;46 Ocean Tiles&lt;br/&gt;18 Mysterious Pillar Tiles&lt;br/&gt;6 Role Cards (Bonus: several customizable role cards)&lt;br/&gt;6 Avatars&lt;br/&gt;4 Player Aid Cards&lt;br/&gt;3 Locked-in Pillar Markers&lt;br/&gt;1 Player One Card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
