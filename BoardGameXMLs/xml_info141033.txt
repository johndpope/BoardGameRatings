							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fantasy Warriors: Dawn of New Heroes</name>
									
			<description>Fantasy Warriors is a wargame about fantasy armies clashing on a battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not a skirmish game but a game that revolves around units that move in ranks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main focus of the game is the strategic deployment of units and the kind of orders the units have. Every units will have a generic behaviour depending by the orders thay have and will change that only if a new order is delivered. Greater armies will have a more complex chain of command so orders must be delivered by voice or by other means (banner bearers and herlads can be too far) so couriers are employed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The careful management of orders given or changed during a game is the key to vistory because you must be able to react to the situations that can arise! And be sure to have competent leaders on the field (another aspect of the game this one)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first scouting part of the game help the players to shape and organize the battlefield and the scenary elements on it, then it's time for omens and leaders' speeches to rise morale and motivations of troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From that moment on the most common things seen on the battlefield will be, in this order, the ranged attack phase, the combat phase and the reorganization/change orders phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic will obviously alter mechanics, supllying for an exemple to the lack of good communications on distances, but do not confide too much in the bizzarries of magic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D10-sided dices are rolled to check the outcome of actions, attacks and potentially morale-shakening events (like the death of your Leader or seeing your comrades wiped out in few minutes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special items to be defended or positions to be conquered represnt the objectives but, obviously, it is possible to concede to the adversary when things are clearly FUBAR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Constant management of leadership, C&amp;amp;C chain of command and orders given make Fantasy Warriors a game that can be very different from other fantasy wargames out there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tens of races and units add excellent variability to the game that has been published firts time in 1990.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new edition in particular is an ambitious idea that strives in bringing to life the Fantasy Warriors world, creating pratically from scratch the theatre where the exciting battles and stories of valour, sacrifice and war are going to unfold.&lt;br/&gt;The old &amp;quot;Warrior&amp;quot; magazine, published by Grenadier (many wargame players will for sure remember good memories here!), described in very brief and fast strokes some of the places that composed the savage and grim fantasy world of the game, but it never brought it forward a complete gazzetteer of a region, a map or some of the peculiarities that races, tribes and people of this world share (or fight for!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contributors to this campaign will have the opportunity to see again a great classic of the fantasy wargame world having a new life, helping us in bringing the game to new heights where the old Grenadier never had time to reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This campaign will drive forward the game to develop the well-proven mechanics of Fantasy Warriors into new terrains, new rules for naval and seaside battles, sieges, fortifications, city fight and more ideas we are testing yet to see what we can add to this wonderful ruleset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A real background world will be fully developed, with maps, cultures and tens of races, something the old Grenadier never did in details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If this campaign will meet success. future is going to see new armies, beasts, wondrous vehicles and buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
