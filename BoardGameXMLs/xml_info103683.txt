							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dante&#039;s</name>
									
			<description>A board game about saving souls with mass consumerism.  Players go through a mall in search of the seven mystical symbols to escape from Dante's shopping mall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, the players roll a die to determine the amount of actions they may take, which include moving between various parts of the mall, shopping to find weapons and other items from the Fate deck, and attacking other players, angels, or demons in order to further their goal of finding the seven symbols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, a few key pieces of information are missing from the rules site, such as a description of the board and the fate wheels, but these may be constructed through a good guess after reading the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
