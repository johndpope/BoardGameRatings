			<description>This game was developed for and given out to participants of the geocaching mega event &amp;quot;Project &amp;middot;G&amp;middot;A&amp;middot;M&amp;middot;E&amp;middot;&amp;quot; in Bremen(Germany), on May 31st 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is printed on DIN A3 photo paper. The rules are similar to &amp;quot;Snakes &amp;amp; Ladders&amp;quot; with some minor twists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     No dice is used. Instead, participants of the event recieved a &amp;quot;geocoin&amp;quot;, which also could be used as a dice, with a spinning pointer.&lt;br/&gt;     Blue Symbols on the map allow the player to move forward.&lt;br/&gt;     Red Symbols on the map send the player backwards.&lt;br/&gt;     Green symbols allow the player to decide if s/he wants to go forward or backward.&lt;br/&gt;     A cog symbol lets you spin the counter/roll the dice a second time.&lt;br/&gt;     A magnet symbol lets you move another players pawn to your position.&lt;br/&gt;     Dice symbols lets you press your luck. You shall name a number between 1 and 9 and spin the counter. Depending on the result, you either move forward twice the called number, go back twice the called number or move forward even three-times your selected number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
