							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Trial of Poland</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trial of Poland is a game that focuses on the rise of the Solidarity movement in Poland n 1980, from the point of view of the established powers confronted by a legitimate and ultimately existential threat. Each of the characters is a historic eastern bloc leader and, in his own way, a terrible person. The game hinges on a single decision&amp;mdash;will Poland be invaded?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an experimental freeform game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
