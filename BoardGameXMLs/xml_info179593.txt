							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trickster: Tianxia</name>
									
			<description>Trickster is a fun and easy-to-learn card game for 3-7 players, lasting about 15 minutes. Each Trickster set features its own heroes and new ways to play. Find the set that&amp;rsquo;s right for you... or mix together characters from different sets to customize your own game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Trickster set has 49 cards with seven heroes, each with their own simple effect on play. A hero appears in seven different suits, each a color of the rainbow: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet. Each hero and suit combination appears once in a set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player of each round may play any card from her hand. The second player in the round is called The Trickster, who may also pay any card from her hand. Any subsequent player that round must play a card that follows the pattern set by the Trickster. (If the first two cards are Yellow, then everyone must play a Yellow card.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you cannot follow the pattern, you must collect cards played this round into your personal scoring area. If everyone was able to play one card, then the Trickster collects the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Trickster is to have the fewest cards by the time any player has emptied her hand. Whoever has the fewest cards is the winner... with one exception! If you have more cards of a suit than any other player, you may ignore those cards when scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
