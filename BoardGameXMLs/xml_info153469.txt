			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Conquering Worlds, Players move their space ships from their home world to neighboring planets and planetary systems.  The game can be played until one player defeats all his opponents or conquers all the worlds. 1 to 4 players can play and the computer can act as one of the players. The galaxy can be set from 4 to 32 planetary systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to arrive at a planet gains control of that planet. Sending ships to a planet already taken by another player initiates combat. Combat can either be automatically resolved by the computer or by the players playing an arcade game. The arcade game consists of shooting a laser from the sides of the screen at the maneuvering ships for a set amount of time. Each player alternates turns and the first player to destroy all the ships is victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
