			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Editor is a battle card game whose theme is the creation of the universe. As a player, you will become an incarnation of a god that governs an element constituting the universe. Create the universe and own it with strong control!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Vedic mythology, the entire universe including five elements and the earth we live in were completed when Brahma emerged. In Space Editor, you will recreate the moment the universe was created through the friction of the five elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses one of four out of five elements: water, wind, earth, and fire, and start a game with a deck of cards of the chosen element. Players take turns placing planets and stars with energy as powerful as God. You have to read stars like an astrologer and advance the game so that the element you govern has the strongest control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One universe will be created as each game finishes. The player who governs the most dominant element in the universe is a winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
