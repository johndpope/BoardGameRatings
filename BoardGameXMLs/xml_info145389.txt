							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Galactic Incursion</name>
									
			<description>The Galactic Empire is under siege from an extra-dimensional entity known as the Incursion. The Emperor is going mad and amid this chaos, the lords of the various factions (i.e., the players) have decided this is the perfect time to consolidate their power and diminish their rivals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galactic Incursion is a card game for 2-4 players that represents this power struggle in which the safety of the Galaxy is second to the ambitions of the few!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galactic Incursion is available through The Game Crafter as well as a print and pplay version on the Wargame Vault. An Android version is in the works, which will be available in the Google Ap store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
