			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is narrative-focused RPG. This means instead of mechanical rules, the game world is defined by  description and narration. The game mechanics only helps to interpret the events, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide answers to what actually happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is meant not to confine, but to inspire you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no quantifiable stats for the character and no difficulty level for the challenges. The action are instead defined by the way the character does them, for example, forcefully, carefully or deviously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of the action is determined by the metaphysical balance of five mystical elements, and each action in turn impacts this balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
