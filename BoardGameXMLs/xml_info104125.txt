			<description>This is game of personality analysis and deduction for children.

The score sheets are &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot; in a cardboard clubhouse at the center of the board. The players now move along a pathway and attempt to guess who wrote what answer when the child lands on a &amp;quot;Guess One Secret&amp;quot; square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to guess five secret answers is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes a colorful board, the clubhouse, cards, stand-up character tokens with plastic stands, score pad, a die, the rules, and a storage insert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for 2-5 players age 7 and older.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
