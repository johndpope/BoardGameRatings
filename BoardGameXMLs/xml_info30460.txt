			<description>These rules simulate land warfare in Europe during the period 1660-1721.  One centimeter represents about 20 yards.  Units represent infantry battalions, cavalry regiments and artillery batteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units are made up of stands with variable number of figures and units are also made up of variable numbers of stands depending on unit type.  Foot units are differentiated by tactical doctrine:  platoon firing, shock, rank firing, skirmish, dragoons, etc.  There are similar differences among the horse units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules come complete with a very large set of army lists of various nations from the different period covered by the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
