							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Damager</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I hit him for five.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;He hits you for seven.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I take a swing at him with a 19.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;You hit.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Twelve damage.&amp;quot; Sound familiar? Everyone has trouble coming up with exciting attack descriptions every round of every combat. The Damager is a die-roller that generates attack descriptions based on your attack type and how much damage you do. Use them as a jumping-off point for your own creative descriptions, or as a way to mail it in on those days when it just doesn't seem worth it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The damager can roll any combination of any size dice, with +/- static amounts, and even rerolls for any number lower than a certain point (the &amp;quot;brutal&amp;quot; weapon property). In addition to the damage roller, there's a generic die-roller in case the Damager is the only tool you have on hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is written in .NET, so it should work on all recent versions of Windows and quite a few *nix boxes and Macs as well. (Assuming you have an emulator; the Damager was tested on Mono on Mac and Wine on Linux and worked on both, though there are some slight glitches on Wine.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
