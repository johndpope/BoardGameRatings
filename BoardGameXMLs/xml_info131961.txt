			<description>This is a free do-it-yourself print-and-play game for parents and kids to use to divide up the variety of Halloween treats they acquire, although any good variety of treats can be used, and not just on Halloween!  Playing the game without a decent variety of treats (using generic tokens for treats for example) eliminates much of the fun in choosing which delicious morsels your monsters get to grab from the pot, and steal from other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by rolling 3 custom dice (which have to be assembled from the files included here) in order to roll a MONSTER(s) which then can use the other 1 or 2 dice to perform an action.  One-headed and two-headed MONSTERS can GRAB a treat, STEAL a treat, or EAT a treat, for each head they have.  A player who GRABS takes a treat from the pot and puts it on their STASH plate, a player who STEALS can take a treat from the pot OR take a treat from another player's STASH.  A player who EATS a treat puts it in their STOMACH CONTENTS bag and that treat can not be stolen by any other players.  Rolling triples has special effects, like being caught stealing.  After all the treats are gone from the pot, players score 1 point for each treat in their STASH and 2 points for each treat in their STOMACH CONTENTS bag.  I suggest having at least 10 treats per player to play with.  For fairness reasons, sometimes the players agree that if they don't roll at least one monster they can physically eat one treat from the pot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dice are made by cutting out and gluing the sides on 3/4 inch wood blocks, or printing them out with adhesive backed paper and pasting them on cubes.  The file might have to be re-sized to fit smaller dice; it contains enough icons to fill 6 dice even though you only use 3 to play.  If anyone would like to have me make a custom set for them for a little $ I will make them for you.  Geekmail me here (NoodleArtist).  within a year have a few laser-engraved dice made, and re-release the game with some added rules as a more professional, packaged game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
