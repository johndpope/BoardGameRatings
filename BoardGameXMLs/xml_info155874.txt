			<description>This description's a bit tricky, so let's take it in stages...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Countermay: The Tapestry of Worlds, the crossroads of civilizations beyond imagining. After a thousand years of war, Countermay is dying. Battles, curses, extraterrestrial parasites, demonic influence, and other hazards have ruined much of the planet. The food is running out, and the threat of starvation looms. The only way to save Countermay is to seize undisputed control. Until then, armies march, fed with the ever-dwindling food as they churn farmland into mud with their boots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players assume command of one of the vastly different warring factions &amp;mdash; including steampunk aliens, displaced WWII-era American GIs, or a risen empire of the undead &amp;mdash; to expand, glorify, or defend their empires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plot of the 2013 movie The Gamers: Hands of Fate revolves around the fictitious game of Romance of the Nine Empires. Within the movie itself, AEG was the publisher of the game, but as a result of Kickstarter funding for the film, it decided to create a real-life version of R9E, as an expandable card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Romance of the Nine Empires: Arcane Fire is the first expansion to the card game featured in The Gamers: Hands of Fate. This box contains a complete play-set of cards necessary to build two new factions, as well as brand new cards for the five existing factions of Countermay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wield the power of guardians, extraplanar heroes summoned by wizards, with the Magocracy of Arcanix, or strike down your foes with the dueling Tuatha! This expansion features a new card type and mechanics and opening up more from the exciting world of Countermay.  The Romance of the Nine Empires: 15th Anniversary World Championship Edition is required to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
