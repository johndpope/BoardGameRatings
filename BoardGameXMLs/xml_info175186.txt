							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tower Of Babble</name>
									
			<description>This is a co-operative game in which 2-8 players each select an 18 card deck of cards in one of 12 different languages (Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Navajo, Russian, Spanish, and Swahili). Players must select a language which with no one is familiar and read foreign words, giving clues through facial expressions and mime as to their meaning. Large wooden cubes are used to build a tower on the board (which is the inner part of the box).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
