			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tokyo Express: Naval War In the Solomons, 1942 is primarily a two-player game covering six major battles of the Solomons Campaign, between the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) and the United States Navy (USN).  Also included is a hypothetical scenario.  Each scenario covers roughly one day of air and naval action.&lt;br/&gt;     This game was not designed for cut-throat play and required both honesty and friendly cooperation between the two players.  In order to learn how to play the game, examine all the components, skim over the game rules, and then re-read them in their entirety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;Two Playing Maps&lt;br/&gt;Two Rules Booklets&lt;br/&gt;Two USN Unit Charts&lt;br/&gt;Two IJN Unit Charts&lt;br/&gt;Two sets of Combat Tables&lt;br/&gt;Four Counter Sheets (Two USN, Two IJN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
