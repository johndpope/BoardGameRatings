			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie Mayhem&lt;br/&gt;ZOMG! is designed to mimic the action-packed absurdity of your standard bad zombie movie, with a little bit of a videogame feel thrown in for good measure. The incompetent PCs (player characters) struggle desperately against hordes of undead, succeeding as much through luck, determination and moxie as through any inherent skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pregenned PCs for this game aren't balanced, and that's okay. They're meant to all be equally fun to play as comedic heroes, not as finely-tuned killing machines. If you're looking for a gritty, tactical battle against the forces of darkness, this is not the adventure for you. If you want to kill zombies, kill your friends, and blow stuff up - not necessarily in that order - read on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;This scenario was written for Worldwide Adventure Writing Month 2008.  The adventure is available as a free download from the archive page for Worldwide Adventure Writing Month 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
