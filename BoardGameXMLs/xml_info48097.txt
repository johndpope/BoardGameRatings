							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Original Edition Options: The Halfling Adventurer</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;By the time they reach fourth level, most Halflings will want to be back in the comfort of their home, enjoying their loot and weaving ever-expanding tales of their exploits. However, a very rare few will make adventuring their life-long occupation often exceeding beyond the typical abilities of most, if not all Halfling leaders. This short pdf has been created to allow gamers to play a Halfling character beyond fourth level in original edition rpgs. Included is a rationale for the class, details and description of the class, some suggestions on Halfling Adventurer tactics along with Experience Level, Attack and Saving Throw charts. Come and see how challenging and exciting running a Halfling Adventurer can be! Furry feet await you.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
