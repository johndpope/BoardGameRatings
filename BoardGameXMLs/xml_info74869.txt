							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chronomancer: Time Travel for Everyone</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time travel is a topic of much apprehension and dread for many Game Masters. From re-writing campaign history, to bringing back automatic weapons, saving themselves and killing arch-villains when they were toddlers, chronomancers have not found a welcome home in medieval role playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book provides, not all the solutions to time travel, but many of those solutions and the tools to craft the rest of the solutions. Beginning with Fate&amp;rsquo;s fee, and stretching across the multitude of times and laws of physics, every Game Master should be able to craft the campaign setting she wants and allow chronomancers without the fear of losing control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the players, there are new classes, feats, spells and a new attitude towards time travel. You have much to explore that has been and will be. You WILL be able to time travel and, at your GM&amp;rsquo;s discretion, you will be able to create paradoxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time travel has long been a part of fantasy. A no more classical example can be made than of Merlin, from King Arthur, who lives time backwards in exchange for immortality. Chronomancer exists for those who have been waiting to explore time past, present and future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am. I was. I will be. Time is unbound. I live, lived, will live. All barriers are thrown wide.&lt;br/&gt; Dead, dying, will die. I can go anywhere, anywhen.&lt;br/&gt; I am nothing and everything. I am not, was not and will never be.&lt;br/&gt;Fate hunts me. Time Protects me. I am.&lt;br/&gt;                                                     - One-Less&lt;br/&gt; Time for something new&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;115 new spells&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;88 new psionic powers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;29 new classes and prestige classes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;22 new feats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One new attitude&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A d20 fantasy book on Time Travel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
