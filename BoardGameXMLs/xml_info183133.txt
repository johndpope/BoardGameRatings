							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pictionary Dice Game</name>
									
			<description>It's &amp;quot;Pictionary in a can&amp;quot; with the Pictionary Dice Game. The new twist on the classic drawing game has two players rolling dice to decide what to draw next. Out of three descriptor dice and three subject dice, the players choose a die from each category to make a unique combination. The artistic battle is then on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Draw as quickly as you can to help your team guess the combination. Your opponent's doing the same thing. The first team to guess right scores the point. The first team with five points wins it all, including the coveted bragging rights. Add this to family game night or pull it out at parties for an unforgettable game night full of laughs and really bad drawings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
