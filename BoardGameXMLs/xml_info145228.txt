			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kustan is located in the Peran wilderness at the northern terminus of the road known as the Scarlet Ribbon. The site contains a ruined Corani Empire fort, numerous barrow graves, and the village of Kus, home to the Rathiri Kuroba tribe. Kustan is the site of the annual tribal moot of the Kubora, a powerful warrior nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kustan article describes the history and present situation of the site and provides details for its many interesting locations. A number of legends about Kustan and the Kubora are included, along with a diagram of a typical barrow grave. Includes full-color GM and player maps as well as floor plans for the ruined Corani fort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a H&amp;acirc;rn Classics article. The majority of this material was originally published in 1985 as part of the Rethem Kingdom Module. Some additional text is from the Tribes of the Kubora expansion (COL #4762).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
