Rumor has it that the casino is connected to the mysterious underworld character 'Mr X'. No one seems to know exactly who the elusive Mr X is, or what he looks like - and there are many people who would love to know. Among those trying to find Mr X are Interpol, the local police, the local organized crime family, and the agents of several countries in which Mr X is believed to operate. Tonight, however, a charity auction is being held at Casino Fatale and it has drawn all sorts to the casino - playboys, starlets, maybe even a jewel thief&amp;hellip; Who will you play?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Casino Fatale lasts for about four hours and is suited to an evening. It is often played over a meal - a finger buffet if possible to allow guests to circulate and talk in private.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The free introductory pdf file (35 KB) contains an introduction to the game, a list of all the characters, an invitation to send to your guests - plus details of how to buy the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
