							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nine Holes</name>
									
			<description>Nine Holes is a dice-based golf game. It uses five special dice of which two are used for each stroke (except when putting), at the player's discretion. If both dice show numbers the ball goes straight, but if a number plus H (for hook) or S (for slice) is rolled the ball will go on a defined line to one side or the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are rules for landing in water, lost balls, etc. In addition, landing in certain positions causes the player to draw a Rough Luck card, which will impose a penalty. There are other spaces where Golf Pro cards are drawn, which can be used for benefits on later strokes. Golf Pro cards are also awarded for under-par holes and exact putts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules were published in Games &amp;amp; Puzzles $3 (July 1972). A sample hole is given; players are encouraged to make their own based on courses they like. Lists of the cards were made available by the magazine if you sent in for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
