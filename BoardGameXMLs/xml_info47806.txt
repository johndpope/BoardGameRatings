			<description>Roleplaying in the Devastation of WWIII.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This roleplaying game sets characters in Europe towards the end of limited nuclear war.  Characters are generally military personnel (although civilian options are allowed) who are cut-off from headquarters and 'authorized to go on their own'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character generation can be handled by random die roll or by allocation to primary stats consisting of Strength, Agility, Constitution, Charisma, Intelligence, and Education.  These basic stats are augmented by several calculated stats including hit capacity, weight, load. throw range, and base hit numbers.  Character skills are based on careers (military branch / training, education, civilian work, etc) and provide sets of skills appropriate for each career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In game combat addressed both armed and unarmed combat with a heavy focus on modern (1990's) military weapons and equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The base rule book includes details on equipment based on country of origin and military training.  In addition, details on vehicles (especially military) that are likely to be seen by the characters is included and detailed.  Information on various countries and points of interest (such as likely nuclear targets) are outlined for the Referee (i.e. gamemaster) to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
