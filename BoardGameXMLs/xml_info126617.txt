			<description> This is a board game for two players, played using 9 tokens for each player and a pair of dice. This game actually simulates is a war using projectiles between two fictional factions. The two factions hurl projectiles at each other, like in the game battleships. This game is different from battleships in two aspects - the players can see each others' boards and it is a dice roll which determines where the projectile hits. &lt;br/&gt; Each player has a board of 25 squares (5 rows x 5 columns) where he deploys his nine soldiers in any fashion. Players take turns rolling the two dice. First die is used to select a row and second one to select a column. Each dice roll is a hurl of the projectile at the opponent field. The outcome of the 'hurl' is determined as below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the outcome on both dice are less than or equal to 5, then soldier at the square determined by the row and column found from the dice roll (if not empty) is removed. If only row dice is equal to six, then the player can choose a row. If only column dice is equal to six, then the player can choose a column. If both dice give six, then the player cannot move this turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues till one of the players run out of all his soldiers. Then the other player is the winner. A variant can be played on a single board with all the soldiers of both players in it. Rules can be modified to accommodate 'friendly fire' (player hitting his own soldiers) or 'field battle'(if player hit his own soldier, he can move the soldier one square to capture an opponent soldier)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
