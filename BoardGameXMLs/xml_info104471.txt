							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Batman Returns (SEGA 8bit)</name>
									
			<description>Batman Returns is a video game for various platforms based on the movie of the same name. The Sega console versions (i.e. Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Sega Mega-CD, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear) were published by Sega themselves while the NES and Super NES versions were developed and published by Konami. The PC version was published by Konami and developed by Spirit of Discovery. The Amiga version was developed by Denton Designs, and also published by Konami. There is also an Atari Lynx version, published by Atari themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with the 16-bit versions, the 8-bit versions of the game are side-scrolling platform games. However, the titles were created independently of the 16-bit versions. This version featured a unique branched level system, allowing players to choose from an easy and difficult route. The latter typically forced players to use rope swinging to navigate over large floorless areas in these versions of levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Batman Returns (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
