							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tarsh War: The Lunar Army in Dragon Pass</name>
									
			<description>Large-scale freeform module for Glorantha.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Tarsh War is a lavishly-illustrated 48-page book with colour cover, containing a rules-light freeform scenario suitable for up to thirteen players and a referee (though easily playable with fewer). The player characters include a Lunar General, People's Tribune, Cossack Hetman and Prince of Tarsh. Most players are senior officers and troop commanders. Illustrations and detailed unit descriptions are included for the Granite Phalanx Hoplites, Lost Sky Peltasts, Red Dragoons, Bush Rangers, Bagnot Militia and Char-Un Cossacks, as well as Lunar military magicians from the Lunar College of Magic, not forgetting their fearsome Tarshite opponents, from savage Tribal Militia to the Cannibal Virgin Axe-Maidens. Also included are a two-page pictorial map of the Bush Range, full-page illustrations of Lunar and Tarshite troop types, half a dozen pages of Lunar military background, player handouts, regimental marching songs, full wargaming rules and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover: &lt;br/&gt;War-drums are beating along the Bush Range. On the hill-tops blaze the fires of the Tars Gor, summoning the clans to wash their axes in the blood of enemies. The natives are restless, and one thing alone stands between civilization and scalp-taking savagery. A thin red line, a line glimmering with Silver, Bronze and Steel: the Lunar Army!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join the serried ranks! Lead the army of the Great Red Queen to the very foothills of Wintertop! Defend the Pax Lunara in a last-ditch struggle, or plant the Red Vexillum in the smoking ruins of a Tarsh encampment! Live or die, the tales of your exploits will stir the Empire!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tarsh War is an epic Gloranthan scenario about military life. The players are the commanding officers of a Lunar Army operating beyond the Glowline of Lunar Tarsh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is unlike any that has been published before. It offers a unique insight into the Lunar Way of War and the trials and tribulations of life in the Red Army. Besides the scenario and its many cameo episodes, Tarsh War also contains a mass of material useful in other Gloranthan games: a map and description of the Bush Range, illustrations of Lunar and Tarshite troops, articles about Lunar warfare, and several prominent personalities who would grace any campaign set in Dragon Pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Tarsh War, Glorantha returns to its roots: the military actions of the Lunar Empire in Dragon Pass, which were the subject of the very first Gloranthan game, White Bear and Red Moon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Table of Contents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Foreword&lt;br/&gt;     Introduction&lt;br/&gt;     Starting the Game&lt;br/&gt;     On the March&lt;br/&gt;     The Tribes of Tarsh&lt;br/&gt;     Garrisoning the Bush Range&lt;br/&gt;     Heartland Troops&lt;br/&gt;     Map of the Bush Range&lt;br/&gt;     Tarshites Sacrificing a Captive&lt;br/&gt;     War Drums&lt;br/&gt;     GM Reference&lt;br/&gt;     Battles in the Bush&lt;br/&gt;     Red Army&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
