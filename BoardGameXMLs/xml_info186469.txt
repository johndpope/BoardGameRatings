							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mr. Maksimov&#039;s Manor</name>
									
			<description>Mr. Maksimov, the town's wealthy recluse, has passed away and many old rumors are swirling about. Some say that he was descended from royalty, others say that he was an adventurer or a smuggler, and there are even those who claim he was a wizard.  Whatever they believe, the towns people are wasting no time rushing to his estate sale after his death seeking answers to the mystery around him... and to get their hands on as many of his possessions as they can.  Some of Mr. Maksimov's possessions could be worth a fortune but others might end up being worth nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Maksimov's Manor is played in four rounds.  In each of these rounds players will bid on Maksimov's possessions during his estate sale. Item cards that players can gather will either build on each other for more points or cause the player to lose points. When bidding, players need to balance how much value can be gained from the available items with what cards could hurt them. Also, if Mr. Maksimov's will turns up, it could change everything!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Maksimov's Manor is a casual game that both non-gamers and strategy gamers can appreciate.  Casual gamers will enjoy the game's easy to learn rules and the feelings of excitement and anticipation that the game play yields. What will keep strategy gamers coming back is the ability to manipulate the game's odds, constant risk and reward decisions, and subtle elements of social deduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
