			<description>Should you go for it on fourth down? Will your opponent sack you or cause a turnover?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Push your luck if you're feeling lucky in Dr. Livingstin's Sports Dice: Football Edition, a fast-paced, easy-to-play game. Each team gets six dice and simultaneously rolls every play. One quick reference card is all you need to determine the outcome of your play (with no complicated charts or instructions). Use the three advanced cards for even more football action, such as onside kicks and two-point conversions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
