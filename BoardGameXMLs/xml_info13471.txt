			<description>This simple game features a large spinner surrounded by holes to hold marbles. Players place the 4 marbles of their color on any of the holes. For a turn, a player spins the spinner and, if it points to one of his marbles, removes the marble from the circular track and places it in one of the holes in the corner of his color. If it points to another player's marble, the other player removes the marble and places it in his corner. If it points to either of the two gray penalty spaces, the player who spun must put back on the track a marble that he has captured. The first player to gather all four of his marbles into his corner wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also comes with alternate rules in which a player calls out a color and then spins. If the spinner points to a marbles who's color matches the color called the player places it in his corner. In this version the first player to fill his corner with one red, one blue, one green and one yellow marble wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mostly luck, the game combines a spinner (arrow) with the mechanics of roulette = Arrowlette.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
