			<description>Summary of information found on the game website, in Kickstarter updates and in the tutorial videos:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infamy: Welcome to The Big Smoke is an action-packed skirmish game and a range of steampunk miniatures. Join the revolution and battle across an alternate Victorian London!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infamy: Welcome to The Big Smoke uses playing-card-controlled skill management and opposed-dice combat creating strategic, hybrid gameplay. Each character uses playing cards for a pontoon/blackjack mini game, drawing cards as close to 21 as possible to increase the selection of special actions that are available for use.  Bust hands only allow the most basic attacks, but increase the character's defensive abilities.  Attacks are resolved with opposed dice rolls and players alternate activation of their characters, so the players are continuously engaged in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infamy: Welcome to The Big Smoke has a range of intricately detailed, resin-cast, 32mm scale miniatures. Many Infamy: Welcome to The Big Smoke characters are based on famous individuals from literature and history, but given a steampunk twist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is set in an alternate Victorian London in turmoil through the development of advanced new technology. The city is packed with intriguing stories, fascinating characters and a deep history, making for a rich steampunk setting. Character cards describe the unique abilities of each character, creating games that have an exciting cinematic style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
