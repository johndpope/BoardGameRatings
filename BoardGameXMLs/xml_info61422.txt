			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever vice your PCs, or the criminals they seek, might have, The Mug and Bottle is happy to serve their dark desires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zeon the Bold serves drugs, booze and women in the run down warehouse he converted into a tavern and brothel designed specifically to serve the basest vices of the sailors, dockworkers, and anyone else willing to enter The Mug and Bottle. Home to addicts and drunks, Zeon makes no secret that he will help satisfy any vice, if he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have what you need, he certainly knows someone that does, for a price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM Note: This product describes several new drugs in generic terms for your game use. It does contain themes of drug use, addiction, and prostitution that might not be appropriate for your game, but these themes can easily be altered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
