							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deities &amp; Demigods</name>
									
			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as a demigod, and show your devotion to the deities of the Greek pantheon to earn their help moving your troops around the map, doing quests, erecting buildings and monuments, and controlling cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action in Deities &amp;amp; Demigods is driven by an Olympus deck, containing cards for Zeus, Hermes, Ares, and Hephaestus. Each round a deity from Olympus arrives, and you may either show devotion to that deity with an offering of gold, or cash in your devotion to that deity by asking them for a favor:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Zeus will advance your position on an initiative track, which brings rewards, preferential turn order, and initiative when resolving quests later in the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Hermes will bestow you with gold, which you can use to show your devotion to the deities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Ares will grant you troop movement, allowing you to add troops to the board and move them around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Hephaestus will build you artifacts, buildings, and monuments for special effects or end game scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each cycle through the Olympus deck, you'll complete quests, and add a Hera card to the deck. When Hera arrives, you must meet her demands, and if you can, you will be rewarded with victory points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At game end, you'll score points for the quests you've completed, the buildings you've erected, the cities you control, and the deities who's favor you've earned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
