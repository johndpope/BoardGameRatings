							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Major Matt Mason Space Exploration Game</name>
									
			<description>Comment from Keith Meyer's site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot; If a kid wasn't satisfied with the ever increasing popularity of the Major Matt Mason toy line, and just couldn't get enough of the toys themselves or the compliment of non-toy items such as note book binders, wallets, puzzles, etc.... There was this really cool looking boardgame! Not a great game, but hey, it's Major Matt Mason so we had to love it!.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of play was to explore the moon for signs of life. The first explorer who returns to the space ship and is able to point out where there are three signs of life-- as shown by the moon cards--is the winner. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keith Meyer's MMM collector's site entry:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.majormattmason.net/5453.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.majormattmason.net/5453.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
