			<description>In essence a roll/spin and move game, advertised in the 1950s as &amp;quot;fun for all the family&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game board, 2 dice, 4 pawns and 4 sets of coloured counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No image of the board is available but it is apparently a board with an outside track and an inner grid of &amp;quot;Roo&amp;quot; squares. According to the rules the object of the game is to monopolise as many 'Roo blocks' as possible by forming more 3-counter rows - horizontally, vertically or diagonally - than opponents. 10 points are scored each time a row of 3 is formed. A player rolls the dice to move around the track, and the track block on which he lands indicates the Roo block on which he is allowed to place one of his counters. When a particular Roo block means there is no chance for a player to start a row of 3 or block an opponent that block is considered dead and from then on no player moves to it. When all Roo blocks have been played out players compute their scores and highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publication details from The Game Catalog: US Games Through 1950, 8th edition, 1998. Rules from gamearchives.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
