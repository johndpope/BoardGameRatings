							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido: Seiji</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all monks of the Temple of Ro-Kan, Seiji is following a path and element that he was always destined to. Still in the early years of his training this calm and relaxed monk is already showing signs that he will become a great defender of the Jwar Isles, and an asset in the struggle against the chaos. It is told that Seiji sat under the Grand Father tree for a full cycle in meditation, quietly becoming as one with the forest around him and in a deep communion with the sacred Kami. The secrets he learned now enable Seiji to seek out the help of the natural world around him, it comes to his and the Temple&amp;rsquo;s aid. Enemies find themselves rooted to the spot, held firm as they are bound and restrained by the very ground itself. Along with this ability Seiji has also achieved a higher level of understanding and attunement with his own body, enabling him to focus his energies and recover from even the most severe of wounds at an astounding rate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
