			<description>Mixed Signals: The Circuit Board Game is a game in which two players compete for the domination of a circuit board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players play as low and high voltage (or zeroes and ones if you prefer) and take turns placing triangular circuit tiles on the board. This in an effort to cause favorable voltage transitions in the circuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal for each player is to place all of their voltage tokens on the board by getting a majority of the circuit to carry their voltage. This is not as easy as it might sound since your opponent can and will hijack your sections of the circuit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts out with only two input tiles, one carrying a low voltage and one carrying a high voltage. Throughout the game, you will find signal mixing tiles and even new input tiles that make the game increasingly challenging, complex and fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
