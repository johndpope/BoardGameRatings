			<description>Dracula is a text adventure game developed by Rod Pike and Ian Ellery for the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum home computers. The game is based on the novel &amp;quot;Dracula&amp;quot; by Bram Stoker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An English lawyer travels to Carpathia to meet Count Dracula regarding a routine property transaction, but soon learns that his client has sinister ulterior intentions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a standard text adventure with static graphics in some locations. It is divided into three parts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;First Night&amp;quot; - The young solicitor arrives in Count Dracula's country, staying at the The Golden Krone Hotel; strange events are observed&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;quot;The Arrival&amp;quot; - After an eventful journey, he arrives at Dracula's castle, and soon learns the real nature of his host's intentions; he realizes that he must escape if he is to survive...&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;quot;The Hunt&amp;quot; - A psychiatrist at an insane asylum in England receives a strange letter from a friend on business overseas, warning of &amp;quot;boxes of earth&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;undead&amp;quot;; meanwhile a patient at the asylum grows increasingly disturbed...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is notable for receiving a &amp;quot;15&amp;quot; certificate from the British Board of Film Censors on account of the gory images it contains. However, CRL expressed disappointment with this as they had hoped for an &amp;quot;18&amp;quot; certificate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CRL followed Dracula with three further adventures of a similar style, Frankenstein, Jack the Ripper and Wolfman, all of which also received BBFC ratings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dracula (adventure game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
