			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Does your Crew have what it takes to fly the Good Shepherd&amp;rsquo;s Run?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SMUGGLER&amp;rsquo;S GUIDE TO THE RIM is a supplement for the FIREFLY RPG that is designed for both players and GMs. The third supplement in the line, the SMUGGLER&amp;rsquo;S GUIDE TO THE RIM introduces Reputation rules for Crewmembers, 12 new archetypes, the Good Shepherd&amp;rsquo;s Run, more Chinese translations, more rules, new in game aids, a pair of Episodes, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We think you&amp;rsquo;ll appreciate the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Reputation Rules: Find out how to earn your Reputation, how to lose it, and how to make it count. While Reputation rules are player-facing, Gamemaster characters will employ Dispositions to guide interactions with the Crew. In addition to the new Reputation rules, you&amp;rsquo;ll also dive into plenty of examples, read about the four Factions in the &amp;rsquo;Verse, and get an overview of Dispositions, too!&lt;br/&gt;    New Crewmember Archetypes and Boats: You&amp;rsquo;ll read about the suggested Reputation die ratings for the Serenity Crew and discover twelve, brand new archetypes along with new ships. They are: Alliance Contractor, Alliance Dogfighter, Alliance General, Folk Hero, Freedom Fighter, Roving Medic, Corporate Broker, Corporate Lackey, Corporate Researcher, Friendly Face, Lone Hood, and the Shady Entrepreneur.&lt;br/&gt;    Good Shepherd&amp;rsquo;s Run: Each location in the Blue Sun and Kalidasa Systems is presented like a brand new Episode for you to dive in and explore with new story ideas, ship rules, adventure ideas, new Antagonists, new Chinese phrases, and a whole lot more! In the Good Shepherd&amp;rsquo;s Run, you&amp;rsquo;ll fly to places like Deadwood, Ghost, Kuan Lo, and strange locations like The Nest!&lt;br/&gt;    All in the Family: Written by Margaret Weis. Nothing&amp;rsquo;s more important than family, &amp;rsquo;cept maybe a big ole strongbox of gold coins. Bao-Huang Qin, the leader of the Dragon Tong, has tasked your Crew with recovering his loot, thought lost after it&amp;rsquo;d been confiscated by the Alliance. Qin ain&amp;rsquo;t askin&amp;rsquo;, though&amp;mdash;he&amp;rsquo;s holding Jayne&amp;rsquo;s momma as collateral and his daughter, Fang-Hua Qin, is accompanying the Crew on this job. Easy, right? Problem is it&amp;rsquo;s on a wreck floating in Reaver space, and four mercs sent by Qin&amp;rsquo;s unlikely rival Agnes Pierce will be racin&amp;rsquo; your Crew to the prize&amp;mdash;and they don&amp;rsquo;t give a damn about Jayne&amp;rsquo;s momma.&lt;br/&gt;    Circling the Wagons: Written by Greg Stolze. Folk in the Core think they can put a leash on damn near everyone else in the &amp;rsquo;Verse, and one of their leashes is named Special Independent Investigator Garth Mandrake. But a leash matters less to them what love power than who&amp;rsquo;s holdin&amp;rsquo; it. Mandrake&amp;rsquo;s found himself caught between two political cliques within the Alliance. Their tiff strands him on an uncharted rock facetiously known as Barry's Kingdom, with each side hiring a ship&amp;mdash;the Crew and their greatest rivals&amp;mdash;to pick him up and get him under their control. The Crews got to deal with double-dealing, rampaging wrecks and the namesake of the planetoid to get the SII in hand while he&amp;rsquo;s still breathing. And that&amp;rsquo;s before the Reavers show up.&lt;br/&gt;    Expanded Appendix: We&amp;rsquo;ve included a brand new FAQ, Chinese translations, more Distinctions, maps for the Kalidasa and Blue Sun Systems, and a set of brand new tools for players and GMs&amp;mdash;an Advancement Sheet that includes Reputation die ratings and a GMC Sheet to take the guesswork out of building GMCs, too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
