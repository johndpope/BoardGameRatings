			<description>Collect a Corpse is a tile laying, build your own royal corpse, game for two players. There is also some dice rolling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start the game with either the torso of the king or the queen of Sweden. The goal is to finish your corpse as complete  as possible with your own limbs at the right places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you draw a card that either shows a bodypart of either the king or the queen, a black dice or a white dice.&lt;br/&gt;If it's a bodypart (it doesn't have to be your own) place it on your torso. You can later exchange them for parts matching your torso if you have the maximum number of that part (usually 2).&lt;br/&gt;If it's a card roll a die and see the charts: The white die is usually constructive for you and the black die destructive for your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the last card is drawn you score points. Parts matching your torso score double points if they are in the right place otherwise the score the number printed on them (inner parts give 2 the outer 3 points). You get no points for the opponents parts on your body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
