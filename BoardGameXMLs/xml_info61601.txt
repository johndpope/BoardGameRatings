			<description>Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fifth Wheel (the First Book of West Marque) is a western-fantasy RPG. In it, you play a Fifth Wheel, a lawman's lawman. Set in the world of West Marque, a not-so-wild west of some forgotten yesterday, the law of the land is yours to uphold. The game is designed to cater to three types of players: 1. Those wanting quick, one shot games filled with snarling gunfights. 2. Those wanting longer campaign styled play. and 3. Those seeking a blend of both. The core mechanic is condensed to a handful of pages but many optional rules are available so you can suit the game your personal tastes. &amp;quot;Outlaws, dirt riders, low lifes, and Dead Priests...Bring them to justice, hang 'em high, or put 'em in their graves. It's all up to you.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
