							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Crater</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 48 x 30 inch, full color battlemap of a Desert Crater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions, the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT) .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;You must not enter the cave! It can take you towards many elemental planes of existence, all deadly to the unprepared. The Guardian Statues are also not as lifeless as they may appear&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Elderly Guardian Wizard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crater is an exterior map of a circular-shaped valley surrounded by high cliffs. There is a cave entrance to the west flanked by two statues and two mountain passes to the north and east with two small stone buildings in the center of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crater is intended for use in fantasy and horror games. It may also be of use in modern pulp or horror games as a ruin or archeology site. It may also be an interesting location in a science fiction game on a backwater planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Guardians of the Gateway:  Local legends tell of a fiery meteor that struck the highest mountain in the land, Vredemont. The legends say that after the comet struck demons spewed forth from the mountain&amp;rsquo;s zenith and plagued the land. The demons were only stopped by the Guardians, mighty wizards that ascended the mountain and sealed the gate that was opened by the meteor strike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When an earthquake hits the mountain range where Vredemont resides a century later, suddenly demons appear and attack the people living at the nadir of the mountains. If they are saved by the player characters, the townsfolk beg them to climb to the summit of Vredemont and find the Guardians if they are still alive to help them reseal the demons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the top of the mountain, the group finds two extremely old men, an elderly wizard and an aged sculptor. They warn them to not approach the cave to the west as they have sealed it with the Guardian Statues to prevent things from exiting the cave but they also prevent others from entering the cave on this side.  They have felt the earthquake as well, but cannot leave these gateway undefended due to an ancient oath. The Guardians may be persuaded to help the group if they give them an oath to their cause. In that case, the sculptor helps them carve two more Guardian Statues from the crags to be placed wherever the new rift is at in the mountains to seal it as well. But while they are trying to make new Guardian Statues, suddenly they are attacked by gargoyles swooping down from the top of the cliffs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
