			<description>&amp;quot;Kalory: A game for all fun loving, weight conscious people!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kalory is a roll-and-move, weight-loss-themed Monopoly derivative which instructs players on methods of losing weight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After rolling dice, players move their playing pieces around the board, gaining or losing Kalory chips (which represent weight). They also perform actions on cards that they draw, depending on which space they land on. The first player to lose all of their Kalory chips is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may select different game lengths: a lightweight game, a middleweight game, or a heavyweight game. The game length corresponds to an increasing number of starting Kalory chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
