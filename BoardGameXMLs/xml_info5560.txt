			<description>Based on the popular comic strip, Steve Canyon, this game lets up to four players fly their F-105 Thunderchiefs to three different air bases. The first person to complete this circuit wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very luck driven, in that a roll of one die determines movement on the map and also altitude increments of 1,000 ft. Player choices amount to deciding what altitude to fly and which air field to visit next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Random weather cards cause problems while flying over certain areas of the board or flying through certain altitudes. Fuel consumption is basically one unit every time the die is rolled, and running out of fuel can force a landing at an emergency air field or cause a pilot to bail out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is interesting because of the scale plastic planes used as playing pieces (actual reproductions of the F-105) and in the cardboard 'control panels' which players use to keep track of altitude and fuel. The rules also include a two-page insert describing &amp;quot;the world's most powerful one-man airplane&amp;quot; in detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
