							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mystery of Prometheus Island</name>
									
			<description>From publisher burb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of explorers head out into the Atlantic, on course to a point on a map, directed by a cryptic note. There they discover a derelict ship, a mysterious island, the ruins of an ancient civilization and beasts found only in the writings of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Can they make it back home when their ship disappears from the middle of a tranquil cove?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The driving force behind the adventure is a woman who was left a set of map coordinates off the Florida coast (29.XX N 76.YY W) by a dying uncle most of the family called a &amp;ldquo;loonie.&amp;rdquo; Still, to her, the wild stories of adventure in exotic locations her uncle told has sparked her curiosity as to what may lie hidden around the world. Now aboard a small chartered boat, the Carolina Dreamer, she speeds toward an adventure she&amp;rsquo;s sure her late uncle wants her to enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
