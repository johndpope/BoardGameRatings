							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Faceless King</name>
									
			<description>The Faceless King is a card game of hidden identities and deductive reasoning with a little insanity. Each player has 4 different identities that they can choose to use or not at their discretion, all for the primary purpose of determining who is the faceless king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Identities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The King - Functions as Assassin, Oracle, Magus, and Witch&lt;br/&gt;The Magus  - Can trade a card for another card between two players&lt;br/&gt;The Oracle  - Can make a player reveal a card and discard it &lt;br/&gt;The Illusionist  - Counters the Oracle&lt;br/&gt;The Wizard  - Can hide a card previously revealed.&lt;br/&gt;The Witch  - Can force another player to tell them if they have a certain card, cant ask if they have the King.&lt;br/&gt;The Spectre  - Can resurrect a new card to replace one lost.&lt;br/&gt;The Knight  - Counters the Assassin&lt;br/&gt;The Assassin  - Can Assassinate a specific card&lt;br/&gt;The Monk - Counters The Spectre &lt;br/&gt;The Ranger  - Counters The Magus&lt;br/&gt;The Undead King  - Makes Offense Abilities Unblockable&lt;br/&gt;The Bard  - Counters The Witch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before beginning play remove The King from the deck of cards, based on the number of players determine how many cards you need. Set aside that many cards minus 1. Place The King on the top of the deck and then shuffle the cards thoroughly. For example is you have 3 players you would shuffle and deal 11 cards face down then shuffle the King card into that. Deal the cards to each player from there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal four cards to each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then each take a turn going around the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, they state an ability they wish to perform, based off one of the actions that the various cards can do. The player states &amp;ldquo;As a X i want to Y&amp;rdquo;, For example &amp;ldquo;As an assassin I want to assassinate your second from the left card&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However if they do not have to have the card to successfully pull off the action. The targeted player can choose to call their &amp;ldquo;bluff&amp;rdquo; so to speak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That player must reveal if he has the card or not. If the player does have the card the action goes through as normal, if they do not have the card they will lose 1 of their other cards as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The targeted player has repercussions as well if they accuse the player of bluffing and they are not, not only does the action go through as normal but they also lose an additional card.&lt;br/&gt;On that same note the player who is targeted with an ability can also bluff and say they can block the action with appropriate card, however their bluff can be called out as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or the may choose to pass. However once a card has been discarded its ability can no longer be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If The King is revealed or assassinated everyone but The King&amp;rsquo;s holder wins. If The King can outlast and outwit his opponents than he wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If all a players identities are revealed they are out of the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
