			<description>A jungle-themed cooperative children's game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme&lt;br/&gt;Baba Banana and his four monkey friends have decided to throw a party. They've got the decorations and the food, but they don't have any guests yet. So they are running, climbing and jumping through the jungle to invite the other animals. Will they be able to invite enough friends for the biggest and greatest party the jungle has ever seen?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game&lt;br/&gt;The players work together, trying  to get seven or more animal tiles and three monkeys to the clearing before the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play&lt;br/&gt;The board shows a track consisting of 18 spaces. Each of the spaces shows a different animal; the same animals are also printed on the tiles. At the center of the board there is a clearing.&lt;br/&gt;The 5 monkeys are placed on random spaces. The animal tiles are shuffled and placed next to the board in a face-down stack. Players take turns drawing a tile and then look for the corresponding space on the board. Then they try to reach that space with one of the 5 monkeys. Each of the monkeys carries 1-3 fruits, and this number shows exactly how many spaces that monkey can move. If none of the monkeys can reach that space, the tile is removed from the game. If a monkey succeeds, the tile is placed on the clearing space that shows the fruit which the successful monkey is carrying. Then the player may also place the monkey on the clearing. Monkeys that have been placed on the clearing stay there for the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all animal tiles have been used or all monkeys are on the clearing. If there are 7 or more animal tiles and 3 monkeys on the clearing, the players win the game. Only animal tiles accompanied by a monkey count.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
