							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Terror War</name>
									
			<description>Terror War is a DTP solitaire, strategy level game of the current conflict against al Qaeda and various potential adversaries. The player takes the side of the U.S./West and must choose one of the offered strategies. Operations include military, diplomatic, and intelligence. Economics have been added and interleaved as an important factor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initial strategy in the Historic game is set and one must follow through with it until allowed to change strategy. This presents both opportunity and difficulty. Terror operations are governed by Random Event and various rules. While the terror side may not seem too active, it's very existence constitutes a tremendous threat to the U.S./Western position in the world. Players will feel the pressure and frustration of achieving the right balance of strategy to means. A half dozen or so different strategies are available to play with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game spans 20 one-year turns, from 2001 to 2021. By the end of this time the U.S. side must either bring off a victory, or lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a tough, strange war and the game reflects that reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download rules, map, counters, etc at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX?14@153.EuETbiw6OXw.45@.1dd43f4f/0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX?14@153.EuETbiw6OXw.45@.1dd4...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
