							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Energy Quest</name>
									
			<description>In Energy Quest, each player is the president of an energy corporation, developing energy sources so as to sell the output.  Two basic types of property are on the board: raw materials (coal, oil, etc.) and power sites, where energy can be produced (electric stations and the like).  World Oil Price will rise steadily if unpredictably as the game progresses, making some propositions profitable in the later stages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two sets of currency: dollars and kilowatt-hours (kWh).  You buy energy from a player when you land on his developed power site, but the real victory condition is accumulating kWh &amp;quot;receipts&amp;quot; whenever you land on your won power sites or pass &amp;quot;Take Off&amp;quot; (e.g. &amp;quot;Go&amp;quot;).  Money and property are not counted at the end, so you must gauge carefully how much money to invest in kWh receipts as the game goes on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
