			<description>Blind Wizard Brawl is phygital card game by Wrench Games. &lt;br/&gt;It's a mini deck building dueling game where players combat to become the most powerful wizards in the land.&lt;br/&gt;Combining classic cards and a digital app, blind Wizard Brawl combines the classic table top staple with the modern convenience of an app.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a world where magic is the key to all life, wizards are gods. You play as one of the most powerful wizards in the land, however, all power comes at a cost. The magic has taken your sight, leaving you only aware of your own power and the magic you possess. &lt;br/&gt;Using your limited perception of the world, you must use your skills in magic to absorb and unleash magic upon your enemies to become the one true wizard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;Each Player has their own private app on their device.&lt;br/&gt;Generate a Wizard on your app. In private.&lt;br/&gt;Separate the cars into three separate stack, one for each type of card: Wave, Growth, and Blaze.&lt;br/&gt;All players take one card from each of these stacks to create their starting deck of three cards. Shuffle your new deck and draw a starting had of two cards.&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with whoever has the worst eyesight or the most magical powers. You decide which.&lt;br/&gt;On each of your turns, you do one of two things:&lt;br/&gt;Do some Wizard Magic (Chant, Cast, or Mind Blast)&lt;br/&gt;Then, draw a card from your deck.&lt;br/&gt;Now, end your turn and play proceeds clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;Any player who dies announces their defeat.&lt;br/&gt;PLAY CONTINUES UNTIL ONLY ONE WIZARD REMAINS.&lt;br/&gt;TO WIN, YOU MUST BE THIS WIZARD, THE GREATEST WIZARD!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
