							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Master&#039;s Decree</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theron Hawksfar, Westbrook&amp;rsquo;s town master, isn&amp;rsquo;t convinced that all is well in town. Several farm folk have reported sightings of creatures scampering about and causing trouble. Now, the murders of several local hunters and the kidnapping of two children confirm the threat from the South Forest. With the impending arrival of the kingdom's most powerful guild of merchants, Hawksfar wants the wood tamed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Master&amp;rsquo;s Decree is set in the sprawling, old forest that grows just south of the town of Westbrook. Included in this 112-page book are background information about the situation in town and the goings on in the forest, plenty of rumors and NPCs for the characters to interact with, three forest lairs written to be inserted into any game session, and three linked, full-length adventures. With the material in this book, you'll challenge your group for many sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Master's Decree stands on its own and can be dropped into any fantasy setting with little or no modification. Those who already own Beginnings: Westbrook will find that this book extends the information found there. While you don't need them to run this book, its content builds on the events and adventures introduced in Beginnings: Westbrook, thus expanding the setting and making it even more useful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
