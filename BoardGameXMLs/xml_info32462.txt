			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Baseset&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An easy-to-learn card game of battling wizards. Each player uses the same starter deck of cards, but there are apparently additional sets of items available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mages can transform between werewolf, human, and vampire, depending on the cards played. Spells cost cards (resources) to play, and have a series of effects - essentially healing, direct damage, or items that affect future card play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different forms suffer different amounts of damage from various spells - a silver lightning spell, for example, affects werewolves more than humans. The different forms also have got some abilities. The werewolf for example has got the ability darkness more than night, which means the oppenents handsize is decreased by one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to defeat your opponent a series of times, starting as a mage, and progressing to high mage, and finally to battle mage. Each rank has different life totals and has some effect on gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extension and deck construction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more experienced players are some extensions available.&lt;br/&gt;With the extensions you are able to setup up your own decks.&lt;br/&gt;Each deck consists of 80 cards. Each card with the same name and the same icon you can take up to 8 cards into your deck. If the text in the middle part of the card has got a different color, you have to take less cards.&lt;br/&gt;Bronze = 4 cards&lt;br/&gt;Silver = 2 cards&lt;br/&gt;Gold = 1 card only&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You always have to play with an evil and undead transformation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The extensions have got different levels.&lt;br/&gt;The level of baseset is simple. The extensions demon and necromancer have the levels &amp;quot;difficult&amp;quot; and the extension lich is &amp;quot;profi&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;There are some sample decks in some articles in the web available. The next SpielXpress magazine in decembre will explain some sample decks as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experienced players should play the game with the extensions right from the beginning. The baseset is for beginners only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tournament rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was designed for tournaments. You can find the actual rules in the games wiki.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MageBattle is NOT a trading card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
