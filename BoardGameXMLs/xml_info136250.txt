			<description>Where does wild anise grow? And what does it mean to &amp;quot;winnow&amp;quot; a plant? Gardening is one of the most popular pastimes. No matter whether a cottage garden is growing at home, a garden plot is thriving on the outskirts of town, or a few flower boxes embellish the balcony, in Welt des Gartens, players with a green thumb deeply immerse themselves in the world of their hobby &amp;ndash; and in doing so, even the most experienced gardener will learn something new.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before starting the game, players agree on how many questions they'll face. Each turn, one player reads a question from the card; the question has multiple answers listed below it, and 1-3 answers will be correct &amp;ndash; but there's no way of knowing how many are right ahead of making your guess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the active player reads off the answers, each player can place 1-3 guess markers on the numbers matching those answers. When the player reveals the correct answers, anyone who guessed incorrectly scores no points, no matter how many other answers they got right. Players who guessed correctly with all of their placed tokens score as many points as the number of tokens they placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After finishing the agreed upon number of questions, whoever has the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
