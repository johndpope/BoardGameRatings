			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to CampAntics, the board game of summer camp adventures, mischief, activities, and lots of social interaction. If you&amp;rsquo;re curious about summer camps, or have already been to one, you&amp;rsquo;ll love this game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CampAntics is primarily for children from 7 to 14 years of age. The summer camp theme is also very attractive to older children, parents, and grandparents. Each trip around the board is one, very realistic day at camp. Campers decide how many days to play, and enjoy a social experience like no other. During a camper&amp;rsquo;s stay at CampAntics, points are won and lost with the ups and downs of daily life at a great summer camp. Each space on the board relates to an activity that you would do at camp.  Some spaces will reward you for an activity and others will penalize you for let&amp;rsquo;s say... throwing a water balloon.  You roll dice to move and each trip around the board is a day at camp.  You choose the number of days based on level of play. The winner is the camper with the most points (acorns) at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
