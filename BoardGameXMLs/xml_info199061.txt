			<description>The greatest warriors of history have been assembled for the ultimate battle to determine their legacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warrior Clash is a capture and elimination strategy game that pits greatest warriors in history against each other. Players will draft teams of warriors, defend their land, collect resources with the goal of conquering their enemies. These battles are played atop modular gameboards which create hundreds of possible areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each warrior has a different arrangement of trait scores between the categories of Grit, Agility, Ingenuity and Strength. As warriors are moved throughout the gameboard, the players will attempt to rely on relative strengths and exploit weaknesses of their enemies. When matching sides of two opponent warriors are aligned, they can do battle. The trait scores determine the handicap of the fight, but rolls of the dice determine the victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will your team be the last one standing?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
