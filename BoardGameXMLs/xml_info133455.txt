			<description>Arkanoid: Doh it Again (アルカノイド Ｄｏｈ Ｉｔ Ａｇａｉｎ) is a 1997 Super Nintendo game released by Taito. It was released in both NTSC and PAL formats, and received release in Australia, the United States, the UK, and Japan. It was developed as a sequel to the original 1986 arcade release of Arkanoid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a ship using the SNES d-pad. Rounds are completed when all the colour and silver blocks on the screen have been eliminated. Enemys enter from the doors at the top of the play area. Every ten rounds a boss enemy will have to be fought. Some of the blocks contain power-ups that you must catch with your paddle to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a total of 99 levels, an edit mode in which users can create their own levels, power-ups, and two-player capabilities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Arkanoid: Doh It Again&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
