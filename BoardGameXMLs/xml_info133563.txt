			<description>Dirge: Shadow of Olympus is a revamped, Omen: A Reign of War-themed edition of Dirge: Carnage in Crimson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dirge: Shadow of Olympus, players lead ferocious creatures of myth into battle. From the mighty Cyclops to the swift and elusive Uat, each beast brings unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses to the arena. Players command their creatures in heated combat using equal parts strategy and tactics, and utilizing an easy-to-grasp action point-based combat system. Victory goes to the player with the last beast standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dirge revolves around players managing actions each turn to protect their figures and to destroy their opponent&amp;rsquo;s figures. Each figure has a combination of two special abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
