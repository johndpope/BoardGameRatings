			<description>This is a trivia game with over 1000 questions divided into five categories: Humanity, Earth, History, Technology, and Nature.  Players move around the board trying to correctly answer questions so that they can earn chips from each area.  The chips are used to surpass obstacles along the way, and players can rearrange the obstacles on the game board.  The first player to reach the last square on the board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several aspects of the game that make it family-friendly.  The first is that questions can be answered in multiple-choice style so that players can try to deduce the answer rather than having to know the fact directly.  The second is that there is a catch-up mechanism which boosts the player in last place so that they can compete more effectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
