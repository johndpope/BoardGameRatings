			<description>First-person Monster Boxing with Customizable Boxing Gear!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play a secret human boxer in a beastly world. She's outmuscled, undersized, and in way over her head. Can she master the skills needed to get to the top of the legendary boxing leagues of Beasthalla?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Develop a fighting rhythm between attack and defense, and don't give up hope if you can't beat these monsters on your first try. There's a host of skills to train, and new gear to acquire that can give you an edge in the ring. Build up your boxing skills and gear to match your personal style, and beat the grand champion of the Ultra League to unlock NewGame Plus mode and reach a new level of challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beast Boxing Turbo is a complete remake of critically-acclaimed iPhone game Beast Boxing 3D from 2010. The game has been completely redesigned for the desktop market, with rewritten story, additional content, redesigned fight mechanics, faster action, hugely improved character upgrade and gear systems, and redesigned enemy AI. We took the past two years of player feedback to recreate the gameplay in a way that emphasizes speed, quick reactions, and the zen of fighting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Punch monsters in the face!&lt;br/&gt;    Upgrade your skills to level 99&lt;br/&gt;    Equip 35+ unique gear pieces&lt;br/&gt;    Enjoy wild monster designs from lead artist Khang Le&lt;br/&gt;    Take on retro-style challenge with unique freestyle boxing gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
