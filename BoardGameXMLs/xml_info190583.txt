							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lady Satan 1944</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I'll answer the invitation to death... but not with bullets.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When everyone she loved was killed in a Nazi bombing raid, a young woman surrendered her entire existence to a quest for revenge. Under the name Lady Satan, she first hunted and killed the Nazis whereever she could with conventiional weapons... but later, she became a master of black magic. Even after the Nazi monsters were broken and consigned to history, she continued her fight, becoming a hunter of all manner of supernatural monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lady Satan 1944 presents four illustrrated tales of the mysterious Lady Satan--two from her career as a traditional spy and assasin, and two from her existence as a creature-killing sorceress. The book also contains a short story by Steve Miller (who has written fiction for Dragonlance and Star Wars) that reveals how she gained access to magic, and OGL d20 Modern rules that allows for the incorporation of the spirit-powered magic of Lady Satan in campaigns where magic is supposed to be rare or non-existent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
