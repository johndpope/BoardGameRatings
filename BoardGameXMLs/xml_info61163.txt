			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next piece of essential gear covered in the &amp;quot;Adventurer Essentials&amp;quot; line is the Lantern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You cannot fight what you cannot see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t solve a puzzle if you can&amp;rsquo;t find the pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without light, there is no heroism or victory, just blind frustration and futility. Lanterns are a uniquely human invention, a mechanical substitute for the keen night-eyes the nearly-human races possess. The lantern provides a way for a night-fighting human to meet his orcish, elven or dwarvish counterpart on equal footing, and the glow of a lantern lit city visible on the open plain is a tangible reminder of the power of human ingenuity to beat back the darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No adventurer would ever dare wander into the coldly lethal caverns under the known world without a lantern held high. No walled city&amp;rsquo;s watchman would make his rounds without a kerosene flash clipped to his belt. No peasant farmer surviving at the edge of the world would dare venture out into his field to dump the night dirt without a lantern vouch-safing his steps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lantern is an adventuring essential- a humble tool that&amp;rsquo;s infinitely useful and that no wanderer could survive without.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This release for the Adventurer Essentials line details the history of the Lantern, as well as various mundane light sources from the simple candle, the Dwarven Foss-kalk, various human lanters and the fuel they use to illuminate. Additionally, eleven new magical variations are also presented. From the Ambusher's Lantern to a Stonecutters Bullseye and the Lantern of the Dying Wisp. Add some illumination to your campaign with this essential PDF!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
