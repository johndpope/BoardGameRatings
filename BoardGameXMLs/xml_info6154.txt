			<description>English translation of title: The Sinking of Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of Bandai's Game for Adult - &amp;quot;IF&amp;quot; series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game for Adult meaning aimed at older players, not anything with objectionable content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;If&amp;quot; just refers to the their gimmick of setting up each game in the series as a &amp;quot;What if... (insert game scenario)&amp;quot;. In this case 'If Japan started sinking, what would you do'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complexity 1 on Bandai's 1-7 scale (1=easiest).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, earthquakes and volcanoes and the like are devastating Japan, and the object is to rescue as many of your people as your can. Cards are used to determine the type of disaster and its location. hex overlays are used after the disaster to represent the aftermath of the devastation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the dull packaging, the multi-part game board itself is nice and colorful, and sturdily mounted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
