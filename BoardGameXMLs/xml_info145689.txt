			<description> User Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A superb web-based flash game in which you start out with one character, the roque Josh, in search of treasure and artifacts. You travel, fight and dodge enemy fire throughout the 10 stages of the game. In the first stage you are by yourself but Erica the arbalester soon joins you at the end of stage 1, and Selena the dark Cleric follows at the end of stage 2. Two more party members, Glenn the air wizard and Ray the engineer also join your party at ensuing stages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All party members have unique sets of skills and different attack styles. However, you can have three of the characters in your party at any time. There are various weapon upgrades, healing potions and an array of coins to be collected throughout the stages. The coins can be used to buy and improve your characters'abilities at the end of every stage. There is no gainsaying the fact that you can replay each stage as many times as you want. However, the experience awarded is more or less predetermined so replaying the early levels becomes pointless after a certain point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
