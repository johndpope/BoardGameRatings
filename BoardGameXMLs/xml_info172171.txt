			<description>Publisher's Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lure Absorbing Man to the Water!  Absorbing Man has decided to eliminate the Incredible Hulk. He has set up a trap for the Hulk in a hydro power plant.  You must join forces with She-Hulk and the Hulk to get rid of Absorbing Man, once and for all.  Here's the plan.  Since Absorbing Man can absorb the properties of anything he touches, She-Hulk and the Hulk will attempt to make Absorbing Man turn himself into fire.  Then they will throw him into the sea, where he will disappear forever!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Incredible Hulk was published as part of the Marvel Comics Super Heroes Game Book, and the board is a double-page spread of the book which is laid flat to play.  It is a fairly standard roll-and-move game where players must move two tokens representing Hulk and She-Hulk one at at time along a track by rolling an electronic die.  Along the way, some spaces will move players forward or back or cause a loss or gain of a turn.  If a player lands on another player's token, he or she moves back four spaces.  First player to reach the end with both markers wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
