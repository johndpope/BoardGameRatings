							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Traumaville Tryout Terror</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters are attending Traumaville High&amp;rsquo;s annual cheerleading camp and squad tryouts, honing their skills in hopes of becoming part of Traumaville High&amp;rsquo;s cheerleader squad. (Or, often in the case of &amp;ldquo;Spirit Squad Boys&amp;rdquo; because their parents made them, sort of like ballet lessons.) What no one knows is that &amp;ldquo;Prima&amp;rdquo; Donna St. Claire, former captain of the squad, has returned. You see, though almost assured of becoming team captain yet again last year, Donna was humiliated in an incident involving the super-human pyramid. She ended up not even making the squad, losing her point of cherished place on the team and status as the most popular girl in school. After that she quit school and went into hiding. She blames her team (incompetents!), opponents (sabotage!), and the judges/coaches (biased!) and, of course, the people who shared her humiliation with everyone &amp;ndash; the school paper! Now they&amp;rsquo;re all going to pay. Players can be Traumaville High Cheerleaders, Traumaville Spirit Squad Boys, or Cheerleading Camp coaches; one person can be the journalist for the school paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
