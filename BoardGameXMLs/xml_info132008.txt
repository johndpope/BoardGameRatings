			<description>Scared to Death is a horror monster battle card game for 1 to 4 players. The goal of the game is to battle your way through an opponents monsters and steal all of their precious victims.  When a player has no victims left in play, they lose the game and their opponent is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scared to Death uses the Ignats Card System; a battle card system designed by October Games that enables players to play with an infinite amount of cards in one match.  Players may choose to play a quick game by each using one, 28-card deck, or they may opt for a longer, more complex game, where each player uses five, 28 card decks!  Using multiple decks makes it possible to &amp;ldquo;level up&amp;rdquo; your monsters, making them stronger over the coarse of the game... yeah, you heard me: your cards can level up like characters in a video game.  Level 9 is currently the highest, although the system is designed in a way that makes it possible to release more expansions in the future; meaning your cards could level up infinitely!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was designed for 2 players, although variations for 1, 3 and 4 players have been added. Most games that claim you can play solo, end up being designed for 1 person, leaving players feeling as if they are playing a solo game alongside other players. This system uses a card driven AI, so when you are playing solo, you still feel that you are playing against another person. Of coarse the artificial intelligence is not as smart as a human brain, so the AI is given some special advantages to make it a worthy opponent. The four player variant is simply a 2 on 2 battle, that feels almost the same as a 2 player game, but you are partnered up with a teammate, with whom you can trade cards and devise strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further, Scared to Death can be played using only the cards, or with an add-on betting system that uses tokens, money, or even Halloween candy!   Overall, the Card System opens up a wide range of possibilities, including new, and entirely separate games that can be played using your existing Scared to Death cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
