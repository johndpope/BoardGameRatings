							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quirkative Joker Poker</name>
									
			<description>Game time is variable based on number of players and rounds you chose to play. Each round has 5 simple stages. You have 2 early decisions to make, then sit back and watch the round unfold. Each round has 1 winner and 1 loser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts the game with 3 Heart Tiles, 2 QJP Tiles and 1 Joker Tile. Each player gets dealt 2 cards (as in poker).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first choice is do you use a QJP tile? This will change 1 or both of your starting cards. You can then choose to use your Joker. If you play your Joker and you end the round with the best hand you win an extra Heart Tile. If you have the worst hand, then you don't lose a heart tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hand then plays out, as it would in poker, however, hands  are all revealed so everybody can see what people have. There is no gambling. You all see how everybody gets on. Then the player with the worst hand, loses a heart. If you lose all your hearts then you are out. Last player standing wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the game uses a poker mechanic, it differs as all players show their hand, so there is no gambling. It turns it into a co-operative game style with lots of players hoping one will do badly. It also differs from poker with the use of the QJP, Joker and Heart based structure, which are tokens/tiles and not gambling chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
