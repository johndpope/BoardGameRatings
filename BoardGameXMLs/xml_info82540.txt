			<description>Psychosis (Paranoia in Japan) is a side scrolling shooter type game for the TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine. It was released in 1990 by NAXAT Soft, which also released the games Alien's Crush and Devil's Crush (two pinball type games.) When released it was praised for its colorful graphics and original backstory. It was released on the Wii Virtual Console in 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player's mind has been taken over by an evil power, or at least that's what they are led to think. This force, &amp;quot;The Devil Ugar,&amp;quot; plans to make their mind his own, but the player's character won't give up without a fight. The player used their mind to create the vehicle that will travel through their conscious and subconscious to win back their sanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Psychosis (video game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
