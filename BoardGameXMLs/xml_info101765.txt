							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Georgia Skin</name>
									
			<description>Georgia Skin is a game that has to be seen to be believed.  When it's played by professional gamblers, you see it but you don't believe it!  All cards are dealt face up. Players bet against the dealer and against each other. What they're betting on is that the face up card in front of the player they are betting against will be matched (paired) before their face up card is matched. That's all! Rank and suit of cards have no meaning in Georgia Skin ... and no one has an advantage.  It's a dead-even gamble. Player with the most money is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1 Felt game mat&lt;br/&gt;     2 Standard decks of playing cards&lt;br/&gt;     1 Set of play money&lt;br/&gt;     1 Best Little Book Ever Written About Poker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
