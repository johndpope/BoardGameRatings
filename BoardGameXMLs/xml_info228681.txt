			<description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard stories of the great heroes and legends that span the worlds of fantasy, raiding dungeons, toppling strongholds, and slaying malicious monsters. We&amp;rsquo;ve all sat and listened to the tales of evil warlords and sorcerers raising armies and rancorous beasts to do their biddings. Now&amp;rsquo;s your chance to be the very source of all these stories! Jump behind the seller&amp;rsquo;s table. Rife through all the alchemical, magical, and sharp bits and goodies that make up the very foundation of the worlds of fantasy! And match them all up with the tricky characters that are willing to buy &amp;lsquo;em for your good ole fashion gold!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Market Bonanza is a living card game where Players select their special Seller Character Card and draw their own Seller's Table worth of Contraband Items to sell to Customers for precious gold coin counters. In the Contraband Deck, Players will find unique Contraband Items, some with special abilities, and tricky Sleight Of Hand Cards that be used for your own benefit or at the expense of your opponents! In the Market Deck, Players will draw the coveted Customer Encounters, the fun and random Market Events, or the dreaded Guard Encounter Cards! Beware of being thrown into Lockdown! Can't play the game much if you're stuck in a cell! All things in the Market Deck depend on your Seller's Skill Checks and lucky dice rolls, so be sure to choose your Seller wisely!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your ultimate goal is to be the first Player to get to 10 Gold! So get those coins clanking into stacks, get all your items sold, and be the first to take control in Black Market Bonanza!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
