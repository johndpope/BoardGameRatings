			<description>On their turn each player rolls the dice and moves their piece that number forward. If you land on a multiple of ten square (10,20,30 etc) your piece is returned to its former position and the player forfeits their turn. This also applies if a piece lands on a log or puddle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to pass the finishing line wins the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
