			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the Chess-like game that appears in Star Wars: A New Hope, Beast Wars has two opponents moving Six pieces on a circular playing field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six pieces represent different monsters and each have Different strengths, Movement patterns, Energy rating and a Power Rating. Energy is used in movement and combat. Power is a beasts' combat rating, Which varies depending upon the beasts' strength, nearby friendly beasts and its' opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing field consists of 41 spaces placed in rings around a center space. Movement to an empty space costs energy. When a beast leaves a space an &amp;ldquo;ownership&amp;rdquo; marker is placed in the newly vacant space. Movement into a space with an ownership marker or your own costs less energy, while moving into a space with an opponents marker costs more. The center space will recharge the energy of the beast occupying it. Movement into a space containing an opponents beasts will initiate combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat takes place on a side-view combat screen.

You can move the beast to the left and right, Flee and attack. Damage to a beast causes its' energy level to be reduced. When a beasts energy level reaches zero it dies (even if the energy loss is due to normal movement). The surviving beasts gets it energy replenished at the end of combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When only one player has beasts remaining the round ends. Each player receives 300 points for remaining beasts and 150 for ownership markers. After a predetermined number of rounds have been played, the player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
