			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So,you've battled Eurostar in Paris and thwarted Dr. Destroyer in the jungles of Peru.  You've probably been to the moon or even beyond.  And now you think you've seen it all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think again Heroes! There's a land of mystery and adventure that you are probably overlooking.  A land filled with heroes and villains all its own. This land, of course, is Canada, the realm of the Champions of the North.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Champions of the North is a sourcebook for Champions, completely describing America's northern neighbor and the heroes and villains who live there.  Inside you will find dozens of new characters, three fully detailed adventures, and many more adventure ideas.  For the GM, there are extensive notes on Canada, its people, its history, and detailed descriptions of the cities and locations for your northern adventures.  Whether your heroes are just visiting or are settling in for a full scale Canadian campaign, Champions of the North is the sourcebook for you (eh?).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
