			<description>Duell der Formen / Duel of Forms is a 2 player abstract strategy game. The aim of the game is to position six tokens to make a line, triangle or hexagon. The player who manages to do this first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 12 tokens and takes it in turns to place one of their tokens on the empty board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player attempts to use 6 of the tokens of their colour to make an unbroken line, a hexagon with six equal edges or a triangle with three even edges (including placing a token in the middle of each of edges of the triangle).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If all the tokens have been set out and neither player has won, the players take it in turns to move their tokens to empty spaces. Players can only move one space and cannot jump. Each player must move a token to an empty space during their go and cannot choose to wait.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variant: Once all the tokens have been set out, players cannot only move but also jump to any place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
