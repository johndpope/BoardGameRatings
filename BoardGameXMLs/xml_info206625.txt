							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Build a Better Bot</name>
									
			<description>Q: What is it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A: A light card game about building and selling robots in a fluctuating market, for 2-5 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q: How is it played?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A: Players take turns choosing cards from a row, adding value to all the cards below the one they chose. Once they have a complete bot with a head, torso and legs, they can sell it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q: What makes it interesting?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A: The money you earn for selling a robot is based on 1: The current market value of each colour, and 2: how many parts are the same colour. The market shifts after each robot is sold, so keeping track of what your opponents are doing and how they will affect the game is important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
