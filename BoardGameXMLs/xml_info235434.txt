							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Rathurbosk</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rathurbosk is a bridge city that spans a narrow section of the Gouge between Krarth and Kurland on the continent of Legend. It was built in the distant past by agents of the Magi of Spyte and lay on the main trade route between Krarth and the more southerly lands of the continent of Legend - most notably Emphidor at the time it was built but later Selentium and its provinces. It is an imposing structure, that many believe is supported by some sort of magic, such is the legend of Spyte. But it has seen better days and while the bridge itself is sturdy and strong, many of the structures on it show the ravages of time. Notable buildings include the Flynt Ridd Tavern, the Citadel Guidor, the Tower of Helgryak, the Great Library of Jastel, and the Church of St Petrov.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is based upon materials presented in The Lands of Legend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
