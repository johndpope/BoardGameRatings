							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Drider Corruption</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along Came A Spider...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corruptions, from Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Horror Adventures, give players a new way to indulge their dark fantasies and take the role of gothic monsters, infecting themselves with some taint or darkness, and presenting the tantalizing question of whether to struggle against the corruption, or embrace it, and allow themselves to bask, however briefly, in its dark power. While Horror Adventures presents 11 different corruptions to choose from, there are many more potential sources of corruption that could potentially be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents the drider corruption, a brand new corruption featuring unique progression rules, and 10 new manifestations that are flavorfully connected to driders, as well as other spider-like monsters. Further, the book introduces the greater drider, a new CR 14 Huge drider with venomous webs, drinks the blood of its victims, and can inflict the drider corruption on those that it catches in its webs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
