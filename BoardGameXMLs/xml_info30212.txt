							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jim&#039;s LectraMatic Torpedo Attack</name>
									
			<description>Maybe the first battery operated game ever produced.  Torpedo attack relies upon two &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; sized batteries to power the naval warfare game board.  Two opponents maneuver their battleships across the ocean while the opposing player attempts to find and torpedo them.  A red light comes on when a hit is successful and a small magnet is placed upon the &amp;quot;damaged&amp;quot; ship.  An interesting game that appears to have been produced in the early to mid 1960s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
