							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Experimental Technical Readout: Marik</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shattered the Jihad and left in ruins, House Marik&amp;rsquo;s Free Worlds League has crumbled in the face of betrayal and deceit. Parliament is scattered, and alliances spanning generations have been broken. But even in death the dream of the Free Worlds lingers, and the economic and industrial might that once stood poised to usurp the powerhouse of House Steiner&amp;rsquo;s Lyran Alliance still churns out cutting edge technologies for a new interstellar order. In factories and test sites deep within the borders of the sundered League, powerful new secret weapons, devised during the darkest days of the war against the Word of Blake, are making their debut to defend the shadow of their fallen motherlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental Technical Readout: Marik samples the custom and prototype designs that have begun to turn up in testing labs and top-secret proving grounds of the crumbling Free Worlds League. Each design featured in this book incorporates some of the latest technologies developed by the realms of the Inner Sphere as the war against the Word of Blake winds toward its final conclusion. These technologies&amp;mdash;first described in Tactical Operations&amp;mdash;have yet to achieve widespread production, but each has been prototyped and rushed to the field for their desperate consumers. Statistics and Record Sheets are included for 13 new experimental BattleMechs, vehicles, aerospace units, and battle armor designs presented in this book, ready for play in advanced BattleTech games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
