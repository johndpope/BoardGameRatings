							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bling Bling Gemstone: 7-Card Mini Expansion</name>
									
			<description>7-Card mini expansion offered during the Bling Bling Gemstone Kickstarter campaign. The first 500 backers got them for free. The remaining backers could add-on for $2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Kickstarter:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game shuffle and deal one of each of these cards to all players. Graphics for these cards are coming soon but they will fit the theme/feel of the existing art. Each card is a one-time use card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Cave In! Play on another player, that player loses their turn. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Dead Canary: Play this card on another player's turn, this player must hit the tower with their pick, with their eyes closed! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Strike it Rich! Play this card on your own turn, you score double points for anything you knock off this turn (even center cores!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Dynamite! Take an extra turn (4 hits instead of 2) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Broken Handle! (Play on another player) Your pick axe is broken, you have to strike the column while holding one tip of the axe head and striking the column with the other tip of the head (do not use the handle at all!) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Claim Jumper: When you play this card, randomly take one collected gem from each player: Warning, if a player has no gems you must take a stone column piece from that player. If the player has no pieces then they steal a piece of their choice from you! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Jeweler's Loupe: Play this on any other player, you discover imperfections in their gems. All of that player's red gems are worth one less point during final scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
