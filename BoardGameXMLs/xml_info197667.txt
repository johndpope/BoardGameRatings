			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting consists of one hundred plots of forest terrain, and is described by its grass, shrub, and tree vegetation.  Player characters are farmers, hunters, or foresters.  Each of these types have various goals, including maximizing commercial exploitation (primarily through planting and grazing), deriving taxable income (primarily from grazing permits), or sporting enjoyment.  Many of these goals are conflicting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also introduces periodic fires into certain parcels.  These fires remove that plot from all use for a defined period of time, further restraining available resources and options.  The game is played in phases, during which the seasons change and, thus, possible land uses change in a variable (but predictable) way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
