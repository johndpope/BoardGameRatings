			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The...Solitaire game consists of several pegs arranged in a pattern of holes on a board.  The center hole is left without a peg.  Your goal is to get rid of pegs by jumping.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;Why create this game on a computer?  The main reason is that you'll often start to play the game, but find that some pegs are missing.  You can't even set up the board without the right number of pegs.  The computer will always set up the game without losing pegs, and can also check for impossible moves and thus prevent cheating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire was written by C. Regena and published in Compute! Issue 76, September 1986.  It was provided for the TI-994A computer.  The author also offered the game 'already typed in' on cassette or disk (you mailed in blank media), for a modest fee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was expanded with an &amp;quot;undo&amp;quot; feature by additional type-in source code published in Compute! Issue 77, October 1986.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
