							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Swords of Astagar</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fog lay heavy on the streets of Astagar muffling sound, obscuring sight and dulling the ever-present stink of rotting garbage. Where the denizens of other cities would remain indoors on such a night, Astagar's alleys and secret markets bustled with activity. In the shadowed crowds, a lone figure made its purposeful way across the unlit square that held the Market of Earthly Delights, down Murderer's Alley (whose reputation was greatly exaggerated) to a particular worm-eaten door, where it knocked twice, paused, then knocked twice more with the flat of its hand, whereupon the door opened, spilling warm yellow light into the alley. &amp;quot;A most healthful evening to you, Calomite,&amp;quot; said the fat, scar-covered man pointing a crossbow at Yana when she stepped inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Candar, don't be a fool,&amp;quot; Yana said, smiling and slinging her cloak onto a red-velvet divan, revealing a pair of hand axes on her belt and lush curves under a mail tunic. &amp;quot;I came here because I know you need my services. Do you need my help with the Wharf Rats or not?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So it's like that, is it.&amp;quot; Candar's eyes narrowed in thought. After a moment, finally returning Yana's smile, he said &amp;quot;Yes, I may know of an... opportunity for you.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swords of Astagar is a campaign frame for Mortal Coil written by Justin Bow. Set in a dark world of swords and sorcery, Swords of Astagar shows you how to run Mortal Coil in a setting inspired by Lieber and Howard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swords of Astagar is a fully sketched out setting in the form of a detailed theme document, with all of the world set-up choices written out in detail. The frame is customizable by your game group. You choose a tone, and pick the magic level that is appropriate for your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
