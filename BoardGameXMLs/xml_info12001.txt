			<description>Lunker Lake is a realistic and entertaining family game, that is easily played by people of all ages. This ultimate freshwater fishing game, is both exciting and challenging for anglers and non-anglers alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several species of fishing lurking in the depths of Lunker Lake. Including Muskie, Walleye, Lake Trout, Pike, Large and Small Mouth Bass&amp;hellip; but you must catch the &amp;quot;lunkers&amp;quot; to open your options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to catch 2 fish from each of the 6 different areas in the lake, is TOP ANGLER and wins the game. Watch for sandbars, and be sure to have your life jacket and fishing license for everyone&amp;hellip; the fisheries officer is unforgiving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
