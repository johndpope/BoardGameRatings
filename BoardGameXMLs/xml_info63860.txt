			<description>A collaborative storytelling game in which players tell a story together, using fine art and photographic images as creative cues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The physical game takes the form of decks of oversized cards (about twice the size of normal playing cards) with the images printed on them. There are also online versions of the game (in the form of a Facebook app and a general web-based app) that can be played for free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
