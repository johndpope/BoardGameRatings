			<description>The players alternate spinning a spinner. The spinner results indicate different plays and results. The game is played on a board showing a baseball field, and each player has four tokens representing his batsmen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An earlier version of the game was registered by the McLoughlin Brothers in 1856, making it possibly the earliest baseball boardgame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
