			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A clock shows 4:55am&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yard Boss&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I see a couple new faces here today.  Nice.  So Here's the drill.  Contracts come in for freight and passengers every morning starting at 5am.  Trains need to be loaded and out of here by 5:30.  You have exactly 30 mins to complete your tasks.  It is YOUR job to see that ALL contracts are fulfilled.  GOT IT?!?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;More than that, make sure you make the railyard money or you are sacked!  Every locomotive, and car you use needs to be fully loaded, or it will cost you your job.  And one more thing, don&amp;rsquo;t overload my trains.  Locomotives can only pull so much.  You blow one of my engines and I will become seriously unpleasant.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Any questions?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;No?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Excellent&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;One more thing to remember, as departure time draws nearer and you see you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough capacity to fill all your contracts, you can always sub them out to one of these mates standing next to you.  You may not get paid for that contract, but it won't count against you when the whistle blows.  You and I get paid when the contracts get filled so make sure there are no contracts in your hand when the whistle blows.&amp;ldquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now get out there and make me some money!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is as follow:&lt;br/&gt;Players start with 10 train cards.  Each turn they can either draw 3 cards or play 3 cards.  In order to play cards, you must first play a locomotive and coal car.  Then additional car and cargo can be played.  The correct train car needs to be played in order to place cargo and cargo is the only way to make money.  In the end, if time and running out and there is cargo you cant play, then subcontract it onto another player's train.  You may not get the money for it, but it wont cost you double in the end.  You also might just fill a spot on an opponent's train that they needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
