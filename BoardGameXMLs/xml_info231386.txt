			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 6-round, 4-to-6-player hand-elimination card game where players race to create 6-point hands using both positive and negative cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 10 cards at the beginning of each round. Cards can be a combination of positive cards (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), negative cards (-1, -2, and -3), and special Action Cards. Each player mixes and matches their cards each turn to create as many 6-point hands as possible with the ultimate goal of playing all of their cards (thus scoring zero points) and catching other players with points. The lowest score after 6 rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player creates their own Laydown Pile of 6-point hands during each round. As a twist, when every player has started a Laydown Pile during a round, the board becomes Open for Business, and players can start making 6-point hands off the top of other players' Laydown Piles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several Action Cards allow players to both help create additional 6-point hands and also block (or at least delay) other players from making their own 6-point hands. Action Cards include both offensive and defensive cards, cards for stealing hands or forcing other players to steal each other's hands, cards that change positive cards negative or negative cards positive, and cards that force other players to draw varying numbers of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
