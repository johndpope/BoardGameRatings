							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Khagan</name>
									
			<description>Khagan is a game of 13th Century Mongol conquest. In this game, players each assume the role of a mighty Mongol warlord. With his powerful army, each warlord expands across Eurasia conquering and pillaging the native peoples. The warlord who ships the richest plunder back to Mongolia will certainly be named the next Great Khagan (and win the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of each turn, the active player draws from his pool of available tumens (Mongolian army unit of 10,000 men). The drawn tumen tokens function as the player's army for the given turn. Players move their tumens to conquer new territories, receiving both resources and intimidation tokens, the latter of which can be strategically used to acquire even more territories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the spirit of nomadic warfare, at the end of each turn, the active player must select one of his clans to encamp. All tumens of a differing clan are removed from play. Tumens of the chosen clan remain on the board, functioning as a springboard for future conquests on the player's next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
