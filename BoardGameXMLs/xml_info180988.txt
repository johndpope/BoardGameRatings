			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawn from the entries of the 2015 Spheres of Power Worldbuilding Contest, this 45 page PDF features three entire worlds for your campaigning pleasure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with setting info, story hooks, and adventuring guidelines, each world comes with its own set of custom mechanics that can easily be adapted to a variety of worlds, including new magic talents, alternate classes and class features, custom XP systems, and fun alternative methods of item crafting and handling player wealth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this volume you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Grimoire: Featuring new and alternative classes including the Mage, the Wunderkind, the Exemplar, the Shaman, and the Dendrite, guidelines for chapter-based character progression, and a new material: Pirium!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First the Strangers came and elevated the animals and taught them magic.

With nothing but a handful of refugees and the Bloodmother's united orcish horde standing in his way, the time has come for heroes to choose the course of the world...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Irhardt: Featuring the Affinity system that exchanges alignment for elemental focus, several new Destruction talents, and a new race (the angelic aielari)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With their advanced technology, the Zethian Empire has made it their mission to slaughter the divinities. With their Dragon divinities, the Kingdom of Atonia matched them to a stalemate. But now that the Elemental Dragons have vanished, there's no telling what the Zethians might do, or who might have the power to stop them...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
