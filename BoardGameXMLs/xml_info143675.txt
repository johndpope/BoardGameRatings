			<description>&amp;quot;It is a game with many possibilities. Every gameplay is a new story&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mesozoic Tales is an indie strategy board game for adults, teenagers and children (age 12 and up).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Released in 2013, it has been under production for 7 years. It was inspired by books, films and retro videogames from da 1980's and 1990's generations, capturing the essence from many sources, such as Jurassic Park, Carnosaur, Lost World and Dino Crisis (and others), that filled the memories of many people through cinema, television, the Nintendo, Sega and PlayStation 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A remote island hides a secret: an advanced hi-tech dinosaur zoo. However the unpredictable happened and the creatures went loose. The gameplay starts when a group of few people try to put things back in order while the prehistoric beasts are roaming free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the incident, buildings on the island went out of energy and the players are found in the middle of the map. From there they must fight for survival while reactivating the system in the complexes as described in their Mission Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complexes are activated by using Access Cards, which can be obtained, or exchanged, at the Access Points in the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In case of any assistance players can carry 3 items at hands (Action Cards) - vehicles, guns, medical packs, etc. -, that can be obtained at the Maintenance sheds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is possible to play also as dinosaur. Before each turn, players must throw the 'Player Mode' dice to define if he/she will control a carnivorous dinosaur, an herbivore, or a human. In human mode, the player must follow his/her mission normally, but if he/she is playing as dinosaur, he/she can hunt the opponents down and eat them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a game of many possibilities. Every gameplay is a new story: this makes it a terrific fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
