			<description>From the back of the book...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Exotic Vistas... Outlandish Inhabitants... Limitless Adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Scaum, a great, bosomy watercourse flowing through Almery and Ascolais, is the most famous river in the Dying Earth. From the Maurenron Mountains to Sanreale Bay, the valley is thick with ancient forests, picturesque ruins, and somber tombs. It is alive with vibrant towns, memorable taverns and glittering palaces. It teems with eerie creatures, exhilarating predators, and cunning prey. Arch-wizards, grandees, artisans, and peasants make their homes in its wide, green lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Whatever your pleasure - travel, adventure, refuge - the Scaum Valley is the ideal destination. And this Gazetteer is the only guide you will need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Scaum Valley Gazetteer is comprehensive and beautifully illustrated, with clear, detailed maps throughout. The Gazetteer brings each community to life. Every entry, from Arch-Magician's manses to riverside taverns, includes a full description, adventure ideas, and comprehensive game statistics for GMCs. Adventurers may find themselves robbing tombs or plying demonic workers with beer, hunting a head-taking monster or playing cupid to an amorous fish. The variety is staggering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complete with additional picaresque misadventures, frightful curses, new spells, creatures, and magic items, the Scaum Valley Gazetteer contains enough material for months of exceptional gaming. Suitable for any level of play from Rogue to Arch-Magician.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        The Scaum Valley: aeons to erode, yours for a pittance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
