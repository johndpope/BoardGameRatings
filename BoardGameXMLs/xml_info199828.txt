			<description>Triomphe (French for triumph) is a card game dating from the late 15th century. It most likely originated in France or Spain (as triunfo) and later spread to the rest of Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is the origin of the English word &amp;quot;trump&amp;quot; and is the ancestor of many trick-taking games like Euchre (via &amp;Eacute;cart&amp;eacute;) and Whist (via Ruff and Honours).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
