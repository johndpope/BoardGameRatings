			<description>The United States has the most powerful armed forces in the world. Three army corps stand ready to defend Western Europe from the red horde poised across the Iron Curtain. Armored troops' powerful M60 Patton tanks or state of the art M1 or IPM1 Abrams tanks, mechanized infantry mounted in reliable M113 personnel carriers, and light infantry of the 82nd Airborne all stand ready to stop the red tide. Cavalry and scouts deploy forward in tanks, APCs and HMMWV vehicles to thwart the enemy's progress, while anti-aircraft troops with gun and missile vehicles watch the skies. The US Marine Corps' amphibious troops are ready to be deployed where needed with their own tanks, Light Armored Vehicles, and hard fighting infantry, backed by their own support. Those commies won't know what hit them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Background on the US 7th Corps, 1st Armored Division, Combat Team Alpha, 82nd Airborne Division, and the 2nd Marine Division.&lt;br/&gt;     Instructions on how to build a M1 Abrams Combat Team, M60 Patton Combat Team, Mech Combat Team, Armored Cavalry Troop, Cavalry Troop, Infantry Combat Team, Marine Tank Company, Marine Infantry Company, and LAV Company.&lt;br/&gt;     Three scenarios that drop you into the actions of an Armored Combat Team.&lt;br/&gt;     A detailed painting guide to help you prepare your US Forces for combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
