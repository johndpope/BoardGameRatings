			<description>Info:&lt;br/&gt;Golden Rule is a card game, a bit like Bang! or Flux. The only components are the cards, and the deck is 54 cards (46 unique cards, and 2 copies of 8 of those).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Premise:&lt;br/&gt;The king of the country has passed away suddenly, leaving no heir and no instruction. Every noble in the land is convinced that he or she the rightful ruler of the kingdom, and they have already started enacting laws against each other.&lt;br/&gt;Vie for control of the kingdom against the other nobles by writing your own laws in this game where you make the rules.&lt;br/&gt;Each card represents a scroll, featuring a law written by these competing nobles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
