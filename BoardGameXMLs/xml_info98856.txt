							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chocolate Quest</name>
									
			<description>An abstract strategy game intended for chocolate lovers, which uses a combination of colored plastic pawns and wrapped chocolates (not included) as game pieces for gameplay.  Chocolates are eaten (or saved for later) as they are captured, by the capturing player.  Rules do not indicate any end condition beyond all of the chocolates being eaten, and suggests that the winner is whoever ate the most (or that everyone wins because they got to eat chocolate).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
