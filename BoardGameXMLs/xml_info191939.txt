			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The concept behind the structure of the game is that new players often find character creation tedious and confusing.  Thus, play begins immediately and character development happens &amp;quot;when it happens&amp;quot;, during play.  Players begin with tokens that are spent during play to gain some type of character Trait or ability.  These Traits are linked to dice pools for action resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
