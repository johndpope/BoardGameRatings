							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bulba the Cat</name>
									
			<description>It's surprising how few cats have made a name for themselves in the world of platform games.&lt;br/&gt;Given their ability to land on their feet and the fact that nine lives is way is above average, you'd think they'd have the genre locked down by now.&lt;br/&gt;Yet somehow the only cats to enter the platforming arena have been SNES C-lister Bubsy and Big the Cat from Sonic Adventure. They were both rubbish.&lt;br/&gt;Thankfully, French developer C4M is here to up the cat quotient as the Bulba the Cat noses its way through the App Store's cat flap.&lt;br/&gt;The game sees you helping the eponymous pink and purple furball reclaim his sushi picnic from a meddling crow. Naturally, there's an ocean full of perilously small islands, moving platforms, and crumbling bridges between our bouncing hero and success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
