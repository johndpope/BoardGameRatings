							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Green House Game</name>
									
			<description>An environmental awareness board game. The game encourages children to become knowledgeable in environmental issues. The object of the game itself is to demonstrate one's knowledge of issues concerning the environment and thereby turning the home into a &amp;quot;Green House&amp;quot;. The winner of the game is the first player to earn an ENVIROMIND certificate. There are two ways to earn a certificate, either by being the first to reach the greenhouse or by being the first to collect ten ECOPOINTS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players enter the gameboard by descending in the balloon onto the balcony of the Kids' Room. Players roll a die and follow the arrows to move through the rooms/areas of the house. Along the way players encounter green, red, and yellow squares and by doing so learn new environment related facts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
