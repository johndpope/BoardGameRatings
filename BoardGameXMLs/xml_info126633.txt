			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Times are tough, lately, in the underground city of Alpha Complex. Communists, mutants, and secret society traitors are a constant threat, and it's starting to seem like maybe they're winning. It's getting so an honest Troubleshooter can't get ahead just by doing the job. Which is why you're a less than completely honest Troubleshooter. Your secret society connections and your mutant power help you do well on your missions. You need to do really well on this next mission -- or, at least, you need everyone else on your team to do really poorly. You don't know the mission yet, but you know exactly three things you'll have to do: Stay alert. Trust no one. Keep your laser handy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This special release playset was written by PARANOIA contributor Dan Curtis Johnson who has worked on making roleplaying games, comics, operating systems, and daughters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PARANOIA is a trademark of Eric Goldberg and Greg Costikyan.
