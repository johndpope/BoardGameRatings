			<description>Excubitor is a sci-fi action tower defence game based in the Baphomet solar system; home to the vast &amp;lsquo;hyper-giant&amp;rsquo;, a star thousands of times larger than that of our own sun. You are a lone human pilot, responding to a distress call that leads to a struggle for survival; a battle against all odds that will test both your shooting and strategic skills to the limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armed to the teeth and set on a course of sheer destruction, a wave of drones is rushing towards Antares &amp;ndash; the research vessel you are tasked with protecting. Players must build your defences in the best possible locations and load your Hammerhead defence craft with the deadliest weapons if you are to have any chance of survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STORY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1935, Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen predicted the existence of wormholes; shortcuts through space-time enabling instantaneous travel across vast regions of space. A century later, a discovery was made that turned their theory into reality - plunging mankind into an interstellar space race to claim the ultimate prize: the Voidshards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The events of Excubitor are set in the year 2182, in a remote star system colonized by humans. At its heart is the Baphomet - a vast &amp;lsquo;hyper-giant&amp;rsquo;, a star over a thousand times larger than our own sun and one of the biggest stars known to humanity. Dozens, maybe even hundreds of planets orbit the giant star, with many more swallowed up as Baphomet grew larger during its stellar evolution. All around the system, a strange and powerful element is scattered across the many worlds. An element that could provide humanity with all the energy it will ever need. An element that takes the form of blue crystals known as the Voidshards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
