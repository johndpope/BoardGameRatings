			<description>From the game's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You play the role of the insurgent leader rebelling against the Japanese Occupiers. The player with the most number of Valour points by the time the Commanding General is defeated wins the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battlebox is a deckbuilding game. Players start the game with a Tactical Deck of 10 cards, made up of 7 basic resource cards and 3 Solo Vigilante mission cards, and 80 Life Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During every turn, players draw 5 cards from their own Tactical Deck and use the 5 cards to acquire more powerful cards (Resources, Plans or Mission). Players may also play Plan or Mission cards if they are part of the 5 drawn cards. Plan cards help players complete Missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing a Mission card leads to a draw from the Warzone deck. If the player fulfills the requirements of the drawn Warzone card, he completes the mission and gains the Valour points and benefits listed on the card. A failed mission leads to loss of Life Points listed on the same card. Reaching 0 Life Points leads to the skipping of the next turn, and reduction of maximum Life Points by 20. When the maximum Life Points reaches 0, the player is out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest number of Valour points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
