							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">In Amongst the Trees</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leocrest is under attack! A dangerous Formorian has been tormenting the town, using his Evil Eye to curse the town's defenders. Even with their homes built high into the trees, the people of Leocrest are in grave danger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The giant is not the only threat lurking in the surrounding forest. A group of fanatical Elves known as the Brothers of the Fire have begun attacking anyone travelling near the River Lis. Although they claim to want to rebuild the glory of Cormanthor, they are nothing more than thugs who despise non-Elven races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trapped by an insane giant and the ignorant bandits, the town of Leocrest is in desperate need of help!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
