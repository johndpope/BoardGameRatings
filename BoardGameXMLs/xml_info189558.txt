							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vossler&#039;s Labyrinth</name>
									
			<description>Blurb From Publisher --&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm starting a program where I will try to make a brand new dungeon every single day!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some men collect swords, some rare rocks... Vossler collected wealth!!! Once he had much more coin than the local king could ignore, Vossler was made an enemy of the kingdom. Vosslers death, unlike his extravagant life was made most horrific. Vossler left behind wealth unimaginable, but that wealth was hidden deap beneath his manor, hidden behind the twists and turns of his labyrinth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vosslers Labyrinth is a simple labyrinth with a few devious  twists. I'm keeping the labyrinth small than I normally would to allow it to be solved &amp;amp; mapped by players as they delve deep within it. There are 2 maps to Vossler's labyrinth, the base map &amp;amp; the labyrinth's solution (the most direct route that can solve the labyrinth)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The highres JPG's are included &amp;amp; pre-formated for 8x11 @ 300DPI print&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
