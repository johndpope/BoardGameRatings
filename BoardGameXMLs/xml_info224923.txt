			<description>In Zoom Out you play as photographers from the planet Barruffus in a trip in the outher space: on these travels, the planet's inhabitants revel in curious Photo ZoomOut photographing all the details of their planet, like super zoom detail of small insects or cities in all the universe. The worst enemy of the photographers is the famous Space Toad, which has developed an answer to this hobby all its own, called the &amp;quot;photobombing&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game you have to get rid of all the cards in your hand, always raising with a highest value and paying attention to the cards with the Space Toad, that give the opportunity to the fastest player to get rid of an extra card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to get rid of the seven cards that are dealt at the beginning of the game as quickly as possible. A card is flipped over to start the discard pile&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player on his turn can do one of the following actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discard a card if its value is higher than the top card in the discard pile or if it has the same value and is the first card of equal value (there may never be more than two cards with the same value)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the Photobombing paper, exclaiming the word photobombing loudly. When the card is played all the other players try to get rid of one of their own cards, only the fastest one will get rid of his card. The game will resume from the player after him&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing a card if you can not (or do not want to) play, the card can not be played immediately, so you have to wait for the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until one player is out of cards and they are the winner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
