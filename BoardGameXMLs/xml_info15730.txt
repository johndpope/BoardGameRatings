							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Letter Loops</name>
									
			<description>This is a children's game with a Sesame Street theme that helps teach young players how to read. The game is played using letter &amp;quot;Match-Ups&amp;quot; - curved &amp;quot;Y&amp;quot; shaped tiles with letters and pictures on them. Each player takes 4 Match-Ups from the draw pile, and another is placed in the center of the table to start. On your turn, you try to match the color and letters on one of your Match-Ups with the tiles on the table; for example, you might match up a yellow &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; on one end of your tile to a table tile with a yellow &amp;quot;ook&amp;quot; forming the word &amp;quot;Book&amp;quot;. If you cannot make a match, you take a new tile from the draw pile. Because the tiles are curved, as the game progresses large letter loops are formed. Play all your Match-Ups first and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
