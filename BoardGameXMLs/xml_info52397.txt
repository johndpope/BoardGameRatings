							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tower in the Ice</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A round building with an impossibly tall, conical roof seemingly rises from a frozen lake. Is this structure really as small as it looks, or does more of this building lie hidden beneath the water's icy surface? What secrets does this odd structure conceal? Are its inhabitants harmless eccentrics or deadly foes? Download this new adventure by Skip Williams and find out what's really happening in this mysterious tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tower in the Ice is suitable for 9th-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Preview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tower in the Ice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many centuries ago, an evil ogre mage built a tall tower in an arctic vale. Adventurers eventually defeated him and looted his tower, leaving it empty for decades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost fifty years later, a geological upheaval flooded the vale, submerging all but the tower's uppermost level. Because of the cold temperatures in the area, this new lake soon froze, masking the massive structure beneath the water level. Only its topmost portion still protruded from the ice. The tower remained quiet for many years thereafter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, however, local bards relate tales and legends of an eccentric old woman who lives on an island on a frozen lake. This person is reputed to be an avid ornithologist who will pay generously for any unusual avian specimens that anyone cares to bring. But is this strange lady more than meets the eye?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
