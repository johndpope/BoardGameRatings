							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conga</name>
									
			<description>Conga is a two-dimensional game which combines characteristics of Kalah games with four in a row. One players uses 10 black seeds, the other 10 white seeds. Players start with their cache of seeds in opposite corners of the board. The contents of a pit are distributed into the succeeding pits in a particular manner not unlike the &amp;quot;sowing&amp;quot; that happens in Mancala games. The object of the game is to form a row of four occupied holes (the colors of the seeds don't matter), diagonally or orthogonally. In addition, you win if your opponent can't move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
