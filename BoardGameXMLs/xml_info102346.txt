			<description>(from ATO website :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guns of the Askari (GoA) recreates the imperial struggle for East Africa during WWI. This often overlooked campaign featured classic land battles, naval engagements between lake flotillas, cruiser duels at sea and finally hit and run guerrilla engagements. It opened with conventional force-on-force battles dominated by infantry, machine guns, and trenches. But the low troop densities and wide open spaces enabled a war of movement spearheaded by South African cavalry that broke the stalemate in mid 1916. This left Von Lettow-Vorbeck a choice between surrender or guerrilla war. He chose the latter and dragged his weary pursuers through a series of running battles in Portuguese East Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by WWI game specialist John Gorkowski, Guns of the Askari features 280 half-inch full color counters that represent forces as varied as rifle companies, armored cars, naval units for oceans or lakes, and the supply units on which both sides depended. There are even artillery units back-printed with the other side&amp;rsquo;s colors, so that they can be captured and used again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game offers four different scenarios, from the complete campaign to the 1918 guerrilla operation and two periods in between. Combat mechanics change as the nature of the conflict evolves, and each turn has a variable end point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played by two OR THREE players, giving the option for German, British, and Belgian players, and making it possible for the &amp;ldquo;neutral&amp;rdquo; Portuguese to (perhaps) join the German side!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you, commanding greatly superior numbers, do better than the Allied commanders? Can you, commanding a mix of Europeans and native troops (including sailors from a scuttled German cruiser), manage the right balance of caution and audacity to keep your foes off-balance and elude destruction? The choices are yours in Against the Odds Magazine #38, Guns of the Askari.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map - One full color 22&amp;quot;x34&amp;quot; mapsheet&lt;br/&gt;Counters - 280 full color 1/2&amp;quot; die-cut pieces&lt;br/&gt;Rules length - 12 pages&lt;br/&gt;Charts and tables - 2 pages&lt;br/&gt;Complexity - Medium&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire suitability - Average&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time - 6 to 8 hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
