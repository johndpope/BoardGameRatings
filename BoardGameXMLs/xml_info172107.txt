							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pass The Tentacle</name>
									
			<description>Tentacles are cropping up all over the place and they're reaching for YOU! But you can trick the tentacles into going after someone else. Are you quick enough to rid yourself of all those grasping tentacles? Or are your friends quicker? Only one way to find out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game will accommodate 3 to 8 players (ages 8 and up).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECT OF THE GAME: Be the person with the least number of Tentacles in your hand at the end of the 9th turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TO PLAY: Determine who the dealer is by whoever owns the most tentacles... or failing that, any manner that suits you. Each player will start with three cards in hand. During each turn, you and your fellow players will simultaneously pass cards to the left and right. After all cards have been passed, the players will then pick up the cards passed to them and draw a new card from the deck. Once everyone has drawn a new card, the turn is over, and it's time to move on to the next turn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
