			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artisans is a free print and play game for 1 player. &lt;br/&gt;You are a young artisan who recently completed an apprenticeship and must now make a name for yourself. Your ultimate ambition is to receive a Royal commission to create something for the looming wedding of the young Prince and his fianc&amp;eacute; &amp;ndash; however, this cannot happen unless you first build up a good reputation! Unfortunately, Shearspike (your fellow pupil and fiercest rival) has also just completed his apprenticeship and has similar ideas. You cannot deny that Shearspike has more natural talent and skill than you do, but you are determined and hard-working, whereas Shearspike is lazy and arrogant. Your time is short and reputation is everything in this game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are just 4 sheets to print (grayscale) - two sheets are your player boards, two sheets contain 18 cards that require cutting.&lt;br/&gt;You will also need to supply 7 dice and approx 30 cubes or tokens of any colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was an entry into the 2016 Solitaire PNP Design Contest:-&lt;br/&gt;3rd Place - 'Best Overall Design'&lt;br/&gt;Winner - 'Best Worker Placement Game'&lt;br/&gt;Winner - 'Best Greyscale Printed Game'&lt;br/&gt;3rd Place - 'Best Easy to Build Game'&lt;br/&gt;3rd Place - 'Best Original Artwork'&lt;br/&gt;4th Place - 'Best Graphic Design'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
