			<description>of Shot &amp;amp; Blade is a boardgame of action, magic and high adventure set in the unique fantasy world of Edath where non-combat skills are as influential as combat in surviving a wild and broken world. The game allows for a variety of simple adventures to be played &amp;ndash; skirmishes, quests, hunts, investigations, etc &amp;ndash; and in a variety of settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players split into two teams. The Adventurers Team attempt to achieve a final objective and take their squads and champions across three Locations against beasts, ravines, natives and the like, while the Nemesis Team aims to thwart them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With each encounter, the players draw from their chosen Skills and any support they may get, and opposed players engage in a conflict where their dice rolls are influenced in a back and forth fashion until one player can do no more and so loses that particular contest, suffering the consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the time the final goal is reached the Adventurers will have succeeded or failed to acquire boons and other bonuses that can aid them in an all or nothing last ditch attempt to succeed in their mission. Adventures can be played stand alone or as part of a series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
