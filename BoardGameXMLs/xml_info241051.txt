			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wood is the thickest, oldest, darkest, and dankest forest there is. Deep inside the pallid gloom, past tangled limbs and towering boughs, lives the harmonious Lord of the Forest: the Faun. He has called and collected the creatures and the critters of the Wood together, for he senses that peril and destruction are imminent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Faun knows many secretive things, even that player characters are making their way into the Wood even as you read this, and his adherents shall be prepared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsterarium is a boutique bestiary, populated with fiends and fey alike. These aren&amp;rsquo;t the kind of the monsters you run into d12 of each time your GM fears you&amp;rsquo;re bored. From the Al, the demon of childbirth, to the Hair that had a Human, these are beings you may have never before encountered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
