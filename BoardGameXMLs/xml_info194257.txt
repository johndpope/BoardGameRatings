			<description>Knight Online is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game that has been under continuous development since its beginnings. Acclaimed by many players as a PvP classic, two nations, El Morad and Karus - or more colloquially, humans and orcs - are locked in an eternal struggle for dominance. Pick a side, build up your warrior, and join the fray!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
