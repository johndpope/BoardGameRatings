			<description>A girl who cannot fall in love.&lt;br/&gt;A boy who has no interest in love.&lt;br/&gt;If they were to fall in love with each other, how would the world change?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WANTED!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Springtime. Cherry blossom season.&lt;br/&gt;It is a time of first encounters and final partings, a time when buds are sprouting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But for Asaba Yuma, a 2nd year student at Mihaya Academy, it was simply a gloomy day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yuma was something of an accomplished love expert that all the girls in the academy came to for their romantic troubles. So skilled was he that there was even a 21,000 yen (taxes included) &amp;quot;love bounty&amp;quot; placed upon his head. Whether it was seeking advice regarding jealousy or even infidelity, Yuma heard it all and increasingly it made him less and less interested in love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then one day he met a mysterious girl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She had never fallen in love before.&lt;br/&gt;Yet, she believed that it was something truly wonderful.&lt;br/&gt;That girl also had a rather mysterious job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Do you want to fall in love?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;As a fairy of love, her job was...&lt;br/&gt;...to make Yuma's love come true.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
