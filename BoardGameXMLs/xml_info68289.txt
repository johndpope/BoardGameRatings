			<description>3singes (3monkeys) is a unique party game, as it handicaps the players. It is based on the chinese three monkeys of wisdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is blind but knows all (with 3 cards) and must tell the mute player how to mime the phrase to the deaf, without saying to the mute what he is miming, but HOW to do it, and the blind cannot see if the mute mime it correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deaf players (having iPods or similar things) don't hear what the blind is saying, so they must try to understand the blind's message according to the mute's mimes. If a blind player hears a correct element, he indicates the mute a deaf got a good answer and points are scored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
