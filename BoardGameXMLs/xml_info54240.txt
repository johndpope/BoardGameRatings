			<description>This is a 2 player dexterity game where players are attempting to battle their way to the death star and destroy it.  Players have to test their reaction speeds in tie fighter battles.  The first one in each round to hit the correct weapon button, has one of 6 LEDs illuminated on the path to the Death Star in the middle.  Once there, they have the chance to destroy the Death Star if they can win a final battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
