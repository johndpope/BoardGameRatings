			<description>From the website: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.jc-designs.net/themachine/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.jc-designs.net/themachine/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Machine was designed to be a board game that evolves over time, for 2-4 players. The story line is open ended so that new plots can be added and old ones can change. New cards, tokens, and board layouts can be downloaded, and printed to be used with the game, keeping the players interested, waiting to see what comes next. The Machine isn't just a machine. It is for the players to find out what it is and what it does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first phase of the board game is to control it before it destroys everything. If you can accomplish that, then there is a chance to see what secrets it has....if you live. If you have any questions or would like to make a suggestion for a card or have an idea for The Machine, please contact me using the contact button. This game is supposed to be open, anything can happen, so if your ideas are well liked, they will be added to the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
