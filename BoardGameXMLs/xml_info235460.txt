			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to &amp;quot;100 Oddities for a Treasure Hoard,&amp;quot; the ninth entry in Skirmisher Publishing&amp;rsquo;s popular &amp;quot;Oddities&amp;quot; series! This publication includes 100 unique things characters might encounter in an otherwise mundane collection of loot and includes guidelines for ways to introduce Oddities into your game sessions or stories in a fun and compelling way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever needed to stock a treasure hoard? If you are the storyteller for a game, the answer to that question is undoubtedly a resounding yes! At the end of a long and perilous quest, the heroes (and their players) usually look forward to some tangible material reward for their efforts. But it can be difficult to get beyond randomized coinage and a handful of gems, especially if you are pressed for time. And ambitious players are always on the lookout for innovative, exciting, and unique loot after a hard day of Dragon-slaying and overlord overthrowing. Well, we at Skirmisher Publishing are here to help, and have done far more than just compile a loot list. We have, in fact, created some valuable oddities!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oddities are intended to aid storyteller creativity, turning possibly bland areas or gaming episodes into something more, and the goal of this publication is to make things more fun and to take your imagination in directions it might not otherwise have gone. They fill in the corners of a bookshelf, a room, a level, a story or scenario, with all the sorts of things that add interest but take loads of time to come up with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
