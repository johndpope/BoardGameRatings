			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you enjoy visiting exotic locations? Meeting new people? Shooting them? If so, you might be a prime candidate for membership in the Galactic Space Marines. Just make sure to save up some cash before going to the recruitment office. The Space Marines don't want slackers, and if you can't even afford to equip yourself, you don't have what it takes. But if all your gear meets the Uniform Military Code, you can look forward to adventure, excitement, and (if you live long enough) maybe even Citizenship. Plus, you can earn big bucks (or at least enough to pay for the latest required equipment upgrade).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Self-Made Space Marine is a science fiction parody game designed for use with the QAGS Second Edition rules. It includes background on the Galactic Space Corps, an exciting new auction system for character creation, armor and weapons, Game Master tips for extorting players, the sample adventure &amp;ldquo;Prince of the Gravity Thieves,&amp;rdquo; the QAGS Qik Start rules, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;May the blessings of Great Zeenu be upon you. Join today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
