							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Races of Gallian: The Hobben</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strong in Body and Mind&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hobben have an average height of 6 and a half feet. They are seldom shorter than five foot ten, and any hobben below six feet in height is considered a runt.  They generally weigh between 170 to 240 pounds. They are an imposing species that towers above most others, and they possess tremendous physical endurance. hobben skin shades range from earthy ochre to is deep red, and their ears taper to prounounced points, though not as exaggerated as those of an elf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hobben have hair on their head and brows, but are otherwise naturally hairless. Although it is not present in all members of the race, many hobben also have horned cranial ridges. Some also possess down-turned horns that emerge from their cheekbones. Because these horns have been viewed as a sign of strength for all of hobben history, noble families have seen these physical traits as a desirable trait in potential marriage prospects. Consequently, members of noble bloodlines more commonly manifest horns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite their physical endowment, hobben do not fall back on their might as a solution for every challenge. In fact, they are known for their intellect and their race has produced many of the world&amp;rsquo;s foremost scholars and philosophers. Many of the world&amp;rsquo;s technological and scientific advancements originated within the mind of a hobben.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents include: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Hobben Race.&lt;br/&gt;    Hobben NPC statblocks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
