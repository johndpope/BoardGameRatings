			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What was the world like in the long and bitter run-up to the Three Way War?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book provides a glimmering of an answer in two parts &amp;ndash; Getting Involved and The Big City. The first of these deals with how the PCs personally got involved in the ongoing nastiness, while the second provides for an extended campaign in a major Western Alliance city in the face of a growing terrorist threat and the increasing levels of lawlessness that this creates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventures are not for the faint of heart &amp;ndash; especially those that are terrorism related. Two of the three major opponents of the Western Alliance, the Japanese Imperium (allies of the Russian Federation) and the Caliphate, are steeped in both imperial ambitions and out of control fanaticism. Neither sees much of a line between &amp;lsquo;civilian&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;soldier&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; the Caliphate glories in the deaths of all infidels, seeing none of them as worthy of consideration and the twisted version of Bushido promoted by those manipulating the Japanese military is only marginally better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are around 50 adventure scenarios included &amp;ndash; from multi-page monsters to &amp;amp;frac;14; or &amp;amp;frac;12; page &amp;lsquo;Vignettes&amp;rsquo; &amp;hellip; and there is considerable scope to use the additional Cast of Thousands and the background information from the book to create your own stand alone or linked scenarios to them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also covered inside are much expanded Cardboard Character lists and some changed or improved rules regarding their usage &amp;hellip; providing the Civilian side of things that was not really covered in Modern Encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book also includes basic information of all of the weapons used by NPCs (friend or enemy) inside, some limited information on any vehicles that are present, and some added Police and Security rated equipment &amp;hellip; so it is possible to play through the adventures without possessing the D10 System Gear Book (though the game will be much more enjoyable if you possess it).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
