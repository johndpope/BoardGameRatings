			<description>A chess-like board game for two players. Each player chooses a race (humans, dwarfs, elves, undead or orcs) and then his &amp;quot;army&amp;quot;, i.e. his set of figures (including exactly one king). Similar to chess, each figure has different movements. Since, other than in chess, the armies are not predefined, there is a setup phase before the game where players place their figures on the board. Then the game is played like chess, with players alternately moving figures according to their possible movements. A player loses when his king is captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The complete rules can be found at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.popcorn.cc/~zandor/english/fantasychess.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.popcorn.cc/~zandor/english/fantasychess.htm&lt;/a&gt; .
