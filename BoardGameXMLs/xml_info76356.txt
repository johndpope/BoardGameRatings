Fun for all your friends and family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These Giant Fuzzy Dice contain 3 games inside...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- &amp;quot;Fuzzy Dice&amp;quot; -- a variation on &amp;quot;Liar's Dice&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Liar's Poker&amp;quot;.  The dice are rolled, and players declare how many cards they have that match a single die or a sum of two or more dice.  Later players either raise or call the claim.  Whoever loses the call loses a card from their hand.  The last player with cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- &amp;quot;Chuck-A-Luck&amp;quot; -- world famous betting Carnival betting game of chance.  Players place a card from their hand next to High, Low, or High/Low, then the 3 dice are rolled.  If their total is 13-18, players who bet High save their card in their winnings plus a card from the dealer; if 3-8, those who bet Low do the same; if 9-12, those who bet High/Low save their card but with no extra card.  After all the cards are played out, players reveal their saved cards, and the highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- &amp;quot;Good Riddance&amp;quot; -- a fast-paced elimination game.  Players place a card from their hand face up on the table, and the 3 dice are rolled.  Cards that match any die or sum of dice discard their card; if doubles or triples are rolled every player passes a card from their hand to the left; and any player who matches the sum of the dice gets a free roll and discards all cards matching any dice or sum.  When a player goes out of cards, the rest total their remaining cards.  The lowest total after a certain number of rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
