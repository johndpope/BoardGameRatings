			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global Connection is a drawless connection game for two players: Black and White. It's played on the cells of a hexhex board with eight or ten cells per side. Before the game starts, the perimeter cells of the board, except the six corners, are filled with black and white stones alternating in color. Each corner cell must be adjacent to one stone of each color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black plays first, then turns alternate. On their turn, a player must place a stone of their color on an empty cell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the board is full. A player's score is the number of groups of connected stones of their color including at least one perimeter stone. The player with the lower score wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
