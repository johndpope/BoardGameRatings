							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wizard&#039;s Tower Solitaire</name>
									
			<description>Wizard's Tower Solitaire is a Tarot card game based on the playing card solitaire game Spider. The game begins by laying out all 78 cards face up in 13 rows of 6. Cards of the bottom column are exposed and may be placed below any card of the next higher numerical value or overlapping the next higher numerical value of the same suit. Overlapping cards may be moved as a unit and removed from play when it is complete. Trump cards may be placed under any other Trumps of a higher numerical value or overlapping a Trump of the next higher numerical value. When the Fool is exposed it is transferred to the top of the tableau to form the foundation of the Wizard's Tower and other Trumps are placed on it in ascending numerical value. Any exposed card may be transferred to an empty column and weaving may be used to overcome a blocked game. The goal of the game is to remove all but the Wizard's Tower of Trump cards which remains mysteriously suspended in the air after the cliffs below it have been blasted away by magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
