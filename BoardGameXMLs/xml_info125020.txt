			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'd say it was about the Year of Your Lord Eighteen Hunnerd and Fifty, or thereabouts, that the Underground Railroad managed to help me get my mortal flesh off o' that plantation and safely to Canada. 'Course, I found I couldn't sit there all idle-like and not help others as I was helped, so I went back to guide my brothers and sisters to freedom. Well, that work was the death of me, but I can't say as I hadn't made peace with that 'fore it happened. I was a God-fearing man back then - still am, I s'pose, though it's a different kind o' fear now - and I'd done right by most folks, and I figgered I'd be goin' to Heaven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Problem was, when I got there, I didn't much care for it. I don't remember it so well, you unnerstand, but I do recollect them bastards - 'scuse my language - not being so keen to let me leave. So I escaped again. And just like last time, that put a fire in my belly to help out those as wanted to follow the same path. So if you're happy chained to a cloud, son, playing that golden harp or what have you, you're free to turn back. But I expect that when I pick up this here old guitar and start strolling down the trail again, if I look back, I'll see you a-followin' behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soul Train is a campaign frame for Mortal Coil written by Greg Phillips and Rich Flynn. Set in the afterlife, Soul Train imagines a Heaven and Hell that souls wish to escape. Demons and angels are not so keen on the souls getting loose, however, so an underground railroad smuggles the souls away from their eternal reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soul Train is a fully sketched out setting in the form of a detailed theme document, with all of the world set-up choices written out in detail. The frame is customizable by your game group. You choose a tone, and pick the magic level that is appropriate for your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
