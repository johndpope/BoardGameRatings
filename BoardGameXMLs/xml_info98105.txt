							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1862: First Winchester</name>
									
			<description>(from wargamedownloads.com)&lt;br/&gt;1862  First Winchester (American Civil War in 3D)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is our third of five battles in the Jackson Valley Campaign of 1862 and the seventh battle in our series of the American Civil Wargames in 3D. It sees the Union army under General Nathanial P Banks being attacked once again by the Confederate General Thomas J Stonewall Jackson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Union army retired to Winchester having lost the brief action at Front Royal two days previous. Banks is now lined up around Winchester and is waiting for the Confederates to attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First Winchester initially has a time limit of 16 bounds in which the Confederates must achieve their task objective. Its design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game within a 1 to 2 hour period of continuous play. The game gives a flavor of the American Civil War period and a simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game, keep the chain of command together and everything is fine, lose it and it could cost you the game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit. You don&amp;rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&amp;rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion. The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
