			<description>This baseball themed edition of UNO features pictures of American League stars on the cards.  The National League version is the same, but with National League stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL UNO: The &amp;quot;Top 2&amp;quot; -- this one requires the two players with the fewest number of cards in hand when it is played to draw a card into their hands, with the player playing the &amp;quot;Top 2&amp;quot; card exempt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
