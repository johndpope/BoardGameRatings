							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cthulhu Risus</name>
									
			<description>introduction:&lt;br/&gt;I love gaming in a Cthulhuesque universe, but something one quickly learns about such a setting is that the  lifespan of a typical character is quite short, and sooner or later they'll wind up either drooling-at-the-mouth  insane, gorily sacrificed by a cultist, or ingested by some nameless tentacled horror. It is hard to spend an  hour creating a character knowing the great likelihood of their eventual fate, and even harder to justify  spending another hour on a new character after your previous one has just been rent limb-from-limb by a  shoggoth while on his first adventure. &lt;br/&gt; Hence, here is my proposed solution: use Risus as the gaming engine! It is hard to find a setting better suited  for 30 second character creation than the Cthulhu Mythos. Even if your character just got eaten, sacrificed, or  pulled into an alternate dimension, a new character is just a few seconds away. The advantages of this should  be clear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
