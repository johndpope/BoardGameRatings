			<description>The Gizmondo is a handheld gaming console which was released by Tiger Telematics in March 2005.  It has GPRS and GPS technology. The electronics design was undertaken by Plextek Limited and the industrial design by Rick Dickinson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gizmondo sold poorly, and by February 2006 the company discontinued the device and was forced into bankruptcy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the system's commercial failure, only 14 games were released for the platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Gizmondo&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
