							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pippi Langstrumpf Puzzlejagd</name>
									
			<description>Childrens game where the players race to complete a jigsaw first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a different colour and is given the eight pieces that will make up a picture of Pippi Langstrumpf. In your turn, you roll the special die. The die has freckles instead of numbers except for the face that shows the monkey Herr Nilsson. If the monkey is rolled, that player can start to assemble his jigsaw and he may continue to try until another player rolls the monkey and cries &amp;quot;Stop!&amp;quot;. Then that player can start his jigsaw. It continues in this way until someone has completed the puzzle and that person is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
