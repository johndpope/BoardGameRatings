			<description>The students will get hands-on experience in a section of game-theory that models many common situations in which two parties make a decision with an outcome that depends on the other parties choice. They will understand the four cell matrix often used to model games in game theory, and learn how different configurations of the scores in this matrix affect the tactics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to gain as many points as possible during the game. The score can be compared both to the other players and to own highest score in previous games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;52 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
