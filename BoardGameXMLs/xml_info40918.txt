							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Don&#039;t be the Dragon</name>
									
			<description>From the box: In this exciting board game you will really dress up.  The four sturdy costumes change the players into a Knight, Princess, Magician, or Dragon.  Suddenly, when you least expect it you have to change costume and that changes the whole game.  Whatever you do, Don't be the Dragon.  You can't win the game.  But... if you are, have fun keeping the other players from winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This children's game is a costume changing game.  The costumes are plastic bibs.  It is a simple roll and move game where the players try to move from an Inn to the Castle.  Along the way there are short cuts to move ahead and pitfalls that move characters back.  The Dragon moves back and forth along the trail trying to catch the players.  When a player lands on a portrait of another character, they trade costumes.  The winner is the first player, who is not the Dragon, to reach the castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
