							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gurami: das Spiel</name>
									
			<description>GURAMI is a collection of three games based on GURAMI PUZZLE: numbers of two colors are filled in a grid of triangles, so that in any direction the sums of both colors are equal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EQUAL = WINS is a family game in which the players lay out pieces to construct Gurami chains. Bigger Gurami chains bring about higher scores than smaller Gurami chains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KISSNG GURAMIS is a 2 player game in which both players have their own boards. The objection is to score more points than the opponent by placing the same pieces in a more sophisticated way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GORAMI is a strategy game for 2 persons. Here both players have their own color. The objection isn't equal sums, but to conquer more stripes than the opponent by having higher sums of one's own gaming pieces. One tactic is to take the last liberty of an opposing piece, because then the opposing piece is turned to one's own color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
