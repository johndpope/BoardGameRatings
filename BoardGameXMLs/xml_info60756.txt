			<description>User Note: Free pdf adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subtitle: An introductory adventure for Weapons of the Gods&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome! Auspicious Beginnings is a tutorial adventure for Weapons of the Gods, designed to teach the game to new players over a single 3-4 hour session of play. We&amp;rsquo;ve included pre-generated characters, handouts, an adventure Loresheet and a fast-paced adventure following the player characters through the exotic Six Devils City: everything you need for a one-shot, demo, or a pre-campaign warm up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Auspicious Beginnings is also suitable for campaign play for Rank 4 characters. You can expect players who know the Weapons of the Gods system to chew through the material presented here very quickly though, so be ready to follow and embellish any hooks that interest the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to fit within a single-session timeframe, the events of Auspicious Beginnings are fairly linear, with a fixed series of encounters. However, the adventure introduces the concept of Loresheets in such a way as to give the players a great deal of control over the context and aesthetics of play, as well as the destiny of the PCs and NPCs alike!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
