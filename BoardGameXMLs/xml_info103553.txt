							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Allied Star Police</name>
									
			<description>We are getting ready to release Allied Star Police for the iOS &amp;mdash; and we are super-thrilled! PopCap has done lots of cool things over the last ten years but we've never worked with an inspiring kid like ten-year-old Owain Weinert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PopCap met Owain in April when Make-A-Wish Foundation&amp;reg; of Alaska &amp;amp; Washington told us about his wish to make a video game. Owain (which means &amp;quot;little warrior&amp;quot; in Welsh) was diagnosed with pre-B Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia last year and has gone through lots of difficult treatments. But his dad said that what he really wanted was to hang out with &amp;quot;real game designers&amp;quot;. So we volunteered to help Owain make his video game during PopCamp. PopCamp is a unique time here when folks can tinker around with interesting ideas, learn lots of new stuff and share it with everyone else at the end of the week.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, little did we know that Owain would be our teacher and lead game designer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the first day of PopCamp the team &amp;mdash; a producer, several developers, programmers and a musician &amp;mdash; invited Owain to our Seattle office to learn more about his idea for a video game. They were blown away when he came with a PowerPoint presentation and basically walked them through the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's how his first slide began: &amp;quot;You are a military genius who has just been released from cryo-sleep. Your brilliance in the Lunar War convinced the A.S.P. (Allied Star Police) to put you in cryogenic slumber, just in case WWIII showed up. It's not exactly WORLD war three, more Galactic War one...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play the commander of the Allied Star Police. Across four lanes, choose where to place your attack vehicles to prevent the enemy from reaching your base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
