			<description>A horse-racing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No dice, no skill!  An unusual mechanism. Each horse moves by having its colour indicated by an arrow on the base of the last horse to move, on a variable track with the colours in varied sequence. Completely predetermined as soon as the track is laid and the first horse is chosen, but completely unpredictable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implementation of:&lt;br/&gt;Alternardo (that game used the same basic mechanism, but with a fixed track of six lanes)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
