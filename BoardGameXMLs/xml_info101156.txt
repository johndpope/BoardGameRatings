			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;I, Robot (arcade game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robot is an arcade game designed by Dave Theurer, and published by Atari Inc. in 1983. The arcade machine comes with two games. The first is I, Robot, a multi-directional shooter that has the player assume the role of &amp;quot;Unhappy Interface Robot #1984&amp;quot;, a servant bot that rebels against Big Brother. The object of the game involves the servant bot going through 126 levels, turning red squares to blue to destroy Big Brother's shield and eye. The player can switch to the second game, Doodle City, a drawing tool that lasts for three minutes, and vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I, Robot is known for being the first commercial video game with filled 3-D polygon graphics and featured flat shading, as well as being the first video game to feature camera control options. Its name was originally titled &amp;quot;Ice World&amp;quot;, but was changed to &amp;quot;I, Robot&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon release of the game, I, Robot received poor reception and was a financial flop. Approximately 750-1500 units of the game were created, with few having been confirmed to exist today. However, the remaining arcade cabinets have become rare collectibles and the game has received later praise for its innovative 3D graphics.Author David Ellis listed it as one of the &amp;quot;notable classics&amp;quot; of its time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
