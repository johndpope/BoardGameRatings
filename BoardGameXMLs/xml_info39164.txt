			<description>This is an abstract game a little similar to checkers.&lt;br/&gt;Theme is rabbits and hunters, but that is of no meaning in the game - rabbits can kill hunters as well as the other way around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a set of blocks numbered from 1 through 7, which is hidden from his opponent. &lt;br/&gt;The number represents the amount of spaces the piece can move.&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of a grid of 9*7 squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the game is to capture opposing pieces. In order to do this, you have to enclose an opponent's block in a straight line between two of your own blocks. These blocks have to sport consecutive numbers, e.g. 2-3 order 4-5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over, if one of the players has no such pairs left. The player who can no longer make captures loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
