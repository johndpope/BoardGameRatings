							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Jon Morris Sketchbük Roleplaying Game</name>
									
			<description>From the game's introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welc&amp;uuml;m to the Sketchb&amp;uuml;k&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jon Morris is a simple man, devoting his time to a loving wife, his chicken coop and the most extensive online sketchbook ever conceived. This sketchbook is so huge, in fact, that I decided it would make a great backdrop for a game. But not any game. Friends, welcome to the Jon Morris Sketchb&amp;uuml;k Roleplaying Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his own words, &amp;quot;Man, if there's one career out there that seems like a fun-filled and exciting adventure filled with amazing experiences and colorful people, I think that career must be Pokemon Wrangler.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hmm... I'd better let the game speak for itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gettin' Ready: what yo&amp;uuml; need&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the Jon Morris Sketchb&amp;uuml;k Roleplaying Game you need:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Some ten-sided dice, preferably all alike.&lt;br/&gt;     A ten-sided die that looks different from the rest; an outcast; a loner. This is the Special Die.&lt;br/&gt;     An Internet connection and, incidentally, a computer.&lt;br/&gt;     A printer and, incidentally, some printer paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Randomly selected pieces of art from the pages of Jon Morris' extensive sketchbook to form the basis for characters, in this chaotic and loosely-defined role-playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
