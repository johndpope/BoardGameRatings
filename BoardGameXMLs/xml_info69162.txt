			<description>Simple roll and move game based on characters from a Swedish series of popular children's books written by G&amp;ouml;sta Knutsson. You move across the city of Uppsala (where the books are set) and get the occasional typical &amp;quot;lose your next turn&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;move four spaces ahead&amp;quot; events, accompanied by short descriptions of cat antics. The box notes the game was made with permission from Knutsson's widow Erna, and it's not impossible she's had some input on the game's design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
