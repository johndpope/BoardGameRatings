			<description>Sprint 2 is a two player overhead-view arcade racer released in 1976 by Kee Games. It was the first in a series of racing games from Atari and Kee Games, a wholly owned subsidiary of Atari. Sprint 2 is believed to be the first Atari product to feature the well-known 'Atari arcade font'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sprint 2 evolved from the two player racing game Gran Trak 20, but included a microprocessor (the 6502), a first for racing games. This allowed Sprint 2 to include two computer-controlled cars, better graphics, and more tracks. Unlike Gran Trak, Sprint 2 did not have brake pedals, but the players could still make their cars &amp;quot;fishtail&amp;quot; by turning their steering wheels abruptly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other arcade games bearing the Sprint name include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Sprint One was released in 1978. The &amp;quot;One&amp;quot; in the title reflects the number of players rather than indicating it was a prequel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Sprint 4 and Sprint 8, a 4 player and 8 player version respectively, were released in 1977. Both were full color raster versions of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Sprint franchise regained life in 1986 with Atari's release of Championship Sprint and Super Sprint, two and three player racing games with color graphics. These also inspired a sci-fi racing/car combat game, Badlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sprint 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
