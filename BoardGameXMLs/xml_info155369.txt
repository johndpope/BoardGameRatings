			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Reflection of Adversity&lt;br/&gt;An eldritch mirror holds the key to demonic power. Courageous and mighty adventurers must face impossible odds to track it down.&lt;br/&gt;You have to stop those guys from taking the treasure you plan to steal!&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Dungeon Fantasy Adventure 1: Mirror of the Fire Demon presents an adventure for four or more Dungeon Fantasy heroes built on 250-300 points. As rumors of the mirror's existence spread throughout the land, the heroes must race against time to defeat monsters, overcome challenges, and outwit other adventurers who want to get the ultimate prize first. The heroes need to wander the wilderness, search the sacred grotto, and find the hidden fortress to save the day. This time, getting there may be more than half the battle!&lt;br/&gt;In addition to a complete adventure (with a drool-inspiring treasure table), you also get:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Twelve adventurers, each with full GURPS Dungeon Fantasy stats and gear. Designed as rivals for this tale, each is also suitable as a ready-to-use PC . . . or for any other nefarious purpose!&lt;br/&gt;     Eleven &amp;quot;henchthings&amp;quot; -- followers and henchmen of the loot-seekers herein. Even after the adventure is over, you'll be prepared with GURPS stats for artillery mages, pixie thieves, karatekas, and more.&lt;br/&gt;     Monsters, monsters, monsters! Over a dozen new creatures waiting to kill headstrong heroes in this epic tale . . . or afterward!&lt;br/&gt;     Seven wilderness maps that can form the basis for countless outdoor encounters, whether used individually or combined into a mega battle map! Each is divided into hexes, for compatibility with basic or tactical combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even if the heroes fight back the forces of darkness, the adventure includes plenty of ideas for follow-ups and spin-offs to keep the action going.&lt;br/&gt;With GURPS Dungeon Fantasy Adventure 1: Mirror of the Fire Demon, the heroes need to face their own dark reflections . . . and keep them from getting the loot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
