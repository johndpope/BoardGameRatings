			<description>Seesaw is a game in the Wooden Balance Game series by Daiso, the Japanese 100-yen shop chain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a piece of wood with a flat upper surface but curved base - the seesaw. The flat surface has the two end areas marked off and each player has to take turns placing different kinds of wooden pieces in their respective areas, depending on the colour rolled on the special die. The pieces come in three colours, yellow cubes, blue cuboids (about twice the length of the yellow cube) and red cuboids (about four times the length of the yellow cubes).&lt;br/&gt;The wooden die has round spots in these three colours (repeated once on the six sides). &lt;br/&gt;The idea is to be able to place your designated piece without toppling whatever has already been placed on the seesaw.&lt;br/&gt;The twist is that the pieces all have two surfaces that are slightly convex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
