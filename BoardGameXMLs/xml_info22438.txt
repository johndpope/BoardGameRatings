			<description>from the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Murder At The Four Deuces is a 1920's gangster murder mystery game with a murder, bribery and back stabbing to be had. Some of the guests will include gangsters, politicians, singers and gamblers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don and MeMe Wannabe are hosting the grand opening celebration of their new club The Four Deuces and you are invited to attend. The Four Deuces is a lavish juice joint serving music, food &amp;amp; fun. The cream and not so cream of society will be here. With gangsters, politicians, dolls, molls and many other interesting guests in attendance this event is sure to be the bee's knees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game content rating:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have taken our bestselling murder mystery game Murder at the Four Deuces and tweaked it to be suitable for teens and/or adults who are concerned about the content in the Mature version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version has no prostitution. In keeping with the TEEN rating there are characters who secretly see others, but they are not called affairs. The murder takes place at the party. Everything is done very tastefully so as not to offend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
