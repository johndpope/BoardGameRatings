							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Keeping on the Borderlands</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life is Nasty, Brutish and Short. So Are You.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just on the edge of the human kingdom lies a valley whose cliff faces are riddled with caves. In these caves dwell a surprising variety of monstrous races: sneaky goblins, downtrodden kobolds, savage orcs, enormous ogres and stranger things still. These monstrous peoples are only tenuously united by the common worship of the bloody god Zemox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The human Baron of Restwell Keep is supposed to keep the monsters under control, but there isn&amp;rsquo;t much he can do. Sure, every year or two you get a couple of self proclaimed &amp;ldquo;heroes&amp;rdquo; coming in to wipe out the monsters. But most of these adventuresome kids wind up on the wrong end of a glaive-guisarme. The monsters, they stick around. The biggest threat to the monsters isn&amp;rsquo;t the human warriors, but the constant infighting between monstrous tribes. Gathering together this many violent subhumans in one place is a surefire recipe for disaster. The valley is a fiasco, just waiting to happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
