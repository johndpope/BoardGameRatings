			<description>Known as &amp;quot;Survie 2000&amp;quot; in French.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two planets are in desperate need of the Uranium found on a third.  Whoever brings back the most to his planet, facing natural dangers and the enemy's might, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships come in four types: Astrobase (strongest, initially carries everything else), Fighter (fast but weak), Battle-Cruiser (medium strength, carries Laser Gun and Force Field Transmitter) and Carrier (slowest and weakest, transports the Uranium [NOT the Fighters] --may steal the cargo of another Carrier).  Each is rated in Offensive Potential, Defensive Potential and Motion Potential (which is also the Firing Range).  Laser Guns are immobile firing platforms; Force Field Transmitters are obstacles and may be combined to erect linear barriers (when their separation is at most 3 hexes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Natural obstacles include Magnetic Storm Zones, Asteroids (fixed and mobile) and a Black Hole.  Combat uses a classic odds-ratio table (CRT), with possible results being destruction, breakdown (out of action for a turn) or deviation (moving the ship 3 hexes) --the aggressor may suffer as well as the defender, depending on the odds.  Collisions can occur but not on purpose (no ramming).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
