							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Twizmo! Original</name>
									
			<description>Twizmo! is made up of two parts.  A Twizmo cube, which is a twistable puzzle cube with 9 faces per side, and a deck of square cards.  In Twizmo Original, the faces and cards are made up of 6 symbols.  The 54 cards have 9 of each symbol, as does the Twizmo cube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twizmo! Original&amp;rsquo;s simple rules bely the use of spatial and deductive reason along with strategy and a little bit of luck needed for a win.  Its thoughtful pace is great for bringing young and old minds together and its universal appeal transcends language and culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twizmo! is all about creating sets of three matching icons.  Players take turns twisting the cube, with the goal of creating &amp;ldquo;three-in-a row&amp;rdquo; groups of similar icons on the top panel.  A &amp;ldquo;3-in-a-row&amp;rdquo; set on the cube allows a player to collect all of the visible cards with the matching icon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When players have collected 3 cards with the same icon, they may turn that set face down; that card set is &amp;ldquo;closed&amp;rdquo; and cannot be taken by another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game, collect the most card sets, or at any time during the game, collect a set of all nine matching cards for an instant win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
