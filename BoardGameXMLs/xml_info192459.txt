			<description>Life: School Years is a deck building game about real life! Everyone starts the game with only Mom and Dad to help them, but can acquire new friends and properties to help them defeat jerks and succeed in life. Milestone cards also add a press-your-luck mechanic and a way to remove unwanted cards from your deck. The player with the most success points at the end of the game is the winner at Life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
