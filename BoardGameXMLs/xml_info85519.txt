							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">For Love or Power</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;For Love or Power deals with the idea of romance in an RPG and it also looks at the medieval reality of marriage as well. There are certain assumptions already made and they are the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The campaign has room for it without disrupting everything else. For example, romance will probably not fit into a typical &amp;quot;kick the doors in&amp;quot; campaign where role-playing of any kind is minimized. Other types of campaigns might have good or bad reasons to include romance and there may be better times to include it than others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Every one of the players and the GM has agreed that romance that should be in the game. The maturity level in the group is high enough to accept it without causing the game to break down. The amount of romance can vary in every campaign. Is the main plot, a occasional sub-plot or does it only take place during in between adventures or perhaps only played out when some of the players cannot make it. The agreement is very important because disinterest or distrust can quickly derail the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
