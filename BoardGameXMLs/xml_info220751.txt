							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sol Tabletop RPG</name>
									
			<description>Kickstarter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sol is a unique tabletop role-playing experience. Many role-playing games draw on medieval fantasy to create their worlds and playing environment. To differentiate themselves from this huge choice, these games have developed rule systems with increasing depth, complexity that have, in the end, only served to throttle the player's freedoms and imagination. Sol turns this trend on its head: it sheds the unnecessary kilos providing the player with a sleek yet powerful game system that once again allows the player's imagination to rule supreme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sol has a single rulebook that covers both game mechanics and discusses the world of Sol. Players are encouraged to use their imaginations; if you can think of a plausible reaction to a scenario you can try it. Want to transmute a moose into a million stinging wasps? The game mechanics will allow for that scenario.  What Sol brings to the table is a new world and a game system that dispenses with complex die rolling. The game is played with a few standard six-sided die and character sheet delivering on its slogan, less rolling, more role-playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
