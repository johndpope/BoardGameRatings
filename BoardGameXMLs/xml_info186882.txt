							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ascension: Theme Pack â€“ Location Pack</name>
									
			<description>The Ascension Location Pack introduces a new card type to the Ascension Deck Building game.  Locations can be shuffled into the center deck of any Ascension game.  When they are revealed in a center row slot, they they permanently modify that slot to fundamentally change gameplay.  Locations can change the cost of cards as well as create special events when a card in that slot is acquired or defeated.  This promo pack is a great addition to any Ascension set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pack of thirteen cards contains doubles of Cetra's Shrine, Path Of Trials, Stone Circle, Hedron Sanctum, Rift's Edge and Arha Dojo plus a rules card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
