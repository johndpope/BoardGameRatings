			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mambo is a renowned guitarist. Few people know he's also the best agent of the Intergalactic Spy Agency based on the planet Freak (in fact, he himself doesn't know that, as his spy personality is activated by a telepathic entity called the Cosmic Sisters. He doesn't remember any of his missions.) When an I.S.A. agent learns about how the guards of a secret nuclear missile base in the Amazonian rainforest have gone rogue and threaten to destroy the earth, the only choice is to send in Mambo and his trusty Guitargun Shooter to infiltrate the base, reprogram the missiles and fire them towards the sun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mambo is a side-view action game. The player must travel screen after screen while fighting enemy guards and dodging traps. Guards can either be shot, or stunned in close combat (which allow the player to steal their ammunition). Mines can be disarmed in an included minigame. The four guard officers must be stunned in order to get their missile firing codes. The player must also find two switches to open the doors to the base and the command room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
