			<description>bit Crawl Portable is the &amp;quot;take with you&amp;quot; version of Super Turbo bit Crawl FX: Alpha Xtreme, packing the punch of the full-size game in a smaller package.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;bCP is a rogue-like dungeon crawler with the feel of a classic console RPG. Players select their hero, their special ability, and a boss that they will fight at the end of the game. Then players navigate the dungeon, fighting any monsters in their way, collecting treasure, and dealing with any events that might crop up along the way until the boss fight is triggered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;bCP is a co-op game with a competitive element. Players will find it difficult to navigate the dungeon alone but will be collecting treasures of varying value along the way, the choice on whether to share these with their party or hoard them for their own benefit at the end of the game is theirs alone. The person with the highest value of treasure when the boss is defeated or the heroes die at the hands of the boss is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;bCP uses custom dice to resolve combat, trigger special abilities, and seed the dungeon. The game is played out through a series of rounds in which the players each take a turn consisting of two actions then the monsters take a turn fending off the heroes advances. This continues until the boss fight is triggered by a card located in the monster deck, at which time all heroes are warped to the room that the boss appears and fight desperately to best the boss of the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the varying player abilities and the random dungeon seeds bCP will not play the same way twice. Unlike other dungeon crawlers, bCP will not require a DM to guide the party along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
