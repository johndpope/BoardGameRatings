			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome again to Luceat Lux Vestra!&lt;br/&gt;As a Game Master you have a special responsibility in the game. Lux is a game that is both fun and with opportunities to learn from the trials and tribulations of characters from that time period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a Game Master, your responsibilities are:&lt;br/&gt;To be the world they play in&lt;br/&gt;To keep the action going&lt;br/&gt;To challenge the characters&lt;br/&gt;To talk it over at the end&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be The World They Play In&lt;br/&gt;As a GM, you&amp;rsquo;re responsible for painting the image of the situation they&amp;rsquo;re in. Try to be descriptive and engage all five senses. If the players are trying a daring escape through secret tunnels under the streets of Rome, tell them of the smell of damp soil all around them, and the heat of their torches as they make their way. This helps bring the world to life and helps them immerse themselves into the situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speaking of immersion, don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to act out when playing the role of the various Non-Player Characters that the players will be interacting with. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to go overboard, but even just shifts in body language and word choice go a long way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep The Action Going&lt;br/&gt;Given Light Bringer&amp;rsquo;s missions, the game should always be moving forward, and the Light Bringers should always be encouraged to make a decision or take a course of action. Sometimes this can be achieved by establishing a deadline, for example, &amp;ldquo;Antonius will be executed by dawn. We must rescue him tonight!&amp;rdquo; In other instances it might serve to introduce a more direct threat, like having their location discovered by a group of soldiers. Likewise, perhaps appealing to their Virtues will be best, as a Light Bringer with Justice as their Virtue would be spurred to action by seeing an innocent being beaten up by thugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
