			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 16 x 30 inch Battlemap of an Office, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a simple job, break into the boss&amp;rsquo;s office and extract all the data on his PC with this external hard drive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time to punch the clock for work in DramaScape&amp;rsquo;s Office! Work includes extraction of data, personnel, and packages with payment on delivery of the goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Office is an internal view map of an office floor in a building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Office is intended for modern settings. It also might work in near future science fiction settings such as cyberpunk although the old-style monitors are a bit of a stretch. The really cheap company simply refuses to invest in new monitors in that case, forcing their employees to work with outdated equipment. It may also be an interesting location for a horror game, such as barricading the stairway door from zombies as the Player Characters try to survive for as long as possible on the top floor of the building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Payback: The office boss recently fired an employee from his office job. The employee knows he saw the boss doing things on his personal computer (PC) that are not in the company&amp;rsquo;s interests. He needs a copy of all the information on the PC. He intends to use the information to blackmail his boss to either get his job back or barring that to humiliate him and get him fired. And perhaps both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He hires the Player Characters to break into the office at night and use an external hard drive to download all the information on his boss&amp;rsquo;s PC. The Player Characters must bypass the locked front door and the lone security guard on watch. The boss&amp;rsquo;s PC is protected by passwords and other firewalls requiring the Player Characters to hack into the PC to get all the information out of it. While the information is being downloaded into the external hard drive, a squad of security guards suddenly arrives from the stairs and elevator and tells the group to freeze. Was there an alarm built into the PC itself? These security guards are wearing a completely different uniform than the security guard that was on watch. If they want to get the information out of there, they&amp;rsquo;ll have to fight off the security guards while the download completes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
