							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dogs of War (2003)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 903, 18 April. Domino Dogs have been with SLA Industries for over two years now, the prototypes for almost three. SLA has used them to trace and hunt cannibals, carrion, rogue operatives and it has been rumored rogue Necanthropes. They are dangerous creatures, but the World of Progress has learned to work with them, if not trust them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr Strand has been very pleased with the work of the Domino Dog and its Head, Dr Taro Toyama. The work on the Domino Dog allowed Phantom Pregnancy Inc to acquire additional funds for further projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Domino Dogs were seen as the future, to deal with the increasing incursions of carrion and cannibals. The work they undertook in Downtown and the Cannibal Sectors led the populace to believe that their savior, Mr Slayer, had once again led them from destruction to the promised land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
