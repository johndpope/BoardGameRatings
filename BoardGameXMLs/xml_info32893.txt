			<description>Middle East Smackdown is a 2-4 strategy board game set in the middle east. Players take control of the USA, Israel, Syria, Iran, Iraq and Lebanon for the final conflict in the middle east. Terrorism sponsored by Iran and Syria have pushed the US too far and now it is full scale war. The US and its allies are now out to conquer Iran and Syria completely. They have overwhelming technological superiority and the best trained troops in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Iran has some good defensive ground, lots of men for canon fodder, militant groups, terrorist insurgents and its most potent asset of all, the liberal politicians within the US house and senate. Can Iran manipulate the media and its liberal allies to get Congress to cut funding from the US military in order to stave off conquest and win the war? Can the US military complete the war with the forces it has in the fields if funding does get cut?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Middle East Combat Comes with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) 3 piece 16.5&amp;quot; x 31.5&amp;quot; full color game map.&lt;br/&gt;2) 432 cut-out full color game counters on chipboard.&lt;br/&gt;3) Game Rules&lt;br/&gt;4) 1 Six Sided Die.&lt;br/&gt;5) Resource Chart&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
