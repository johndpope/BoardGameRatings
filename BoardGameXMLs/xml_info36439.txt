			<description>&amp;quot;Wargame of the American West circa 1840-1900. Players are rival Land Barons trying to gain complete control of the same territory. Victory: Control all Settlements on the Board. Players are eliminated if their Baron is killed.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a hex map showing thirty settlements. Each player chooses to play one of four ranches and the ranches are placed on settlements that are far apart. The remaining settlement spaces have a random settlement counter placed on them. The settlements are thereby determined to be farms, mines, towns, or trading posts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a Baron counter and two Regulator counters. The players gain revenue from their ranches and from other settlements they control. Revenue is used to recruit new units and to provide upkeep for the units a player controls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
