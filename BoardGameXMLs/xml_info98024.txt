			<description>website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Synopsis of the ParaSpace Role Playing System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ParaSpace Roleplaying System (PSrps ?pronounced serps) is a hardback, 336 page, full colour, rule book that really does deliver what it promises on the cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether it's swashbuckling on the high seas, investigating a murder on Mars, or attending the court of King Arthur, the ParaSpace Role Playing System is a generic set of rules that can be used to play games set in a multitude of settings and styles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find a comprehensive role playing game system allowing for balanced character creation at various levels of power and experience. Combat mechanics that can be played as gritty and realistic or, by adding in various skills, abilities, techniques and manoeuvres, can become heroic, high fantasy. The magic system has also been developed to fit in with varying genres and settings and encompasses inherent magic, rituals and ceremonies, traditional spell slinging, the creation of potions and other magical items, free form magic and special abilities. In addition, the Game Master section contains templates allowing for the quick creation of a multitude of creatures and Non Player Characters, hints on running games, building settings and designing adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In short, the ParaSpace Role Playing System is a complete set of generic rules that contains everything game masters and players need to open the door to the many worlds of their imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;            &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Core Rule Book is broken into three distinct Sections: The Player&amp;rsquo;s Guide, which details creating characters, combat, equipment, experience and other miscellaneous rules that the players may need to know; Magic, which details all the different styles of magic that can be achieved using PSrps and The GM Section which contains annotations to the player&amp;rsquo;s guide, Templates for Non Player Characters (NPCs), plus plenty of advice and hints to help with designing settings, adventures and GMing in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
