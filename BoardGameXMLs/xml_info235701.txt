			<description>Battalions is a card game for 2-4 players which uses two packs of 52 standard playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over a series of rounds in which players are trying to manoeuvre cards from a battalion pool in front of them and in to their hand (deployment). When any player has succeeded in deploying 5 cards (i.e. have 5 cards in their hand) the game ends and the players go to war. The cards are counted and scored and the player with the highest total has defeated the other players and won the game (War).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
