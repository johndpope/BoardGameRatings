							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horror Rules: Book of Bad Guys #3</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STILL MORE Brand New Bad Guys!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We know what you're thinking. &amp;quot;They already gave us Horror Rules Books of Bad Guys #1-2... my players are still traumatized by the horrific and terrifying creatures I've unleashed on them. How can things get any better?!&amp;quot; Well, they can't. This stuff is just too darn good! But, as long as you've got your players reeling and are tossing record amounts of Character sheets into the shredder, why stop? If you take it easy on them they'll just get weak. So, we dug down deep and found more previously unexplored and disturbing areas of our brains to bring you... STILL MORE BRAND NEW BAD GUYS!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This third release in the popular Book of Bad Guys line is another meaty 10-page collection of completely original, brand-spanking-new Bad Guys. Just like in the others, you won't find tired, warmed-over old foes like axe murderers and yetis, but ten never-before-seen and totally creeperific fiends designed to possess, torment, suffocate, poison, freak-out and otherwise bring harm to your players. Be prepared to watch them cower in fear as they face such fiendish foes as the &amp;quot;Bone Reaper,&amp;quot; the &amp;quot;Psycho Fungus,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Old Lantern Eye&amp;quot; and the really really freaky freakiness of &amp;quot;Mr. Whispers!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
