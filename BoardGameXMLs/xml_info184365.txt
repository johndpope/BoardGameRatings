			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pass the Grass is an interactive board game that borrows elements ranging from the innocent world of Milton Bradley to the psychedelic vibe of the Grateful Dead. Rolling both dice and joints, players make their way around the board in a quest for the perfect buzz while completing hilarious challenges and satisfying their lust for &amp;ldquo;munchies.&amp;rdquo; Pass the Grass can be played with 2 or more players but they must be 21 or over. Clearly, this is a game for adults (cough).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take turns drawing cards (and puffs) and complete challenges to win. Includes: 1 game board, 2 dice, 6 game &amp;quot;tokens,&amp;quot; 2 decks of cards, and a rule book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME PLAY: Everybody puts $1 in the jackpot. There are two sets of cards, you roll dice and there are places on the board that tell you to do different things. You take a card, and each card will tell you to do something different. There are credit and pass cards. A credit card means you do what the card says, which could be anything from taking a hit off a joint, to eating some munchies, to telling an embarrassing story. If you take a pass card, you pass it to anybody and then they have to do it. If they choose not to, they&amp;rsquo;re out. If you land on the jackpot, you get all the money and everyone replenishes it with $1 each, but it can be more if players want. Players who choose not to ante up are out. Last player still playing wins the pot. (Everyone else wins a nice buzz.) For a shorter game, play ends when someone lands on the jackpot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may substitute a shot of booze for a puff of pot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
