			<description>A menacing space station has appeared in orbit above the Earth. On board, an army of evil robots is being assembled to invade the planet. Meanwhile, a lone discarded Robo wakes up with a fresh perspective&amp;hellip; saving humanity! Can you help our Hero escape the space station and put an end to the evil robot&amp;rsquo;s nefarious plot? Find out in RoboArena, a new game for the iPhone, iPad, and other devices!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RoboArena is a Top Down Turn Based Casual Strategy Multiplayer Action Game (TDTBCSMAG for short). Inspired by the board game classic Robo Rally, it will be a unique blend of strategy, puzzles, action, and casual fun! You play the part of a small Robo who has woken up in an evil factory designed to create a robot army to take over the world. Your mission is to help the little Robo to escape from this factory and stop the evil plot before it&amp;rsquo;s too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you play, you must use an increasing arsenal of weapons, armors, and skills to solve puzzles, dodge evil robot drones, and destroy key computers to stop this evil factory. Additionally you will be able to test you skills against advanced AI players as well as humans in Arena and Multiplayer modes where players hunt each other, try to predict their targets moves, lay traps, and avoid enemies across random battlefields in a game of cloak-and-dagger chess. We have developed a unique casual style of game play that will push your planning and strategizing skills to the limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
