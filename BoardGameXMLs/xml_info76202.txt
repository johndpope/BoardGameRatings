			<description>Nestortiles Octopus is a game for 2 to 6 players in the line of Knizia's masterpiece Ingenious. You'll need one set of Nestortiles in order to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players score points by creating rows of equally numbered or colored tiles. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle all the tiles and randomly distribute them facing up so each player receives the same number of tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Determine the starting player. This player places one of his tiles in the middle of the playing surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in turns in anticlockwise order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn, each player must place one of his tiles adjacent to an already played tile (horizontally or vertically). Then he scores points and the turn passes to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCORING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To score points, do the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In each of the 8 directions (orthogonally and diagonally), count the number of adjacent tiles of the same color as the tile just played (the tiles must not be interrupted by blank spaces or other tiles of a different color). The played tile doesn&amp;rsquo;t count. Add these points to your total score.&lt;br/&gt;     In each of the 8 directions (orthogonally and diagonally), count the number of adjacent tiles with the same number as the tile just played (the tiles must not be interrupted by blank spaces or other tiles of a different number). The played tile doesn&amp;rsquo;t count. Add these points to your total score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;END GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all the tiles have been played. The player with the highest score is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VARIANT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For longer games, you can use 2 sets of Nestortiles instead on one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
