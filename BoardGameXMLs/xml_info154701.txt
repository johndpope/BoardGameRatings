			<description>Long before time had a name, Ninjago was created by the first Spinjitzu master by using the 4 golden weapons of Spinjitzu; the Scythe of Quakes, the Nunchucks of Lightning, the Shurikans of Ice and the Sword of Fire &amp;ndash; weapons so powerful, no one can handle all of their power at once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Spinjitzu master passed away, his two sons, Sensei Wu and Lord Garmadon, swore to protect the golden weapons but Lord Garmadon was consumed with darkness and wanted to possess them. A fierce battle broke out and at last, Lord Garmadon was struck down and banished to the underworld. Peace returned but knowing Lord Garmadon&amp;rsquo;s hunger for power, the weapons were hidden in secret places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fate of Ninjago now lies in your hands and you must choose which brother you want to help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build your own army of heroes, battle the enemies and become a Master of Spinjitzu as you recover powerful ninja weapons and restore the balance between good and evil! Enjoy fun adventures and exciting missions as you travel the land of Ninjago to find the golden weapons before the evil Lord Garmadon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or play as the bad guys and join Lord Garmadon&amp;rsquo;s evil Skeleton Army, where you&amp;rsquo;ll face-off against the Masters of Spinjitzu and help Lord Garmadon regain his strength and become more powerful than ever before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
