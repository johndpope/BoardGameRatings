							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Game Boy Color)</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a 2000 Game Boy Color video game based on the television show of the same name. It was the first video game based on the franchise to be released and the only Buffy game to be rated 'E' by the ESRB.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story&lt;br/&gt;Set in the fourth season. Buffy is just trying to relax and enjoy a week off from her university classes when a horde of blood-thirsty vampires and demons descend upon the campus and the surrounding town. Now it's up to her to make things safe again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Levels&lt;br/&gt;There are 8 levels in the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Graveyard &lt;br/&gt;The Bronze &lt;br/&gt;The Sewers &lt;br/&gt;Outside The Zoo &lt;br/&gt;The Mansion &lt;br/&gt;The Initiative Lab &lt;br/&gt;The Hellmouth &lt;br/&gt;The Chamber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters&lt;br/&gt;Buffy, Willow, Xander, Giles, Anya, Angel and Ethan Rayne make appearances. Cordelia does not appear on-screen but can be 'heard' talking to Buffy on the phone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemies&lt;br/&gt;All of the enemies are Vampires, but from various parts of the earth. They include standard vampires, bikers, ninjas, Amazonian warriors, top-hatted and cane-carrying gentlemen, and a hybrid mummy/vampire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Each level opens with a non-interactive cut-scene, and then Buffy goes solo on a patrol for vamps. These vamp patrols are typically a scrolling affair with intermittent requirements to jump or duck and of course lots of vampires trying to bag themselves a slayer. Sprite buffy can both punch and kick the bad guys and also hurl objects at them; when the HP of the enemies gets low Buffy stakes them. There are bosses as well but that's pretty much it for the game. (There's no puzzle genre tag on this VGG entry for good reason)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_(handheld_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
