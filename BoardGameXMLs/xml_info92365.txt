			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chaos March gives players the information they need to run games and campaigns in the troubled Sarna March. The Guide to the Chaos March  offers players an up-to-date look at the many factions and employment opportunities on the planets in the area, including first-person accounts of the real situations. Chaos March also includes new rules and equipment for BattleTech and MechWarrior, and a chapter describing Outreach, the ideal starting point for a Chaos March campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook filled the need for an area that could be used in campaigns that didn't feature the Clans, but also wasn't another &amp;quot;fight the Periphery Bandits&amp;quot; scenario repeated over and over. The location of the Chaos March within the Inner Sphere makes it ideal for use with factions from all of the major Houses, and the book offers lots of plot hooks and ideas. It also introduces several new vehicles, including possibly the most dangerous helicopter in BattleTech history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book's probably of most use to those who want to create battles that involve any major or minor faction wanted, want to use Level 2 technology, and don't want to be limited to scenarios linked to the period between the war of 3039 and the Clan invasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
