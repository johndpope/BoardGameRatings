							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Green Game</name>
									
			<description>The Green Game is an entertaining, enlightening and sometimes alarming way to examine the ecological facts and myths that face us today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The person who bought the game always goes first. Players roll the die and move their tokens around the circular track. Landing on certain spaces lets the player answer a question. Correct answers reduce the player's carbon footprint, while incorrect answers increase the carbon footprint. Other spaces have players draw &amp;quot;Eco-Warrior&amp;quot; cards that reduce the carbon footprints, or &amp;quot;Eco-Pig&amp;quot; cards that increase the carbon footprint. The first player to reach the smallest carbon footprint on the scoring board (8 points) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Green Game is made from recycled material, soy inks and wooden game pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
