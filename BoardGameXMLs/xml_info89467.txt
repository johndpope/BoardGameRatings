							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wayfarer: Scout Ship</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wayfarer is a state of the art Seeker-class scout ship - a reconnaissance and surveillance vessel built for long range operations. It is designed to be operated by either a single pilot or pilot/co-pilot team, though a 4-6 person variant is provided. This small vessel is approximately 120ft long, with a wingspan about 20ft longer, and employs some of the latest progress-level seven technology. The cargo bay also contains a custom hover car for more stealthy reconnaissance or just off-duty cruising.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To round things out, two additional small craft are included. The first is the &amp;quot;TOAD&amp;quot; Transport for Omniphibious Advanced Deployment. This military transport was developed to quickly deploy and recover a platoon of troops or recon team and vehicle on the battlefield. These sturdy craft employ massive, rotating engines for high-G vertical take off and landing. The armored Toad hull is designed to land on anything from solid ground, to swamp, to calm water; and can maneuver in space or atmosphere with equal agility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TUG-4103 is an old freight hauler was made to pull long trains of unmanned cargo pods (also included). It requires only a single crew and operates exclusively in space - sporting a powerful set of ion engines but no atmospheric thrusters. Though not glamorous or adventurous, it is a common sight in the space lanes and should be useful as either a supporting character or a main player just starting out. Complete stats, maps, and bonus art are provided for all of the vessels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wayfarer Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     14 page PDF file detailing the ship, interior locations, and captain.&lt;br/&gt;     Open Game License stats provided for the vessel, crew, and hover car carried in the cargo bay.&lt;br/&gt;     Includes the Shadowhawk variant which sleep six and sports a darker paint scheme plus turreted guns.&lt;br/&gt;     Tug-4103 &amp;amp; TOAD Overviews&lt;br/&gt;         7 page PDF file that covers the same aspects listed above, but for the freight hauler TUG-4103.&lt;br/&gt;         A similar 7 page PDF file for TOAD.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Map Book&lt;br/&gt;         Full-color 15 page PDF file containing complete interior maps for all ships.&lt;br/&gt;         Includes miniature-scale maps for tactical combat.&lt;br/&gt;         Composite maps of the ship interiors.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
