			<description>An Apocalyptic d20 Scenario&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six years ago something happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this point, nobody is really clear what. At least nobody that you know anymore. The information superhighway was the first thing to go, before the meat world started to fall apart. A global wave of... Something, followed by an array of environmental catastrophes rendered the vast majority of our silicon industrial age inert as a dead battery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, not all of the pieces of it stayed as quiet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Willful Entities, or some other handy technical euphemism, also emerged or were perhaps only empowered by this event. Ethereal, intelligent... beings manifesting from in the waters, the rocks, the towers and cars that are equally indifferent, and hostile to the confused populace that they emerge among.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the wealth of modern civilization&amp;rsquo;s resources no longer accessible, and humanity forced to rely on more Industrial age means to just to survive, all people really know is that our old station as the apex of this world has passed away in a flash and it is time to either learn to cope and rebuild with Earth&amp;rsquo;s new co-inhabitants or simply to go, fall into the chaos, and fade away with civilization into history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haunted Earth was an intended post-apocalyptic campaign setting based around the d20 Modern rules set.  This introductory module is self-contained, aside from the standard d20 Modern rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
