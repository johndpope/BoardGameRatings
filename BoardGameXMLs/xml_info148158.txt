							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Day in the Life: Gaming the Downtime</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Day in the Life&amp;rdquo; sessions allow a lot of different non-combat things to happen in a gameplay style that satisfies the desire to utilize character abilities and gifts while still focusing on deep story development and roleplay. To do a Day in the Life session, just get everyone at the table as usual, and ask them to think about what they want to accomplish on the day or period of time in question...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Day in the Life rules hack makes resolving all of those between-the-adventures activities gamable and a lot more fun, with very tangible rewards and benefits as well as excellent narrative and roleplay consequences. Every player at the table will be able to choose from the following Activities for their Day in the Life session: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Acquire&lt;br/&gt;     Assist&lt;br/&gt;     Carouse&lt;br/&gt;     Court&lt;br/&gt;     Craft&lt;br/&gt;     Explore&lt;br/&gt;     Gamble&lt;br/&gt;     Interrogate&lt;br/&gt;     Investigate&lt;br/&gt;     Manage&lt;br/&gt;     Negotiate&lt;br/&gt;     Patrol&lt;br/&gt;     Reminisce&lt;br/&gt;     Research&lt;br/&gt;     Rest&lt;br/&gt;     Socialize&lt;br/&gt;     Train&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With rewards like Adventure Cards, Bennies, Information, Contacts, and more, players will enjoy getting to play out Day in the Life sessions as much as regular adventures. GMs will greatly appreciate the added opportunities to leverage Hindrances and instigate new Plot Hooks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though designed initially for the Shaintar product line, GMs of any Savage Worlds setting (or, really, any game) will find this system extremely useful for their campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
