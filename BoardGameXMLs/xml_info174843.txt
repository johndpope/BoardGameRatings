			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nameless Streets will take you between the rainy streets of Portland (Oregon), once considered the most vicious City of america. You, as private investigators, you have a way to interact with the less desirable part of the community, which some call the Portland &amp;quot;invisible&amp;quot;. But this term has a special meaning for you. Why in your work you come to see the part really hidden in Portland. What others would call supernatural. Where shady types are not - necessarily - even human. Besides, who ever said that you are really human?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nameless Streets is a Game Storytelling - you can even call it an RPG, but do not expect anything like the classic RPGs - that will take you to investigate mysteries whose solution will prove to be ... special. You can be the witch who finds missing persons with magic, or the werewolf that gets rid of the minions of the underworld with his brute force, or any other character typical of urban fantasy. In Nameless Streets, all you have to do is write a description of your colorful character, and the rules of the game will help you to make it alive and make it an integral part of the adventures that you will live in the company of your friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nameless Streets is a full game, you need no other hand to play. Are only required paper, pen and friends with a lot of imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powered by White Rabbit Studios. Developed by Charles A. Green for Alephtar Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
