							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bloomie&#039;s: The Game</name>
									
			<description>Each player starts with $1630 and uses the dice to travel around the gameboard buying property. The properties represent Bloomingdale&amp;rsquo;s department stores around the United States. Houses and hotels from Monopoly are replaced with little and big brown bags. Players can play until all but one player is bankrupt or the richest player is determined to be the winner after a one-hour time limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
