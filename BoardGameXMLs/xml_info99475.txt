							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fox and Hounds Card Game</name>
									
			<description>44 cards, all showing characters at the fox-hunt; Hounds, Lady Riders, Huntsmen, the Fox and the Whip.&lt;br/&gt;All the cards are dealt to each player. After dealing one card to each player, the dealer must add one to the pool as well so that the game starts with a number of cards in the pool. Each player is given 24 counters. The person holding the Whip card cries &amp;quot;Tally Ho!&amp;quot; and asks the player of his choice if he has the Fox card. Various penalties occur if he is right or wrong. Then the Whip is placed into the pool cards, which are now shuffled.&lt;br/&gt;Now each player asks a player for a card, and if he makes a trick, he can claim it in front of him. Then he takes a number of counters from the pool and adds them to his other counters. If a pair of Hounds is played, he collects 3 counters, a pair of Lady Riders, 6 counters; a pair of huntsmen, 9 counters; a special pair of the Whip and the Fox, 12 counters and that trick counts as two tricks at the end of the game. All cards in the pair must match numbers as well as images.&lt;br/&gt;When all the cards are collected as pairs, the player with the most tricks takes the remaining counters in the pool, and the one with the most counters, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
