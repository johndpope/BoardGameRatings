			<description>The Icehouse Plant Game is an Icehouse Pyramid game played inside a loop of string.  Each player controls a plant that is trying to grow while blocking all of the light energy from the other players' plants.  The more energy your plant can collect, the bigger it can grow, but you must be careful not to grow so fast that you kill your leaves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
