			<description>Three critics... One set of tools... No excuses!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chiseled is a deck-sculpting game about sculpting marble. In Chiseled, play as artists in a shared studio, working to complete your sculptures by the time any player has checked in with the three critics enough times to get rated. Using one tool at a time from the shared workbench, remove and accentuate cards from your starting deck of cards to improve its artistic value, and please the critics for bonuses. Each tool offers a unique method of interacting with the marble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chiseled features a single-player score challenge mode, as well as competitive play for 2 to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
