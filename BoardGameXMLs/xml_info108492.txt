			<description>In Slag om Amersfoort (Battle for Amersfoort) the players try to conquer the Dutch city of Amersfoort. The game is situated in the 16th century, when the forces of field marshal Maarten van Rossum occupied the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn, players can try to have one of their pawns enter the city. Then they roll the dice to move the pawns that are already in a city. Whenever pawns of different players are on the same spot, the players roll the dice to fight. The losing pawn is thrown out of the city. Instead of moving their pawns, a player can also try to answer a trivia question to &amp;quot;acquire&amp;quot; the location of one of their pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one of the players has acquired the four location on their secret mission card. Alternatively, the game can also end when a certain number of pawns have been ejected from the city; in this case Maarten van Rossem wins, together with the player who won the most fights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for a simplified game for children &amp;quot;Amersfoort op Drakenpoten&amp;quot; (Amersfoort on Dragon's Feet) are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
