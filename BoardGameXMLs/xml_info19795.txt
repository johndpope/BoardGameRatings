			<description>This game combines roll-and-move, auctions, horse-trading and multiple victory conditions. Players roll to move around an intersecting track that includes a space for each state and spaces with instructions (Free TV, Major Fundraiser, Go to Home Region, Good News, Minor Set-Back, Minor Foul-Up, Major Disaster).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The states are divided into five regions, and ranked within each region. Players pick a region and roll for Home State on 2D6 within the region. When a player lands on an unclaimed state, it goes up for auction (with conditions). A player can grab another state in his home region for the minimum bid; if in another candidate&amp;rsquo;s home region, it is a two-way auction with that candidate; otherwise all can participate. Landing on a controlled state requires paying money (more if the owner is there or it is part of a bloc of 7+ states in its region). Players can trade states and money at any time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can win in one of four ways: Front Runner (majority of the 1500 total delegate votes); Regional Bloc (control 7+ states in each of 3 regions);  Key States (control 10+ of the 15 states ranked #1, #2 and #3 in their regions, including 2+ #1s); and Balanced National Appeal (control 5+ states from each of 4 regions).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 1.5 hours, the game moves to a Convention round, where players not meeting minimum levels are eliminated, everyone gets bonus money and all auctions are open. After another 30 minutes, if no one has achieved one of the victory conditions, there is a Roll Call vote and most delegates wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
