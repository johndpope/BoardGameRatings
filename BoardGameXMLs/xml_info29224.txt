			<description>Operaci&amp;oacute;n Barbarroja (Operation Barbarossa) is a strategic wargame that portrays the Eastern Front during World War II. The game recreates the combats between the German and Soviet armies between 1941 - 1945.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1987 NAC released a series of mini-wargames consisting in this and two other titles (&amp;quot;Infanter&amp;iacute;a&amp;quot; and  &amp;quot;La carga de la brigada ligera&amp;quot;). Their boxes, boards and pieces were obviously of a smaller size than NAC&amp;acute;s regular games, and also their prices (I seem to recall that I paid about 700 pesetas by then).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents were: a 24x38 cms board, 112 counters, a tray for them, a special die, sheets and rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was conceived for two players, being its duration from about 30 to 120 minutes and its difficulty 5 in the NAC scale (high).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Counters could be organized in groups. The pieces within them were put aside on the grouping sheets, and numbered group counters were moved on the board. This was the first time I saw this method in a NAC game. They were really getting better and more &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot; comparing to the first ones they published...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
