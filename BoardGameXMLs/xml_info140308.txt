			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's an amazing maze with prizes everywhere. Plan your best path, and start the ball rolling!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you like mazes, you'll love LOGIC LEVELS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First you tell the Magic Hand where to put the walls, bridges and springs to guide the ball through the maze. The more prizes it hits the more points you will score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that's just the beginning. Once the ball starts rolling, you can change the maze as you go. Move the bridges back and forth. Send the walls up and down. Aim for a spring and KABOING!--up you go to a higher floor. Land in a paint bucket and KERPLOP!--the ball changes to a new color. Then hit a prize of the same color and you score extra points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In LOGIC LEVELS you have to think fast--and that's why the fun will last and last.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LOGIC LEVELS was designed by Frieda Lekkerkerker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learning Value: Thinking logically and planning ahead are important steps in learning. LOGIC LEVELS challenges children to predict the outcome of a complex sequence of actions. It also encourages quick decision-making. Ages 7-12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
