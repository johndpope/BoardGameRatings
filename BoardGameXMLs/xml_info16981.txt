							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lion and the White Witch</name>
									
			<description>Your goal is to be the first player to reach the Castle at Cair Paravel.  Along the way, you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter the White Witch and her minions of nasty dwarfs.  But you&amp;rsquo;ll be cheered on by the boosts of the friendly beavers, as well as the benevolent presence of the Great Lion, Aslan.  Cooperative play is part of the action because once the White Witch captures a player, the rest must move backwards until someone intercedes with an Aslan card.  The pitfalls are balanced by the shortcuts, but the true of heart will surely lead the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
