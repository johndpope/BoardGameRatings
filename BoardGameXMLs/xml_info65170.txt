			<description>From the cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As parties of adventurers roam the globe in search of treasure, not everything they find will be gold, silver, or precious gems. Sometimes the party will come across more mundane, yet still valuable, commodities that are bought and sold every day and help keep the world economies going. How do you determine what the value of a surrey, or a set of builder's tools should be? If a party should defeat a band of Gnolls and collect a dozen battleaxes, what price will they get when they sell them in the next town?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To answer this question Tangent Games has created Commodity Cards. Commodity Cards are cards that the GM can print out and use to determine the type, quantity, and value for different commodities. Commodity Cards III: Finished Goods - Swords to Plowshares deals with those commodities that have been made into armor, barding, tools, weapons, and transportation. The set contains 280 different cards depicting finished goods from chainmail to short swords and adzes to galleys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, if you do not want to print out a set of Commodity Cards, tables for random generation have been included!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
