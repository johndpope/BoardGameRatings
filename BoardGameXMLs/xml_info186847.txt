							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Good and Plenty Game</name>
									
			<description>Late 1960's game based on the popular candy. Each player begins with 2 Good and Plenty Chips, and spin the spinner to determine order of play. Highest number goes first, lowest number goes last, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play: Spin arrow and move your token the number of spaces indicated on the spinner. If you land on your own color, take one Good and Plenty chip. If you land on a Good and Plenty's Grabber space, give one Good and Plenty chip back. You may go backwards instead of forwards ONLY if doing so will land you on your color so you can get a Good and Plenty chip. First player to reach the Finish space gets 3 Good and Plenty chips, Second player gets two, Third player gets 1. If there is a fourth player, they get none. Winner is the player who has the most Good and Plenty chips once all players reach the Finish space. If the Good and Plenty chips are depleted before all players reach the Finish space, winner is the player with the most Good and Plenty chips at that time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
