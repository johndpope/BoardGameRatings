							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kill Doctor Lucky: Doctor Lucky&#039;s Mansion That Is Haunted</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctor J. Robert Lucky wishes to sell his haunted house to a pair of unsuspecting newlyweds from across town &amp;mdash; but the ghosts of Lucky Mansion have a different plan. They love Doctor Lucky so much, they want him to stay with them forever!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the Doctor Lucky's Mansion That Is Haunted expansion board, the players are ghosts, so they can move through ceilings, walls, and floors! Any two rooms are connected as long as they share an edge, not just a corner. Players can see from their current room into all the connected rooms, but no farther. What's more, the board contains three secret portals that connect two rooms, represented by duplicate objects (the raven, globe, and portrait); you can move through these portals, but you can't see through them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game board can be folded in half to create different play spaces with at most 4-5 players in the game, or the entirety of it can be used for games with up to eight. Whenever the number of players is close to the upper limit of the board, you should probably play with the Cat; if the board seems too roomy, you should add the Dog instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
