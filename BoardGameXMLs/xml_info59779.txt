			<description>Two players are playing a football match. There are four rows of numbers on the board, and each player has number chips. One player starts an attack by secretly choosing two chips which have a result (there are different sets for addition, subtraction etc.) that is on one of the fields in the first row of the board. The opponent does the same. If they reach the same result, the attack is stopped, the other player attacks and both players take back their chips. If not, the attack proceeds to the second row, etc. If the attack isn't stopped by the fourth row, the attacking player can try to flip the ball chip into the defending player's goal, thus scoring a goal. Whoever has scored more goals at the end is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
