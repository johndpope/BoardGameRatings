			<description>Owen's Chase is an asymmetrical 2-player deduction game set in the 19th century Nantucket. Whales are trying to safely travel north to the feeding grounds to feast on rich krill while being pursued by a sharp lookout in the crow's nest of a whaling ship. On each expedition, use your senses to track down a whale in the vast ocean. But be careful of dangerous weather, unexpected repairs, or even a nasty tail fluke that can bring your chase quickly to an end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player plays as the Whale and the other as the Lookout. The Whale player puts the cards face down in a 4 x 4 grid, and the Lookout chooses cards. Based on the card chosen when revealed, various actions occur that can have the Lookout win, the Whale win, or other results. Play continues until the Whale is found or or the Shipyard is found, or until the expedition ends. Cards include the Whale, a tail attack, crow's nest, open ocean, shipyard, and storm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
