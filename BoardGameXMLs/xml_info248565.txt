							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Basketball Duel</name>
									
			<description>Basketball Duel is a fast card game for 1/2/4 players that simulates a basketball game. Players attack and defend in turns and following basketball possession rules. It is an action/reaction game, with bluffing, hand management and luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are divided in two parts, an attack action and a defensive action. The basic layer of the game is using colors, each attack has a color and defensive cards cancel one or more colors. But there is much more to it, you are able to move to different positions, some cards have effects when or when not canceled. Most basketball elements are simulated too: rebounds, fast breaks, interceptions, fouls, bad shots, dunks, blocks...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round feels different with all the possible combinations and players have few important decisions to take in each turn that can change completely the result of each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basketball Duel thread for contest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
