One player rolls his dice and decide wether he can/want to place BALL and GOALKEEPER on the line. The opponent does the same.

Some faces provide support (FAN), some other not (MISSED SHOT) and some may give an extra chance to score (PENALTY)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;during a PENALTY KICK OUT The quickest to roll, obtain the 4 faces PENALTY, assemble them properly, and show them up shouting GooaAAAal! wins.
