							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Second World War at Sea: Alternatives for &#039;&#039;Deutschland&#039;&#039;</name>
									
			<description>Our 24th issue looks at the designs considered by the German Navy for their Deutschland-class armored cruisers, the famous &amp;ldquo;pocket battleships.&amp;rdquo;  You get 20 new Second World War at Sea pieces, with six different versions of the ships plus the original design for the Scharnhorst class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Design studies took two variant paths: an armored coast-defense ship for operations close to its bases, and a long-range commerce raider (the variant eventually chosen).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our Alternatives for &amp;quot;Deutschland&amp;quot; variant gives you all three ships eventually built in all six variations.  Some hewed to the restrictions of the Versailles Treaty; most did not.  The designs range from heavily-armored ships with 15-inch guns to unusual heavy cruisers with 8-inch main batteries.  And of course we have some Plan Z-related scenarios and scenario modifications for their use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
