							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">All Manor of Evil</name>
									
			<description>The manor of HP Lovecraft has attracted some shady characters to its door. These people have come with the intent to steal the valuable relics stored within. But can they do so without driving themselves mad or awakening one of the elder gods?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In All Manor of Evil, 3-5 players compete to steal the most valuable relics from HP Lovecraft's manor. Each player is given a hidden role which will help guide their strategy during the game. Investigators want to &amp;quot;run out the clock&amp;quot; while cultists are trying to awaken one or more gods. As players steal relics, abilities are activated which can add awakening tokens to one of the three gods, give madness tokens to players, and rearrange the relics within the manor. The game ends when one (or more) of the gods is awakened, or the second Clock card has been drawn from the manor deck. When this happens, players reveal their roles and the player with the most total Madness is eliminated (either devoured by the awakened god or driven mad by the relics they have stolen). The remaining player who has stolen the most valuable relics (total Value) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
