			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is something not quite right at your local nursing home.&lt;br/&gt;Your friends, peers, and fellow residents have been going missing recently&amp;mdash;never to be heard from again. However, nobody seems to care enough to do something about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These young folks who visit the home, and the staff who work here, don&amp;rsquo;t have the sense or the wherewithal to figure out what&amp;rsquo;s going on. They don&amp;rsquo;t have the tenacity to see the strangeness of it all. Thankfully, the fire and passion in your heart and bones never truly went away. It&amp;rsquo;s time to do something about this yourselves.&lt;br/&gt;Society may not regard you as its fittest or most capable citizens. But as far as these problems go, you don&amp;rsquo;t need saving. You have your life, limbs, and experience to get to the bottom of the situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this issue you play old folks who care enough to figure out how and why your fellow neighbors have gone missing, and you&amp;rsquo;ll need no help to do it, either. These characters are competent protagonists who just-so-happen to live in a care facility for older people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
