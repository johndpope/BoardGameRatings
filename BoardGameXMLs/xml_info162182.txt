							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Three Kings</name>
									
			<description>Three Kings is a three-player chess puzzle game.  Each player represents an &amp;quot;Alliance&amp;quot; of two of the three colors of chess pieces in the game (red, black and white).  On each player's turn, they may move a piece prior to adding a new piece to the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Three Kings, check and checkmate are not means to an end, as the object of the game is not to render checkmate, but to have the most points.  When a King is put into check or is checkmated, the opposing color(s) involved score points.  Because each player represents two colors of pieces, his or her score is mostly the sum of points scored by those two colors.  However, each player also has a Hidden Agenda which may increase their score, and each player scores points for captures they make throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
