			<description>In the game of &amp;ldquo;Magically Cute Creatures&amp;rdquo;, players will use a set of creature cards to defeat one another in a turn based game. The game play is very similar to &amp;ldquo;Rock, Paper, Scissors&amp;rdquo;, where one type of creature and/or element beats a different creature or element type. In this deck series, however, all cards have BOTH a creature and element attached to them. This means that every card is individually unique, and players can use each card differently depending on the type of game they wish to play. The elements covered in this game are: Fire, Water, and Nature. The creatures introduced in this game are: Dragons, Phoenixes, and Unicorns.&lt;br/&gt;Remember!&lt;br/&gt;Dragons beat Unicorns &amp;ndash; Unicorns beat Phoenixes &amp;ndash; Phoenixes beat Dragons&lt;br/&gt;AND&lt;br/&gt;Fire beats Nature - Nature beats Water - Water beats Fire&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
