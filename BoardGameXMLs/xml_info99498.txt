							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Curse of Blackwood Manor</name>
									
			<description>From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rain lashes the windscreen like a wild insane animal. Why you have to go out at this time of night, you don't know? Your boss rang you twenty minutes ago to take some papers to Blackwood Manor for Mr Smith to sign, so a sale can go through quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You drive through the rusty iron gates and drive up the gravel driveway. A dark foreboding wood closes in on you from both sides until you arrive at the house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blackwood Manor towers over you like a malicious giant creature staring at its prey. You get out of the car, run through the rain and reach the front door stepping in every puddle all the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You knock on the door and wait in the darkness shivering. The door snaps and clicks as locks open to reveal an ancient face. The old man is withered and cracked from years of experience. He is slightly stooped forward and leans on a wooden walking stick. He wears a brown dressing gown and blue slippers. 'Can I help you?' he asks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You tell him who you are and he lets you in. Entering the foyer he leads you to the entrance hall decorated with a black and white chequered floor, red walls and ominous-looking portraits. You turn left into the study. All the other doors are closed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study is dark and lit only by a few candles and a crackling fire in the fireplace. An ornate clock echoes its ticks throughout the room and sits atop the mantel. Red drapes cover the windows and an oriental rug fills most of the floor. An oak desk sits in the far corner and two armchairs face the warmth of the fire where you both sit down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You take out the papers from your briefcase and hand them to the old man. He ignores them and stokes the fire with a nearby poker. 'This night reminds of an age past. A time I can never forget. If I had known what was to befall me that night, then I wouldn't have ventured here.' he says as he stares distantly into the dancing flames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Although the day itself was quite eventful, it started when my car broke down just outside a small village quite near here.' He stares at you and gives you a sickly grin. As you look into his eyes you see something familiar about them. Have you already met? No, you would have remembered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strangely you start to feel drowsy. As he continues his story you start to visualize his very words, when suddenly...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
