			<description>A movie-related game but not Disney this time. This game made use of scenes from the cartoon film by Max Fleischer at Paramount studios. Published anonymously by Pepys because they didn't want to risk losing their good-will with Disney.&lt;br/&gt;44 cards, each with an illustration and a word. Players must add a card to the centre of the table in their turn. Only the word on the card added is important. It must make sense and contribute to a proper sentence. When the 7th or more card is added and a sentence is finished, the player playing the last card to the sentence takes the 'trick'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
