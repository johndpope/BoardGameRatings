			<description>A simply and funny  business game, Urs Hostettler created for the &amp;quot;Migros Genossenschaft Bern&amp;quot;. Migros is the largest supermarket-enterprise in Switzerland. The game was part of the annual business rapport, every member of the cooperative got one. The game was never sold in shops. The rules were written in the business rapport, and there were some funny materials like phone keys or dowels coming with the rapport. The paper of the rapport was perforated, so you could tear the papers and use it for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, every player is owner of a Migros Store and has to buy and sells products. Prices are changing depending on supply and demand. You can also invest in propaganda and good relationships. The players write their offers and prices simultaneous on a secret paper. When players want to buy goods, the one with the highest offer can buy first. If they want to sell, the one is the lowest price sells first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic game mechanism is close to Executive Decision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
