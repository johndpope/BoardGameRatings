							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SOLO: Solo RPG Campaigns for the Cepheus Engine</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SOLO is a solo add-on for Cepheus Engine and the 2D6 SF roleplaying game that it is based on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your players are out of town, or you want to experience your own sci-fi setting &amp;lsquo;from the inside&amp;rsquo;, SOLO is the answer. This isn&amp;rsquo;t the usual collection of random word tables - instead it presents an array of game types and campaign styles that you can play solo, in the company of a complete adventuring party. Exploring new star systems? Chasing pirates in a naval destroyer? Touting for patrons on one frontier world after another? Smuggling? Planning interstellar heists? Operating a free trader on the margins of profit &amp;ndash; and legality?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SOLO allows you to pick up your favourite version of the game to run the kinds of sessions that are normally reserved for a traditional group of table-top players &amp;ndash; led by a referee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SOLO includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Copious examples of play&lt;br/&gt;Guidelines to ease the process of character creation&lt;br/&gt;Rules for inter-character drama&lt;br/&gt;The Plan: A single, universal scene resolution mechanic&lt;br/&gt;Solid advice on tying seemingly random events together&lt;br/&gt;Fast play space combat rules&lt;br/&gt;Checklists to speed play and help understanding&lt;br/&gt;A unique space exploration sub-system&lt;br/&gt;Star system creation rules&lt;br/&gt;Record sheets&lt;br/&gt;You will be surprised, enthralled and captivated by the events unfolding around your player-characters. Can you shepherd them through adversity? Will their past catch up with them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You &amp;ndash; and YOU ALONE &amp;ndash; will decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
