			<description>From the webpage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Potential is a 28mm miniature wargame based in the post-apocalyptic near future of Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build up your chosen faction of miniatures ... and prepare to immerse yourself in a highly tactical skirmish-level wargame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you fight for humanity's survival? Or will you side with the X'Lanthos menace? Or perhaps you don't really care for either, and will fight for the twisted Bioformed or the enigmatic Reclaimers?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you can decide the fate of the earth, and perhaps even humankind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games Indiegogo page related &amp;quot; is Dark Potential?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In short, it is a miniature wargame set in the near post-apocalyptic future of earth, roughly in the 2500s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humanity had managed to spread out to several other colonies in other systems, but then met with a hostile alien race that attempted to drive them back.  This led to a war that annihilated both sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As most of humanity's population was still on Earth, the alien species (called the X'Lanthos) launched a virus meant to destroy all human life.  Unfortunately for them it was only 99.99% effective, and left many survivors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those on earth revert to a basic survival mode, and nature starts reclaiming what was once hers.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is scheduled for release soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
