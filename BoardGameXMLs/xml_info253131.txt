			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, you've agreed to run a game today and you have not had time to even think about an adventure. Don't freak out. We have you covered. This document is all that you need. Run this adventure. It will be over in one session. Then you can get back to your own evil machinations next session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to the capital and optimistic foresight of Moons and Sons Lumber Company, the former ghost town of Mammoth has a new future. They intend to create a logging community on top of the bones of a silver boomtown that went bust. An eccentric artist from back east built a nice house on the outskirts of town. The new foreman would like to take up residence. The problem is that the house is haunted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crews of men have been sent to the house to fix it up and make it liveable for the foreman and his family. All of those crews have quit on the grounds that the place is thoroughly haunted. They claim that even the trees are possessed. What the company needs are a group of experts that can cleanse this house of all of the ghosts and spectres that the lumberjacks believe haunt the place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this adventure is set in the Boot Hell campaign setting, it can easily be used in any sort of Western steampunk or horror roleplaying game. It uses 5th Edition SRD rules as a default.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
