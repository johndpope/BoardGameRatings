							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Throne of Chaos</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Seat of Power&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ancient times, when the gods of chaos were at their height and the greatest civilizations of the mortal realm were yet to arise, these gods arranged a meeting upon the loftiest peak of the Mountains of the Moon. Above the clouds, they gathered to erect a monument to their glory, and to the glory of chaos. Each of the gods who arrived contributed a part of their power, experience, and knowledge, and together they birthed a wondrous and sorcerous chair: the Throne of Chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those who arrived too late to add to this seat of power laid their gifts around and before it. For how could they let just any mere mortal plant themselves upon their monument? They put guards before it, weird passageways that lead to it, and arcane traps to keep intruders from using it. Only those who had been touched by chaos first would have access to the Throne of Chaos, they decreed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But not all of the chaotic gods agreed with this decision. There are some &amp;mdash; perhaps many! &amp;mdash; who want to see the powers of the Throne made manifest upon the Earth. These gods have been known to guide brave adventurers to the Throne before, dispensing their wisdom of its workings, so their wishes might come true.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
