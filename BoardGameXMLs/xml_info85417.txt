							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gun-Fu: Balletic Ballistics</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blam! Blam!! BLAM!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gun-Fu: Balletic Ballistic is a brand-new d20 mini-game that lets players swagger through the hyper-violent, wildly stylized world of Hong Kong-style shoot-em-ups. Trenchcoats swirl and nickel-plated automatics blaze as bad guys die in truckloads. Heroes never run out of bullets (until the final showdown), bad guys get knocked down only to stagger to their feet one more time, and if you do go out, rest assured you&amp;rsquo;ll go out in a blaze of glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first product in EN Publishing's new line of mini-games, Gun-Fu uses the Modern d20 rules as its starting point, but features an entirely new class system, a completely different hit point system and revamped firearms rules to create a distinctive, cinematic style of play that favours wild action over careful maneuvering. Characters have a Panache score that lets them pull off crazy stunts, but when used up leaves them vulnerable to their fatal Flaws. Players take the parts of dedicated police officers, ambitious Triad members or just folks caught up in the violence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
