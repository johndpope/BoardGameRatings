			<description>Dash Through the Dungeon is a fast-paced game of dungeon exploration for 2-6 players ages 6 and up. Each player takes on the role of a brave adventurer, making their way through a series of dark dungeons. Your goal is to find treasure while avoiding creatures and other obstacles, like traps and locked doors. You&amp;rsquo;ll have some help along the way in the form of useful equipment and beneficial encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;60 Dungeon Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;21 Equipment Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set Up:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First step is to separate the Dungeon Cards and Equipment Cards into two decks and give them both a good shuffle. Next take the Dungeon Cards and deal out the first dungeon, laying 20 cards out face down in a 4 x 5 grid. This will be the first dungeon that the players will take turns exploring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next deal out three equipment cards at random to each player. This is your starting equipment. Players are free to look at these cards. You can place them either face up or face down on the table in front of you. Playing with them face down adds a bit of additional suspense to the game since other players won&amp;rsquo;t know if you have the equipment needed to get past a particular encounter until you reveal it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you&amp;rsquo;re ready to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking a Turn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in a series of turns. A player starts their turn with 6 action points or APs. Once its decided who goes first, players one begins their dash through the dungeon. They select and flip over any card on the 5 X 5 dungeon grid, then subtract the AP cost of that card from their remaining APs. In some cases, like flipping over the Pit Trap, the card may tell you that you must &amp;ldquo;lose all remaining AP and end turn&amp;rdquo; which means you&amp;rsquo;re turn is done. Some equipment cards, like the Float-Up Potion, can be used to cancel out these cards. A card that&amp;rsquo;s canceled in this way costs 0 AP. Some equipment cards can also be used to reduce the AP cost of certain cards, like Bandage, or even reduce them to 0, like Freeze Bomb. Your turn ends when your AP reaches 0 or you flip over a Treasure. When your turn ends you take any cards you flipped over, keeping Treasure cards separate from the other dungeon cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then it&amp;rsquo;s the next player&amp;rsquo;s turn to explore. Players continue until all the cards of the first dungeon have been flipped over. When the last card is flipped, the AP of the player who flipped it is reduced to 0 and their turn ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another 4 X 5 grid of Dungeon Cards are then laid out and the next player&amp;rsquo;s turn begins. Play continues in this order until a total of three dungeons have been explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning the Game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all three dungeons have been explored players add up the value of their treasure cards. They then count up all the other Dungeon Cards they&amp;rsquo;ve collected and add the amount to the value of their treasure cards. Whoever has the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
