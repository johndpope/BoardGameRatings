			<description>User Summary: A card game where players try to collect most valuable suggestions to save energy in different categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five categories: K&amp;uuml;hlen (refrigerating), Waschen (washing), Unterhaltung/Information (entertainment/information electronics), Heizen (heating) and Beleuchtung (light). For each category there are six suggestion/hint cards ranging from 3 to 6 points representing saving suggestions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A stack is built from these hint cards and several Kurzschluss (black out / power surge) cards. Players take turns. The active player reveals cards from the stack one by one. At any time he can stop and take the highest valued cards on his hand the rest of the cards is place face up in front of the player and it is the next player's turn. If a Kurzschluss shows up all cards of that turn are lost and placed face down under the stack together with the Kurzschluss. Instead of revealing new cards the active player may exchange a card from his hand with a higher valued cards from the open cards of the same category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round ends when a player collects one hint from each category. If the points add up to 27 and more round ends instantly. All other players lose a live represented by two Stecker (plug) cards.&lt;br/&gt;If score is below 27 the sum is kept secret and all other players get another turn to get more points. Then all players tally their points. The player(s) with the lowest score lose a live.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All cards are shuffled and a new round begins. Game ends when only one player is left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
