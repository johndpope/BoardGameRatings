							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alisia Dragoon</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Alisia must battle her way through 8 levels of platform action in order to destroy the great evil Baldour before he awakens. She can shoot a lightning bolt from her hand that targets enemies close by but use it too much and you wil run out of charge and be defenceless. She is also aided by pet monsters which she can summon. Her companions will circle around her attacking the enemy at will or defending her from harm. The Monsters can be powered up but also be damaged and defeated if they take too many enemy hits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
