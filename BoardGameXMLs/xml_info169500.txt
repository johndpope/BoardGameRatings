							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Aliens: The Xilit</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Close Encounters of the Mythic Kind!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re encountering them on a distant planet in a far-off nebula, or they&amp;rsquo;ve come to you, and are abducting innocent villagers for nefarious purposes, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing quite like a strange, alien race to help breathe some life into your galaxy&amp;mdash;and your game. Some Pathfinder products have even explored the idea of alien life in the past, and it&amp;rsquo;s certainly true that many aberrations could serve as alien creatures in a pinch. But there&amp;rsquo;s one thing that Pathfinder aliens have never been until now, and that is&amp;hellip;mythic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents the Xilits, an industrious race of hyper-evolved insects which roam the galaxy aboard massive artificial planets called hives in an endless search for the resources needed by their queens to continue producing more xilits. Xilits have a highly organized society divided into two distinct classes: the worker and the warrior, which are physically and culturally distinct from one another. Xilits are able to work in perfect harmony due to their hive mind, which for the xilit makes meaningful contact with other races an unpleasant chore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
