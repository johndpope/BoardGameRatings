							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lost Pyramid of the Desert King</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nomadic tribes that inhabit the Aneir desert are fiercely independent, and only once in their known history have they ever been united.  It happened many generations ago, and was brought about by one man, Ansar the self-proclaimed King of the Desert.  Stories of Ansar are popular among the nomads, and many of the tales have traveled well beyond the confines of their desert homeland.  While there is great variety in the stories, they all agree that Ansar was a powerful and ruthless leader.  At the height of his reign, he had united over 30 tribes into one great nation, which given the independent nature of the nomads was an incredible feat.  His charisma is legendary; some stories claim that simply to hear him speak was enough to cause many of the tribal leaders to swear him fealty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 7th - 9th level characters.  Typically distributed as an RTF scenario file with two GIF files (maps).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
