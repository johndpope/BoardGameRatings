			<description>B&amp;eacute;b&amp;eacute;'s Kids is an action-oriented Super NES video game that is loosely based on the movie of the same name. The video game enjoyed a North America-exclusive release. Nintendo Power gave this game a 2.475 out of 5 rating (49.5%) in its January 1994 issue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the style of a Streets of Rage/Golden Axe style of beat 'em up, the player must control either LaShawn (the female protagonist) or Kahlil (the male protagonist) as they devastate a Disneylandesque theme park being the troublemakers they are. Players must watch out for security guards, disgruntled mascots, and pirates (that are employees of the theme park). Other stages include a haunted house,[8] a pirate ship, and the pits. Both characters have their own special attacks. Enemies take an excessively long time to eliminate; thus dragging the difficulty level beyond that of the film's target audience. An oppressive time limit make sure that only professional gamers have a fair chance of completing each level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coke cans look like items that can be picked up. In reality, there are a part of the background even though they appear on the same sprite layer as the main character and the enemies.[5] There are three sprite layers in the game: the background, the foreground, and the main action layer. The game was rushed for release in order to complement the VHS release of the movie that it was named after. While a MIDI version of a hip hop tune is good for the first fifteen seconds of the game, the soundtrack eventually becomes repetitive and boring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bébé's Kids&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
