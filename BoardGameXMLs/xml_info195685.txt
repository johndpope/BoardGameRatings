			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bad Campaign is the presidential party game. You are a candidate running a half-baked campaign for the Presidency against your friends.  Players take turns reading question cards containing campaign slogans, political promises, and awkward statements.  The candidates submit one of the hundreds of crazy answer cards to fill in the blank. The combinations are read out loud and the reader votes for their favorite. The candidate that gains the most votes by the end of the game wins and is moving into a plush crib on Pennsylvania Avenue. Just like in real presidential campaigns you will make plenty of horrible promises and terrible statements, but in Bad Campaign the more ridiculous you are, the better your chances for getting elected.  The game pulls content from real quotes and situations.  Combined with our offbeat answer cards you will be laughing with your friends at the fat cats in Washington in no time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     90 Fill-in-the-blank Question Cards- Containing Real Quotes, Awkward Statements, and Questionable Campaign Promises&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     450 Crazy Answer Cards- Creating Millions of Ridiculous Combinations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Bi-partisan fun. No political knowledge necessary or needed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Fancy Gray Box Perfect for Holding Your New Favorite Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Sense of Satisfaction You Will Derive By Participating in Our Country's Great Electoral Process OR Your Opportunity To Make Fun Of It&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
