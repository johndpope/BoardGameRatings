			<description>A cycle racing game inspired by the Tour de France. Each player runs a team of 4, 5 or 6 racers, teamwork between the racers helps to improve the position of the team's racers through slip-streaming. &lt;br/&gt;There are four short stages and 2 long (mountain) stages to the full race, but a lesser number could be raced over. There are 34 (green) random movement (&amp;amp; event) cards: nine '1's, 13 '2's , nine '3's and one '4', a hunger/fall card and a weakness/blackout card. Each player also holds a pack of 9 yellow cards. one '+5', one '+3' one '+2' three '+1's, a spare wheel, a food musette (musette = In cycling, a bag containing food handed out in a feed zone of a multi-stage race such as the Tour de France) , and a 'Baraka'. (which means good luck in French slang.) On their turn the active player draws a random card for each of their racers, and if desired adds one of their yellow cards. Yellow cards are discarded for the stage after play. &lt;br/&gt;If a racer ends his move with one space between him and the player of his team ahead of him, then he can slip-stream into the space provided it is not filled by racers of other teams. A racer can also slipstream another team's racer if there is a completely empty road space between them. Roads are 4, 3 or two riders wide, depending upon the terrain.&lt;br/&gt;The winner can be decided by shortest number of turns taken to complete the course, or by placing in the finishing order of each stage - (better to agree this in advance). The short stages can take between 30 and 60 minutes, and the long stages 60 to 90. A lot depends upon the number of players, and of racers per team. If the whole race is to be run is would be best to spell it over a weekend with some other games filling between stages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
