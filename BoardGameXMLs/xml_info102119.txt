			<description>This is Game #25 in the Games on Half a Checkerboard Series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a fusion of Lines of Action, Focus and Extinction Chess.  In it, in order to keep pieces moving, a player must control at least one stack each containing 1 piece, 2 pieces, and 3 pieces.  In order to move a stack on top of another stack, a player must have all their pieces on the board.  If a player is unable to perform a legal move at the start of their turn, that player loses the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paul Beykirch also was part of the design process and is listed as a co-designer of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
