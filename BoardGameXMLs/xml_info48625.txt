							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Screwball</name>
									
			<description>Catch it - Add a screw - Throw it - Careful now - Don't touch a screw - YOU COULD BLOW IT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A balloon bustin' game for 2 or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First place a balloon inside the Screwball and inflate the balloon.  The first player inserts a screw and tosses the Screwball to any opponent who catches it while trying to avoid the balloon bustin' screw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second player puts another screw into the Screwball, just far enough to stay so it won't burst the balloon unless hit.  He then tosses the Screwball to the next player.  As play continues, catching the Screwball is more and more difficult as with each toss one more screw is added.  The unlucky player who hits the screw on the head and breaks the balloon loses the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
