							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Arcane Smith</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the folklore of many of the world&amp;rsquo;s cultures, smiths are ascribed certain supernatural powers, ranging from incredible luck to the ability to cast curses upon their foes, and of course their mastery of fire and steel. As such, they were viewed suspiciously (if not reviled outwardly), despite their clear importance in society as the workers of iron and steel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arcane Smith presents a 20-level base class that builds upon this folklore and integrates into the d20 System. The arcane smith is a unique spellcaster who specializes in the creation (and sometimes the destruction) of certain types of magical items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new revised edition contains several new spells for arcane smiths as well as the Scion of Hephaestus, a prestige class for arcane smiths who truly desire to become one with their element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
