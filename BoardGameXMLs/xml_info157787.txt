			<description>from The Game:&lt;br/&gt;This is an introductory adventure with some characters, a little background, and enough of the rules to get you through the session. It's a d20-based system, so you'll need the usual variety of polyhedral dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from What's in the Book:&lt;br/&gt;There are six characters, one for each class, included, along with full descriptions of their special abilities. We've chosen knacks for them to help you get started quickly, but feel free to let the players come up with different ones if they want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A short Equipment section describes the stuff the player characters are carrying, along with a few other common items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Action chapter describes the core mechanic and other essential game system information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is called &amp;quot;The Cave of Crystal Souls&amp;quot; and is designed for the included (third level) characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, there's a separate file called &amp;quot;QalidarQuick_PlayersPack.pdf.&amp;quot; This reproduces most of the material in the Characters, Equipment, and Action sections in a small file. You can email this to your players before the game to help them prepare without giving away any secrets about the scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
