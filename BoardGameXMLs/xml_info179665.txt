			<description>Founder is a table-top strategy board game that revolves around entrepreneurship. Talent management is key here. Players must decide how many and what kind of employees they need to make their business successful. Furthermore, knowing when to promote them and how to keep a balanced work force play important roles in determining the company's success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Founder is played across 5 turns, and each turn consists of a number of phases. First, players Invest (recruit, run payroll, advertise, build factories). Second, they Produce (design products, buy resources, trade resources, manufacture). Then, they Sell (generate and fulfill demand), before Managing Talent (promote, compensate, defect). In the final turn, players Resolve (replenish resources, calculate market cap, move time marker).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end, the player who achieved the highest market cap will emerge victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game box will include numerous cards, a marker, pawns, cubes, paper bills and a main game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
