			<description>The Twinkles Game: His Trip To The Star Factory. Based on the General Mills Twinkles The Star Shaped Cereal with the Twinkles the Elephant mascot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players choose to be one of four characters: Fulton the Camel, Wilbur the Monkey, Leopold the Lion or Sanford the Parrot. The players begin on the Start square, and the Twinkles playing piece starts several squares ahead. Players draw cards that have colors on them and move to the next square with that color on the board. Players must draw a card for Twinkles and move him on his turn, as well. Players cannot pass Twinkles, even if that means they cannot move. Certain squares award the players stars, and others take stars away (if they have any). When Twinkles finally makes it to the Star Factory, the game is over. The player who has the most stars, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
