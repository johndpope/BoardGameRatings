							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Four Seasons Chess</name>
									
			<description>An interesting four-player version of chess from medieval Spain.  Each player represents one of the seasons, and starts the game with a king, a rook, a knight, a bishop and four pawns in one corner of the board.  The pawns are split, and move away from the corner in one of two directions.  Each player is supposed to attack the player to his right, and on checkmating his opponent takes over the use of his pieces.  From Alfonso X's Book of Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
