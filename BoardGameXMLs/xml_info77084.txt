							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Myth II: Soulblighter</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;Myth II: Soulblighter is a unit-level RTS game that takes place in a fantasy medieval setting.  It continues the storyline begun in its predecessor, Myth: TFL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control soldiers, archers, molotov-throwing dwarves, and other fighters to defeat the undead armies of Soulblighter.  There are several types of friendly and enemy units, each with its own abilities, and the mission objectives vary from defending an area, to reaching a location on the map, to assassinating a key enemy figure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Myth II has no base construction or unit production elements.  Save scripted reinforcements, the forces you start with at the beginning of a level will have to last you to the end.  Additionally, the game was an early example of a fully 3-D environment, and terrain and weather effects play a key role in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to a well-written single-player campaign, Myth II featured multiplayer battles using Bungie's Bungie.net hosting service at no extra charge.  Also included was a set of model and terrain creation tools for making custom levels, which led to many user-created works.  These fan-made levels used the engine to showcase battles in a science fiction universe, real-world historical scenarios, and even a plastic world of LEGO bricks.  This variety of content and a strong online community has given Myth II considerable longevity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
