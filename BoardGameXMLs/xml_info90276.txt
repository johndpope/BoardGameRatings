			<description>Star Trek: Borg is an interactive movie/computer game and audiobook set in the Star Trek universe. It was written by Hilary Bader, directed by James L. Conway, and featured an original score by Dennis McCarthy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the midst of a new Borg incursion ten years after the Battle of Wolf 359, Starfleet Cadet Qaylan Furlong is given an opportunity by Q (John de Lancie) to go back in time and prevent his father's death in the historic battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q sends Qaylan to the USS Righteous, his father's Excelsior class starship, just before the Battle of Wolf 359. Originally, the ship's security officer Coris Sprint was killed by a Borg intruder over four hours before the battle. Q gives Qaylan control of Sprint's body at this point, allowing him to change history. Since Sprint is Bijani (a heretofore unseen alien race) he has the ability to go into a &amp;quot;Bijani Pain Trance&amp;quot; which allows him to complete jobs even when feeling immense pain. This later becomes an important plot point in allowing the character to complete the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, Q takes over the role of Dr. Thaddeus Quint, whose personality is similar to Q's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At several points throughout the game, the player (Qaylan) is given multiple choices about what actions should be taken in various situations. The results vary based on whatever actions are chosen. If the player chooses poorly, Q will reset time and allow him to try again. If the player makes too many mistakes, however, Q becomes bored and the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Star Trek: Borg&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
