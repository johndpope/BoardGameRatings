			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collectible card game played as a duel against another player. You construct your deck of 12 cards and have access to all 12 from the beginning. It takes resources to play a card (there are five different ones and decks can only be constructed from a maximum of three different types). Cards exist either in your hand, on the battlefield or in your graveyard. Cards in your graveyard can be recalled to your hand for a price of health depending on how many are in the graveyard. Through the duel you get as many actions as your level. You gain experience through various means and can advance a level for one action. The object of the duel is to reduce your opponent's health to zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
