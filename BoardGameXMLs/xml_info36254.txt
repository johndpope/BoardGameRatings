			<description>&amp;quot;Board &amp;amp; card game for 2 players. Battle between Zentradi and the Robotech Defense Force. Takes place in the Robotech Universe. Each figure represents a single Battle Pod, Armor Suit, Veritech Fighter or Destroid. Victory: Destroy 10+ of the Hits of the opposing side or the opposing Commander.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chessboard or any other 8x8 grid. Miniatures or counters are used to represent the units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game presents statistics for seven Robotech units and five Zentradi units. Each is rated for movement, hits, and up to ten special abilities (related to weaponry, defenses, or movement.) Each player purchases sixteen hits worth of units to start the game. One unit is designated the Commander.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A custom deck of cards is central to the play of the game. The players draw hands of cards from the shared deck. Card play determines when units may move, attack, and defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
