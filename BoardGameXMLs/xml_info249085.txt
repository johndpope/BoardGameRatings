			<description>Each player has to get his six pawns from his starting positions to the starting positions of his opposite player. The first to do so wins the Game. Movement is determined by a standard die (1-6) and a directional die. The possible directions are straight ahead (G), diagonally left ahead (SL) and diagonally right ahead (SR). If a pawn reaches the border of the game board and has spaces left to move, it is deflected in the direction it came from an has to count the remaining spaces backwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
