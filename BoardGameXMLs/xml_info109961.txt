			<description>Card game that owes a debt to Rummy as a similar game mechanic but with a lot of extra options.&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to use all the cards in your hand first, by laying down cards that represent a journey. A journey may include such cards as destinations, Visas, passports and currencies.&lt;br/&gt;When a player 'goes out', all the cards played by him onto a single journey or multiple journeys, will score him points. The black number on each card represents the card's value. Cards also have a red number, and that is the penalty value of cards not yet used by the opponents.&lt;br/&gt;Six deals equals a game. The player with the most points after those six deals, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
