			<description>The game combines elements of games such as Lemmings and The Incredible Machine, and adds a quirky art style and a surreal sense of humor. In Eets the player must navigate the titular character through a series of platforms to collect puzzle pieces. In order to do so the player must place a variety of items in Eets' path to help him to his destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the characters mood he reacts differently to stimuli. If Eets is angry he can jump across larger chasms, while a scared Eets will not jump at all. His mood can be changed in several ways&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Eets&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An enhanced edition of the game was later released as Eets: Chowdown on the Xbox Live Arcade,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
