			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town of Cayhill needs your help... They've been living their lives blindfolded...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basilisk! is an adventure compatible with Folklore: A Rules-Light Roleplaying Game, but can be used in any game that you prefer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the same way that Folklore is a rules-light game, Basilisk! is a light adventure. What that means is that instead of finding intricate point by point plot details, you will find that Basilisk! has no more than what you need to prepare you for a game session. It will be up to you, however, to add your own narrative to the adventure and figure out how the players fit in. More than anything, make sure that they have fun along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
