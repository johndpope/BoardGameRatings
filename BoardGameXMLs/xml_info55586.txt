			<description>From the back cover (translated from Dutch):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dor is a world inhabited by strange races. Elves walk silently through the forests, dwarves delve for ore, giants live in the mountains and the seas are populated by scalings. Above all this lies the shadow of Rothin. It is quite an adventure to stay alive in this world. The heroes try to  serve the powers of Good and foil Rothin in his attempts to control Dor. But his power is rising, and Dor needs heroes to stop him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Schimmen en Schaduwen' is an open game that can be played without a gameboard. Everything is driven by the imagination of the players and the gamesmaster. The possibilities are huge and are only limited by the imagination of the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Schimmen en Schaduwen' is the roleplaying game of The Wise Tree and is not a translation from an English game, but an original game developed in Flanders. We hope to make Belgium and the Netherlands more independent w.r.t. roleplaying products. The Wise Tree will publish much more material in the near future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Schimmen en Schaduwen' contains a full guide to Dor, over 80 careers and professions, more than 90 skills, 40 monsters, 9 different magic classes and forms the basis of a lot of fun gaming!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
