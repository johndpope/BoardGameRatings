			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a full-color, 48 inch by 20 inch, floor plan of a Dragon Ship, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;There are tales of wondrous treasure to be had on the island but the rumors say that it is guarded by an emerald dragon.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Pirate Captain Wilbeck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon Ship is a single level map of the upper deck of a ship with a dragon or leviathan motif.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon Ship is intended for use in fantasy settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure idea for this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dragon Hoard:  Pirate Captain Wilbeck seeks adventurers to help him slay a dragon and collect its hoard. For a nominal transportation fee of two shares of the treasure, he will transport them to Dragon Isle and help them transport the treasure back to civilization. Whether or not he keeps his word about this deal is up to the Game Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The truth about Dragon Isle is that there is no dragon. The &amp;ldquo;dragon&amp;rdquo; is actually a pirate ship in the guise of a dragon designed to keep visitors away from Dragon Isle. Dragon Isle does not have a hoard but it does have treasure that the Pirate Captain of the Dragon Ship has buried on the island. The Dragon Isle might also have a small village that was built to support the Dragon Ship such as the one presented in our Skull Cove module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the group can defeat the Dragon Ship and any settlers on Dragon Isle, they can search the island for buried treasure, but can they trust Wilbeck to help them get the treasure off the island?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
