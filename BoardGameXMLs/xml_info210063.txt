			<description>Assassins is a simple game full of chaos and trickery. It can be played with a little as 5 people, and as many as 52.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in the restless Kingdom of Ridian, the Assassins find themselves pitted against the rest of the King's court. Their goal? Kill everyone and get to the King! The kingdom is in dire need of a new leader, or so say the Assassins. The loyal subjects have banded together upon hearing rumors of an uprising. Their goal is to find and stop the Assassins before they can carry out their terrible purpose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You need a Narrator&lt;br/&gt;Pass out cards to the other players&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 1 card&lt;br/&gt;Keep your role secret!&lt;br/&gt;Make sure you have at least 1 Oracle, 1 Physician, and 1 Knight.&lt;br/&gt;At Night&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts out at night. The Narrator starts out by telling everyone to close their eyes (they are &amp;quot;asleep&amp;quot;). Then all the Assassins open their eyes and find each other. The narrator then goes one by one having each role open their eyes while everyone else keeps their eyes closed. Once the narrator knows who everyone is the game begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Assassins choose a player to try and kill each night. They open their eyes and while and silently point to one player. They must all agree on the same player. Once the Assassins pick, they close their eyes and then its the Oracles turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Oracle then gets a chance to look at any players card while everyone sleeps. Then the Physician has a chance to choose whether to use a potion to save or kill someone. Then the Wizard has a chance to redirect an attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the night each player with an ability will have a chance to choose to use their skill or not. By using it you can directly effect the outcome of the game, but by waiting to use it, you may find a better time to use it, or just cause more confusion and mislead people. Information is your ally in this game so you want to reveal as little about yourself as possible, while learning as much as you can about everyone else!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Day&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When everyone is done using (or not), their ability, everyone wakes up and the round resolves during daytime. The Narrator weaves a story about what happened during the night, and explains which people were saved, and which died.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you die, you reveal your card to the rest of the group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kingdom goes a bit crazy at this point! They know there are Assassins among them, but they don't know who they are. So, like any rational mob, they want to hang someone! With clues that were gathered during the night, people can now accuse others of being the Assassin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When more than one person nominates the same player, they are qualified for being hanged. The player with the most nominations is hanged that day. If there is a tie, the two players have offer a defense and another vote is taken to determine who will survive to play another round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If no one is nominated twice, then no one is hung that round, and the game continues to the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night once more&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game cycles through day and night, and players have a chance to use their powers to uncover the true identities of the Assassins! Each round gets more and more intense as the Assassins close in!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Assassins win if they can kill everyone else. The Court wins when the defeat all the Assassins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep your secrets close, and your wits about you! And have a blast playing Assassins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
