			<description>The storyteller has 30 seconds in which to tell a &amp;quot;shaggy dog story&amp;quot; including three key words listed on a card taken at the start of that player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trick is that the storyteller is trying to conceal which three words of the story are on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the story has been told, the other players may confer and jointly have three guesses as to which words were on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
