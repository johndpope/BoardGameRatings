			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is designed to set players and characters several challenges beyond mere combat. All of its protagonists are human, with not a chaos cultist amongst them, so it provides some interesting moral dilemmas. You will also find no details of stats for any of the protagonists herein. This should provide flexibility when balancing the encounter to the ability level of your adventuring party, as well as hopefully encouraging more diplomacy as opposed to conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its setting is the Forest of Ch&amp;acirc;lons, within the Dukedom of Bordeleux, in the Kingdom of Bretonnia. Little work is required to set it elsewhere in that land, and it caters for a party of any experience level. It can be completed in an evening, though options have been provided to extend the encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
