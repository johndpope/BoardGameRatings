			<description>Koins is a simple and engaging game for three players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players all start out with a handful of coins. Each turn, the players bet one or more of their coins, the bets are called &amp;quot;hands&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;If all hands are different, the middle hand is the winner (ex. 5 out of 2, 5, 7).&lt;br/&gt;If two hands are the same, the third hand is the winner (ex. 2 out of 5, 5, 2).&lt;br/&gt;If all hands are the same, there is no winner and the coins are put into the pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the winning hand takes all the coins that were bet that turn, as well as the pool if there is any, and a new round is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
