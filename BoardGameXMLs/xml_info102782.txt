			<description>Copied from the official webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clash of Empires is the new tabletop wargaming rules from Great Escape Games.  Clash of Empires  is a full colour, hardcover book  Here are some key features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We mainly play with 28mm figures but the rules are adaptable to 15mm and 20mm armies as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a typical sized game of Clash of Empires, number of models will vary by army &amp;ndash; our own Carthaginian army has 155 men and our Early Imperial Romans 125 men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be plenty of dice to roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The turn sequence is: Orders Phase, Movement Phase, Shooting Phase, Hand-to-hand Phase and Combat Outcomes Phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SOLDIERS OF ANTIQUITY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Troops&amp;rsquo; profiles are:                                                                                                                Movement Rate; Shoot; Attacks; Hand-to-Hand; Defence; Kill; Hits; Discipline; MoralE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Troop morale is vital but troop discipline is a separate characteristic and can be just as important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units have profiles to determine how good they are but may also have Unit Special Rules such as Cantabrian Circle (Skythians), Expert Swordsmen (e.g. Legionaries) and Shieldwall (e.g. Saxon infantry) to name a few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different weapons are well represented according to their historical uses - the pilum is used as a thrown weapon before combat disrupting the enemy formation, and the pike enables more attacks but suffers if the unit is pushed back in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARMY LISTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Army lists are very expansive and you choose your unit size by individual models within set minimums and maximums (e.g. a Roman auxiliary infantry unit has 10-30 models in it).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units within the army list are 'flavoured' for that period so that a Roman Legionary is different to a Viking Hirdman, rather than both being superior Heavy Infantry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generals and other characters command, they are not super killing machines. This can be a good excuse to do diorama bases for your leaders if you are so inclined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clash of Empires even has a use for those casualty figures you never painted!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE RULEBOOK&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the rulebook will be lists for the Early Imperial Romans and its enemies in the west &amp;ndash; Ancient Germans, Ancient British, Caledonians and Dacians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first army list book will cover Early Achaemenid Persia to the death of Alexander.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many army lists will be free to download from the web. They will be official but will be living lists reviewed by us and the wargaming community.  Some of these will go to print but many will stay on the website as free downloads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook also contains rules for four different scenarios including elements such as terrain placement, terrain types, army initiative and flanking manoeuvres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
