							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fifty Shades of Fey</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party is hired to rescue a banker&amp;rsquo;s kidnapped son who the parents believe was taken for ransom. The young man (of sixteen) was set to take over the family business in the next year and the banker is willing to pay handsomely for Teddy&amp;rsquo;s safe return. The adventurers travel to the High Forest and encounter a variety of fey creatures before arriving at a secret mansion deep within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mansion belongs to Myra, a beautiful nymph. It seems Teddy wasn&amp;rsquo;t kidnapped at all, he followed his heart and ran off to be with Myra in her amazing mansion of love. Of course not everything is exactly as it seems. The party finds themselves trapped in the mansion and only quick-thinking and bravery will see them escape the taboo depravity of her pleasure dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 4-5 hour adventure that is designed to be completed in one session.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;This is a fun adventure to run between campaigns or around Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day. This adventure can be quite adult themed depending on how you wish to present it to your group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
