							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hänsel und Gretel: Ein Märchenspiel</name>
									
			<description>(translated: Hansel and Gretel - A Fairy Tale Game)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Probably from the 1950s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple roll and move course with events from the Grimm fairy tale. The board has die-cut holes in it instead of spaces, it stays in place of the box.&lt;br/&gt;On the box's edge is a short wooden lever which can be used as a stand to keep the board at a slight angle. The playing pieces are colored pottery balls which are moved from hole to hole - some holes are larger than the balls - should a die roll or an event (explained in the box's lid) bring your piece to such a hole, your ball falls through, rolls to a chute on the lower end of the board and you will have to start again. The mechanism is similar to Cat &amp; Mice or Holes &amp; Traps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
