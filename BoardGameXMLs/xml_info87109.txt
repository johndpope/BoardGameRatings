			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night is falling, you're tired, it's raining and you're eager to get home soon so you go a little too fast on the highway. A deafening sound, a bone-crushing shock, the smell of burning rubber and you wake up in a damp cavern. You're in Hell, and Satan offers you a deal: if you can bring him a suitable gift, He'll let you live and your soul will be returned to your body. If you fail, you'll have all Eternity to think about speed limits and safety belts...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orph&amp;eacute;e is a graphical text adventure game. It uses a text parser for player input and a vector graphics. It's a classic adventure-game, with inventory-based puzzles and a lot of ways to &amp;quot;die&amp;quot;: thirst is a common way to die (Hell is supposed to be a hot place after all) and the player must be careful to always have drinking water handy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features an important number of locations, a lot of characters (some of them can accompany the player) and digitized voice samples used to give the player vital clues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
