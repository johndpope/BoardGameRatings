							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dawning of the Jet Age</name>
									
			<description>One of the great &amp;ldquo;what ifs&amp;rdquo; of the Second World War involves Germany surviving long enough to field a large force of operational jets. By the end of the war the Me-262 and Me-163 had been operational for awhile and there were many others either in the experimental stage or on the design board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jet bombers escorted by jet fighters were certainly not out of the question if the war had gone late into 1945 or early 1946.&lt;br/&gt;But the Allies weren&amp;rsquo;t exactly unprepared either. Several of their jet designs were approaching the operational stage and could have&lt;br/&gt;set the scene for some fascinating jet battles over Germany.&lt;br/&gt;P-80s escorting B- 29s that are intercepted by a variety of German jets is just one of the many scenarios that these rules will allow&lt;br/&gt;you to simulate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dawning of the Jet Age allows gamers to recreate these hypothetical battles as Allied jets try to counter the German jet fighters already in operation. Like many other games in this series,&lt;br/&gt;these rules are designed for a fun and fast game as the basic rules are only a few pages. Gamers should be able to grasp the concepts&lt;br/&gt;and be flying in no time at all and the system can also work for large, multiplayer games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feel free to add additional rules, jets, or other WW2 prop driven aircraft to your scenarios. The rules are flexible enough that a little more complexity can be added without loss of playability or more time needed to finish a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dawning of the Jet Age is designed for 1/600th or 1/300th miniatures, although 1/144th can be used by doubling all measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
