							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Geshtei Castle</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geshtei Castle, the capital of Gerium Province and a stronghold of the Gerium Legion, sits on the Thard River along the western border of the Thardic Republic. Although considered something of a backwater, the town is notable for its strategic position and rich agricultural lands. A feud brewing between the magistrate and marshal threatens the settlement's peace and prosperity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Geshtei Castle article describes the settlement's history, government, religion, economics, and military forces. Details are given for some of the local craftsmen and other locations in the settlement. Includes a full description and color floor plans for the keep, along with color GM and player maps of the settlement. Also included is a 2-page expanded description of Geshtei's busy milling operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
