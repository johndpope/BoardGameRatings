			<description>From the frontispiece and back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Contained in this grimoire of ancient knowledge are quests that will lead those who dare to crumbling temples, labyrinthine tombs, sand-swept pyramids and vast mountain halls. Here are demons and gremlins, ghosts and traitors, the ways and means to reach fabled cities and mayhap escape with your life. Also etched within are words of warning and counsel for those who would follow the demonic arts; tales of how to summon and banish infernals and setting a good price for one&amp;rsquo;s soul in a bargain with a lord of the Abyss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In From The Cold is a collection of classic articles from the golden age of RPGs, when Dragon Warriors creator Dave Morris was the foremost writer for White Dwarf magazine &amp;mdash; so prolific that he used pseudonyms to disguise the sheer volume of his output. This book collects the very best of his articles and adventures from the 1980s, fully revised and expanded to fit the rules and world of Dragon Warriors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In From the Cold features two major articles and six complete adventures for Dragon Warriors player-characters of all levels, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Dealing with Demons: Demonologists as a playable profession, with complete rules for summoning and binding the inhabitants of the abyss, new spells and rituals, a chapter of new minor demons and rules on using the game's existing demon races, plus full descriptions of the powerful and terrifying Demon Princes.&lt;br/&gt;     The Unquiet Grave: rules and instructions for giving undead and ghosts the properly chilling effects on PCs that they deserve.&lt;br/&gt;     A Box of Old Bones, a fan-favourite scenario, set in Osterlin Abbey where the bones of Saint Giles are attracting unwelcome attention;&lt;br/&gt;     The Lone and Level Sands, wherein an ancient tomb long buried in the desert proves to have some unexpected contents;&lt;br/&gt;     The Serpent&amp;rsquo;s Venom, in which a chance remark gives the party an opportunity to beat a band of rivals to a treasure, if they move fast;&lt;br/&gt;     A Ballad of Times Past, an adventure from the history of the Lands of Legend, when magic worked strangely and required powerful patrons;&lt;br/&gt;     Temple of the Lost God, an excursion deep into the Mungodan jungle to search a cursed ancient temple for a frankly bizarre prize;&lt;br/&gt;     and the classic Key of Tirandor, an epic quest for a forgotten city, a world of dreams and the ultimate power within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An essential collection, In From the Cold has something to offer every Dragon Warriors player and GM. The book also features great new art from Jon Hodgson, Steve Dismukes, Gordon Napier and Scott Neil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
