			<description>Greetings, fellow stranger!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember those times when someone around you was saying something like &amp;quot;I need to harvest these crops...&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;We need to kill these 65,340,285 boars...&amp;quot;? Well, forget it! You are the god here and those things are not worth your divine attention! Leave all the dirty work to your pawn and enjoy the only thing that matters in any game - fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Godville is a massively-multiplayer zero-player game (ZPG). The gist of the Godville is a parody on everything from &amp;quot;typical&amp;quot; MMO games with their tedious level ups, to internet memes and ordinary day to day things appealing to a wide audience. We aren't the first who tried to make this, but we are constantly working on making the game better and we believe that with your help we can take this idea even further.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is available on the iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch, Android devices, and web via Facebook Connect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
