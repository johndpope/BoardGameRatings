			<description>In Grossburgers, you are a line cook in a 1950's hamburger joint.  Your job is to serve as many burgers as you can, no matter how gross the ingredients.  In fact, depending on the customer, the grosser the better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grossburgers is a real time dice rolling game about building and selling burgers.  Players, at the same time, roll their dice trying to get sets of icons to do different actions in the game.  When one player has an action that requires them to ring the bell, everyone must pause play and let them perform their action.  Then that player rings the bell and everyone can start &lt;br/&gt;rolling their dice and performing actions again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will fulfill customer orders with ingredients ranging from classic to grossout!  Ingredients on burgers are worth points at the end of the game but watch out for grossouts because they will cause you to score negative points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grossburgers is a fast and frenzied game of burger building madness!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
