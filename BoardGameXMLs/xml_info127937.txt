							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">National Trust Golf</name>
									
			<description>Not confirmed on the box, but this must have been a promotional game for the National Trust, maybe to sell in their souvenir shops exclusively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a simplicated table golf game, with marbles acting as golf balls and a cheap plastic golf hole, a flag (to add realism perhaps!) and a club for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set the hole somewhere on the table and whack a marble with your club. The fewest shots taken, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think you will need a spirit-level because slightly sloping tables and marbles don't go together very well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is housed in a plastic pouch rather than a box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
