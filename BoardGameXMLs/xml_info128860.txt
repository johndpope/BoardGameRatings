			<description>Welcome to the world of Diggin Deep: World&amp;rsquo;s Game, brought to you by Diggin Deep Sports.  With this game, you should be able to re-create a match of soccer complete with all the decisions that the coach would make.  You decide who to dress and who to scratch.  You decide who to start and who to save as a substitute.  You name the starting keeper.  There are also plenty of &amp;lsquo;in game&amp;rsquo; decisions to make.  Do I take a shot from the scoring zone, or try to penetrate for a better scoring chance.  If the game is tied late in the second half, do I play conservative, or do I play aggressive and go for the win?  My star midfielder just collapsed due to heat exhaustion.  How do I replace his offense?  How do I replace his defense?  Once you have a solid understanding of the cards, charts, and gameplay, you should be able to play a full regulation match in about thirty minutes.&lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;The game is played using three ten sided dice and player cards that represent their abilities on the pitch.  Some players can actually 'dig deep' in certain game situations to tilt the scales in their favor.  It's all here as you attempt to bring glory to your squad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
