							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mickey Mouse Rickety Bridge Game</name>
									
			<description>Walt Disney board game dominated by a central three-dimensional die-cut bridge with four movable pylons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must transport two monkeys of their color to the finishing area on the other side of the river, so three separate journeys must be made as the monkeys cannot be carried together.  Players may elect to take the long, safer route around the edge of the board or they may take the shorter route &amp;amp; attempt to cross the bridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is directed by a spinner, which has 5 divisions (1-4 movement &amp;amp; a broken plank).  If the plank is spun, one of the pylons supporting the bridge is removed.  Pieces that fall into the river from removal of pylons are placed on a special log square on the longer outer path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get both of their monkeys to the finishing area is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
