							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crabs Adjust Humidity: Blank Deck</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because you think you're so funny. 56 blank cards with the Crabs Adjust Humidity logo. Includes: 38 blank white cards and 18 blank black cards. Like the regular volumes of Crabs Adjust Humidity, these are professionally printed on linen-finish, casino-quality cards. No actual humor is supplied with these cards, they are blank cards only. Because you'll be adding these to an existing deck, no box is included: the deck of cards is individually wrapped in cellophane. The cellophane is NOT edible. Discard it after you remove your cards. Or, just throw it on the floor like an animal. See if we care, we're not your mother.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
