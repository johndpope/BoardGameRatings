			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;By Order of Pella Ardinay, Lady of the Light...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So begins each of the documents called Queenswraths, proclamations calling all knights of honor to do battle with the forces of corruption and darkness on behalf of the Speaker of the People of Aysle. Only the most evil and powerful enemies of the magical realm find their names on these decrees. Do you have what it takes to undergo a quest for the Lady of the Light?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the realm of Aysle, from the shores of England to the fjords of Scandinavia, the servants of darkness continue their war of conquest and corruption. Lady Pella Ardinay stands as a bright light within the gathering darkness, calling the servants of good and honor to battle for the defense of the realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From agents of the Cyberpapacy operating in Oslo to monsters under Lord Uthorion's command rampaging in Ireland, from deadly skeleton cultists to warring faerie nations, Aysle has more than its share of the Possibility War's evil. And now Lady Ardinay is calling for help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Queenswrath is full of adventure hooks set in the fantasy realm of Aysle. It comes complete with villains and their statistics, dreadful plans and plots against honor, and maps of important new locations. Pella Ardinay provides the quests &amp;mdash; you provide the Storm Knights and the courage to see them through!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
