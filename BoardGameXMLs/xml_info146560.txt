			<description>Each player places their coloured pawn on the corner of the board that matches their colour. The dice is then thrown to decide which player is to start; other players follow in a clock&amp;not;wise direction. In their turn players throw the dice and move their pawn the number of spaces indicated by the dice. Moves may be made backwards or forwards around or across the diagonal paths. If the &amp;lsquo;pawn&amp;rsquo; lands on a letter, the player takes a matching letter from the letter tiles. Should the pawn land on a Gold Star he may take any letter he wishes; but if the pawn lands on a Black Spot the player must return a vowel card from those he has won back to the general pile; if he has not yet gained a vowel, he must owe it and return it when he obtains one.&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to form words from the tiles collected. For the younger child it can be to make simple three letter words such as CAT&amp;mdash;MAT&amp;mdash;COT&amp;mdash;CUP and so on. It should be decided beforehand the number of words (say six) and the first to do so being the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is also a game which may be played with enjoyment by much older children. In this case a point value is given to the length of the word. 3 letter words, 5 points; 4 letter words, 10 points; 5 letter words, 15 points; 6 and over letter words, 20 points. In this case it must be decided beforehand the number of points to be played for (say 100); the first player to do so being the winner. Words already formed may be added to such as MAT to MATS or MATCH; but no word already laid may be re-arranged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
