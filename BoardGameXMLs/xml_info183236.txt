			<description>Riana Rouge is a 1997 adult action-adventure game developed and published by Black Dragon Productions. It is one of the few titles that have earned an &amp;quot;Adults Only&amp;quot; rating from the ESRB.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game stars Playboy Playmate Gillian Bonner as Riana, a shy secretary who spies on her boss attempting to rape a coworker. She enters the office and tries to help her, but, she is overpowered by her boss and thrown out of the window. Somehow, she is transported to another world where she is a seductive warrior who must rescue the world from an evil dictator (her boss) and rescue her friend (the coworker).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Riana Rouge&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
