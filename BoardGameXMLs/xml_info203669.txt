			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vampyre of Mons is co-operative game of exploration, adventure and horror by Darkmook Paper Miniatures &amp;amp; Water Closet Press. Debuting at Thought Bubble 2015 in the UK and originally limited to only 30 copies for the initial print run, this is now available digitally as an RPGNow! exclusive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in the dark days of the Great War, The Vampyre of Mons is designed for 1-6 players and sees heroic (and not so heroic!) British troops and their mysterious allies facing the horrors of the Vampyre Lord's castle, where the very building itself plots to aid in their demise!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the latest version of the Darkmook Paper Miniatures Survival Horror rules, all you need to do is print and construct the components, grab some 6 sided dice and a standard deck of playing cards and you are ready to start your adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
