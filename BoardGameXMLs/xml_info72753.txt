			<description>In Goldrush! the players start deep down in a cave filled with gold. The goal is to get out of the cave with as much gold as posible. Every now and then the cave collapses and the players might be caught in the falling masses of stone. The players are able to influence on whether the cave will collapse or not but they can never be certain. To help them they have a Amulet which warns them just as they cave is about to collapse but it can only be used once. It takes guts to stay and pick up gold with the risk of the cave collapsing. The player who gets out with the most gold wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
