							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">CityVille</name>
									
			<description>CityVille is a social game allowing anyone anywhere to build their dream city from the ground up. CityVille allows players to build a city, interact with friends' cities, and build franchises with the help of their friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Rome may not have been built in a day, the growth of a CityVille town is in the hands of the player. CityVille allows players to grow a thriving city, balance the needs of citizens, run restaurants and businesses and harvest crops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;CityVille is where Monopoly meets Main Street,&amp;quot; said Sean Kelly, GM of CityVille. &amp;quot;We are thrilled to bring the world our most social game to date &amp;ndash; building on the best-of-breed gameplay that Zynga fine-tuned with FarmVille and FrontierVille. Instead of harvesting crops you're harvesting your neighborhood, instead of clearing your friend's frontier you're working on a friend's franchise.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Abbreviated from The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
