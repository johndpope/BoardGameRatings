			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;The object of this game is to win as many cards as possible in ten minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player takes a card from the BrainBox and turns the timer over. The payer then has ten seconds to study the picture on the card. When the timer runs out the card is passed to player 2 and player one rolls the die to see which question is to be asked. The questions are on the reverse of the picture card. Player 2 checks the answer by looking at the picture and if it is correct the card is given back to player 1 to keep. If the answer is wrong the card is placed back into the BrainBox and the next player chooses a card. The player with the most cards after ten minutes wins. If there is a tie, it's sudden death with both players choosing a card and having to answer all eight questions on the card. The player who answers the most correctly wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 1 or more players, and ages 8+.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kings and Queens How many things can you spot in ten seconds? Turn the timer over and try to memorise as many of the pictures and words appearing on the beautifully-illustrated cards. After ten seconds, turn the card over, roll the die and answer a quick-fire question to win the card. The player with the most cards after 10 minutes wins. A fun way to learn about our kings and queens of the realm. Age 8 and above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
