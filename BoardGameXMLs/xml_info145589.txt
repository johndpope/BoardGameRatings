			<description>Authenticity, the new innovative relationship board game designed to discover the true essence of you and your mate. The game of Authenticity was created to provide couples that are dating, engaged or newly married the opportunity to learn more about their mate in a fun, interactive yet informative format. Seven categories; Finance, Life, Actions, Situations, Religion, Family and Sex and Romance address those questions that are crucial to every relationship. To achieve the full benefits of the game you and your mate must be completely authentic. To be authentic is to truly be yourself, be proud of your past and your present. The focus is not winning or losing, but learning and connecting with your mate so that you can determine if there is a love connection. This is the most fun you will have getting to know your mate. Object: The object of the game is to Authentically answer the questions so that you can learn about your mate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment: 1 game board, 1 die, 2 game pieces, 39 life cards, 39 finance cards, 39 family cards, 39 situation cards, 40 actions cards, 40 sex and romance cards, 40 religion cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play: You and your mate will start with a kiss at the start space. Every time you pass start you must give your mate a kiss. Roll the die, the mate with the highest score goes first. Move your piece around the board. When you land on a space, pick up the corresponding card and ask your mate the question. Your mate SHOULD answer the question as authentically as possible. Once the question is answered, add the card to the bottom of the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Pick your Pleasure: If you land on this space you have the autonomy to ask your mate to perform an act, performance, whatever you choose!&lt;br/&gt;    The Ball is in your Court: If you land on this space ask your mate any question that you like.
