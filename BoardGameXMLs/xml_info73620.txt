			<description>Players lay out cards with digits and operators from a dealt hand, trying to construct a sum that yields a predetermined result. Points are lost for being off the target. During a round, players can draw new cards or pick up discarded ones. There are three levels of difficulty that determine how many and which cards are used, starting with basic addition and subtraction and moving on to things like negatives, multiplication and division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
