							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Go Go Kani-la</name>
									
			<description>Very simple action game published in 1971 in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;Each player set Kani-la on his catapult and try to throw them into the opponent player's field through the hole.  Sometimes Kani-la was hooked on the net.  In any way, the first player who has no kani-la in his field wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple, but really fun game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
