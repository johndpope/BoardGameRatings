							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battletech: Chaos Campaign</name>
									
			<description>Chaos Campaign rules provides an open-ended campaign framework that easily allows gamemasters and players to use a variety of published-tracks to create their own unique gaming experiences using forces of their own creation. Each track that plugs into the Chaos Campaign rules system (there are no tracks found in this Chaos Campaign book which is a free download) provides a backstory that fits into the overall campaign plot. Likewise, each track is set up as a general framework to assist gamemasters and players in creating the opposing forces and adding other battlefield effects specific to that track. In addition, using the Warchest Point System, player groups may choose what direction the campaign takes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chaos Campaign rules are designed to allow players to customize campaigns from the Jihad Series of Scenario books and a new set of campaign books designed specifically for the Chaos Campaign system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The books in this series are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Jihad Turning Points: Luthien fleshes out the details of the conflict surrounding this pivotal world published in various Jihad Plot Sourcebooks. Additionally, players can join one of the myriad of units fighting for control&amp;mdash;and survival&amp;mdash;of the Combine&amp;rsquo;s capital world. Enemies from within and without seek to cut off the Dragon&amp;rsquo;s head, while loyal samurai fight to save it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further books are expected to be released in the coming year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Classic Battletech: Total Warfare&lt;br/&gt;    Classic Battletech: Tactical Operations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
