			<description>Sphered is a very short two players game playable with the Shibumi game system. It uses the 4&amp;times;4 holes board and balls of all three colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;The board starts empty. Two players, white and black, take turns placing a ball of their color, or a red ball, on an empty board hole.&lt;br/&gt;When any 2x2 platform is created, the ball that has to be placed on the platform must be of the predominant color, or, if there is not a predominant color, the ball must be of the absent color. Established the color to place on the top, if it is red or the color of the current player, he has to place the ball on the platform in the same turn, instead if it is the color of the other player, next turn the other player has a forced move and must place that ball. Completing a platform forces the completion of other platforms.&lt;br/&gt;The player who places a ball of his color on the top of the pyramid wins the game, but if he must place on the apex a red ball he loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note&lt;br/&gt;As for the forced move in the next turn, there are more than 16 moves, but all the levels above the first one are decided by the 16 balls on the 4x4 board. The placing of the red ball on the apex is a losing condition and a player can use the sequence of forced moves to force the other to be the player who places the red ball on the top of the pyramid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sphered can be played online (real time) at igGameCenter - &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.iggamecenter.com/info/en/sandboxshibumi.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.iggamecenter.com/info/en/sandboxshibumi.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
