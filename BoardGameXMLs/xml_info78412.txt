			<description>Solaris is a game for the Atari 2600 published in 1986 by Atari. The game was programmed by Douglas Neubauer, who owns the copyright to the game and the Solaris trademark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The galaxy of Solaris is made up of 16 quadrants, each containing 16 sectors. The game has 3 distinct environments:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The tactical map, in which the player navigates through the quadrant and choosing which enemy to fight.&lt;br/&gt;- Space battle ensues whenever the player navigates into a hostile battlegroup via the tactical map&lt;br/&gt;- The player may also descend to planets. there are 3 types of planets in the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      Friendly federation planets, which provide for refueling, but may also harbor a planet defense mission if they are under attack. If players allow a friendly planet in a quadrant to be destroyed, that quadrant becomes a &amp;quot;red zone&amp;quot; where joystick controls are reversed and booming sounds are overheard.&lt;br/&gt;      Enemy zylon planets, in which the player must rescue all cadets, gaining an extra ship when all cadets are rescued.&lt;br/&gt;      Enemy corridor planets, in which the player must traverse through a fast-paced corridor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are able to &amp;quot;warp&amp;quot; between the sectors, during which they must attempt to keep their ship &amp;quot;in focus&amp;quot; to lower their fuel consumption rate. Fuel must be carefully managed, as an empty tank results in loss of one of the player lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space enemies range from the easy to the frustrating - pot shot-loving &amp;quot;pirate&amp;quot; ships, mechanoid ships and aggressive &amp;quot;cobra&amp;quot; ships. Each battlegroup has at least one enemy flagship, which shoots out fuel-sapping drones. There are also 4 kinds of ground fighters - stationary guardians, gliders, targeters and raiders. The ultimate goal of Solaris is to reach the planet Solaris and rescue its colonists, at which point the game ends in victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_%28Atari_2600%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_%28Atari_2600%29&lt;/a&gt;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
