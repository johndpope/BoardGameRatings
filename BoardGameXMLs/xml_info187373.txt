							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Megalomania</name>
									
			<description>Megalomania is a card-centric base-building game in which players take the role of megalomaniacs. The flavor of the game is a mixture of James Bond and Looney Tunes villains, focusing on ridiculous scheming rather than sinister.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play is accomplished in turns, with each player possessing two actions. Players may build structures, hire minions, develop schemes and attack other players. Most cards synergize with others, granting bonuses for building intelligently and towards particular strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to be the first player to score twelve infamy. Infamy is generated by completing plots - which require resources - and assaults - which require greater attack than an opponent has defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
