							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">White Chalk Cliffs</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here the gently rolling hills of the countryside abruptly drop to the sea below, exposing the white chalk resting below a thin layer of grass covered earth in the form of steep cliffs. Of course if one were to ask one of the local fishermen and sailors they would attest that the land actually abruptly rises from the sea instead. At the bottom of the cliff face countless chalk blocks have tumbled into the sea and still continue to do so. Especially after heavy storms the coastline may change quite a bit. This makes approaching the cliff from the seaside quite hazardous. While some of the chalk blocks break through the surface of the water, others lie submerged just below, apparently waiting to tear through the hulls of approaching boats. Climbing down the cliff is hardly any saver though. The chalk of the cliff is brittle and prone to break even under the smallest of loads placed upon it. As a safety measure a fence has been erected along the cliff face, to keep the foolhardy from plummeting to their death. The barbed wire of the fence is rusty though and in many locations the fence itself is in danger of plummeting to the bottom of the cliff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
