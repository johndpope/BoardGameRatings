							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goo Games</name>
									
			<description>Goo Games is an above the line campaign featuring a range of activities with a Facebook game at its heart. Additional awareness comes from their existing 2m+ fanbase engaging through social networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preloaded worked closely with CMW to develop the Facebook Games, made up of six unique Creme Egg events, all of which are designed to create maximum goo! Inspired by real Olympic disciplines, events include the Goodles, High Splat and Triple Bump. The player must 'get their goo on' in each event, exploding their egg in the biggest, most dramatic way possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for short bursts of play and over multiple sessions, the game&amp;rsquo;s killer feature is the scoring layer which generates social competition by feeding friends&amp;rsquo; live game data into the player&amp;rsquo;s own game. The games also integrates Facebook&amp;rsquo;s new scoring API, hard-wiring the game directly into the Facebook community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
