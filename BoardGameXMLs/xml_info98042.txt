			<description>Advertising-related game, for Wrangler jeans, etc.&lt;br/&gt;Questions test your knowldge within the years 1945 to 1985. Players score penalty points for wrong answers and the player with the least amount of penalty points after the deck has been used completely, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the packet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Test your knowledge of Britain with this compulsive new card game, quiz and puzzle combined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this pack are 50 cards - 48 ask the questions, 2 cards give the answers (in case you are really stuck!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A rules leaflet tells you how to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two games to play, with up to 5 of your friends, and two games to play on your own.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a fairly straightforward quiz with a color photograph on each card to illustrate the location concerned in the question. The method for answering is quite novel. Instead of a straight a) b) c) d) multiple choice, you pick your answer and go to the next card according to the number next to that answer. You should find that your set of answers takes you back to your starting card after eight questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is interaction between the players when one person thinks they need a cards already used by another in their answer. There is then a challenge for the card because each card can only appear in a single set of answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
