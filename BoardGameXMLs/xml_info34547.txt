							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alles Banane!</name>
									
			<description>The game is played in 5 rounds. Players take turns flipping over cards. When a banana card is flipped up, the active player gets a big banana. When a monkey is shown, the banana has to be put back. Banana peels mean there is no change. When all cards are face up the round is finished. The player who has the big banana at the end of the round gets a small banana. The player who has the most bananas at the end wins.  &lt;br/&gt;The game is entirely luck-driven and targets the very young.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
