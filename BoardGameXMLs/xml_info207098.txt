When a rival pirate lord calls in a large amount of favors and sets a fearsome raiders of the Storm Wolf against the PCs,led by the vicious Captain Sculberd Craggs, nothing they prize is truly safe. These marauding raiders cut a bloody swath through the heroes' holdings while they are away adventuring, setting off a feud that can have but one ending. Such inexorable enmity can only be repaid in blood, and when the heroes discover the location of the raiders&amp;rsquo; base on the volcanic island known as The Steaming Isle, it is their opportunity to turn the tables and unleash a roaring rampage of reaping revenge against Captain Craggs and his crew of blackguards and scoundrels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Islands of Plunder: Scourge of the Steaming Isle is a 5E adventure for 9th-level PCs full of mystery and peril upon the high seas, below the waves,, and on dangerous islands, incorporating investigation and negotiation alongside deadly danger on board ship and among the deadly reefs below.
