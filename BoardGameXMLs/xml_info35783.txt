			<description>INTRO&lt;br/&gt;Kamchatka (yes, THAT Kamchatka), somehow, has escaped the damage brought by man&amp;rsquo;s over development of our globe. To this day it remains one of the great unspoiled wildernesses on the planet and one of the most rugged places on the Earth.  Located on the Pacific&amp;rsquo;s Ring of Fire, Kamchatka holds some of the world&amp;rsquo;s most beautiful active volcanoes. Add to that the earthquakes, mudslides, flooding, and avalanches and it is easy to see why Kamchatka is literally a force of nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fauna is just as imposing: Giant roc-like eagles reign from above (seriously, google Stellar&amp;rsquo;s Eagles-these things are unreal!); huge sockeye salmon are plentiful in the many rivers and waterways; walrus and seals live and breed along the shores; herds of reindeer number in the thousands; and there is a greater density of giant grizzly bear in Kamchatka than anywhere else in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME&lt;br/&gt;In Kamchatka you must fight to survive.  Time stands still here: You play an indigenous hunter hundreds&amp;mdash;even thousands&amp;mdash;of years ago surrounded by Kamchatka&amp;rsquo;s frigid seas, great rivers, dense forests, and snowcapped volcanic mountains.  Your village depends on you and your small hunting party to hunt, trap, and trade in order to search out the resources they need.  You will risk your life on this journey through Kamchatka&amp;rsquo;s harsh bush and in its treacherous seas to bring back the required resources to your villagers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kamchatka is designed to play solitaire or for 2 to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
