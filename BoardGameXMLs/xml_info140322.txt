			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Give Skeletons New Life!&lt;br/&gt; Skeletons have always been a danger to young heroes venturing into lonely graveyards and ominous tombs, but these classic monsters are quickly replaced by their more powerful undead. Monster Focus: Skeletons is here to give Game Masters a wealth of options to give these clattering undead new &amp;quot;life&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt; Inside, you'll find a number of options for player characters facing off against skeletons. Options like the Bone Breaker feat, which allows a character to bypass damage reduction, or the new spell Maul of the Righteous, which can crush most skeletons with a single swing. In addition, there are a wide variety of new rules for Game Master to use in their game. There are 7 new magic items like the bone sword, a dreadful weapon that can turn any creature it kills into a skeleton under the wielders control. Game Masters will also find 3 new types of skeleton inside, including the skeletal lord that command the dead and create new minions to serve him.&lt;br/&gt; Monster Focus is a series of short, easy to integrate PDFs, designed to make one classic monster the central theme for an adventure or even a small campaign. Each PDF in the series includes options for player characters and game masters, including new feats, spells, magic items, and more! Written by veteran game designer, Jason Bulmahn, you can be sure that these rules will fit seamlessly into your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
