			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Million Faces, A Million Lies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen people freeze up, lose their minds screaming, faint dead away, or crap themselves while scrambling to try to get away. Falling apart like this can be fatal in the field. But nothing&amp;rsquo;s as bad as the ones I know who got so scared they went crazy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anastasia paused, letting the room grow silent. &amp;ldquo;Scared yet?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several of the students actually had the guts to nod their heads. &amp;ldquo;Good. You&amp;rsquo;re the smart ones so far. Okay, so who here knows the mortality rate of Warden field agents?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;None of the students raised a hand. They were definitely paying attention now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not something they tell you when you&amp;rsquo;re signing up. It&amp;rsquo;s 35% over two years. Think about that. Look around at everyone. One out of every three people in this room is going to be dead within twenty-four months.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There it was. Someone broke out in a sniffle, trying not to cry. Several students simply stood and walked out. Anastasia didn&amp;rsquo;t look surprised at all. It was almost like this behavior was expected and on cue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Scared now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Void is an original Lovecraftian hard sci-fi horror setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character&amp;rsquo;s Unbound I: Player&amp;rsquo;s Guide:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Introduces Lifepath Character Generation, so you can build any kind of Character from the ground up.&lt;br/&gt;     Provides tools to help put more of The Void into your Character, including Character secrets.&lt;br/&gt;     Greatly expands the number of Character Talents, and introduces Advanced Talents and Team Talents.&lt;br/&gt;     Introduces optional rules for Character Empathy.&lt;br/&gt;     Provides new rules for Achievements, so you can get more for exploring the world of The Void.&lt;br/&gt;     Introduces optional rules for a more conglomerated skill system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
