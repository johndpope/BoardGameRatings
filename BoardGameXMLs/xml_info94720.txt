							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arctic Hunting</name>
									
			<description>In Arctic circle, a seal cuts 12 breathing holes in the ice in 2 square kilometer region.  Polar bear needs to choose one from the 12 holes and wait for hours to days for his prey to rise. Once he misses the chance, he might not survive the winter.&lt;br/&gt; &amp;quot;Arctic Hunting&amp;quot; is a party and family card game for 1-8 players. 1-2 people play the roles of Polar Bear or/and Eskimos who become the hunter.  Other people play the roles of Seals, Walrus, or/and Beluga Whale who become the prey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receive a deck of 12 cards. There are 5 turns in a game and 3 phases in one turn. Each player receive 3-6 cards according to their roles.  Hunters and Preys play one card simutaneously.  If the prey and the hunter play the same number, the hunter eats the prey.  If there is a difference between their cards from 1-3, the hunter can discard 1-3 cards to pursuit the prey.  On the same time, the prey can discard 1 card to escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the hunters kill 2(4) preys or 2(4) prey discard all of their hand cards before the last turn in 4(8) players game, hunters win the game. If not, the preys win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
