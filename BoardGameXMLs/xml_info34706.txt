			<description>In this game, players race to move four pawns from their starting positions around the board into their &amp;quot;Home Country.&amp;quot;  Basic gameplay resembles Pachisi or Sorry!, but there are a couple of twists.  First of all, movement is controlled by a deck of standard playing cards (with some extra Aces and Kings) -- most cards move a pawn forward by their face value, but some have special powers (get a pawn out of the starting area, move multiple pawns, trade places, move backwards, etc.).  Additionally, while the game can be played as a free-for-all, it is also possible for players to split into partnerships and aid their partners in the race to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is subtitled &amp;quot;An International Card Game,&amp;quot; featuring rules in eight different languages and decorating its board with the flags of many of the countries where it can be played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
