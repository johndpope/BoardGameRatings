							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">World Truck Racing</name>
									
			<description>Racing trucks accelerate to 100 km/h faster than most supercars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you can feel the power of their twelve-cyllinder engines firsthand. Get behind the wheel of these road monsters and take part in a worldwide series of races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be on your guard, because truck racing is a close-contact sport and your opponents will do everything to eliminate you from the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Changing weather conditions and time of day also won't help you. You will need to demonstrate your extraordinary driving skills and correctly choose the settings of your car to get the championship title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     12 trucks&lt;br/&gt;     16 racetracks&lt;br/&gt;     Mechanical and visual tuning&lt;br/&gt;     4 race modes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
