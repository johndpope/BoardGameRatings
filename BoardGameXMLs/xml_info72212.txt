			<description>All Things Zombie: Giving Up The Goat is an expansion for All Things Zombie tabletop miniatures wargame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes zombies are the least of your worries!&lt;br/&gt;Two members of your group went downriver by boat in search of supplies. They were expected back before nightfall but it's been three days since they left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Julie and Phil have only been with your little group of survivors for a short time. Maybe it was a mistake to let them go by themselves but sometimes that's the way things go. Since the zed outbreak it's better to look out for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that still doesn&amp;rsquo;t make you feel any better. You asked for volunteers and two others will go with you. You just hope for their sake that Julie and Phil didn&amp;rsquo;t go all the way down to Lake Havasu. Not with the rumors about things worse than zombies prowling the countryside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Giving Up The Goat you will find...&lt;br/&gt;-Rules for using Enemy Forces or PEFs &lt;br/&gt;-Rules for boats and swimming. &lt;br/&gt;-Rules for Chupacabra, Feral Dogs, Javelinas, and Rattlesnakes. &lt;br/&gt;-Rules for sleep deprivation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
