			<description>A game of Backgammon... with cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game played for thousands of years known widely as Backgammon, now has its card game counterpart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to play cards matching their dice results and then gather them back in their hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player rolls the dice and plays and/or moves up to 2 cards, then draws a card. Game play gives a new twist to the classic backgammon since it can be played with 2 to 4 players and cards need certain dice results to be played. A number of variants, boosts the game's replayability and offers new ways to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
