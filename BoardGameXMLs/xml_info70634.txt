			<description>&amp;quot;Players of the original game are never told the hero's name, but are instead asked to enter their own. The default name of &amp;quot;Roger Wilco&amp;quot; &amp;mdash; a reference to the abbreviated radio communication, &amp;quot;Roger, Will Comply&amp;quot; &amp;mdash; became the de facto name of the hero in the later games of the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roger is a member of the cleaning crew onboard the scientific spaceship &amp;quot;Arcada&amp;quot;, which holds a powerful experimental device called the &amp;quot;Star Generator&amp;quot; (a thinly-veiled reference to the Genesis Device from Star Trek II). Roger emerges from an on-duty nap in a broom closet to find that the ship has been boarded and seized by the sinister Sariens. Using a keycard that he found from the body of a fellow fallen crew member named Jerry, he finds his way to an escape pod and escapes the &amp;quot;Arcada&amp;quot;. After crash-landing, he finds himself on a dry and barren wasteland that is the planet Kerona. Making his way through the desert and through a system of caves below, he is tasked with the killing of a creature called the Orat. He finds the Orat in a cave, and duly kills it...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Space_Quest:_The_Sarien_Encounter,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
