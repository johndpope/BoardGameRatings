							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Swiss Facts</name>
									
			<description>Swiss-Facts is a multilingual guessing game for 2-6 players, aged 12 years and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game focuses on the cantons of Switzerland and has a playing time of 15 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do more people live in the canton of Basel-Land or Basel-Stadt? Which has the larger surface- Valais or Grisons? Is the population density greater in the canton of Zurich or Geneva? Are there more municipalities in the canton of Glarus or in the canton of Obwalden? Does Ticino or the canton of Uri have the higher mountain peaks? What was created first- the canton of Freiburg or the canton of Schaffhausen ? And which canton actually has the highest gross domestic product per capita? These questions are similar to those that the players of Swiss-Facts will have to think about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
