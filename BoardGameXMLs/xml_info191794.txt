			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world as you know it is gone. In the wake of a terrible disease, the dead have risen to walk the Earth and humans are no longer at the top of the food chain and civilization has collapsed. Welcome to the world AFTER ZOMBIES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After Zombies is a d% RPG with no character classes. All skill and combat checks are rolled on percentile dice and 2-5 d10&amp;rsquo;s are all you need to play the game, along with pencil and paper. Advancement is based on survival by any means necessary. Hide. Run. Fight. It makes no difference. Surviving one more day is all that matters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After Zombies was designed by industry veteran Charles Rice, with art by the amazing Jon Gibbons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
