			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poisoned Pages for Shadow of the Demon Lord!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the world crumbling into ruin and chaos, and reality itself teetering on the brink of utter oblivion, there are those who find the temptation to embrace the darkness almost irresistible. After all, they will argue, if everything is hurtling toward annihilation, why shouldn't we all indulge every desire and engage in whatever acts we choose, no matter how wrong or evil, without fear or care of what might come?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Price of Evilexplores the costs and consequences of characters' evil actions by expanding on the Corruption rules as presented in Shadow of the Demon Lord. Using the variant rules in this supplement will strengthen the effect of Corruption in the game, building upon the horror of transformation and subversion by demonic influence until the characters become the very monstrosities they fight against.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement joins other installments in the Poisoned Pagesseries by offering optional rules groups can use to enrich their play experience. Like the variant insanity and madness rules found in Unhinge the Mind, and the lasting scars and injuries in Battle Scars, the rules in this supplement are optional and should only be used if all the players and the GM are in agreement to incorporate them. Utilizing these variant rules brings the story element of the Demon Lord's shadow even more forward as an active and terrifying force that can both aid and hinder the story&amp;rsquo;s protagonists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
