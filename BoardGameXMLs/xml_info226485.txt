			<description>Zuirius is a strategic board game played on an endless triangular grid. It is possible to play on any flat surface, without the special board. The goal of the game is to block all tetrahedrons of your rival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game there is no captures or direct confrontation of pieces. During the game the number of pieces is not changed, all tetrahedrons are interconnected and constantly depend on each other. The compact starting position of pieces passes through various irreversible metamorphoses and, having exhausted all its &amp;quot;energy&amp;quot;, freezes as a result. You can play with 18, 24, 30, 36 or 42 pieces. The more pieces, the harder the game will be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has an allocated color. Players alternate turns. All tetrahedrons must be connected in a single group. You cannot pick up a piece to move if doing so disconnects the remaining pieces, even if they would be reconnected after putting the piece into its new location. Each tetrahedron always has neighbors. Their number can be from 1 to 12. Tetrahedrons are considered to be neighbors if they stand on the nearby triangles. Neighbors are divided into two types - orthogonal and diagonal. The piece can be moved to any empty triangle, where the number of neighbors are less than it is now. Their color does not matter. The piece can also be moved to any empty triangle, where the number of neighbors does not change, but orthogonal ones among them become less. The game ends when one of the players has no legal moves on his turn. In this case, the winner does as many moves as he can and earns one point for each move. When both players lose moves consecutively it's a draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
