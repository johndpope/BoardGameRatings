			<description>Damsel is a tower defense strategy game. One side builds and upgrades towers to protect the Damsel from the vile henchmen. The other side controls the hordes of henchmen out to get the Damsel. While both work in entirely different ways, both offer many paths to victory, it's simply up to your skill, tactics, and cunning to determine the victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Damsel comes with four beautiful hex boards, each with their own sets of obstacles and tactical advantages. While the Craftsmen toil away building clockwork towers to protect the Damsel, the Henchmen horde approaches from all four sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Henchmen, it's all about numbers and diversity; getting the right type of unit to the right location at the right time with the right amount of reinforcement. The Henchmen have four different types of units, the rapid moving Assassin, the agile Horseman, the tough Knight, and the destructive Sappers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Craftsmen, it's all about skillful placement and upgrades of towers. The Craftsmen get to place the Damsel anywhere on the board that they choose. They can place towers anywhere they wish as well, as long as they aren't in range of other towers or the Damsel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game involves only the tiniest bit of luck. Most of the time it is all about tactics and strategy. Do you have what it takes to protect the Damsel? Or is your soul black like that of the Henchmen out to kill her?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
