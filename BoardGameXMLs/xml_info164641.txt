							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Noir Syndrome</name>
									
			<description>Noir Syndrome is a procedurally generated Detective Murder-Mystery with a new story every time! Featuring slick pixel art animations and a jazzy soundtrack, the player is thrown right in to a highly stylized vision of film noir. Visit locations, interrogate suspects, search for clues, and eventually solve the case before the killer escapes - or you wind up dead yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Procedural generation: Murder mystery scenarios with a new culprit and clues each time, every play-through is unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Permanent choices: NPCs, interactions, death, and a slew of other features will all persist until a new game is started. Every action counts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notebook: Collect vital clues in the detective's notebook to help narrow down suspects and solve the case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigation: Interact with and examine numerous objects and characters in a number of environments in the search for more information on the killer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Countdown: Given a set number of days to solve the mystery, each area visited will decrement the time left, adding to the urgency of every case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Freedom of choice: Attempt to solve the case, or live out your remaining time doing as you please - be it fighting the law, going after gang members, or just seeing the city.&lt;br/&gt; Gunplay: Combat is generally to be avoided as a single bullet will take down the player. However, when necessary, the revolver is always available for use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Badges: Complete a variety of challenges to earn unique badges which directly influence future playthroughs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statistics and Scores: Statistics and high scores for a wide variety of topics will persist through every game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Costumes: Multiple unlockable costumes can be earned in game. Play as the default male or female detective, or unlock a variety of new outfits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenges: Optional challenges unrelated to the main case are generated each game. Every challenge completed provides permanent bonuses to all playthroughs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
