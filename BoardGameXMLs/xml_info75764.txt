			<description>The players are dwarves and have to mix colors to color their hats. At the start of the game, each player receives one dwarf card and takes it into his/her hand. The mixing colors are placed face-down on the table.&lt;br/&gt;The active player picks a small (two colors) or large hat (three) and has to name the players who hold the dwarf colors he/she needs to mix the color on the hat. Then he/she also has to find the correct mixing color on the table. If successful, he/she can keep the hat. A player who fails gets a white dwarf and is allowed to use his/her own dwarf in the next move (unless another player makes a mistake and takes the white dwarf from him/her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with most hats at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
