			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Black Monk, Salvation the characters live in a desolate, but vibrant world where time seems to have lost meaning. Living for decades, perhaps longer, in isolation from others, the people of Witherfall toil in work, sometimes visited by a mysterious and powerful figure known as the Black Monk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it has been ages since the Black Monk visited last and the people of Witherfall built a tower in preparation for his return. No longer do they fear his reprisals and sudden turns of mood. They have readied themselves for the ominous beast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no more suffering. Now and forever. Rest assured&amp;hellip; they are ready.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sun is fading now. The torches are lit, the oil and defensive machinery are ready. It&amp;rsquo;s only a matter of time before the Black Monk is sundered and returned to ether.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is that an army of shadows he brings with him? Or just more damned?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
