							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pocket Universe</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to the future! At the dawn of the 25th Century, races from across the void have worked together to develop incredible technologies. Humans, Borganoids, Ursans and Gryzz have lived in harmony for decades... until now. Following the invention of a brand new device called PUGS, tensions have grown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PUGS, the Pocket Universe Generation System, is an amazing invention. When fired up, a brand new self-contained universe is created, filled with precious elements ready to be plundered  &amp;ndash; as long as the players can find them. They'll need to race around the Pocket Universe and grab what they can as quickly as possible, avoiding attacks from the opposition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players fly about the Pocket Universe made up of hexes, controlling their starship and attempting to explore planets and mine four different types of resources. Once collected they can either choose to return them to their starbase in order to score points or keep some aboard in order to use them to perform special abilities - some aggressive, some defensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a set amount of planets have been discovered, players must then make a final race to return their remaining resources to their base and score that last points boost. Whoever has the most points at the end will be declared the winner! Will you come out on top?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
