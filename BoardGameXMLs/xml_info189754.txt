			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ptolus Sketchbook line is a great resource for players and DMs to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; more of the City by the Spire. Created by the artists who set the architectural tone for the Ptolus book, every sketchbook focuses on a different district. Together they expand Ptolus with illustrations of buildings not pictured in the core book.&lt;br/&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in a Ptolus Sketchbook?&lt;br/&gt;-Building illustrations inspired by Monte&amp;rsquo;s descriptions.&lt;br/&gt;- Illustrations of details which could be found in the featured buildings (signs, furniture, typical items).&lt;br/&gt;- Blank handouts of letters, advertisements, etc. which can be easily customized to your needs.&lt;br/&gt;Every Ptolus Sketchbook from The Forge Studios consists of two parts. The first one is stylized and consists of illustrations made on a parchment background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second part is a set of black and white illustrations which can be easily printed or presented to players during a session, in order to enrich the locale&amp;rsquo;s description and create a more precise presentation.&lt;br/&gt;Ptolus Sketchbook vol. 2:Temple district is the second part of a series illustrating Monte Cook&amp;rsquo;s City by the Spire. The supplement focuses on a small section of Ptolus centered around worship and religious faith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ptolus Sketchbook vol. 2:Temple district consists of:&lt;br/&gt;- 6 street overviews&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 13 building visualizations including:&lt;br/&gt;Celestial Conclave&lt;br/&gt;Conciliator Chapterhouse&lt;br/&gt;Hall of Heroes&lt;br/&gt;House of the Sacred Heat&lt;br/&gt;Order of the Fist Compound&lt;br/&gt;Priory of Introspection&lt;br/&gt;Taggert&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br/&gt;Temple of Ahaar&lt;br/&gt;Temple of the Ebon Hand&lt;br/&gt;Temple of Excellence&lt;br/&gt;Temple of Navashtrom&lt;br/&gt;Temple of the Rat God&lt;br/&gt;Stormwrought Campanile&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 33 detail illustrations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- and 7 handouts including :&lt;br/&gt;Two sample envelopes&lt;br/&gt;A street name sign&lt;br/&gt;A menu&lt;br/&gt;A stone slab&lt;br/&gt;A book&lt;br/&gt;A vial&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
