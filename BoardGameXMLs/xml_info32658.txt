			<description>As with all games from this publisher there are a lot (11 in this case) rules variant so it builds up from 3 to 10 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life of the ladybirds is one big feast, just as long as there are enough plant lice to eat and they stay out of harms way for instance coming from the spider webs, and of course the spiders themselves.&lt;br/&gt;Would you like to chase for twins, go for a plant lice hunt or race against your friends? Then come and play Coco Colecto!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game challenges children to use their arithmetical skills to get ahead in the game(s). Although the winning strategies depend on the smart use of additions, subtractions, multiplications and/or divisions, the learning process is almost invisible for the children, since they are too busy having fun. Coco Colecto is a versatile game with different levels of learning, which all draw upon the developing arithmetic skills of children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
