			<description>The roletaking game Radio Cloud  uses simultaneous self-regulating play, deck seeding, and on-the-fly continuity to induce internally consistent interactions within the framework of its post-apocalyptic game world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By seeding location decks, players can attempt to induce characters, supplies, threats, encounters, missions, and other story threads of their choice to weave into the game state, and by filtering through location decks, they can act within the game state as its narrative streams solidify.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Radio Cloud, players start as wanderers in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, each with a defined goal, and must create their own means for achieving that goal: not only by exploring the wasteland and dealing with its inhabitants, but also by training to enhance their capabilities and learn new skills and techniques that can help them succeed at their respective missions. Working against failure conditions that differ for each player&amp;mdash;for example, constraints on number of days expended or on types or numbers of actions, encounters, or visited locations&amp;mdash;players interact with each other directly and indirectly in order to complete their respective missions before time runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radio Cloud is set in the post-apocalyptic setting of New Amarillo, a setting shared with South Quarter Independent&amp;rsquo;s upcoming games Poomp! (SQI004, a racing game), Bragging Rights (SQI016, a storytelling game), and Dustbowl (SQI027, a wheeled combat game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
