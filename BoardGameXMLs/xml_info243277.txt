			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeons are a staple of fantasy settings and they - and, for that matter, other locations - often have water in them, whether this be drinkable or otherwise. There are many different sources of water and water features that could be found in a dungeon, from small to large and portable to fixed. These can be a source of scenery or, for the odder ones, puzzlement, or they can be used to hide useful or other items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are 100 different water sources that could be found in a dungeon. Some are quite normal, others are distinctly odd. Some may cause players to be suspicious that there is a problem or danger; if the GameMaster decides so, this could be the case - some results are definitely dangerous. In some cases the water sources are definitely water and drinkable or not, in others this is up to the GM. Various ways of altering the properties of the water sources are given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gutter - A U-shaped stone gutter about 6&amp;rdquo; wide and deep is set into the floor, leading from one wall to another. The gutter is filled with water and enters and terminates at small, U-shaped openings in each wall, both partially blocked with small black iron grate, with the bars about an inch apart, that prevents larger objects from going through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is cover, one the front matter and one page is ads for other supplements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
