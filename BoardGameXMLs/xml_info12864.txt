			<description>Dimensions is a three-dimensional tic-tac-toe variant, but a somewhat unusual one.  The play area consists of four 4x4 stacked boards.  On a turn a player generally places a chip on an empty square, but instead a player can choose to rotate one of the top three boards by a quarter-turn.  Players score points any time three or four of their pieces form a line, with more points for rows of four and for rows which cross levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Qubic - Played on 4x4x4 cube (4x4 grid with 4 layers) but without turning layers&lt;br/&gt;    Score Four - 4x4 grid of pegs that are filled from the bottom up&lt;br/&gt;    Hi!Noon: Das Duell(2009), Tic Tac Turn(2011), and X: Die 4.
