			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By far the most deluxe western ever produced, this leatheredhardcover rides into town with 400 full color pages crammed with beautiful period artwork! Yes, the Aces &amp;amp; Eights: Shattered Frontier RPG is the highest quality, most complete western ever marketed in the adventure game industry. Just be sure to keep plenty of tissue nearby - the drool-factor on this product is through the roof!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, there&amp;rsquo;s the innovative and visual Shot Clock game aids, which eliminate the abstraction and complexity of other RPGs &amp;ndash; a player can actually see the cover, position and location of his or her target! Of course, the Shot Clock game aids aren&amp;rsquo;t the only innovation in the Aces &amp;amp; Eights game. For instance, the game has a new poker chip-based brawling system that solves the problem of &amp;ldquo;temporary&amp;rdquo; damage; characters actually become winded, tired or knocked senseless in the fight. The realistically deadly combat supports an overall game system that rewards characters for pursuing professions, giving players the in-game incentives to do much more than follow the outlaw trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the Aces &amp;amp; Eights RPG is the first western to not just allow, but focus on, the rest of the major western movie adventures beyond the gunfight. Prospecting, cattle drives, frontier justice, and so on, all have a complete &amp;ldquo;mini game&amp;rdquo; system tailored for that type of adventure. In fact, the Aces &amp;amp; Eights game has over two score available professions covering the full range of possibilities in the Wild West! With no levels or classes (and only gaining experience in skills used), characters can change professions at will, just like the Old West!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full-color maps and 25 pages of history provide such details as minor politicians and military officers (based on real historical figures), making the background spring to life like no other game has. And with the USA, CSA, Republic of Texas, Deseret, Mexico, France, England and dozens of Indian nations all vying for control of this alternate history setting, the Shattered Frontier is far wilder than the historical Wild West ever was!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you prefer simple shoot-'em-ups or on-going campaigns, this is the western RPG you simply can&amp;rsquo;t afford to miss!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
