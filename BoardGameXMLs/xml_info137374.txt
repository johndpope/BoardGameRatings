							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elemons: STATE MODE Battle Game</name>
									
			<description>Elemons are creatures created by Scentons who have discovered the use of a Monolith embedded inside a mysterious planet. When they mixed Pure Elements with the Monolith they discovered strange developments &amp;ndash; but their experiment was sabotaged resulting in the scattering of the Elemons into space. The objective is to help the Scentons recapture the Elemons by battling it out against other players to discover the powers of the Elemons. Scentons need your help to capture the lost and scattered Elemons from the far corners of our universe! Discover the powers of their elemental cores before your opponents do...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elemons: STATE MODE Battle Game, a two-player game featuring creatures based on the elements of the periodic table, contains 49 cards consisting of two sets of 12 unique Elemon creatures plus 12 Temperature cards and a battle area rule card. The two sets have orange and purple card backs. The STATE MODE Battle Game is based on using the three states of the elements ie solid/liquid/gas. Gameplay focuses on adapting the rock/paper/scissors to the three states but with a twist. Each play can heat or cool each Elemon's state using the Temperature cards. The winner is the one who captures ten opposing Elemons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
