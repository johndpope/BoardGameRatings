			<description>Players take turns dropping marbles through the slots at the top of the tower, trying to create vertical, horizontal, or diagonal rows of 4 or more marbles of the same color. A nice addition to an old game is that each column has a screw at the bottom, so players can twist it in his turn; with each twist the bottom marble drops down, shifting the whole pattern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
