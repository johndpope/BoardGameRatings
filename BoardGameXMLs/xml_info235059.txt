							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aerie of the Cloud Giant Strategos</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aerie of the Cloud Giant Strategos is an OSRIC(tm) module designed for 6-10 adventurers of levels 9-14.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hot and smoky badlands of the King of the Fire Giants lies behind the party: his great hall, once a symbol of his power and authority, now only a memorial to his terrible defeat. Within his hold, the party found information leading them onward in their quest to find the fearsome mind behind the recent giant uprising.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their journey has been long and tiring, but the end of the task lies ahead. A gigantic spire of a mountain rises into the sky. Around the peak, an unusual cloud hangs, as if tethered to the stony expanse itself. Perhaps it is here, among the peaks and the clouds, that the source of the giants' evil may be found?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
