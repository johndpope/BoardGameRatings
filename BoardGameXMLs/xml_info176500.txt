			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My first mistake was to underestimate these dark, gibbering creatures. I underestimated their intelligence, their devotion, their singular drive toward a tribal goal that supersedes the needs, or lives, of individuals. My second mistake was pride in thinking I could recover from the first mistake without a lasting reminder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Renwalt the Nine-Fingered&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this short book, you'll find information on using Goblins as a playable race for either PCs or to make an ultimate and unexpected NPC to throw against your players! Information on Goblin names, including a name generator are also included, as well as three types of Goblin sub-races!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
