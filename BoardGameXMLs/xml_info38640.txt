			<description>As manager of a records company, the players try to contract worldwide famous artists. With these artists the players must produce records and bring them to the first place on Hit parade. The winner is the successful manager that produces at least four golden records of four different artists.&lt;br/&gt;On a board very similar to Monopoly, the very creative and beautiful E-guitar tokens of each player can run following dice numbers only on the external part. There, they can contract artists and promote the artists&amp;rsquo; career by means of interviews, tourneys, etc. Special Top oder flop places allow the players to bring their artists works to the Hit Parade, located on the internal section of the board. Here, the players try to increase the success and popularity of the artists under their management, aiming the Gold Record.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
