							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadows of Knightsfall: Genesis of Heroes (W&amp;W)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the lands of Dragatha, a frontier region steeped in history and conflict. Where factions struggle for power and dominance. Where the civilised races have either fallen or are struggling to retain control of the lands they claim as theirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genesis of Heroes is the first instalment of the Shadows of Knightsfall. An adventure path designed to introduce players to the lands of Dragatha. Here, in the war-weary settlement of Knightsfall, the local people are crying out for a band of brave adventurers to step forward and right the wrongs that haunt their lands. Will you have the courage to embark on such a perilous path?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for the Wyverns &amp;amp; Walocks roleplaying game, this module is designed to start a group on their careers as adventurers, as they embark on a multitude of quests that will eventually take them across these dangerous lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
