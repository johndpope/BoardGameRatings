			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; UNAVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has officially been announced by the publisher or developer, but has not yet been released and made available for purchase. Therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please do not submit images for it, nor add new releases. Press Kits are an exception and a maximum of six can be added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Kologeon you face off against a menegrie of otherwordly beasts and warriors. Set in a mystical world of demons, spirits, and ancient beings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2017, Citing difficulties in conveying the gameworld they desired with 2D limitations, ChillCrow completely revamped Kologeon as a 3D experience. With an entirely different art-style than originally promised. The current art work is unrecognizable as the project backers pledged toward. Even the player character looks completely different. Backers are not pleased about the changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
