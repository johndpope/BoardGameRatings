			<description>Forms is a two-players strategy game played on a square board. Initially half of the board is filled with black stones and another half of the board is filled with white stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player wins if all his stones are removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move alternatively by replacing any opponent's stone with an own stone taken from the board. After doing it a player removes all stones that aren't connected to the moved player's stone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
