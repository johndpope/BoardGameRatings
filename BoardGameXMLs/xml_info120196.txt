							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">So What&#039;s The Pirate Ship Like, Anyway?</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your PCs have set out on an ocean voyage in search of loot and glory. As they cruise the waves, they see a distant ship on the horizon and turn toward it. As they draw closer they can make out that the ship is a pirate vessel! At that point, they ask So what&amp;rsquo;s the pirate ship like, anyway?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So What&amp;rsquo;s The Pirate Ship Like, Anyway? answers this question by presenting tables to enable a busy time-pressured GM to quickly and easily generate the ship&amp;rsquo;s name, captain&amp;rsquo;s name, flag and figurehead as well as providing tables to enable the PCs to make Knowledge checks to learn more about the vessel&amp;mdash;including the ship itself as well as the captain, crew and their exploits. (You even get three stat blocks of typical pirates to hurl against your PCs!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are running a nautical-based adventure featuring pirates, So What&amp;rsquo;s The Pirate Ship Like, Anyway? is for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a Dual Format PDF. The downloadable ZIP file contains two versions, one optimised for printing and use on a normal computer and one optimised for useon a mobile device such as an iPad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
