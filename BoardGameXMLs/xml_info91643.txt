			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introducing a new home for all your Cthulhu &amp;amp; Lovecraftian digital content (or whatever else you want to put on it) - we've created some Cthulhu USB Memory Sticks (4 GB) that feature Great Cthulhu on one side and H.P. Lovecraft on the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cthulhu USB Memory Sticks come pre-loaded with a (compact) host of content from the likes of Miskatonic River Press, the H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society, Pelgrane Press, The Black Seal, Cubicle 7, Clint Krause and of course &quot;Olde Yoggie&quot; itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The USB sticks come in standard and Limited Editions, so if you're looking for something a little different to hold your electronic files, try this. After all, it's got Cthulhu on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cthulhu USB Memory Stick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Digital Home for your Lovecraftian World&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 4 gigabyte USB memory stick with a depiction of Great Cthulhu on one side and H.P. Lovecraft on the other. The USB connector is retractable by twisting the USB stick about its middle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximately 36mm square and weighing less than 20 grammes the Cthulhu memory stick easily attaches to your keyring, to keep it with you wherever you go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The USB stick comes pre-loaded with a variety of content worth over &amp;pound;18 in itself, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Proof of Life scenario by Keith Herber from Miskatonic River Press&lt;br/&gt;     Don't Walk in Winter Wood and Roanoke RPGs by Klint Krause&lt;br/&gt;     The Black Seal magazine #1 &amp;amp; #2&lt;br/&gt;     Tatters of the King soundtrack album + exclusive bonus track for this memory stick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus additional material such as handouts &amp;amp; songs from the H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society, Yog Radio post-interview chats with the likes of Charles Stross, Scott Glancy, S.T. Joshi and Ramsey Campbell, material from Cubicle 7's The Laundry RPG and samples from Pelgrane Press' Trail of Cthulhu line - and yet more - all occupying less than 10% of the memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you *can* keep Cthulhu in your pocket!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
