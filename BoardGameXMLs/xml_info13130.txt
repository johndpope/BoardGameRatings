							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Powerpuff Girls: Save the Day Game</name>
									
			<description>At the start of a round, each player draws a &amp;quot;Villain&amp;quot; card that depicts a number of villains  indicated by the area of the board that their pawn is on (2, 3 or 4). The starting player then deals out &amp;quot;Catch Them&amp;quot; cards equal to the number of villains a player faces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting player then takes the card from the top of the &amp;quot;Catch Them&amp;quot; deck and either keeps it (if it is one of the villains she needs) or passes it to the player on her left. If she keeps it, she must pass another card from her hand. The player on the left must now either keep or pass. In the mean time, the starting player is looking at the next card from the deck and deciding to keep or pass. This continues around the table, with all players keeping and passing cards until one player collects all the villains indicated on her &amp;quot;Villain&amp;quot; card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect all the villains she needs grabs the Bubbles bobblehead from the center of the board. The other players now try to grab one of the other Powerpuff Girls from the center. Since there is one less Powerpuff Girl than there are players, one player won't get anything (ala musical chairs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who ended up with nothing does not move. Players who grabbed a Powerpuff Girl move one space along the board. The player who grabbed Bubbles spins the spinner and moves either 3, 4 or 5 spaces. Rounds are repeated until a player reaches the Finish space and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
