							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fuwalda:  Starfighter (Second Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement gives enough detail to allow players to really get to know the spaceship. It is a great starship to be put at the disposal of a small group of players for their own use, and it will serve their characters well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The supplement includes large numbers of 3D illustrations and many alternate variants. In this second edition there is increased information on the &amp;lsquo;Dominator&amp;rsquo; variant. There is also a hex sheet and counters that can be used to start gaming with the Fuwalda straight away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extensive technical specifications are provided, using Spaceward Ho! rules, with background to the design decisions, to allow the spaceship to be easily integrated into an ongoing game, whatever system is being used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deck plans are included of the science scout variant, and there is an illustration showing the hull equipment and its uses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are descriptions, of weapons, hull systems, equipment, shields, armour and hardpoints. The variants mentioned also come with background information about where and how they are used.&lt;br/&gt; There is also a small adventure hook, and the Spaceship Ho! space combat rules are also included as a reference to the spaceship's statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a lot of content packed into this spaceship supplement, so let's take this bucket o' bolts for a spin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
