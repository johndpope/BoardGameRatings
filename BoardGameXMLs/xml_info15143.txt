			<description>A great educational game that teaches children about crime and crime prevention. It's a board game of skill and chance. It gives you some idea about the crimes you can help stop in everyday life. The police are the guardians of law and order, but much of their success depends on the co-operation from the public&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to solve as many incidents of crimes as possible. Points are accumulated for the various incidents and the player with the highest score wins when all incidents have been solved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
