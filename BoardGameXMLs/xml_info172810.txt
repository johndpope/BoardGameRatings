			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grecia is a Party Game designed for 4 to 8 players above 18, which involves some drinking and moderate physical contact - like hugs and kisses (but this is not a rule, is just something that often happens). Grecia it is not necessary an adult game, although by experience I have noted that when is the case of having only adults playing it, mostly end becoming one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player must choose one among the eight characters available for playing; they impersonate a Hero or Heroine who wants to become a God. In order to do that, the player must advance his pawn through the game board to the finish place, Mount Olympus. The player  simply throw the dice and moves across the game board, adding or subtracting modifiers as he can, using his Drachma coins to gather advantage over the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several things that a player can do in order to win some extra points for boosting his pawn and get first to the finish line. He can win extra Drachma coins by winning some challenge, for example. Besides that, that are some events that can punish the player who lost a challenge, or simply got unlucky on the dice toss. The punishment often involves some drinking or some nudity but, as always, that all can be avoided spending some Drachma coins. In the end, the &amp;quot;temperature&amp;quot; of the game tends to increase, but it will depends on the group of players because the limits are decided before by the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to ancient Greece! A fascinating place where gods vie followers as heroes struggle to get a seat on Mount Olympus. In this game, you will play a hero with a great ambition: Becoming a god. For this you should go through a tortuous path, full of intrigue, riddles and many wine-fueled orgies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to be the first to reach Mount Olympus. Players will have to go a long way to go facing obstacles, challenging mythological creatures and doing rituals and offerings to the gods to get to your destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
