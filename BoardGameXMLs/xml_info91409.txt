			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Universal Power is a fantasy game of chance in which 2 to 8 players compete for wealth and influence to become a world power while trying to avoid scandal.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The circular vinyl playing surface has four concentric rings. From the outermost to the innermost they are: Money, Influence, Scandal, and Power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players start in the Money ring. They roll and move and attempt to accumulate cash by encountering different spaces on the game board. (A healthy $500 million is required in the last step of the game, so players will spend a fair amount of time in this ring.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player feels that she has the resources to deal with the hazards of the next step in the game, she moves her pawn to the Scandal ring. At this point, chance dictates the various pitfalls the player will encounter in the spaces of this area. There are Penalty and Bonus spaces in this ring that require players to draw cards from the Penalty and Bonus decks. (These generally involve gaining or loosing money.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Power ring provides players with the possibility of recovering funds lost in the Scandal ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to finish their turn in the center of the Power ring with $500 cash on hand wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
