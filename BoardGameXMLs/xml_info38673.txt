			<description>&amp;quot;It&amp;rsquo;s fun to earn money for the food bank!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Coins Count! is a valuable first experience in earning money for a charity, making small purchases, and handling change. Players become familiar with pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, and dollar bills. The winner is the player who is the first to donate five dollars to the food bank. This rich instructional package also includes activities for use with an entire class: self-correcting lessons on making correct change and suggestions for interesting investigations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
