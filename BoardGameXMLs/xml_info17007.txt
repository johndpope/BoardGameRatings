			<description>A Golf game. &lt;br/&gt;A 9 holes board, 6 playing pieces, 5 different dice (one for each club type), Bunker cards, Trouble cards, banknotes and a set of papers to mark score. &lt;br/&gt;A hole course is divided into a grid of squares. The player taking his turn chooses what club (and then what die) he wants to use. He moves his marker according to the result of the die throw in direction of the hole, and so on until the piece lands on the hole square. He can move it vertically on the fairway, and horizontally or vertically on the green. He notes the number of strokes he used and the next player takes his turn. When everyone has played the hole, everbody starts the next hole, and so on until 18 holes are played (the 9 hole twice).&lt;br/&gt;If the piece lands in a bunker, a Bunker card is drawn and executed. If the piece lands in trees or rough, a Trouble card is drawn and executed. If the piece lands in water or out of bonds, the golfer plays again (the bad stroke is counted). &lt;br/&gt;Money is gained for different reasons (hole winner, par done...). The winner is the one who gains the more money. Alternative game makes the player who played the less strokes the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
