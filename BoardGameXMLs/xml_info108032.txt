			<description>Canada Quiz is a trivia that integrates tactical elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to be the first player (or team) to get the Canada flag by answering properly the questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has four playing track (one per player or team), leading to the flag in the centre of the board.  Each player (or team) has four markers.  The dice is rolled to bring a marker in play and or to move it along the track;  however, a marker can be moved only if the question asked is properly answered.  When a player answers without a &amp;quot;hint&amp;quot; (without asking which are the multiple choices listed on the card), that player can have an other question, so an other opportunity to move forward.  Under some conditions, the questions may also be used to perform a &amp;quot;power-play&amp;quot;, which could force an other player to move backward.  The first player to reach the flag and to answer properly the question wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Canada Quiz has 250 question cards, with four questions (with multiple answers) on each, for a total of 1000 questions.  The trivia game is based on early the history of Canada, mainly covering the historical period from the very beginnings up to the Confederation.  Canada Quiz has been published in English and in French.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
