							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Masters of the Universe: The Power Sword Conquest</name>
									
			<description>He Man with the help of his fellow heroes must reach the Power Sword first in order to prevent Skeletor from ruling Eternia. He Man must not fail. (Description from the rule book).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a team game similar to Snakes and Ladders, with the Good Guys vs the Bad Guys. As well as rolling the dice to move, there are board spaces that move characters around or allow the drawing of Mystery Cards that give special abilities. When a Good Guy and a Bad Guy end up on the same space combat occurs, with the winner moving forwards and the loser backwards. The winner is the first side to have all characters reach the final space - the Power Sword.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
