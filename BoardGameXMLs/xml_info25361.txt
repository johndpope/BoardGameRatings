			<description>Maselino is a game of speed. 40 Colorful bamboo discs are distributed by color to players who pretend they are mice looking for food. The players turn the tiles over until their pictures match. When they do, the players rob the piece of food from the plates in the middle. Only the quickest one can keep it. The winner is the one who gets the most pieces of food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Age: 4+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
