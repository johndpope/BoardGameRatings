			<description>A baseball board game featuring Can-Am league Quebec teams &amp;quot;Les Capitales&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Les Aigles&amp;quot;. Designed for baseball fans of all ages, the game reproduces the sequences of a baseball game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Les Capitales vs. Les Aigles, each player starts with the &amp;quot;Throws&amp;quot; deck from their respective team. The home team is chosen and each player shuffles their opponents &amp;quot;Offensive&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Defensive&amp;quot; deck and gives them 5 cards from it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, each player chooses a card from their &amp;quot;Throws&amp;quot; deck and place it face down in front of them. They reveal it at the same time and, depending on the combination, the result will either be a strike, ball or contact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the case of a contact, the offensive player plays one of their 5 offensive cards and the defensive player tries to counter it by playing one of their 5 defensive cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innings ends when both players played the defensive phase and got three outs. The game ends after 5 innings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
