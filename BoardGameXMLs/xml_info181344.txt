			<description>Your village once had bananas. Now it has none. Clearly, werewolves...er...banana thieves are to blame! And there's no way you're a banana thief. You're an honest, hardworking villager.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In We Didn't Playtest This Village at All!, each player is dealt one secret We Didn't Playtest style card, which has both an action and a note telling you whether you are a Nice Villager or a Banana Thief. The village gets one action to deal with the banana crisis, and they must vote on who gets to play their one card! That lone card will determine the fate of the villagers and banana thieves, possibly sending some of them to Banana Jail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lasts 1-10 minutes, depending on how long people talk before the vote.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
