			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Baron (2 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An iconic biplane dogfight for two-players, presented in a side-view perspective. The game allows players to control the direction and speed of their aircraft. The players select a time limit and then see who can shoot the other down more times before time expires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panzer Attack (2 to 4 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classic game of &amp;quot;tank&amp;quot; presented in a top-view perspective. There are six stationary barriers on the battlefield that you can aid you in getting into firing position without getting shot. A round ends when there is only one tank remaining on the battlefield. The winner is the player with the most kills after the end of a designated number of rounds, chosen by the players at the start of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
