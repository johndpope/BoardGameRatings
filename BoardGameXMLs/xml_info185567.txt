							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">First Empire</name>
									
			<description>You are in command of the first empire. Your people have been traveling from universe to universe for octillions of years on a quest for truth, which makes you more powerful.&lt;br/&gt;Each time, you must first create a foundation of wealth, then search the stars for neighboring centers of power. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve met your neighbors, you have to choose how you will engage them. Will you overcome them with raw military might? Will you include them in a alliance fueled by trade? Will you build a strong cultural core that makes them want to join you? The choice is yours.&lt;br/&gt;As you become more powerful, you can make scientific advancements to help conquer the increasingly-difficult challenges you will meet.&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, you will be in a position to start extracting truth from the universe. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve gained enough, it&amp;rsquo;s time to unfold the bonds of your current universe and start again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
