							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fantasy Class Preview: The Martialist Heroic</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He is the inheritor of a martial tradition born in the depths of Horrdren's Claw.  He fights with his hands and feet, his elbows and head.  He carries no blade and wears only the lightest armor.  He relies upon his agility and resolve to see him through.  He is no monk.  His abilities come not from a religion or the study of an ancient philosophy.  Rather, his abilities come from the bone of his knuckle, the sinews of his arms, the knowledge of the measure of his own body.  He is... the Martialist!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Martialist--an unarmed combatant grappling or striking with his fist or foot--is unlike any current class for 4E D&amp;amp;D!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This FREE preview provides everything needed to play a new 4E character class up through the Heroic Tier, including over 45 new powers and ten new feats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
