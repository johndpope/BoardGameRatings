							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lazy King</name>
									
			<description>An abstract strategy game with perfect information, designed to be playable with extremely common components.  Allows for quick play and various strategic maneuvers.  A sketch of a notation&lt;br/&gt;system is included to allow for correspondence play and record keeping.  Theoretically compatible with the ELO rating system for tournament or ladder play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Lazy King, players must move their King to a goal space on the opposite side of the board.  Sounds easy, right?  One hitch: the king is extremely lazy, and cannot move on his own.  So, other pieces must escort the king to safety.  But beware, the more pieces that escort the king, the slower they move.  Avoid the trap squares, mind the walls, and trick the opponent into a false sense of security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
