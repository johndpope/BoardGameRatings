							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mortal Kombat Arena</name>
									
			<description>A 2 player card game based on the world of Mortal Kombat. It simulates a tournament match between 2 characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses one character (from a choice of 20) at the beginning of the game. Each character starts with 20 hits. Each character has 2 special abilities and a unique list of fighting techniques.  Each technique has a name, a cost, and an effect. The cost is in the number and type of cards that must be played to produce the effect which will be either offensive or defensive in nature.  Offensive techniques, or attacks, will cause damage reducing the opposing character by 1 Hit. A defence will reduce the damage of an attack by an indicated amount.  Some techniques produce an Auto-Kill effect. If one is produced and your opponent is unable to reduce or negate it, you automatically win the match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck of 52 cards: 10 x Punch cards, 10 x Kick cards, 10 x Grab cards, 10 x Athletic cards, 6 x Focus cards, 4 x Link cards and 2 x Warrior cards.  Players start with a hand of 7 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns comprising 4 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  First Refresh Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Fill your hand to max hand size (or less if stunned)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Attack Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Play (discard) cards to make an attack. If you play a combo effect, you can make an extra attack. Your opponent may play cards to produce defensive effects, fully or &lt;br/&gt;partially negating one or more of your attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  Tactical Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   You may discard any unwanted cards in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.  Second Refresh Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Fill your hand to max hand size. (or less if stunned)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who reduces the opposing fighter to zero or less hits or gets an Auto Kill effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
