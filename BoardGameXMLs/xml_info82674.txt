			<description>Marbles! Balance Challenge is a skill-based action title where the player helps an Ant called Anthony save his colony via a series of physical tests. Wii Balance Board users can access Marbles! Balance Challenge's 100 specially-created stages where the players steer a ball using the shifting weight of their physical movements. This unique way to control the game offers a new experience and combines fun and physical exercise. Players can also use gentle movements of the Wii Remote, with steering the ball through 200 different stages in a quest to locate the mythical &amp;quot;Golden Sunflower Seed.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the player progresses the level designs grow ever more complex as they introduce houses, snow-capped mountains, deserts, watery settings and even a space station. In addition to rolling through the colourful stages, the player must also collect parts needed to extend and repair the roads they traverse, which,when assembled, give access to the game?s final stage. Similarly, other items of ephemera can be collected and used to add new elements within the extensive edit mode.&lt;br/&gt; Marbles! Balance Challenge includes tough multi-player modes where up to four players battle it out in a race to the finish, and an edit mode that allows users to create their own stages and share them among friends via the Nintendo Wii Connect24 service. The competitive element of the game can also be explored globally, with online leaderboards detailing the best scores for all to see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
