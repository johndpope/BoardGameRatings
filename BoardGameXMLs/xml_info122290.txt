			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a new collectible RPG in a Golden Age Superheroes vein: to play, you just need any set of the playbooks, with at least one per player. Each playbook gives you a pre-made character and all the rules needed to play them or to run the game for others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exclusive story: the Secret Origin of... The Haste!&lt;br/&gt;Fineas Fine was an infamous cat-burglar, until the day he picked the wrong house to rob! The owner, a powerful sorcerer, cursed him to live his life 10 times faster than an ordinary human: only a special elixir can reverse his ever progressing aging! Not knowing how much time he has left on Earth, Fineas reformed, using his skills to fight crime rather than cause it! But how fast do you have to run to escape your own past?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
