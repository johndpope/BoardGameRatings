			<description>Author summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Today, now, there are those who only contain the essential nature of wickedness, or of goodness. Some have been fighting for their entire existence, some are newly awakened, and some have yet to realize their true nature. But something new is happening. This is an inflection point, an opportunity to make a real and permanent victory in the long struggle, a chance to finally say 'yes, this world is ours, forever more.'&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fate's Fickle Winds is a two-player fiction game of the struggle between Goodness and Wickedness. One player takes on a singular champion of the Good, while the other builds the Blight of the Wicked. During play, you call upon the Winds of Magic to power your agenda, and hopefully gain control over the Prophecy that foretells the end of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8 page rulebook, 18 pages total including print-and-play cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
