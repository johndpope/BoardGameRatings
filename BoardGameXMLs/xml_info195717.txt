							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ZAMB! Biomutant Extermination</name>
									
			<description>Play as two special operatives and fight your way through a mad scientist's secret asteroid base whilst defending yourself against his army of evil mutants. The amazing brawler Cye is trained in melee combat and uses powerful gadgets of mass destruction; or out-smart the enemy with the master tactician Chrome, an agent of ranged warfare and master of AI turret defence systems. &lt;br/&gt; Develop the skills of your Agent, increase their power and overcome 24 uniquely challenging levels which get harder as you progress. Will you use a &amp;ldquo;punch now, ask questions later&amp;rdquo; approach? Or are you a tactical genius that tricks the enemy into bottle necks, melting them down with a devastating turret barrage? &lt;br/&gt; Play solo, or draft in a loyal friend for epic Co-op action. Use everything at your disposal in order to eliminate the mutant army and put a stop to their evil before it spreads across the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
