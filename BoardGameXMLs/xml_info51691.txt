							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bliss Stage: Interim Stage</name>
									
			<description>The Interim Stage is an update to the initial release of Bliss Stage: ignition Stage. It is available only as a PDF. The next release will be the Acceleration Stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The changes are listed below per the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's no rules difference between the two texts. (ignition and interim)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be slight rules clarifications in the revised text, as well as a few extra options. The clarifications are:&lt;br/&gt;1) On a relationship breaking, add double the Intimacy score to Bliss, not triple (the book right now sometimes says one, sometimes says the other).&lt;br/&gt;2) Starting Bliss = pilot age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By and large, I'm not expecting any serious rules changes. A lot of rewriting, but no serious rules changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next release (Acceleration Stage) will include new Rules modules: One for online play, and one for tactical play, both of which are basically total rewrites of the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
