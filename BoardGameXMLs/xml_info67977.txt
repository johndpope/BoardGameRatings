							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Politico: The Fall of Caesar</name>
									
			<description>Politico: The Fall of Caesar is the 7th game in Small Box Games' Pure Card Line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Politico: The Fall of Caesar, players are Senators who have grown tired of Caesar, and have aspirations of overthrowing the leader of Rome and taking the reigns.  Little did you know that you weren&amp;rsquo;t the only Senator with such lofty goals, as there are other Senators with a similar agenda.  Players secretly plot to gain the most supporters within the city of Rome to help bring their plan to fruition, and to bring about the fall of Caesar, or at the very least, posture themselves in a position of greater power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place over a series of rounds.  During each round, a new Supporter is revealed and players secretly choose what Tactic they will choose for the round, either to Persuade Supporters of the current type, or to Manipulate the game to their favor.  The game ends immediately if any player manages to have 13 or more Supporters, with at least 1 supporter of each type.  Otherwise, the game ends after the round when the last Supporter card is revealed, and players are awarded points for the Supporters they have left at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Politico: The Fall of Caesar is not an expansion for Politico.  It is a stand alone game that borrows mechanics from the original game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
