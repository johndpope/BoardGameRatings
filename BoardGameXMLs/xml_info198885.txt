			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the game actually begins, the players must decide how many acts they would like to play based on how long they want the game to go. The standard game is three acts long and can run from two to three hours. However, players can choose fewer or more acts depending on their time requirements and focus level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each act should contain three scenes, Once the players have decided how many acts the game will have, the players take turns laying scene and modifier cards until every scene of the play is laid out for the players to see. Scenes should be laid in a number of rows equal to the number of acts in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenes each have a time limit of ten minutes, though the players can vote to extend this limit if they are entertained by a scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
