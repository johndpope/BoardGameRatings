			<description>Eco Planet is a board game aimed at environment preservation awareness. The players have a race to see who gets to Eco Planet first, which is an ecologically tolerable place. In order to get there, the players must know the causes, effects, consequences and solutions for the planet&amp;rsquo;s degradation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five theme groups: air, water, soil, global warming and environmental awareness. When a player gets the correct answers to the questions asked about the theme he/she is on, he/she moves forward on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eco Planet may be distributed to employees, clients, suppliers, partners and to the community for the promotion of the planet preservation idea. This game can and must be taken home and played with the whole family and with friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.games4b.com/ecoplanet.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.games4b.com/ecoplanet.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
