			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Mario Odyssey is a 3D platform game, originally released for the Nintendo Switch. The player visits various worlds (stages), and the goal is to locate and pick up &amp;quot;Power Moons&amp;quot;, some of these simply lying around in hard-to-reach places, some of them being hidden, and yet others need special tricks to reveal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, Mario can fling his cap onto other enemies/allies in the game, becoming them. Some of these enemies/allies have special abilities that Mario thus can mimic, such as underwater breathing, resisting heat, very high jumps, etc. The player must experience with the various possibilities on each stage in order to find the hidden moons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to Super Mario 64, the stages are not on a timer, and with the exception of some moons on each stage that cannot be found until the player has reached Bowser's castle and defeated him first, all moons can be found at all times, sandbox-style game. Hence the game relies on exploration and experimenting. Unlike Super Mario 64, but similar to other Super Mario games, there is no central hub world; instead there is just a map on which to point where to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
