			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spanish Fury system now has modules for Sieges, Field Battles, and Naval Engagements. The Campaign system is just around the corner. One more element was needed  to finish the project, and that&amp;rsquo;s Actions! These rules cover conflicts involving at most 2500 men, at the least about 300. All types of low-level fighting are covered; minor battles, ambushes, raids, prison-breaks, cattle rustling and the storming of forts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic unit of the game is the squadron, which is composed of somewhere between 25-50 men. These are often the size of weak companies, but we use the term company to cover the next administrative level, composed of several squadrons, somewhere between 150-250 men. Each company has a Captain, who has great influence on his men. The overall commander of a side is called a Colonel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve tried to portray just about every troop type in Europe in these rules, from Irish Kern to Spanish Musketeers. One of our favorite elements of this game is its expandability and &amp;quot;accessable chrome&amp;quot;. Anyone can add their favorite forgotten troop type, from Cimaroon to Lap scouts riding Reindeer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
