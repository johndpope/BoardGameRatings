			<description>WILDFIRE is a two move role-playing game that acquaints players with the problems associated with the spread of nuclear weapons and some of the solutions to these problems. The basic WILDFIRE game is designed to be played either in two 45-minute sessions of one move each or in a single 90-minute session with a short break between moves. A short introductory exercise is designed to be worked through in advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has three separate parts- an introductory exercise and two &amp;quot;moves&amp;quot;. The introductory exercise covers the fundamentals of the problem and some basic facts (like who has nuclear arsenals today) and gets players thinking about the overall issue. The first move is a crisis control exercise in which players take on the roles of top officials in five nations that are wrestling with a future nuclear crisis involving India and Pakistan. The second and final move is a post-crisis negotiation exercise in which players seek a long-term solution to the conflict between India and Pakistan,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
