			<description>Subtitle: A Storytelling Adventure Game for 2 or more players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Stakes is a new storytelling system by Ganesha Games. With High Stakes, you can create characters in minutes and start telling stories and living their adventures with almost no preparation. You'll need just a bunch of six-sided dice, pen and paper, and plenty of imagination. Watch out for the High Stakes Hackbook coming from Ganesha Games and other publishers later in 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And text in the free, light version:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the free, light version (without any art or background  material) of High Stakes. It contains the full system, allowing you try the rules in a setting of your own devising. These rules are constantly updated. Make sure you download the latest version. If you like it, you may purchase one of the Hackbooks produced for High Stakes. The Hackbooks reprint the core rules (so you have to carry around only one book or file) and add plenty of ready-made settings, story hooks, interesting characters, genre tropes, and ideas to create your stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a living rulebook and will be updated from time to time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
