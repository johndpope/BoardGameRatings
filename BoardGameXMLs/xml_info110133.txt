			<description>from the back cover&lt;br/&gt;Join intrepid cartoon gamers Phil and Dixie as they explore the bizarre world of fantasy gaming! From computers to roleplaying to collectable cards, nothing is sacred as our heroes give an overview of their favorite hobby with all the reverance and tact it deserves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the early 1990s, the world of gaming was changed forever by the invention of the first Collectable Card Game: Magic the Gathering. Award-winning cartoonist Phil Foglio became involved with Magic in its early days and watched its evolution from basement industry to globe-spanning behemoth, maintaining a snide commentary every step of the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collection contains all the What's New cartoon strips from The Duelist magazine, focusing on Magic the Gathering and other trading-card games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is a brand-new 8-page adventure, plus a few extra goodies for the rabid completist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
