			<description>In 2012 the Institute of National Remembrance published a game called &amp;ldquo;ZnajZnak&amp;rdquo;. The game is the history of Poland told with 133 symbols. Playing &amp;ldquo;ZnajZank&amp;rdquo; makes it unbelievably easy to remember the most important figures, dates, places and objects in Polish modern history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ZnajZnak - Sport is an educational game for 2 to 8 players about sport in Poland (1918-1945). The 133 symbols placed on the game cards were carefully selected to show best sportsmen, club badges, world records and many more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ZnajZnak - Sport includes 63 cards on each of which 12 different symbols have been placed. Every two cards have a common symbol. Your job is to find and name it as fast as you can. If you don&amp;rsquo;t recognize your symbol flip your card and read the information on the other side. Then place a new card on the back of your deck and go on with the game. If you manage to name your symbol you should give your card to the player on the left. The first player to get rid of all his cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
