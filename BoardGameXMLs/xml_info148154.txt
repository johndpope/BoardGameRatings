			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mine Rail Extension is a full-color, 48 x 30 inch, floor plan of a Mine Rail, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh you work for him?&amp;rdquo; [Shoots mining supervisor dead center of the head. A look of shock is on his face as he falls forward dead.] &amp;ldquo;I suggest you work for me unless you wanna end up like him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product is a Mine Rail Extension designed to connect the Mine Processing Plant and Mine Shaft products. The map is entered from the western edge of the map on a rocky plateau. The mine rail is in the center of the map with it crossing a small rocky area in the north. The mountainside covers the eastern edge of the map completely. The southwest corner of the map has more mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product can be used in any time period after the Industrial Revolution. The techniques used suggest 1900s or later, but it would certainly be possible for this facility to exist in a steampunk or higher tech late 1800s era setting. This map can be used in modern settings or in lower technology worlds in near or far future Sci-Fi settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventures with the overall mine complex (Mine Processing Plant, Mine Shaft, and Mine Rail Extension) can start with a group of bandits who decide to take over the mines. They capture the miners and tie them up or force them at gunpoint to continue mining and processing the ore. One of the miners escapes and reaches the nearby mining apartment town and requests help. The group forms a posse to fight off the bandits and rides up to the mountains. The bandits ride the rails on mine cars using them as cover and fire their guns at the group. The group is very exposed in the open to gunfire and needs to ride their horses to cover or a worse possibility leap off their horses and use them as cover. A clever group might run and grab their own mine cars to chase the bandits into the mine, having a gunfight while they ride the mine cars to its depths. The bandits jump off the mine car at the end of the rails and then the chase continues through mine tunnels as the bandits move from cover to cover as the group follows them. The chase ends when the group defeats the bandits by capturing or killing them and then they can free the captured miners. When they get back to the mining town, they are rewarded with processed ore or a lower valued cash reward as payment for their services from the miners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
