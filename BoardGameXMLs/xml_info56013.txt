			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your long journey is coming to an end at least for one night. You approach the woodland town of Blackbrook, a small village you've passed through before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Walking along the trail leading into the center of Blackbrook, you can feel the sense of doom that shrouds this village and its people. The villagers seem weak and underfed, and they stare distantly into nothingness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You hear a commotion coming from the center of the village at the small community well. Several villagers surround a young woman in robes who frantically pleads, &amp;quot;You must listen to me! It is the well water that pollutes this village, and all of you must stop drinking from it! Please listen to me!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The villagers pressing in around her look tired, ill, and desperate. They're obviously no warriors and their pitchforks, woodsman's axes, and broomsticks make poor weapons. But they just as clearly mean to do the young woman bodily harm if she remains standing between them and the well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The woman looks hopefully at you as you approach, worry etched in the lines of her face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I've tried to tell them! The well water is poisoned, corrupted by some terrible evil! But they won't listen to me ... please help us!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
