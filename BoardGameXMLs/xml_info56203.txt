			<description>Doodaddy is a family dice game, similar to 10,000,  where each player collects points during his/her turn, which he/she may add to his total, or not, depending on how aggressively or cautiously he/she plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As each player rolls during his/her turn, the player is looking to score points, in the form of sets.  If a roll scores any points, he may set aside any number of sets that he wants to claim points from, and either: 1) roll all remaining dice, hoping to score additional Sets., 2) roll all six dice again if all six dice have scored points, or 3) calculate the points and move on.  A player has to start with 500 points to get on the table.  If a roll scores nothing, the turn is forfeited, and it&amp;rsquo;s the next players turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;a single 1 : 100&lt;br/&gt;a single 5 : 50&lt;br/&gt;triple of 1's : 1000&lt;br/&gt;triple of 2's : 200&lt;br/&gt;triple of 3's : 300&lt;br/&gt;triple of 4's : 400&lt;br/&gt;triple of 5's : 500&lt;br/&gt;triple of 6's : 600&lt;br/&gt;six-of-a-kind : Instant winner&lt;br/&gt;three pair (DOODADDY) : 1,500&lt;br/&gt;Straight of 6 : 1,500&lt;br/&gt;Players need to reach 10,000 points to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
