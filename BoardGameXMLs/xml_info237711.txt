							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Zombie Encounters for the Zombie Apocalypse</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a zombie apocalypse, players are undoubtedly going to come across different zombies. Some of these may be in large, dangerous groups, but these can become boring. Here are 100 different encounters for the zombie apocalypse that are intended to be rather more interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of these are for solitary zombies, but some are for groups. Many may appear by surprise or appear to be trapped or too damaged to be dangerous. Players foolish enough to believe that a trapped or damaged zombie is not a threat may come to rue their overconfidence. Some of the encounters may seem rather bizarre, the result of odd behaviour during the apocalypse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forklift - A zombie has been impaled on one of the tines of a forklift truck. The tines have been raised high up and, if the forklift is in a warehouse, the zombie may not be immediately obvious. The tine only penetrates the chest, so the zombie isn't dead. It may be able to slide off the tine given enough motivation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover and one an d a bit pages the front matter and introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
