			<description>Beat This Book! is an exciting solo player game in a spiral-bound book format, where you (the player) take on a series of clever casino-style challenges using a deck of standard playing cards. To win the game, you MUST get to the last page in the book before running out of cards. But it won't be easy...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The challenges are woven into a continuous narrative that propels you forward in the story. You have been sent an urgent Royal Invitation from The King and Queen of Monaco -- and must set sail immediately to the Grand Hotel Victoria &amp;amp; Casino. But why??&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beat This Book! encompasses the elements that players most enjoy at the gaming tables: The thrill of the hard fought win, the luck of the draw, the crucial decision making, the push to keep going even in the face of diminishing odds, the flip of the cards, and of course the downright fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is recommended for players aged 10 and up. The ability to read and handle a deck of cards is all that&amp;rsquo;s needed to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
