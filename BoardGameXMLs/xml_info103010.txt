							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Knights of the Desert</name>
									
			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the year 1096, knights in shining armor set out on the First Crusade, marching across Asia Minor to reach the Holy City of Jerusalem and free it from the invading Turks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nearly a millennium later, in 1941, a similar scenario would be played out. This time, Crusader tanks of Great Britain rolled across the broiling sands of North Africa to repel invaders of a different sort--the armored forces of Nazi Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is your crusade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In March 1941, Hitler sent Field Marshal Rommel to North Africa. His task: to push his Panzer divisions all the way to Alexandria, crushing the defending British troops along the way and taking the Suez Canal and the precious oilfields that lay beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knight of the Desert is the faithful re-creation of this famous North African campaign of World War II. Starting in March 1941, it goes to February 1943 in twelve turns, each representing two months. Containing division/regiment-sized units of infantry, motorized infantry and tanks, this game introduces an innovative system of play: During the logistics phase, the players must first assign supply and re-supply priority for each unit--before moving it. The operations phase allows multiple movements per turn by one player while permitting the opponent to make reaction and limited reaction moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players' goals are the same: a sweeping movement of troops across the northern coast of Africa, pushing the enemy as far back as possible and capturing key towns such as Benghazi and Tobruk. The only difference is direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the German commander, your ultimate target is eastward to Alexandria. Your campaign is hindered by shortages of supplies while the British have essentially unlimited supplies. However, you do have offsetting tactical advantages: Your Panzer units can move faster than the British and your crack German troops have higher morale ratings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the British commander, you struggle westward to sweep Rommel all the way back to El Agheila and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knights of the Desert also provides for solitaire play in which the computer ably directs the British forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scrolling Hi-Res graphics gives you full-color battlefields. Terrain includes key towns, rough areas, mountains, and impassable sand. Each division/regiment-sized armor, infantry and mechanized infantry unit is rated for current strength, maximum obtainable strength and morale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Tactical Design Group&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
