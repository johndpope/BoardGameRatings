			<description>Rules for low level actions in the Russian civil war using 15mm figures.&lt;br/&gt;This set of rules is intended to cover battles in the Russian Civil War at the lower end of the scale, - games covering a regiment or two aside (5 -6 battalions or cavalry regiments) plus the odd assorted Armoured Car or artillery piece. They are supposed to capture the confusion, madness and unique nature of the Russian Civil War through embedding this in the basic mechanisms rather than just adding chrome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules are written for 15mm figures, and are intended to be played on a 6&amp;rsquo; x 4&amp;rsquo; table, although we play on a 12&amp;rsquo; x 5&amp;rsquo; usually. So first off you&amp;rsquo;ll need two armies and a table. Or a floor.&lt;br/&gt;And some scenery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
