							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goppa: The Game That Moves In Leaps &amp; Bounds</name>
									
			<description>A 2-player, 3-dimensional variation on Chinese Chess.  Players take turns making Chinese Chess style moves and leaps, but over a set of square grids that are staggered at different levels.  The board consists of 6 tiles, each having 16 spaces arranged in a 4x4 square.  The tiles are staggered in 3 different heights, and 3d moves are permitted between the tiles.  Players make extended Chinese checker jumps with their 16 marbles, trying to maneuver them in to opposing setup region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Box (bad grammar authentically transcribed):&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;If you enjoy the strategy of Chinese Checkers, the challenge of Backgammon you're sure to have a blast playing Goppa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the Game.  To be the first player to move all 16 of your marbles from your starting positions, across to the starting positions of your opponents marbles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Helpful Hints.  There are 8 main strategic points on the game board.  These 8 points allow you to slow your opponent from making Goppa's (long jumps) from one side of the board all the way to the other side of the game board in one turn.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
