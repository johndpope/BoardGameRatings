			<description>&amp;quot;THE GREEN GAME&amp;quot; is an educating and universal game of skill, strategy and chance designed for people young and old to have fun whilst gaining valuable knowledge of the fragile world we live in.  The rules of the GREEN GAME are simple to follow and allow children of 8 years and over to play alongside adults.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to circulate the board answering questions, avoiding the pitfalls and collecting one of the subject cards of each topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 500 questions with 6 questions on each card (3,000 in total).  The questions are in six different categories - Air, Water, Earth, Plants, Man Made, Pot Luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take it in turns to move and answer questions related to the subject category on which their piece lands.  A player's turn continues for as long as he/she is able to successfully answer questions.  A subject card is won when the question is correctly answered on a space that also contains a &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; symbol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Certain spaces also require you to draw either an Evolution, Disaster, Lifeline or Pass card, and follow the instructions on it.  These normally result in bonuses or penalties being applied to the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to collect six different subject cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is endorsed by Survival for Tribal Peoples. Any proceeds from the game are used to aid tribal peoples throughout the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
