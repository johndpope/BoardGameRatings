			<description>Panzertales: World Tank Division II (WTD II) is the sequel to WTD I.  Published in Japan and written in Japanese, it is an area movement wargame focused on armored combat in 1944-45.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of three maps (two sheets printed front and back), cardboard counters, a rulebook and four unpainted PVC tanks (Tiger II, Panther, Hetzer and StuG IIIG).  The maps depict the Normandy beaches, Remagen and Budapest.  Counters depict armored vehicles for Germany, U.K., U.S.A., and U.S.S.R.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a light wargame centered around the abstract depiction of armored combat in Europe late in the war.  Obviously the intent of the game designers is for the players to equip themselves with World Tank Museum forces to use on the maps; the first four vehicles (all German) are a means to jump-start these forces.  As these are generally insufficient, the included cardboard counters, which carry the attack strength, defense strength, movement value, etc., for the forces, can be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WTD II is a successor to WTD I, but is not exactly an expansion.  Some minor changes to the forces have been made- e.g., point values for the units (which are used to build armies in design-your-own scenarios) have been adjusted.  However, several new factors are introduced, such as the inclusion of infantry, anti-tank guns, armored personnel carriers, and rules for indirect fire/air strikes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
