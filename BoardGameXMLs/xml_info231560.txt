							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paces Roleplaying Game System</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paces is the fantasy RPG you have been playing your whole life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A d6 system built from the ground up, Paces is simple and intuitive with plenty of tools to customize it into exactly the roleplaying game you want to play. Included with the basic rules are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple Character Creation:  Build any kind of character you can imagine. Creating a character for Paces takes five minutes, and you can create anything with the classless creation system or choose from a prebuilt character archetype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Archetypes:  Thirteen prebuilt characters from warriors and sorcerers to slime shepherds and octopus knights!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Companion Characters:  It's dangerous to go alone, and when you're playing in a small group of three or fewer players, sometimes the best thing for the whole group is to play more characters. Paces makes this aspect of play not only easy and intuitive, but immersive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skill System:  A unique skill system which allows characters to be built around whatever concept the player can imagine and be further customized to the style of play and level of group involvement each player prefers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unique Magic System:  Five distinct magical disciplines with plenty of customization options to make your character stand out, even as a part of a larger world of magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rich Fantasy Setting:  With various island nations, five religions, and an expansive list of NPC's as well as a guide to peopling every city town and village with your own unique NPC's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Open License:  Paces is released under a Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 public license. You are free to copy, share, and build upon this game any way you like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
