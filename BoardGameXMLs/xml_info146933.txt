			<description>The last remnants of Humanity fight a desperate resistance against an Alien invasion that has taken over Earth.  A board game for 2-7 players pits a group of up to 6 marines against an enemy player who controls the Aliens.  Featuring mission based play, a modular board, a campaign based skill and equipment system, and variable enemy selection that gives a new game experience every time you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players alternate turns between the Marines and the Alien commander.  During a Marines turn they choose between moving, firing weapons, using skills, activating Psionic or Tech powers, and destroying nearby enemy spawn locations.  In between each marines players turn the Alien Commander activates a number of his Aliens based upon they type of Spawn Points he purchased at the start of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aliens vary from the melee centric but hard hitting powerhouses of the Pharid, to the robotic utilitarian legions, and finally Alien commandos sent in to personally deal with the Marine resistance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marine player pick from a variety of 10 total Marine Classifications ranging from the Short range centric Assault Marine and Long range specialist the Sniper to the Drone controlling Engineer and the offensive Assault Psion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each mission the Marines pull from a requisition deck to outfit themselves with new equipment and draw from skill decks to increase the effectiveness of their Marines.  These skills and new toys have a cost, they increase the Rank value of the overall Marine and contribute to the pool of Rank Points that the Alien Commander uses to purchase Alien Spawn Points to use against the Marine on their next mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
