			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking advice from a floating banana might not be the best choice for this protagonist on pills. You aren't told much of a backstory, but when you jump in a banana leads you to kill someone and either a lot of his friends don't take kindly to the action or you had a prior beef with them. Either way you have to kill your way through the game. Handily you the pills you were forced to take allow you to slow your perception of time. The game leads to an ending you won't be expecting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
