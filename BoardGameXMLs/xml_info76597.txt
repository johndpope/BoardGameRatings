							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cruel Empire of Tsan Chan</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future History of the Cruel Empire of Tsan Chan&lt;br/&gt;Being an account of the year Five Thousand and the creation of Empire&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That cult would never die till the stars came right again, and the secret priests would take great Cthulhu from His tomb to revive His subjects and resume His rule of earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the citizens of the Tsan Chan Empire, the facts of the events concerning the rise of the Great Old Ones are speculation. Life, fraught and terrifying, is best lived without pondering those momentous days hundreds or thousands of years ago. The Chanese have no reliable records of the times and the Kuen-Yuin who lived in that era provide no answers. The simple truth of their life is that to leave the boundaries of the Interdiction is to step into a world teeming with warfare, madness and the desires of black gods. Tsan Chan is the only place humans exist and it is cruel. It must be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the scholars of the Empire, the Kuen-Yuin, the Ophidians, matters are rather clearer, although they too suffer frustration concerning the specifics. They were not there; they were hidden in the earth, or cowering in monasteries of Leng, praying to Gods that were abandoning them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Cthulhu rose up again, it was the work of humans, some cult, some ancient priesthood making good on its teachings and prophecies. Throughout human history, the inevitability of this release was foretold but the consequences were debated. Some feared it meant destruction, an abattoir-era where the human race and many others were prey and nourishment. Other, were uncertain, believing the Lord of R&amp;rsquo;lyeh would teach men to laugh and revel and kill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those in the second camp were the most correct. Cthulhu did rise up again free from his slumber, free to make good on his antique dreams. But his ambitions were not a destroyer nor even, rightly, a conqueror. No, Cthulhu rose as an evangelist, high priest of unknowable, fabulously dangerous gods. And the shock of his presence, the power of his ministry, is today known as the Dream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Old One arose, humanity was psychically damaged beyond repair. Previously, only the most &amp;lsquo;sensitive&amp;rsquo; of souls could perceive the movement and desires of Cthulhu. Unfettered, free to preach, the world itself went insane. No one knows how long it took but soon, terribly soon, after Cthulhu&amp;rsquo;s release, humanity had fallen. Infected by the alien morality of the High Priest, humans became shrieking things, immoral and barbaric, completely without scruple or the faintest notion of consequence. Society and culture fell apart until humanity simply screamed the name of its new King and converted to a blind and idiot religion they could barely comprehend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Except for a small plateau in China, where precautions had been taken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
