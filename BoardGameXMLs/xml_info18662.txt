			<description>Bonus game included in Dragon Magazine #271.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through Research, Development, and Fighting, you must improve your creature until he has a 6 or more in each of his body areas - 2 arms, 2 legs, heart and head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment: Pencil and Paper, six 6-sided dice, at least five 8-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the intro paragraph:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Colossus, each player is a mad scientist building some sort of creature.  Perhaps it's a stone golem, perhaps it's a wicker man, perhaps it's a plain old laser-shootin' butt-kickin' giant robot.  Whatever the details, you're building them, and you like to make them fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
