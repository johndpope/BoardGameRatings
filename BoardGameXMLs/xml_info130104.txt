			<description>Duel is a combat game played with a standard deck of 52-cards including jokers, inspired by the game Magic: The Gathering. The goal of the game is to reduce the opponents life to zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two players duel against each other using spells drawn from a common library. Face cards (including aces) are creatures, while number cards may be played as lands or spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lands are used to pay the cost of summoning creatures and casting spells. Creatures may attack opposing creatures or the opposing player, which is the primary method of reducing life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
