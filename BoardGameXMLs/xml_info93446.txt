							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Outburst Junior: Travel Edition</name>
									
			<description>The pocket-sized Outburst Junior Travel Edition offers a convenient way to take fun of Outburst Junior with you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just as in the original Outburst Junior! games, players (as individuals or in teams) have 60 seconds to yell out answers in various familiar categories. Teams may shout out as many answers as possible, but only the ten answers that appear on the Topic Card (as viewed through a special view-finder) will score points. Topic cards include such categories as &amp;quot;Things You Take on a Camping Trip,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Kinds of Boats,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Ways You Know You're Getting Sick.&amp;quot; Those who get the most correct answers and earn the most points will triumph!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
