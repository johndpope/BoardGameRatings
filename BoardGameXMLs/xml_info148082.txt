							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Desert Crash Site</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 48 x 30 inch Floor Plan of a Desert Crash Site, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play. The map suits Modern rpg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;All we gotta do is survive, Rescuers will look for us and they will find us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product is a single map of a propeller aircraft having crashed into a savannah. The survivors have turned the crash site into a makeshift camp. The terrain includes sandy dunes enveloping rocky outcroppings, and brush and trees growing from the surface where cracks in the land allow some access to subsurface water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product is intended for use in modern games (propeller aircraft originated in the early twentieth century and are still used for commercial and transport aircraft today). It can also be used in horror or post apocalyptic games. Perhaps the group crashes and finds something alien or supernatural at the crash site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escape from the Desert: The group was on the plane when a freak sandstorm blew them off course and caused the pilot to crash into the desert. The survivors use the various plane pieces and supplies left and make a camp waiting for rescue. However, the sandstorm blew them well off course and would be rescuers are looking for them in the wrong place along their intended route.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of desert nomads finds them after a few days and offers to help them to a nearby oasis. It is up to the group to decide to go with them or not. The desert nomads appear friendly, but they will cut the foreigner&amp;rsquo;s throats and rob them given half the chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group needs to figure out a way to either escape the desert or find the rescue teams looking for them. This may require them to explore the surroundings (this could lead them to anything surrounding the area such as the nomad&amp;rsquo;s main camp, an oasis, a mirage, or even a pyramid or sphinx if the Game Master wants to add an adventure site to explore).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps there are enough pieces of the plane left to attempt to stitch together a smaller plane if they can get enough materials to try and patch it together for one last flight towards civilization&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
