			<description>Drawing from Michael Waitsman's Proteus rather than from Nomic-related card games, M&amp;aacute;s-Menos is a trick-taking game for two players and a 32-card deck constructed around two variable winning conditions: one applied to single tricks and another applied to the whole game. These conditions will change during play as tricks are won by cards of different suits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players start out with a hand of 16 cards - after discarding three each they must determine the winning conditions that will apply from the first trick on. After that tricks are played; the suit of the winning card of each trick will switch one of the two currently valid conditions - red cards determine if highest or lowest wins a trick, black cards determine if more or less tricks win a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
