							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slim to None: The Campaign Along the Slim River, January 1942</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Heedless of danger and of their isolation they had shattered the division: they had captured the Slim Bridge by their reckless and gallant determination.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--Lt. Colonel Arthur Anderson, 155th Battery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slim to None is a war game simulation of the battle along the Slim River in northern Malaya.  In January 1942, the 11th Indian Division was sent north to contest the Imperial Japanese Army's advance from their landing beaches on the Kra Isthmus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the Japanese 5th Infantry Division, supported by the 4th Armored Regiment struck first in the early morning hours of January 7th at the Cluny Rubber Plantation and at the town of Trolak, just north of the Slim River. The Allied forces were caught unprepared by the sudden Japanese combined arms offensive, with units scattered along 19 miles of road north of the Slim River, and with little to no weaponry by which to oppose the Japanese armor. Worse still, the Japanese infiltration tactics through jungle terrain the Allied commanders believed to be impenetrable, led to the Allied battalions being repeatedly outflanked and forced to retreat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Japanese success here would eventually take them all the way to Singapore. Can you do better?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME COMPONENTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     7 page rules booklet&lt;br/&gt;     One 11&amp;quot; by 17&amp;quot; map&lt;br/&gt;     165 single-sided, un-mounted counters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played solitaire as well as with an opponent. The game is part of the Blood and Steel series of games from High Flying Dice Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
