							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Starfleet Wars: Book 2</name>
									
			<description>Since the initial inception of this &amp;quot;Space Battles System&amp;quot; was introduced back in 1978, the 'boys' had been 'busy'...very busy, it would appear. They managed to channel their energy into producing this 'add-on' Booklet to cover whatever it was that they had skipped or missed in the previous offerings. &amp;quot;Book 2&amp;quot; has the same 'front-cover' that the BOXED set has, and is 12 pages(not including the FRONT &amp;amp; BACK covers), with the Introduction &amp;amp; 'Contents' on the inside of the slick Front cover. There was also a *BONUS* of an advert-sheet for even MORE 'minis', with their accompanying 'stats' on this, AND some pictures of those. There are NOW even &amp;quot;Galactic Transports&amp;quot; made available, with their own 'stats' included for use in this. &amp;quot;Book 2&amp;quot; gives us '2' NEW 'Advanced Rules'-&amp;quot;Special Damage&amp;quot; &amp;amp; &amp;quot;Damage Control&amp;quot;! Here's a listing of the 'Contents': &amp;quot;Starfortresses&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Super Galactic Dreadnaughts&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Starbombers&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Star Armored Pursuit Ships&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;CapTacs&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Special Damage&amp;quot;; &amp;amp; &amp;quot;Damage Control Rules&amp;quot;. There is yet another &amp;quot;Stats Sheet&amp;quot; in the middle of this one for additional information on the NEW units introduced with this. It goes into great detail and description about ALL of what has been previously mentioned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Star Fortresses&amp;quot; require *Special* mention, since they are 'modular' in composition. This means that you can pick &amp;amp; choose what it is that you'd like them to be comprised of. These 'pieces' consist of the following: 'Weapons Pod'(W.P.); 'Medium Auxiliary Weapon System'(M.A.W.S.); Life Support System(L.S.S.); Mobile Armed Destroyer(M.A.D.); Communication Module(C.M.); and Small Auxiliary Weapons System(S.A.W.S.). You may wish to include at least one of the 'L.S.S.' modules, unless you have 'droids' manning these, or it's 'automated'! The 'components' are able to be connected together in order to 'fashion' one of these formidable &amp;quot;Fortresses&amp;quot;, without having to use an adhesive on them in some form or manner. I will mention that there were NO 'minis' included with this and they have to be &amp;quot;purchased separately&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Starfleet Wars&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
