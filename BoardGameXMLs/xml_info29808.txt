							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Liner</name>
									
			<description>A luxury liner hits an iceberg and begins to sink. Unfortunately, some of the world's great monsters that had been captured and placed in this boat as part of the liner's entertainment - a giant ape, a vampire, a fish-man, a wolf-man, a mummy and a man-monster - roam free now that their cages have been broken. It's up to the stalwart heroes who captured these creatures the first time, to take them down permanently. And they have to do it amongst, fleeing passengers, unsuspecting maidens and frantic crew. Oh, and before this ship sinks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was the winner of a &amp;quot;Monster-Themed Design Contest&amp;quot; that Z-Man Games held on the Board Game Designer's Forum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
