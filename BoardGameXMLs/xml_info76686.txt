			<description>The game consists of eight tiles with three pictures on each of them. There are also 24 picture cards showing the same pictures. A path is laid out with the tiles; the cards are placed face down around the path. &lt;br/&gt;The active player flips over a card. If the picture matches one of the three on the tile in front of him/her and, he/she can move forward to that picture on the tile and flip over another card, etc. If there is no match, it is the next player's turn. If the picture is already occupied, the active player ends his/her turn as well. When the  last player has left a tile, that tile is taken away and placed at the end of the path, so that the path keeps getting longer and the players have to remember several pictures in a row if they ever want to reach it. The first player to reach the last tile is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of the game is the German TV series &amp;quot;Bernd das Brot&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
