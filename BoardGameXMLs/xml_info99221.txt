			<description>The goal of Snuffy Race is for players to propel their dog along the winding path, using a small plastic bellows against the dog&amp;rsquo;s fan-shaped tail, right into the bowl in the center which contains dog bones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as a dog has reached the bowl, that player collects a bone, moves their dog back to the start of their path, and sets off again to get another bone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the dog falls over or falls off the path, then it must be returned to the start of the path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player whose dog retrieves the most bones is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
