			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;South Sarasota County is a story roleplaying game about a failing independent/regional wrestling organization. Over the years, South Sarasota County has fallen behind its rivals, failing to adapt to the changing wrestling market. Characters are wrestlers either moving up through the ranks or in the twilight of their careers, now circling the drain in a dying league; they can even be promotors, bookers, and support members of the organization. Play involves behind the scenes action as much as the wrestling ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
