							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">States: After the Fall</name>
									
			<description>The government has collapsed. The military has mutinied. Will you be the leader who reunites the country through superior fire power, strategy, and combo-driven tactics?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;States: After the Fall is a combo-driven, strategic area control game where players battle to take control of the former United States of America. Each State a player controls is not only a fertile recruitment ground, but also comes with an ability that can award them an edge. These abilities, often anachronistic in theme, can combo to execute wide-sweeping strategic agendas and turn the tide of war!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is quick and determined without dice. The game will have various game modes included scenarios and of course, domination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
