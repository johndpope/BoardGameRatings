			<description>The Big Stream has been taken over by Invasive Species!  Join Olive and her friends from the popular children's book series on an adventure to meet the local stream residents and clear out the invaders!  While it may be based on a book series for kids, the  gameplay appeals to a much broader audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Chuckin' Bugs, you collect an assortment of flies in your &amp;quot;fly box&amp;quot; (your card hand) and make casts to The Big Stream where you encounter 10 species of fish, Invasive Species, and hazards that get in the way of your fishing!  Match fly colors to the fish's preferences and roll dice to reel them in!  You also get to cooperate with other players to get Invasive Species out of the river and prevent them from completely shutting down the fishing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, players draw a card to their fly box (hand) and either make a cast with a fly of their choosing, or play one of several special &amp;quot;helper&amp;quot; cards.  When making a cast, the player places their fly on the table and declares which card in The Big Stream they are casting to.  The Big Stream card is turned over revealing either a fish, invasive species, or hazard.  If a fish is revealed, it shows its fly preferences, which dictates how many dice you get to roll and what number is needed to succeed in catching it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes two card decks: The Big Stream and Camp Tightloops.  The Big Stream contains fish, Invasive Species, hazards, and weather events.  Camp Tightloops contains three different types of flies in four different colors and special cards to give you an edge when you need it.  Some high points fish in The Big Stream require very specific flies to have a chance at them, just like big fish int he real world!  But, if you don't have the right fly in the box, you have the option of playing your special cards, wild cards, or creating a &amp;quot;wild&amp;quot; out of playing different fly type/color combinations with multiple cards.  Invasive species yield points to both players who cooperate in defeating them, and the player who cleans out the most invasives gets a bonus point token at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is the best strategy to go for several smaller fish or take a chance on the larger high point fish? Should you go after the growing invasive species threats hoping they will pay off, or go immediately for the easy fish you know are there? Do you take chances on netting another player's fish to split the points with them or hope they fail their roll? Every time you play Chuckin' Bugs, The Big Stream has changed like your favorite fishing river.  You never know what lurks under the surface!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
