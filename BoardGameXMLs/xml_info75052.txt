			<description>This is a challenging game for 2 players. The board has holes in it. Those holes are shaped like a star. Each player begins with 10 letters and from those 10 letters tries to make a 5 letter word. then fills his hand to 10 letters. Only 5 letter words can be added to the star(or in some cases 9 letter words can be created using a previously placed 5 letter word ).  All words must begin and end on the points of the star.  If a word has two of the same letter such as WHICH a bonus of 2 points is earned. Words that read both ways (like SLOOP and POOLS) would earn an extra 5 points. The second player can add a new word using his 10 letter hand or any letters from the first word which can be removed from the first word to help create the second word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 9 letter word could be made by going through a point on the star and then ending on another point (PLACE begins and ends on a point of the star and adding either FIRE to the beginning or MENT to the end of the word would create a 9 letter word&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 11 &amp;amp; Up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
