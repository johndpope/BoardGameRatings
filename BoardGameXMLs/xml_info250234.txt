			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blessing is a post apocalyptic settlement located within the ruins of a sprawling, suburban area. A tight knit community run by spiritual leader Father Monroe, the residents' reactions towards visitors tend to sway from the extremes of warm and welcoming to cold and suspicious. All of the members of the community are converted into the faith preached by Father Monroe, and generally most citizens follow the spiritual leader's instructions with little hesitation. Beyond its focus on spiritualism, Blessing is considered to be an agricultural community with surprisingly very fertile soil. The citizens farm the central garden while the Father and the church Elders keep a private garden to grow medicinal herbs and experiment with new varieties of crops. Livestock and poultry can be found here, as well as three community wells that tap into fresh, drinkable water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
