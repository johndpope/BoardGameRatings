			<description>Aggressors of Dark Kombat, sometimes abbreviated as ADK, and known in Japan as Tsuukai GANGAN Koushinkyoku (痛快GANGAN行進曲, lit. Thrilling Intense March?) or simply GanGan, is a 1994 one-on-one fighting arcade game developed by Alpha Denshi Corp. (ADK) and published by SNK. The English game title is a pun on the developer's initials and also parodies Mortal Kombat, spelling the word combat with K instead of C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's major innovation is the ability to walk into the background, in a similar manner to some 1980s arcade fighting games like Taito's Violence Fight, SNK's Street Smart and Atari's Pit-Fighter. Because of this, unlike many other 2D fighting games, the game uses one action button to jump, and does not use the &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; button, unlike many SNK fighting games. Only two action buttons are used for attacking (punch and kick); instead, grappling and grabbing opponents is the focus of the gameplay: opponents can counter being grabbed and break free as well. Also featured is weapon play (another mechanic akin to beat 'em ups). Weapons can be picked up and thrown, or used in special and standard attacks. Weapons are thrown into the ring by spectators in the background. Another (unusual) innovation of the game is that characters begin to sweat profusely after fighting for a while.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have unusually high health for the genre with a health bar that has several layers of colors to indicate the health. There is also a &amp;quot;Crazy Meter&amp;quot; at the bottom of the screen. It is built up as characters attack; this gives the character a special &amp;ndash; and often very bizarre &amp;ndash; attack that will kill the opponent outright. It is called the &amp;quot;Gan Gan Attack&amp;quot; in Japan, and &amp;quot;Crazy Attack&amp;quot; internationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles are joined by irreverent, sometimes humorous pre-fight banter from characters. The dialogue differs from opponent to opponent, and the fight is immediately presaged by a clash of two small images of the combatants' eyes in the center of the screen. There are almost no differences between the Japanese release of this game and the International versions aside from the rather drastic name change, but it is worth taking notice that there is blood to be found when you use a critical hit on an opponent on the Japanese release only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Aggressors of Dark Kombat&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
