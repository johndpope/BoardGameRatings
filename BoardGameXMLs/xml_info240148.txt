							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crazy Neighbors</name>
									
			<description>Crazy Neighbors is a humorous game, where the players assume the roles of residents in a suburban neighborhood populated by a cast of crazy stereotypes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player belongs to one of four exaggerated demographic groups, the Hippies, the Rednecks, the Culture Snobs or the Financial Elite. The people belonging to the different groups obviously cannot stand each other, and the goal of the game is to make sure that your preferred type of people move in to your neighborhood, and that the properties surrounding your opponents are populated by people they dislike. Meanwhile you can also upgrade your own property and bring all kinds of misfortune to your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays with all kinds of stereotypes in a tongue-in-cheek manner. For the duration of the game, each player will identify with their own demographic and try to be as outrageously mean as possible to her opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The large cast of neighbors are represented by cards with individual abilities and descriptions, each illustrated by the gifted artist Erik &amp;Oslash;degaard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
