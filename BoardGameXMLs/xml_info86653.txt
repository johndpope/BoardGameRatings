							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Taint and Sanity</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some places and items are so evil or filled with Chaos that exposure to them marks a character in a very real and difficult-to-cleanse way. Taint is evil. It is a corruption so deep that it warps the very plane of reality. A weapon used to slaughter thousands of innocents, a forest grown on land soaked in the blood of an evil deity, or a book bound in the flesh of an archfiend for his own horrible purposes, are all sources of taint. Taint makes evil a physical threat to the well-being of characters and can have a lasting impact on characters, even killing those who remain exposed too long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sanity is the natural mental state of ordinary life. Normal mental balance is endangered when characters confront horrors, entities, or activities that are shocking, unnatural, and bewildering. As a character encounters monsters, witnesses horrible acts, masters forbidden knowledge, or casts spells, his Sanity score, and his corresponding ability to function as a normal character, deteriorates. Soon, all that is left is a gibbering madman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 28 page supplement contains all the rules that GM's and Players need to add Taint and Sanity to their RuneQuest games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requires the use of the RuneQuest(TM) Main Rulebook available from Mongoose Publishing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
