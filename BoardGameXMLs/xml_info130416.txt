			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solomani Rim&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Solomani Rim sector is an old, highly civilised sector with more than 400 settled worlds including Terra, the original home of mankind.  It bears the weight of thousands of years of history and is the front line of the centuries-long conflict between the Imperium and its bitter rival, the Solomani Confederation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solomani Rim contains a history and description of this sector.  A perfect setting for campaigns that focus on espionage, trading or political machinations, Solomani Rim includes detailed information on the competing Imperial and Solomani leaders, government agencies, corporations, political factions and military or guerrilla forces that operate within the sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The important races found in the sector are also covered in depth, including the exotic Vegans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All 16 subsectors are featured with detailed descriptions of many of the worlds found within them, including Terra and the other worlds of the Solar System.  Steeped in the rich history of the Imperium, Solomani Rim is a classic setting for interstellar adventure and intrigue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To use this supplement, a Referee will require the Traveller Core Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
