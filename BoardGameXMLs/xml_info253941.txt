			<description>Army Guys is a game for people who want to play strategy games, but don't want to sift through a novel to learn the rules or pay thousands of dollars to put together an army.  Army Guys is meant to be played with minimal accessories - you can play on the floor or on a table; you can use literally anything to make up the battlefield; and you only need a tape measure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed primarily for two opponents but does support more players; the game is intended to be quickly learned and rapidly played.  The rules assume (but do not demand) the game will be played with &amp;quot;little green men&amp;quot; plastic figures, and uses a suitable scale for movement.  Forces are purchased with a point-buy system.  Initial placement uses a &amp;quot;hold and drop&amp;quot; method (preferred) to randomize units in a close area.  Play proceeds in alternating turns.  During each turn a player may select five units and execute two actions with each unit.  The game supports only two actions - move and attack.  Attacking units have an &amp;quot;accuracy&amp;quot; value which must beat the defender's &amp;quot;hitability&amp;quot; value - in which case, hits are automatic.  Damage is randomly rolled.  Several types of special movement and terrain are supported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
