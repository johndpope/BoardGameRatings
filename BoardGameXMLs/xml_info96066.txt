			<description>Goal: Be the richest merchant at that moment, when all players have reached their home port&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Each player starts with 10 cargo cards and 2.000 money units&lt;br/&gt;2. Make money by choosing a route which allows you to sell your goods as profitable as possible - look for those ports where your cargo is looked for&lt;br/&gt;3. Try to be the first to enter a port, because only the first can pick up new cargo&lt;br/&gt;4. Try to avoid too many difficulties on your way (storm, mist...)&lt;br/&gt;5. Sell as many goods as possible to avoid penalties&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are the first to reach your homeport you will get a bonus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
