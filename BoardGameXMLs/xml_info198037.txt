			<description>&amp;Auml;lskling is a quiz game. The questions are about to get to know another person. On each of the cards there is three questions, eg Would you be willing to get a tattoo? Did you have braces when you were younger? What is the most embarrassing you've bought in a store? This is a social game and there are no &amp;quot;winners&amp;quot; in traditional sense, it is about knowing more about the fellow players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
