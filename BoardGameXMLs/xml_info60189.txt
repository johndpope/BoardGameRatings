			<description>The board forms a miniature version of Chinese Checkers for two players, white and blue. Unlike that game, pieces that get jumped are here flipped over to change colour and allegiance. Each player has a &amp;quot;genuine pearl&amp;quot; (with the same colour on both sides, initially hidden among the other pieces) which must be protected from capture and brought to the opponent's end of the board. The game is a draw if both genuine pearls are eliminated before one of them can reach its goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box sports a patent number as well as the legend &amp;quot;The International Inventors Exhibition Brussels 1967&amp;quot; and a couple of indistinct badges that may or may not represent awards. Rules are provided in Swedish and English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
