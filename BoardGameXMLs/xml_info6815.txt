			<description>A game created by a mad scientist (according to the cover) who combined &amp;quot;the best parts of Chess, Checkers, and Chinese Checkers.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An abstract strategy game with some light outer space chrome.  The hex grid mapboard is double sided -- one side is for the two player game, the other side is for three players.  The object of the game is to occupy hexes in an opponent's space station (indicated by a small group of colored hexes.)  Players have two types of pawns: yeoman satellites and explorer satellites.  Yeoman satellites are restricted to the owning player's home territory.  Pawns may jump to move, and opposing pieces are captured by jumping.  Some hexes have obstructions which prohibit movement into or over them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Lancer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
