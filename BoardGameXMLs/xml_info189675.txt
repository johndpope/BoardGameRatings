							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Barbarossa File:  Deep Battles in Russia, 1941-42</name>
									
			<description>Corps to Army level, 36 mis/60 kms per hex, 20-day turns, no Finnish front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Russian units start face down, and there are 3 different order of battle possibilities:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Historical - 3/6 chance, as I remember.&lt;br/&gt;2. From Budyonny's Stables - 2/6 chance:  What if the Bolshevik traditionalists *had* completely overthrown Tukhachevsky's modern, mobile doctrine *and* equipment, leaving the Red Army  strong in infantry and artillery, and having only weak cavalry/mobile corps, with the one exception of Budyonny's KonArmiya.&lt;br/&gt;3. The Tukhachevsky Twist - 1/6 chance:  What if Tukhachevsky had not been purged and had seen through the reorganization of the Red Army into the mobile, &amp;quot;deep battle&amp;quot; forces he and  Isserman had envisioned?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, there are 3 different possible replacement rates, so the German player not only does not know what kind of monster he is attacking, he also doesn't know how strong it is - historical is the maximum.  The easier his opponent is, the more and sooner victory objectives he must achieve.  PRESSURE ... to over-extend?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
