							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prototype: Blind Master</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They say that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, the Blind Master proves this saying true. While he or she may not have working eyes, the Blind Master can perform feats that are unmatched by sighted martial artists. His martial training does more than allow him to cope with his blindness, it allows the Blind Master to turn disadvantage into advantage. In the midst of battle, your eyes can play tricks on you. The mind can become confused by what it sees. In the heat of the moment, you may ignore what your other senses tell you. Darkness, smoke and dust can become tremendous obstacles. This is not a problem for the Blind Master, an expert martial artist who has learned to fight without eyes. This 6 page PDF is just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern campaign world, including Haven: City of Violence and Haven: Full Metal Zero. It also includes 6 all new feats for this class including Hyper Acrobatic, Running Blind and Smell of Fear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
