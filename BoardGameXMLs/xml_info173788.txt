							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Legends of Sinbad</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher&lt;br/&gt; This is not a genre piece!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Legends of Sinbad is a new sword-and-sorcery campaign set on Earth in the year 801 C.E.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the Harryhausen Sinbad trilogy but based on real-world mythologies, histories, and legends, as well as the tales of the Arabian nights, the game is more than a Prince of Persia tale. As you can see from the map below (which is not yet complete--more cities will be added as development continues), a wide variety of cultures are represented. In this one era, you can find every RPG setting imaginable. You have the Vikings in the Norselands; feudal Europe with the Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms and the Carolingian Empire; wild, druidic barbarians in the Celtic Kingdoms; a classical feel with the Eastern Roman Empire; savage nomadic hordes with the Kazar Khaganate; and Arabic with the Abassid Caliphate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And each culture brings with it its own monsters from mythology--kraken, gray dwarves, and frost giants in the Norselands; dragons and centaurs in the Carolingian Empire; trolls and ogres in the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms; brownies and banshees in the Celtic kingdoms; gorgons and hydras in the Eastern Roman Empire; and djinn in the Kingdom of the Moors; just to name a few!Of course, there is a lot more to this setting than just the above. This is just a quick note to point out that this setting is not just another Arabic genre piece, but a vibrant, versatile, and unique sword-and-sorcery campaign setting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The campaign book will be made available in Savage Worlds, and you won't need to buy the Savage Worlds book to play! This will be a complete set!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
