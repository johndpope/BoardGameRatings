			<description>OpenSpace: the game of corporate pawns is a board game where players take on a role of corporate employees racing for a promotion and struggling with burnout syndrome during a fast paced gameplay using pawns, cards and a board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the gameplay, the actions you take will affect your career and stress levels. You win the game when you reach maximum of your career level before other players do. However, reaching the maximum of stress level, makes you lose immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During each round of the game, you secretly decide whether you will work normally, work hard or relax and have a break. Working hard will get you closer to promotion, but even more close to burnout - that is why sometimes you need to relax during working hours. When relaxing, you are at risk of being denounced to superiors by your fellow players. What is more &amp;ndash; each time a denouncing person proves right, his or her career thrives. Still, you can gain an upper hand by using event cards such as air-conditioning breakdown, deadline or annual report.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
