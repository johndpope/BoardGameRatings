			<description>Yee-Ho-Ho-Ho! &amp;quot;It's Christmas time in the hills of Kentucky, and just like every other year before, you don't have a job. You decide to clean up your rifle and go hunting for a turkey so yer family won't go another holiday season eating Spam sandwiches for the main course.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I believe this was published in the December 2000 issue of Games Unplugged Magazine. The board is printed in the magazine; you provide a few D4's and 2 pawns of the same color for each player (must be able to tell what direction your pawn is facing). The board also has a &amp;quot;Buzz Meter&amp;quot; for each player (Betty-Jo, Jim-Bob, Tex, Cousin Luke, Uncle Robert and Ma) so you can keep track of how drunk each one is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Objective: Everyone's pawn on the board represents a drunken hillbilly stumbling through the woods trying to land on the center square of the game board (shooting a turkey). Once you have landed on the square, you then have to move your pawn off the board (bringing the turkey home). First one to do this wins.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two phases per turn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action phase - Move (you control only distance or direction), Drink a beer (allows you to change your direction) or Sober up (decrease your level of drunkenness on your Buzz Meter). Everyone performs their action before the Shootin' phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shootin' phase - Anything in each player's line of sight (turkey or hillbilly) gets shot automatically. Of course, if you are shot, you guzzle a beer to ease the pain before continuing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are out of the game if you get so drunk that you wander off the board. You are the winner if you are the first to shoot a turkey and bring it home OR you are the last player on the board without anyone else having gotten  a turkey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
