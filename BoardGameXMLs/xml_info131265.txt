			<description>Each player starts with 16 numbered tiles (two each of numbers 1 through 8) and take turns playing one of them.  The number on the tile dictates how many spaces the player moves around the board, and an arrow on the space where the player ends his turn indicates the row or column where that tile must be placed.  This row or column is then scored based on the tiles present in it.  Red and blue tiles belong to each player; yellow tiles placed in the center can be scored by either player provided the row or column including them contains more points in his color than his opponent.  Once a row or column is scored, it cannot be scored again for the rest of the game.  Highest score after all possible tiles have been played wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
