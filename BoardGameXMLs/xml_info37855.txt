							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rhyme Dominoes</name>
									
			<description>This is a domino game where words are used instead of pips. Each domino is divided into two colors: white and purple. Each side has a word on the top part of the domino and a shape on the bottom. Dominoes are played from a players hand against other dominoes that rhyme. The shapes on the bottom are used to determine whether the words rhyme and the object of the game is to exhaust your hand of dominoes. The dominoes in the box are larger than ordinary dominoes and are made from very thick card stock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
