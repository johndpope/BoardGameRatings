			<description>The World Is Yours to Shape&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lots of people have fixer-uppers. But for some folks, these projects are entire worlds. This month's Pyramid -- the PDF magazine for roleplayers -- offers tools and resources to help build a fantasy world:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;The Turning Points of History&amp;quot; offers a set of random tables to generate fantastic histories suitable for the smallest towns, the most epic worlds, and everything in between. Written by Matt Riggsby (author of GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 8: Treasure Tables), this article will have you devising today's action using yesterday's lore.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Shadowland Runners,&amp;quot; an add-on about how information brings rule to a widespread kingdom. GURPS author Michele Armellini describes (with GURPS rules) the ephemeral world that makes this communication possible.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;God Is Dead,&amp;quot; this month's Eidetic Memory offering from GURPS Fourth Edition co-author David Pulver, includes both systemless and GURPS insight. How does the world react when one of its deities dies?&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;In the Jungle,&amp;quot; which takes your fantasy gaming in a new direction -- straight up! Discover what the canopied world of trees has in common with dungeon-delving action.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;The Gnomish Mafia,&amp;quot; a generic organization suitable for anywhere that can welcome small criminals with big plans.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;The Children of the Coming Darkness,&amp;quot; a dire development for your GURPS Banestorm campaign. Can the world survive the plans of this insane cult?&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;The Duodecennial Deviations,&amp;quot; a developed look at how a calendar might bestow or remove GURPS abilities . . . and what that means for the world at large.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Spirits in Everyday Life,&amp;quot; an examination of how the spirits of a fantasy world might be appeased . . . and what can happen if they aren't.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue also contains a Random Thought Table that considers world-building from a rule standpoint, plus Odds and Ends we didn't have room for elsewhere . . . including a Murphy's Rules that's gone to the dogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They say the world keeps on turning regardless of our actions. However, it won't be as cool if you're not involved -- and Pyramid is here to help!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
