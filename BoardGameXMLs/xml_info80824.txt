			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trials of the Grail is a role-playing game based on the archetypal Grail Quest. The characters of the game are Questors. Together, they search for a Grail in order to heal their Land and their King. They will face trials and enact noble deeds. They will fall prey to their own weakness but with the aid of their companions will rise again, wiser. They will uncover mysteries of their world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leading the Questors is a na&amp;iuml;ve but skillful youth. He has the best chance of success, but is also the most vulnerable. If he grows into his potential, he will face the Grail. And there he will be judged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trials of the Grail is focused on the concept of questing, not on any particular setting. You can use it to play anything from WWII GIs to a modern-day Huck Finn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
