							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Journey: A Quest for Galactic Power</name>
									
			<description>Journey is one of the rare few Grenadier Models board games. It is from &amp;quot;The Great Little Game Line&amp;quot;, product #7002. The game is also referred to as &amp;quot;Journey to Epsilon Cygni II&amp;quot; in the rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you journey to the Epsilon Cygni II star cluster, collect as many precious metals as you can, and then attempt to return home safely. The winner is the player with the most points after all players have either returned to their home bases or been destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Grenadier's description of the game: &amp;quot;You command a star cruiser as you attempt to cross the galaxy to secure decisive materials, and return. Tactical elements include meteor storms, alien raiders, refueling, and exploring uncharted planets. Fun for two to four players, includes full color playing board, cut counters, score sheets, and rules booklet.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cover sheet shrinkwrapped on the bottom of the box erroneously lists the part number for Journey as 7001. However, the side of the box is marked 7002. Product number 7001 was the &amp;quot;Great Little Game&amp;quot; Hydra!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
