			<description>&amp;quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth is a PC real-time strategy game developed by EA Los Angeles. It is based on Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, in turn based on J. R. R. Tolkien's original novel. The game uses short video clips from the movies and a number of the voice actors, including the hobbits and wizards. It uses the SAGE engine from Command &amp;amp; Conquer: Generals and was released on December 6, 2004...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game retains the basic mechanics of real-time strategies. Warring factions gather resources, then use them to construct military bases and armies on-site...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four factions on two sides wage the War of the Ring: Representing the Free Peoples are the horse-lords of Rohan, and Gondor with its forges and battlements. The Forces of Darkness are the fighting Uruk-hai of Isengard, and Mordor's orc hordes, bolstered by Haradrim, M&amp;ucirc;makil and Trolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keeping with the trends of contemporary RTS titles, basic units operate in groups, significant characters are represented by &amp;quot;hero units&amp;quot;...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good and evil have a campaign each. They take place on an animated map of western Middle-earth, where each battle represents the defense/sacking of a territory. Armies and characters move on the map, and moving the cursor over them shows snippets of the movies (whereas battle cutscenes use the game engine).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Battle_for_Middle-earth,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
