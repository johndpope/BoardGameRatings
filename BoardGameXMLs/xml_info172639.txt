							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New Ghostbusters II</name>
									
			<description>New Ghostbusters II is a 1990 video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy, both developed and published by HAL Laboratory in the PAL region and Japan. The NES version was never released in North America due to licensing issues with Activision. As a result, NES players in North America only received Activision's Ghostbusters II game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the player is presented with four Ghostbusters to choose from: Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, Egon Spengler, or Winston Zeddemore. The NES version features their accountant, Louis Tully, as a fifth playable character. This, along with the North American version of Ghostbusters II, were the only titles ever released that allowed players to play as Winston. The objective of the game is to trap all the ghosts in an area until an arrow appears which alerts the player where to travel to next. A boss appears at the end of each stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;New Ghostbusters II&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
