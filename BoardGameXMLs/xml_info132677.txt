							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ambassador: England</name>
									
			<description>Trivia and chance game! Play as an ambassador of an European country and answer questions correctly to win the appreciation of the English Ambassador. The game is available as open source and can be modified to your discretion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a similar take on trivial pursuit, where one must roll the dice and then move to a spot where you can pick a question card and answer it. Correctly answering it, earns you a token and you turn in points for tokens at the English Ambassador square, at the centre of the board. You win be either being ahead by 5 points or having the most points after answering all questions. Tokens do not count as points. If there is a tie in points at the end of the game, then a random question card will be drawn and the best with the fastest correct answer, wins. Otherwise, another question card will be drawn until there is a winner. Only the players in a tie are eligible to answer the question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
