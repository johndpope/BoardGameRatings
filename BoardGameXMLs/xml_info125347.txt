							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forge of the Primordials Encounter 2: Gatehouse</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gate, formidable as it was has been shattered. All that remains of it is the rubble littering the courtyard and the hall beyond the gate as well as the dust that is now slowly settling, making it hard to breath the air or to see anything further than a step away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The walls are made from solid granite blocks, set so finely that hardly even a sheet of paper would fit between them. A corridor divided by a handful of columns stretches from your entrance to the only other exit straight ahead. Larger room housing guards lie to either side of it. Hardly visible through all the dust are a few tables, benches and straw beds in these side rooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
