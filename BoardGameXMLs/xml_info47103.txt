							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Football Party Bingo</name>
									
			<description>Makes a PARTY out of every TV FOOTBALL GAME!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now everyone can enjoy the excitement of watching their favorite team, while playing Football Party Bingo - the game that turns any TV football game in a party.  Based on what happens during the televised game - punt, completed pass, touchdown - players mark corresponding squares on their cards, and when they've marked five-in-a-row, it's &amp;quot;BINGO&amp;quot;!  And with four quarters of play, there's a possibility of four winners per game!  But watch out for the yellow flaf, as the person wearing the referee hat not only calls-out the individual plays, but blows the whistle on t hose having a little too much fun.  So, invite up to 32 of your closest friends over for a Monday night match-up, a Saturday afternoon game, or a Sunday showdown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
