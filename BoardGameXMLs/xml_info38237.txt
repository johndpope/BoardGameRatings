			<description>&amp;quot;Buy a flock of sheep - Construct a flour mill - Convert a hog feeding facility into an organic farm - or even Tear down a nuclear power plant - this all is possible in &amp;Ouml;koly: The only way of winning is by acting ecologically&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This introduction to &amp;Ouml;koly as printed on its box already provides a first flavour of this game. Similar to monopoly, the players move around a quadrangle and buy property within a city and collect revenue from the others. However, money is just a means to the end to act ecologically, i.e. collecting more Eco-Points (EP) than the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These EPs can be collected in different ways:&lt;br/&gt;- conversion of an &amp;quot;ecologically unfriendly&amp;quot; business (e.g. automotive, hog feeding or warfare) to an ecological friendly one (solar, bio-gas, wind energy)&lt;br/&gt;- extending a business ecologically&lt;br/&gt;- helping other players out of insolvency&lt;br/&gt;- passing a turn by working at the welfare centre or an other player's business&lt;br/&gt;- tearing down the nuclear power station collectively with other players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ecological theme, beautifully carved wooden meeples, hand designed playing cards and money (all printed on recycled paper), health-food shops as a distribution channel and a DM3,- contribution to Greenpeace (deducted from the purchase price) made &amp;Ouml;koly a real innovator at the beginning of the 1980's in Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
