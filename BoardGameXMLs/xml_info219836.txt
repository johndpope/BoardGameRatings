			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gems was a system [that] served as a bridge between SeeD and SeeD 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are six attributes (Attack, Magic, Will, Speed, Vitality, and Spirit).  Characters have points distributed into attributes.  Characters also wear a special piece of jewelry - their Gem - that is a significant component of character development and ability.  In most other respects, the game is very similar to SeeD.  Unlike the other game iterations, Gems was developed to support a single game setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
