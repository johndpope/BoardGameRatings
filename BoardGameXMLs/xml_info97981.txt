			<description>From Publishers Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 8 and Up&lt;br/&gt;2 Players&lt;br/&gt;5 Minutes to learn&lt;br/&gt;Playing time: 10-15 minutes&lt;br/&gt;Flip &amp;rsquo;n Link&amp;trade; Money&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fun-Filled Strategic Money Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flip 'n Link Money is an engaging and action-packed strategy game. Players learn how to count coins while reinforcing basic addition skills. Simply add the value of the coins on the game cards and match that amount to the appropriate playing piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, a player must strategically create a link of five playing pieces. But there's a trick! Players must plan ahead to avoid being trapped by their opponents and having their playing pieces flipped to the opponent's side. The action continues until one of the players creates a link. Players win with clever strategies and a bit of luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
