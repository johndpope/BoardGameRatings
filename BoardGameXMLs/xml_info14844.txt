			<description>Nuke: (Mankind's Ultimate Challenge)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is the worlds most realistic game of theoretical thermonuclear war. It is a simple to play board game which requires no skill yet is guaranteed to be intellectually stimulating fun for all ages 15 and over. Designed primarily as an educational tool, Nuke can illustrate many of the specific problems associated with thermonuclear weapons and the current arms race. A unique 'game' with uniques 'consequences', it will provide hours of thought provoking entertainment for you and your family.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 69&amp;quot; linear game board consisting of 51 spaces containing either 'factual' text or a red/green dot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6 1&amp;quot; colored fuzzy balls on metal bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;30 Green cards, drawn upon landing on a green dot with 'event text' and instructions to move forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;30 Red cards, drawn upon landing on a red dot with 'event text' and instructions to move backward. One card is the 'Holocaust' card that ends the game if drawn prior to all playing pieces reaching the end, 'Weapons Outlawed', space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All 6 game pieces are used, regardless of the number of players. Each rolls a die and moves forward. Cards drawn on landing on red or green dot. Game ends when all pieces are 'safe' , the Holocaust card is drawn, or a timer (not provided) runs out. No player decisions are possible and simple analysis shows that the players will lose more than 50% of the 'games'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For clarity, this is not Nuke: The Last Game on Earth, but is rather an educational game about thermonuclear war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
