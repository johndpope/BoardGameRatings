			<description>A card game for 2-4+ players set in the Justice League universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck comprising cards of 4 different types: Primary Heroes, Minor Heroes, Villains and Complications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a circular track of 24 spaces with each space containing instructions to draw, steal, play or discard cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with a hand of 3 cards and then take turns to play as follows:&lt;br/&gt;-   First draw 1 card from the top of the deck and add it to your hand.  &lt;br/&gt;-   Roll 1 six sided die, and move your pawn that many spaces clockwise on the track. Resolve as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;   If you land on an opponent&amp;rsquo;s pawn, steal 1 card from his hand and add it to your own. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;   If you land on a space that instructs you to play a card, place a card of the indicated type on the table face up in front of you. These are your mission cards. &lt;br/&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t have the indicated card type, draw a card instead. If you already have 2 cards of that type out (or 1 of a villain) do nothing. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;   If the space instructs you to discard a card, target an opponent&amp;rsquo;s mission card of that type. If there are none, target your own. If you have none, do nothing. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;   If the space instructs you to steal a card, move an opponent&amp;rsquo;s mission card of that type over to your mission cards unless you already have enough, in which case do nothing. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;   Other board space results are self-explanatory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mission is a hand of 7 cards that contains 2 Primary Heroes, 2 Minor Heroes, 1 Villain and 2 Complications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to complete 3 missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
