			<description>Goodbye, Ghosts! is an adorably fun card game in which you effort to be the first to purge your house of phantoms&amp;mdash;by matching one ghost, to another!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dealer begins by separating the game equally among all players, creating a deck for each their own. After that, everyone draws 5 cards from their deck and the player to the dealer's left begins.&lt;br/&gt;When it is their turn, players draw a card and then play any number from their hand to the middle discard pile, face up. The card they play must match the one in the middle, either by its color or the expression on the ghost's face.&lt;br/&gt;If the player has emptied its hand (playing all its five cards), he-she may draw 5 other cards and continue its streak.&lt;br/&gt;When the current player is unable to discard a ghost from its hand, the turn is finished and the next player plays.&lt;br/&gt;The game contains Rainbow ghosts that can be played at any moment during the player's turn to change the color of the pile to the player's choosing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get rid of all his ghosts win, to get rid of a ghost, match the color or expression of the current top card of the pile. If nobody can play cards anymore, the player with the fewest cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
