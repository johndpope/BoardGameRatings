			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meaningful decisions, unexpected twists and memorable characters are the foundations of this dark 4-hour adventure for 5th to 10th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A chance encounter on an unassuming road leads to a dangerous and lucrative opportunity.  But what seems simple on the surface turns out to be much more below.  Thrust into a world where every enemy has an enemy and everyone has their own dark motive, the only chance to survive is to ally with the right foe.  Sometimes &amp;ldquo;doing the right thing&amp;rdquo; comes only in shades of black.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six Summoned Swords is a stand-alone adventure that begins on the side of the road leading to Phlan and can be easily accessed by any adventurers traveling through the Moonsea region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
