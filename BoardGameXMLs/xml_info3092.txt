			<description>The game comes in a tube with a rolled up board that lays flat when laid out. The board depicts a motor racing circuit which varies in width from 2 squares to 4. The winner is the first past the post and the rules recommend a minimum of 3 laps.  The track and other charts are printed on something akin to vinyl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drivers choose a speed from 1 - 12 squares with the cost of the moves measured in fuel use.  The larger the change in gears (up or down), the more fuel is used.  Corners have an ideal speed, and exceeding that can cause tire wear, speed loss, and movement to the outside of the curve.  Engine wear at high speeds can also take place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
