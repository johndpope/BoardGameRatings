							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ruins of the Dragon Lord</name>
									
			<description>From box back:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Box Holds a Terrible Secret&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ancient Athan civilisation, which worshipped evil dragons and demonic entities, disappeared many centuries ago in the depths of the hollow peak known only as Mount Moru. For countless ages, the history of this ruined civilisation and their forgotten dragon cult remained untold, except for three old tomes of unknown origin...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Path of Archaneroth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rumour speaks of a detailed map of Mount Moru and its inner caves, allegedly based on the findings of countless explorers and adventurers, as well as merchant and diplomatic reports obtained from contact with its few peaceful inhabitants. An anonymous hand gathered, organised and transcribed this evidence under the title The Path of Archaneroth. Now, for the first time, the compilation is published in the form of a full dungeon, ready for adventurers to enter and seek out its dangers&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dragon Stone&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There exists a wealth of information about Mount Moru, its geography and history, including reports from many sources, from ancient folktales to actual testimonies taken directly from local people. This compilation, given the name of The Dragon Stone, is a complete guide to the times and places of the Athan civilisation and the Mount Moru area, equally useful for adventurers, researchers or casual visitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tales of Mount Moru&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a collection of stories, facts and reports about both ancient legends and recent events located in Mount Moru. It is unknown whether these Tales are fact or fancy; they are probably a little of both. They are reunited here for a Games Master to narrate them as separate adventures or one single, epic saga: the saga of the Ruins of the Dragon Lord&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;**CONTENTS**&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One 64-page and two 128-page rulebooks, containing details for a complete campaign, taking Player Characters from 1st to 20th level. Nine double-sided, A4 maps and a giant, double-sided poster map containing details of over 20 levels of Mount Moru&amp;rsquo;s dungeon. A double-sided poster, containing a map of the Moru area and a full-size version of the Ruins of the Dragon Lord cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
