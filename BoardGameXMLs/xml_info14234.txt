			<description>The King's daughter has been taken! She is being held captive in a fort with six towers. The King, of course, immediately sends a band of his bravest knights to rescue her from her plight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But these gallant knights are no heroes. Rescuing beautiful maidens is one thing, but they would rather make sure that the others do all the dirty work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you one of those cowardly custards?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Push other knights forward to fight the dragons, and then collect the keys to the towers yourself to be the player to free the princess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
