							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City Canal</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A narrow canal passes through this otherwise quite neighbourhood serving as a waterway to transport raw materials from the warehouses at the harbour to the workshops further inland and finished goods in the other direction. The canal is barely wide enough to let two river barges pass each other if the steersmen are careful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On its stone reinforced bank lanterns light the canal as well as the stone plastered roads running along its length. At regular intervals narrow alleys branch of in either direction leading deeper into this mostly residential quarter. The houses are well kept, two stories high with a high gabled roof and built mostly from stone and whitewashed bricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
