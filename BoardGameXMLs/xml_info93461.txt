			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mega Man: The Power Battle&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mega Man: The Power Battle, known in Japan as Rockman: The Power Battle​ (ロックマン・ザ・パワーバトル?), is an arcade video game and a spin-off title for the Mega Man series. It was released in Japan in 1995 and was followed by a sequel, Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters, the following year. Both games were ported to home consoles in North America in 2004 as part of the Mega Man Anniversary Collection for PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube and Xbox and in Japan during the same year as part of two game compilation titled Rockman: Power Battle Fighters (ロックマン パワーバトルファイターズ?), also for the PlayStation 2. An adaptation of both games for the Neo Geo Pocket Color, titled Rockman: Battle &amp;amp; Fighters (ロックマン バトル&amp;amp;ファイターズ), was also made&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lets the player choose between three playable characters: Mega Man, Proto Man and Bass. Two players can play the game together as different characters, teaming up to defeat the bosses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays much like the main Mega Man games - the player uses one button to jump, and one to fire the character's arm-mounted energy gun. Holding the fire button charges the gun in order to release a stronger blast. Holding down while pressing the jump button makes the character do a dash, the appearance of which varies between characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After choosing a character, the player chooses between three &amp;quot;stories&amp;quot;, with each one having different Robot Masters from various games. The &amp;quot;stories&amp;quot; are Mega Man 1-2, 3-6 and Mega Man 7. Upon choosing a &amp;quot;story&amp;quot;, the game quickly pans through the various levels, letting the player choose one roulette-style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A level is largely different from the mainstream Mega Man games; instead of going through an entire stage and fighting the Robot Master as a boss at the end, the player faces the Robot Master immediately. Killing a Robot Master earns the player their weapon, which can be switched to by pressing a button. Like in most Mega Man games, each Robot Master is weak to another one's weapon, so the player can fight through them in a &amp;quot;rock-paper-scissors&amp;quot; kind of way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
