							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Day Dice Games</name>
									
			<description>This simple black felt bag comes with 2 shiny metal 6-sided dice and a rulebook for 5 unique games.  These games include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Around the Horn = Players split into 2 teams, that line up on opposite sides of a table.  Starting with the players at one end of the table, each team is given one die to roll.  Players race to roll a 6 and then pass the die.  The first team to have all players successfully roll a 6 wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Face-Off = 2 players go head-to-head rolling one die each.  Low roller pays the high roller the difference in chips.  Ties are paid by both players into a common pot in the center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dealer's Dice = Players take turns being the &amp;quot;dealer&amp;quot;.  The other players put a number of fingers on the table to guess what the dealer will roll.  If you are right other players pay you their own finger-count in chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wild Ride = A push-your-luck game where you keep rolling and add up the total of the dice for your score, but if you ever roll a six you bust and lose all your points for that turn.  A double-six loses all your points you've accumulated for the entire game.  First player to 75 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;12 Down = Players write down the numbers 1 through 12 on paper and then take turns rolling to cover up as many numbers as possible.  The numbers you can cover are ones that add up to the same total as your die roll.  The player with the most numbers covered wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
