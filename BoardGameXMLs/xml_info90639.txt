			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MotoGP &amp;rsquo;07 is the second Xbox 360 title in THQ&amp;rsquo;s motocycle racing franchise. Released for both the 360 and PC, MotoGP &amp;rsquo;07 covers the 2007 Grand Prix season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game does not change much from its predecessors. Players can choose from a number of licensed bikes and riders or create their own customized character. Championship mode lets players race real tracks from the 2007 MotoGP season as they strive to earn enough points to win the title. Extreme Mode is a street racing championship akin to the Need for Speed Underground titles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were a few changes made to the base MotoGP &amp;rsquo;06 game design. The default control settings were set at a more forgiving level to lower the learning curve, and the telemetry feature was added. This maps indicates where a player crashed or incurred penalties on the course, allowing them to quickly identify problem areas on the different tracks. MotoGP &amp;rsquo;07 brings an added level of graphic detail to the settings as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can compete in four-player split screen or in up to 16 player online races. There are two new online game modes as well: Pink Slip and Online Tournament. Pink Slip races are winner-take-all stakes matches, with the winner earning the losers&amp;rsquo; bike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
