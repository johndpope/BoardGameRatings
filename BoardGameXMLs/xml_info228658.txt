			<description>2 new Survivors for Zombicide: Black Plague (including their miniatures and ID cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Troy&lt;br/&gt;Troy doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong in this kingdom, and he never really meant to get into the zombie-slaying business at all. But now that he&amp;rsquo;s here, now that he has no option but to swing his sword around rather than swinging around bales of hay, well, he&amp;rsquo;s going to be the best zombie-slayer there is. Maybe win himself a princess in the process, a small castle&amp;hellip; There&amp;rsquo;s something to be said for being a hero, Troy is discovering, especially when it comes with lovely wenches and pocketfuls of gold. Of course, he has to survive all the zombies first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evil Troy&lt;br/&gt;The necromancers have performed many experiments in their quest for the perfect evil, the perfect zombie. One of the worst things they managed was a simulacrum of a living being. This golem remembers everything the original human, Troy, knew; he has all of Troy&amp;rsquo;s skills. But he is as undead as a zombie, as angry as a raging bull, and as absolutely evil as it is possible to be. Evil Troy is a nasty piece of work, to put it shortly, intent on killing anything &amp;ndash; human, zombie, or necromancer &amp;ndash; that gets in his way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
