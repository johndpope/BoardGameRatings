			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s only a few short days since the world went to shit. Some say a bomb went off and started the whole thing. A firestorm still burns over the north side of town, and thousands of people are dead. Or Zeds. Walking around trying to eat you, spreading the infection or eating people outright. Mortiston has sunken into the ninth level of hell, and only the strong, the smart, and the crazy have managed to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this playset, you play characters caught up in the events after ZDay, as detailed in the Welcome to Mortiston, USA setting accessory from Scrying Eye Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adapted in part from Zombie Apocalypse, a Fiasco Playset by Bryant Durrell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
