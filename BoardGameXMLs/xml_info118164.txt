							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gravity Games Bike: Street Vert Dirt</name>
									
			<description>Gravity Games Bike: Street Vert Dirt is a BMX video game that was the first, last, and only game released under the Gravity Games license by Midway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game garnered mostly negative reception from critics. Reviewers criticized the game's broken gameplay, graphical glitches, and collision detection problems. Some critics, however, praised the game's large level designs. It is considered to be one of the worst video games of all time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gravity Games Bike is a BMX video game, and features gameplay similar to that of the Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX games. It features 21 characters and 10 levels. The player controls a BMX biker, and is required to complete various goals within levels to unlock later courses. As the player performs tricks, they gain more points and fulfill requirements in the game. The control scheme is similar to that of the Dave Mirra games in that one button on the controller is used to perform tricks, and another is used to modify the trick once it's performed. Unlike other similar games, Gravity Games Bike rewards the same amount of points for performing the same trick repeatedly. The game has several different multiplayer modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Gravity Games Bike: Street Vert Dirt&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
