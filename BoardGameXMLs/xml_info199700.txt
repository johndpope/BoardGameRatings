			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Takeshi is a neutral evil male half-elf with hunter and ninja levels and horse companion.  He masquerades as a samurai and is talented in horsemanship, stealth, deception, and wilderness survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of heavy multiclassing, this character uses fractional base bonuses for both saving throw and base attack bonus progression.  See &amp;ldquo;Fractional Base Bonuses&amp;rdquo; section in Chapter 1 of Pathfinder&amp;reg; Roleplaying Game: Pathfinder Unchained&amp;trade; (PZO1131).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Product Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We love our fantasy villains.  We find them in films, on posters, in commercials, on snack foods, and even as action figures.  Our societies flirt and play with villains at a safe distance, and we adore them.  That same sense of awe and wonder can be captured by a player roleplaying an evil character.  It does not work for all gaming groups, but for those able to handle it, the experience can be rewarding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product can serve several purposes.  Some game groups dabble in evil adventures as a one-shot or short run campaign.  Others want to experiment with evil characters and add one or two in to see how it affects the game.  Still others fully embrace evil characters and find they sometimes need replacement characters after a sudden and unexpected character death.  For whatever reason you need a ready-to-play character sheet, this product is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Wicked Wanderers!  In this product, you will discover twenty complete stat blocks for a single PC, level 1 through 20, adhering to the Pathfinder&amp;reg; Roleplaying Game rules.  The core format adheres to the standard non-player character (NPC) stat block most GMs are already familiar with minus the Tactics section.  This makes it easier for the GM to assist with finding information and also prepares the player for the day he or she is running games!  The Special Abilities section includes more detailed write-ups of feats and character abilities than a standard NPC stat block to facilitate faster play.  Sources for spells, races, classes, archetypes, and prestige classes from sources other than the Pathfinder&amp;reg; Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook&amp;trade; (PZO1110) are listed in the Sources section and can be referenced in the Pathfinder&amp;reg; Roleplaying Game Reference Document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Evil Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evil neither means &amp;ldquo;stupid&amp;rdquo; nor &amp;ldquo;irrational.&amp;rdquo;  Some evil campaigns implode because characters mistake an evil alignment for the inability to ever follow a rule or make a decision for the greater good.  Evil is an absent or inhibited sense of responsibility for the hurtful consequences of one&amp;rsquo;s own actions for society or individuals that can lead to actions others would deem &amp;ldquo;wrong.&amp;rdquo;  This does not mean an evil character does not feel love or value lawful society or desire the betterment of mankind.  In the real world, there are many evil people who would never consciously describe themselves as such.  Evil characters can work together and form bonds of friendship.  They possess many of the same insecurities, fears, hopes, dreams, and goals as other people; however, they are more willing to go to extremes to fulfill their needs.  An evil character may disregard laws in his pursuit of his desires, but in a roleplaying game setting the player still must abide by the rules of the game:  the game is about the shared story of every character and each story is equally important.  Play the evil character, and have fun!  Make sure you allow your fellow players to have fun as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
