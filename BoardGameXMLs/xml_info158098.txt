			<description>This was the first product of the Star Fleet Battles Commander's Edition.  It was originally titled only as Star Fleet Battles with the front box cover of the Star Fleet Battles (Designer's Edition) (2nd cover).  It later was named to Star Fleet Battles Volume I.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Commander's Edition of Star Fleet Battles was produced as a box set with counters, map, basic Ship System Display (SSD) sheets and a 96 page rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A separate &amp;quot;Rulebook Only&amp;quot; version with a blue 3-ring binder was also available for previous owners of Star Fleet Battles who had the counters, map and the basic SSD sheets.  The rulebook was designed to be disassembled and put in a 3 ring binder.  New rules could then be added to the binder and rule updates and expansions replaced existing pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other expansions for the Commander's Edition of Star Fleet Battles included SSD books.  Each of these expansions contained 48 revised and new SSD's which were larger then the basic SSD's and had charts for weapons and movement along with other locations to track Ship Systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edition of the game was designated as Star Fleet Battles Commander's Edition, and was the third edition of the Star Fleet Battles series.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;Star Fleet Battles Volume I of the Commander's Edition included everything from the old boxed Star Fleet Battles (Designer's Edition), plus all the errata from the 3 expansions for Star Fleet Battles (Designer's Edition), and certain rules from them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Star Fleet Battles&lt;br/&gt;     Star Fleet Battles Designer's Edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented-by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Star Fleet Battles Captain's Edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
