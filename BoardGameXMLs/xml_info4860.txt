			<description>One in the series of &amp;quot;Max Haines Invites You To An Evening of Murder (tm)&amp;quot; party games. Plays like the &amp;quot;How to Host a Murder&amp;quot; series. This particular edition is Rodeo Roundup. From the box...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crime Scene: It's a wild west rodeo...with bucking broncs, chuckwagon races, and juicy steaks cooked on an outdoor barbecue.  But when champion rodeo rider, Peter Bums, is mysteriously trampled by a wild bronc named Midnight...the scene turns to murder...saddle up, you may be a suspect...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Suspects:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lloyd Hockley: A rival rodeo rider.  How far would he go to win the championship?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Susan Smithers: Pete's steady girl...a handful of trouble for any man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Shorty' Jones: A hard-bitten old prospector down on his luck...had he finally 'struck' gold?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Annie Logan: A rodeo star famous for her dangerous riding stunts...Who  was 'spuring' her on to these dare-devil antics?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slim Gibbons: A handlebar-mustached barkeep from the local 'saloon'.  Was his only crime serving watered-down whiskey?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maggie: A sexy western singer in town for the rodeo...she'll do anything to get her way...and her man!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jimmy Jack: Pete's hired ranch hand.  A full-blooded Indian...skilled with the knife and bow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kate Brennan: A wealthy widow who has inherited the neighboring ranch and a long-standing feud.
