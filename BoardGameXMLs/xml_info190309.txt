			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not including the stereotypical hat, cauldron broomstick and familiar, a witch can often be found to be a good source of potions and brews, with the two terms often being used interchangeably by both the witch and the drinker. These brews often have odd and nasty sounding ingredients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This generator, or series of tables, is designed to help flesh out any needed details you require. Use all of them or just one, they are entirely optional.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring tables for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Brewing method - Does the brew need to be stirred all the time or during a full moon?&lt;br/&gt;    Effect of the potion/brew, from bravery to curing a rash&lt;br/&gt;    A d100 table with 100 possible ingredients, many with linked sub-tables to further expand the details and options; Instead of &amp;quot;Blood of Dog&amp;quot;, you could have blood of cat, elephant or something else&lt;br/&gt;    Duration of the brew&lt;br/&gt;    Possible side effects from consuming this potion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
