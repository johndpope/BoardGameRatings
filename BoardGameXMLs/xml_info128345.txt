			<description>Flames of War is a World War II tabletop game where you use armies represented by painted miniature tanks, soldiers, artillery, and aircraft against another similar opponent's force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin all you need is the Flames of War book/rules and a starting force of miniatures depending on what type of army you want to collect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses 15mm scale (around 1:100) miniatures, allowing miniatures from other manufacturers to be used. The game aspires to provide a good balance between playability and simulation and has a typical game running under 2 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flames of War: Achtung! is a two-player starter set with the 3rd Edition Rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Achtung! has been carefully designed for someone who has never heard of Flames Of War before, or has seen the 296 page rulebook and not known where to start. Achtung! is not a simplified set of the Flames Of War rules, but rather a complete introductory box for a new player!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
