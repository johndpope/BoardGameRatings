			<description>From the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coming up on the heading...IMPACT!&lt;br/&gt;Flight Commander 2 puts YOU in command of the strike force hunting SCUD sites during Operation Desert Storm, or leading a Wild Weasel flight into North Vietnam.  Dive your F-86 Sabres out of the sun into a swarm of Red Chinese MIGs, or knock out Soviet T-80 tanks leading the advance into West Germany!  Flight Commander's Scenario Generator lets you dictate opponents, level of difficulty, and time periods from the Korean War to the present and beyond!  Choose from 5 different campaigns or use the Point &amp;amp; Click Battle Generator to create new scenarios!  You will never run out of fresh challenges.  No two missions are ever the same!  Truly a state-of-the-art game that requires use of your brain, not a joystick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Addendum:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flight Commander 2 is a game of tactical jet air combat in the modern, post-World War II era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the focus is on missile-equipped modern aircraft, earlier gun ordnance of the Korean War is also included for aircraft of that era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both air-to-air and ground attack missions and campaigns may be flown, with the point of view of the player being top-down onto a map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
