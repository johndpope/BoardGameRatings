			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I used to be so foolish. I used to think that the world was too small for me, that I was always destined to break through the invisible doors that kept me enclosed among the mundane. Oh, and I was right about that &amp;mdash; and I was terribly wrong, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh yes, I was always destined to break through those doors. I&amp;rsquo;ve done it. But I was wrong when I thought the world was too small. It isn&amp;rsquo;t. It&amp;rsquo;s too large. There&amp;rsquo;s so much space out there between the stars and behind the doors&amp;hellip; so much space that the things that should never have come to be thrive out there, pulsing and growing and waiting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waiting for fools like me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash; Chashmal of the Mysterium&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For use with The World of Darkness and Mage: The Awakening rulebooks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A collection of dangerous threats for any Mage game, antagonists ranging from the living mage to horrors born of no womb&lt;br/&gt;     A treatment of Mage as a potential horror game, with advice on how to bring the terrifying, maddening and gruesome elements of magic into a chronicle&lt;br/&gt;     Dangers that go beyond simple entities &amp;mdash; constructs, locales, even conditions and infections poised to plague the Awakened&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
