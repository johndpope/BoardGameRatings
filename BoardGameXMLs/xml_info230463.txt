			<description>Players race along paths through a typical farm setting to reach their bus. They can travel along multiple routes that can either detour them along a shorter path or delay them by sending back to an earlier space on the default track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spaces can be described by various encounter scenarios such as drawing cards from the Hay or Straw decks, moving a certain number of spaces, or switching places with other players.&lt;br/&gt;Encounters that will distract and delay the players include being sent to visit animal spaces such as chickens, sheep, and pigs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
