							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">With the Band</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;With the Band&amp;rdquo; is a Star Wars Roleplaying Game miniadventure for four heroes of 9th level. The era-independent scenario takes place well outside the bounds of what most would consider polite society. The current political situation in your campaign matters very little, except insofar as you elect to tie the Gamemaster characters in this adventure to your ongoing storyline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;With the Band&amp;rdquo; can be modified for heroes of higher level by increasing skill check DCs by one point for every level the average hero exceeds 9 and by making the crowd more violent. By default, the crowd at a Distraction concert is only prone to violence against one another, though you are always free to have them act against the heroes as is cinematically appropriate. For a greater challenge for groups well above 9th level, feel free to include a particularly vicious gang in the crowd (using the stats for mid-level pirates from the Star Wars Roleplaying Game revised core rulebook).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;With the Band&amp;rdquo; can be modified for characters of lower level by minimizing the involvement of the crowd, and lowering skill check DCs proportional to average character level. Note that logistical issues (such as payment) are intentionally left vague; shape the rewards to what is appropriate in your era and game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
