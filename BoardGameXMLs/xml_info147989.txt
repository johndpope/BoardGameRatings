							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Old Morgue</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 16 x 20 inch map of an Old Morgue, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play. The map suits Modern or SciFi rpg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Morgue module is a single map suitable for use inside of either a hospital or mortuary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main door is in the bottom middle of the map. The room is in poor condition, the floor is gritty and dirty, and much of the metal in the room has become rusted over time. The room is filled with cadaver dissection trays as well as tool trays. The northeast corner has a U-shaped counter and has many medicine cabinets filled with supplies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The western and southern walls each have several cooled storage containers for storing dead cadavers built inside the walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Morgue can be used in settings ranging from the late nineteenth century to the modern era. The Morgue is a good map to use as a backdrop for an investigation such as an autopsy to discover how someone died in a detective game. The Morgue excels as a centerpiece to a Horror-themed adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventures in the morgue can start with bells ringing, as someone who they thought was dead is found to be still alive. They bring in the mistakenly deceased family to apologize profusely for their error and to reunite them with their dead relative. But when they enter the morgue, something is clearly off about their relative, unable to speak except in grunts and moans, and he even begins to lunge at his relatives and the medical staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The attendants and relatives run screaming from the room, barring the door. A frantic head nurse calls the police describing the man as going berserk probably as a result of shock. The Player Characters could be sent in as detectives investigating what is really going on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This could lead to a swarm of cadavers swarming out from the storage chambers in the morgue when they enter the room or perhaps they need to merely defeat one really strong zombie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
