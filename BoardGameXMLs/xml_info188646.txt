			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have found yourself in the lands of Baron Rogaris. The lands here are known for being peaceful and orderly under the baron's rule, so you have decided to come here to make some money and avoid mortal danger for a while. However, you have never been too successful on that front. However, it's not for want of trying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each adventure book for Legend of the Wayfarer presents a solitaire adventure for use with the game.  These proceed, typically, by presenting a paragraph or so of text followed by a test or decision which leads to another page.  Each adventure book also has a page of random numbers in case the player is in a location that does not facilitate die rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
