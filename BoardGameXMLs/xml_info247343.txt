							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">V&#039;lar: Common Craft</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The V&amp;rsquo;lar are a race of jellyfish-like aliens who typically travel about attached to a humanoid host whom they puppet via filaments insinuated into the host&amp;rsquo;s nervous system. Their ships are a hybrid design utilizing common technological elements (such as engines and weapons) built into an organically grown hull.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that the V&amp;rsquo;lar will be replaced by whatever alien races inhabit your particular game setting and that the ships will be used for fully biological, plant, or even undead craft in addition to hybrid designs. The PDF documents include renderings and orthographic views to support these alternate themes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three common V&amp;rsquo;lar ship types are included in this product. First up is the Coleoptera-class cargo ship, commonly called the &amp;ldquo;Beetle&amp;rdquo; due to its shape. It features a huge cargo hold, carries a crew of 14, and is lightly armed. Next is the Pestilence-class, or &amp;ldquo;Manta&amp;rdquo;, bomber. This combat ship carries an impressive amount of ordnance - either bombs and bioweapons for planetary assault, or ship to ship missiles for space combat. The Manta is also equipped with several automated plasma arc turrets and a breaching bore for boarding actions. It requires a crew of four and has eighteen additional pods for soldiers. Lastly, the Bucrania-class heavy fighter is presented. Originally dubbed the &amp;ldquo;Ox Skull&amp;rdquo;, it is now usually just called a &amp;ldquo;Skull Fighter&amp;rdquo;. With a crew of two, this craft is equipped for dogfights as well as either bombing runs or missile attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The V&amp;rsquo;lar Common Craft package contains five highly detailed, layered PDF files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Main Book&lt;br/&gt;         33 page PDF file detailing the ships and interior areas.&lt;br/&gt;         Contains 3D rendered scenes as well as orthographic views of the ships in various themes.&lt;br/&gt;         Includes system independent statistics designed for easy adaptation to your game of choice.&lt;br/&gt;         Background, art, and text are on different layers for custom display and printing.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Map Pages&lt;br/&gt;         29 page PDF file containing complete interior maps and instructions for assembly.&lt;br/&gt;         Miniature-scale maps for tactical combat with an optional 1 inch = 5 ft grid.&lt;br/&gt;         Divided into pages for easy printing in full color or printer-friendly black and white.&lt;br/&gt;         Selectable layers include: grid, black &amp;amp; white version, and optional objects.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Uncut Map Images&lt;br/&gt;         Three single page PDF files containing huge images (32x44, 53x53 and 7x9 inches) of the Beetle, Manta, and Skull maps so you can see the whole thing at once at 1 inch = 5 ft scale.&lt;br/&gt;         Select either a light or dark background (for printing or projection/display).&lt;br/&gt;         Includes layers for grid, black &amp;amp; white version, optional cargo, and background choice.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Giant JPEG images of the uncut maps are also provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
