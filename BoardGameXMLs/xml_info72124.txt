							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Citadel (Commodore 64)</name>
									
			<description>Not to be confused with the BBC Micro adventure game Citadel (BBC Micro) by Superior Software (UK).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Citadels is a science-fiction themed puzzle game for the Commodore 64, programmed and composed by Martin Walker and published by Electric Dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a top-view square-gridded scrolling environment. The player controls a hover craft and the goal is to find the way out. Each stage has a number of power switches that will open or close doors, teleports that will transport the hover craft, and among the obstacles there are turrets that will fire and destroy the hovercraft if it comes within a certain range and direction; some turrets fire only diagonally, while some fire orthogonally. The hovercraft can also equip several types of weapons to be able to destroy these turrets prior to passing them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the arcade-feel of the game, it is in practice turn-based, as very few enemies will make a move unless the player moves, thus the game is a tactical puzzle/maze game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a fairly late C64 game and the graphics are astounding for the platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits:&lt;br/&gt;Martin Walker: Program, graphics, music&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
