			<description>Hilarious party game with just the right mix of creativity and creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic Rules&lt;br/&gt;1. To start the game, each player draws a Challenge Card.&lt;br/&gt;2. One randomly chosen player is elected Reader and pulls a Topic Card. The Reader picks a topic&lt;br/&gt;of their choosing from the Topic Card and reads it aloud.&lt;br/&gt;3. All of the other players answer the question on separate pieces of scratch paper abiding by their&lt;br/&gt;Challenge Card and passes it face down to the Reader.&lt;br/&gt;4. While answers are submitted, the Reader should check handwriting so answers have full effect&lt;br/&gt;when read aloud.&lt;br/&gt;5. The Reader shuffles all of the answers and shares each answer with the group, pausing in between&lt;br/&gt;reading each one. The answer with the most laughs wins a point.&lt;br/&gt;6. After the round, a new player becomes the Reader and everyone re&amp;shy;draws a Challenge Card.&lt;br/&gt;7. The player who reaches 10 points first wins. You can alter the win condition to your game&lt;br/&gt;environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topic Cards:&lt;br/&gt;Words...&lt;br/&gt;Creatively define the word given, but don&amp;rsquo;t worry about coming anywhere close to the real definition!&lt;br/&gt;Just give it whatever meaning strikes you.&lt;br/&gt;Famous People...&lt;br/&gt;Tell us what He or She is famous for...your version anyway. Create an elaborate back story to the&lt;br/&gt;person or tell us a creative tale involving this person.&lt;br/&gt;Movie Titles...&lt;br/&gt;Come up with a terribly clever plot line for the film listed. Is it a documentary? Maybe a hushed noir&lt;br/&gt;film of yesteryear?&lt;br/&gt;Laws...&lt;br/&gt;Fill in the blanks to complete these laws. Your answer can be as long or as short as necessary to&lt;br/&gt;get your point across.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
