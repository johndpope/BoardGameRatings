			<description>Back cover summary: &amp;quot;Everything you need and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Imperial Jack's Trading Post! In this one of a kind shop, you will find everything you need and more!&lt;br/&gt;     Your company is readying for that overland journey. How much does a barrel cost?&lt;br/&gt;     Your gumshoe is hot on the trail of the mad scientist, but must stop at the bar to talk to his informant. How much does the beer cost?&lt;br/&gt;     Your musketeer has served the king of France for more than a decade.&lt;br/&gt;But the incident in the church proved costly. Now you must replace all those destroyed religious implements. How long does it take to make a brazier anyway?&lt;br/&gt;     The ignorant peasants have no idea that you are a powerful alchemist on the edge of making the most important discovery of all time. But you must have three more rolls of copper wire...&lt;br/&gt;     This is the ultimate equipment sourcebook for use with any RPG system! On these pages, you will find full equipment lists for all eras, from Stone Age to Modern. Each era has its own list showing prices for the era as well as production time and availability. In addition, each list is sorted by type of product: from food products to weapons and armor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are some of the other cool things found inside:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A discussion of technology in each era (which helps to define an era).&lt;br/&gt;     Over 1,200 illustrations.&lt;br/&gt;     Listings of equipment broken down by historical era.&lt;br/&gt;     Many, many listed items of equipment -- from a dozen eggs, to canned milk, to steamer trunks, to pocket calculators, etc.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
