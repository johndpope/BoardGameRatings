			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob limped out of the elevator car. His eyes burned like a man possessed. Dragging his right leg, Jacob hobbled down the garden pathway. The rooftop park was a veritable Garden of Eden, but Jacob only had death on his mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seeing the man seated on a stone bench, Jacob calmly lifted his ASP pistol. &amp;quot;This ends here,&amp;quot; Jacob called out, his words echoing throughout the garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;No truer words have been spoken,&amp;quot; the man replied as he sprung up with superhuman speed, drew out a shotgun concealed under his long flowing duster and pulled the trigger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do you go from here? To the battle map, of course! If you need a map of a modern structure, you need Modern Floorplans. The Modern Floorplans series from Fabled Environments offers gamers high quality maps in a variety of configurations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Want to draw it out yourself? Use the 8.5&amp;times;11 map as a guide.&lt;br/&gt;     Want to simply drop the map on the table and play? Use either the 24&amp;times;36 full map (if you have access to a plotter printer) or print the tiled version on regular paper and assemble a full-size version yourself in a matter of minutes. Both versions are scaled at 1 inch equals 5 feet.&lt;br/&gt;     In addition, each floorplan also comes in versions without room labels and without furniture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: All floorplans are rendered in black and white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All maps are created by an architectural drafter using AutoCAD. This gives all of the maps the realistic feel that your players crave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map is designed to serve as a rooftop garden for Modern Floorplans: High-Rise Building. Using the alternative design also included, this map can also be used as a small free-standing park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
