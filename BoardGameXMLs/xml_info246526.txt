			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nice and friendly. Just a couple of robot buddies tossing shotputs back and forth. But time passed, and a pleasant pastime turned faster, more intense, more deadly No more tossing back and forth. Throw it hard! Throw it fast! Threw it past your opponent! And still the game got tougher. The robots added a wall of moving neutrons side to side to protect the force fields behind them. They exchanged their shotputs for devastating energy balls. Survival took over for competition and exercise. Each shot became a matter of life and death, no longer friendly fun. Faster, faster and faster yet, they moved from side to side firing, blocking, and firing again; until their force fields, their sources short-circuited and disintegrated. No more silly game of catch; it&amp;rsquo;s now WALLWAR!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
