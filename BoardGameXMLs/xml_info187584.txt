							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Loop Inc.: Expansion Cards</name>
									
			<description>This Limited Edition expansion adds 14 new cards to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anomalies (4 cards)&lt;br/&gt;Every time you go back in time, anomalies are added to the game. More anomalies means more variability!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future (5 cards)&lt;br/&gt;Instead of going back in time, you have the option of going into the future. Futures add a bit more complexity to the game, as each future trip allows you to take a bonus action. If you play the future right, you can unlock some fantastic combinations!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Office (5 cards)&lt;br/&gt;The Office action cards replace the simple Trash action cards in the game. Now, instead of merely removing components in order prevent the loss of points, you can time your actions to gain points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cards were included for free for all backers of Loop Inc. on Kickstarter. However, these extras are available for purchase separately. None are Kickstarter-exclusive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
