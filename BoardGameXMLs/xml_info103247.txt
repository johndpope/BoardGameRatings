			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt; Super Hero Squad Online is your chance to fly a mile in the boots of Marvel&amp;rsquo;s greatest heroes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team up with friends in exhilarating combat missions against iconic Marvel villains.  You can play solo or in squads up to four players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect rooms, paints and objects for your helicarrier HQ.  Decorate them and fill them with items your heroes interact with.  Feed your heroes to keep them happy.  Players can interact with objects in the HQ as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Show off your collection of heroes in multiple interactive world environments based on 70 years of Marvel comics and movies.  Each hero has several emotes to entertain yourself and other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play a collectable strategy card game against other players or against AI villains in challenge quests.  Build the deck you want from your card collection, or use an automatic deck builder to make new decks to play with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect crafting items to create &amp;quot;potions&amp;quot; for temporary character modifications in the interactive game worlds, craft sidekicks for the characters, upgrades for sidekicks, or even whole characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most activities - missions, card game, interacting with game world environment reward players with prizes and/or game currency called fractals, after a main storyline of the Super Hero Squad Show.  The currency is used to buy new heroes, unlock highest levels for heroes, buy sidekicks, HQ rooms and objects, goodies for your heroes, mystery boxes, missions, cards and &amp;quot;card quests&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major update on June 26, 2014 replaced a prize wheel and the original currency system with a new system.  The previous challenge system was replaced with a new achievement system for further ways to earn in-game rewards.  That update also switched the starting characters for players from Cyclops, Falcon, Ms. Marvel and Thing to Black Widow, Hulk, Iron Man and Spider-man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
