			<description>From the game document:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cocaine follows the path cocaine traces through the global economy, the fabric of societies, and the lives of users. The game is organized in five phases. The phases proceed backwards along the drug&amp;rsquo;s route: starting with treatment then addiction, sale, enforcement and ending with production. The treatment phase of the game frames the others. Play starts with players taking the role of patients in a group treatment facility. Through monologues and improvised scenes, players reveal memories of how cocaine impacted their characters&amp;rsquo; lives. In between these group therapy scenes, the game shifts to the other stages. Each of these phases opens with an improv game by which players quickly establish situations related to the theme of the phase. Then players play the situations further and resolve them through mini poker games. Throughout the game, players are collecting coins when they improv and then wagering the money during the card games. After all five phases of the game are finished, the amount of money each player has determines whether their character was successfully cured of their cocaine addiction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
