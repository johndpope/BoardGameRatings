			<description>A push-your-luck dexterity game with cards. &lt;br/&gt;As a chef at TOSS pancake house, you flip pancakes in front of the customers whilst entertaining them with your frying pan skills. Get enough positive feedback and you could win the coveted 'Employee of the Month' trophy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each pancake has a different action/skill to perform. The more cards you decide to draw, the more actions you'll have to perform at the same time, but the greater the reward should you succeed in tossing the stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards feature frying pans, pancakes with different toppings, score tracker and trophy.&lt;br/&gt;You'll also need 2 to 4 small cubes or similar (1 colour per player) to track scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TOSS was voted Best Dexterity Game in the 2016 9 Card Nanogame PnP Design Contest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
