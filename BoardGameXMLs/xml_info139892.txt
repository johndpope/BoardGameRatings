							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mage Hunt</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One Wrong Word&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic is primal, magic is powerful, magic is a matter of precision.  With one wrong word, the intent of a spell can be changed, and its effect can be perverted by desire or even the balance of the Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It took only one wrong word... one wrong letter in a translation of an ancient text... and a horror is unleashed upon the world.  If only it were merely a freaky tentacle monster bent of the despoilment of all it touched, but it's worse.  Much worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's called Khadibariffi, and it is the punishment of the Universe on mages who reach too far.  Of course, those who summoned it are the first victims, but now that it's here, it will not stop until it has punished all mages of their civilization, and the very civilization itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mage Hunt has begun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meet Khadibariffi, learn how he either consumes his victims, or puts them through the brutal and traumatic process of becoming his slaves.  Learn of spells never before seen on Earth that exist to allow warfare against magic users, and see the dread Thralls of Khadibariffi that exist only to serve his dark will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a supplement for Hot Chicks: The RPG. You will need the core rulebook to play. As it contains strong sexual material and very disturbing content, you may also need a copy of our dark erotica supplement, Inner Darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also references to the cantrips found in Little Magics, you may find that book useful for reference as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
