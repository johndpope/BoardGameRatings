			<description>You will meet many new characters in Face de bouc, but alas, they have no names and must be given titles by those around the table. Whoever can best remember these titles when meeting them again will score well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a first pass through the deck, as players reveal the character cards they take turns making up names for them &amp;mdash; Mister Watermelon Head, Cake Trunk, etc. &amp;mdash; then they shuffle the characters together once again. Whenever a character is revealed, the first player to state the correct name claims all of the cards in the stack; if no one remembers the name, the player who flipped the character gives it a name, then the next player flips a new card on top of the present one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all the cards have been claimed, whoever has the most cards wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
