			<description>Plants grow, flower and wilt away as they produce seeds for the next year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flora is a quick and simple game played through four short seasons. During Winter, the game is set up. During Spring, players add tiles into an empty play area to form an initial group in any shape. During Summer, the group changes and grows as the players add two tiles and take one away each turn. The first gist of the game is that all these three actions must be used on different colours. Finally during Autumn, only one player takes a single tile and the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second gist is that at the end of the game, the value of a collected tile is based on the tiles remaining in the group: multiple small, separate areas of the same colour make it valuable, but many of them might vanish or be easily connected into one large area, resulting in lots of negative points. Players also have control over the game's length and Autumn can arrive unexpectedly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic two-player game has no structural hidden elements, it consists only of 11 red tiles, 13 blue tiles and 15 yellow tiles, and the rules are easily adaptable for thematic additions and personal variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
