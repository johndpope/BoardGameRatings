			<description>You take on the role of world saviors. You and your team are represented by your colored pawn and you try to find the best solutions for controlling the Disasters and earn Merit points (i.e. Victory points) for that. There are colored fields on &lt;br/&gt;the game board showing potential Disaster Epicenters. The type of the Disaster and the Epicenter location are determined by a die roll (place) and a card draw (type). An Epicenter token is then placed on the place of the Disaster&amp;rsquo;s origin on &lt;br/&gt;the Game board and Spread tokens are placed on the adjacent fields. Players use various Vehicles during their Turns to travel to as many Epicenter and Spread tokens as possible and take care of them. Each token collected in this way results &lt;br/&gt;in a Merit point. But Disasters spread and evolve. If the players do not manage to contain them in time, they can strike in full force. In this case all players must return &lt;br/&gt;the Epicenter/Spread tokens &amp;ndash; being Merit points at the same time - in the color of that particular Disaster. To mitigate this somewhat it might be wise to trade the tokens with other players for Vehicle or Control cards, or even for Permanent &lt;br/&gt;points...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
