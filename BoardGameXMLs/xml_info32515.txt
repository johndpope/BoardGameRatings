			<description>This is a traditional native American dice game, played exclusively by men. It is also a board game, with the board created on the ground using stones and sticks as markers and pieces. Forty stones are placed in a circle to form the track; players use a stick as their marker (or horse). Players cast three wooden billets, known as Pa-tol sticks, onto a flat stone; how they fall indicates how far their piece can move. Landing on another player's piece sends it back to its start. Players may choose where they wish to enter their piece and can choose to go round the track in either direction. The winner is the first player whose marker completes a circuit of the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While ostensibly a game of chance, descriptions of the game claim that expert players can throw the sticks to get their desired results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules and more information are available here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.scienceviews.com/indian/indiangames11.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.scienceviews.com/indian/indiangames11.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
