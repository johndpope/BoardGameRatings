			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kung Fu Kuma: Races of the Islands is an expansion book for the Kung Fu Kuma campaign world and the Pathfinder Game System &amp;trade;. It expands the list of available PC races by 6, and it further includes 1 companion race (for use as friends, allies, loyal servants, and henchman, as well as NPCs). That's 7 new races available for Kung Fu Kuma campaigns, 6 of them directly for use as Player Characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One thing about all of these races, they are all Animal Folk. That is a given in the campaign world of Kung Fu Kuma. But if you purchased this book intending it for use in a different campaign world, all of these races are compatible with the general Pathfinder Game System &amp;trade;, though the Gamemaster will themselves have to come up with some reason why Animal Folk exist in that campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6 New PC Races&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not many people live out in the islands to the east, south, and southeast of Qiu Sang. And of those that do, most are Humans. Not all, though. A wide variety of Animal Folk make their lives out amongst the islands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For one reason or another, a number of Animal Folk races live solely out in the barbarian lands, ignoring the safety and civilization of Qiu Sang. This races book details seven Animal Folk races who are important amongst the barbarian tribes, six of them available as PC races. Many more races than that exist amongst the jungles and plains of the barbarian lands, but these seven are the ones most encountered when traversing barbarian lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because these are barbarian races, PCs of these races are going to be restricted from taking the 12 Clans classes of Qiu Sang. As barbarians, and likely proud of their heritage, they will be taking levels in barbarian classes alone. It is a part of the price one pays for living apart from Qiu Sang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 New Companion Races&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For some, the concept of Companion Races might be entirely new. A Companion Race is a race that is close to the PC Races in power and ability, but that is not intended for use as PCs; instead, they are intended to be used as companions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But what is a companion? Well: aides, stewards, servants, allies, and henchmen &amp;ndash; these are the main roles for Companion Races. A Companion Race is a race that could be a PC race, but for one reason or another, they don't have that special something that makes them ideal adventurers. And so, when they do become involved in adventures, they mostly play a support role.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To put that in game terms: a Companion Race is a race for characters that the Player may haves some limited control over, but which are not themselves PCs. In a world about Animal Folk, these races add a little bit more color to the world that would not otherwise be there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
