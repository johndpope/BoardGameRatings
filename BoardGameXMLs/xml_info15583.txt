			<description>This game is based on the classic 80's video game. From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this fantastic tournament, everyone vies with the roll of the dice to become the Jouster. As Jouster, try to land on a bad guy Buzzardback Rider and challenge everyone else to a rousing round of jousting. That's when the action really begins. Together, everyone flips a secret card. Will the Jouster outmatch the challengers or will the challenger outmatch them all? Win the joust, and you're the one who changes the Rider into an egg. But winner beware! An egg can &amp;quot;hatch&amp;quot; a pterodactyl that lets an opponent snatch an egg from you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object:&lt;br/&gt; To be the first player to collect five eggs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment:&lt;br/&gt; Game Board &amp;bull; 1 Jouster mover &amp;bull; 1 pterodactyl mover &amp;bull; 1 eight-sided die &amp;bull; 4 six-sided die &amp;bull; 4 Jousting Cards&lt;br/&gt; &amp;bull; 20 Rider/egg chips &amp;bull; a sheet of stick on labels (for the movers)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
