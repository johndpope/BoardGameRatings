			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic premise of the game is to acquire 10 virus-free Object cards that represent computer resources such as Graphics, Software, Web Pages, Games, Documents, and Email. Action cards provide game play strategy that allows players to introduce viruses (represented by tokens) onto their opponent&amp;rsquo;s Object cards. You can&amp;rsquo;t win unless you have 10 Object cards on your side with no virus tokens on them. Other Action cards shield your Objects from viruses (like Anti Virus), and help to clean virus tokens off your Object cards (Cleanup). There are Action cards that allow you to steal a card from another player (Piracy), remove anti-virus protection (AV Killer), or that pesky Virus Generator card (Scan), or search for a card in the discard pile (Backup). Some Action cards like Virus!, Recycle or Repair use a 6-sided die to determine how many virus tokens are placed or removed from your Object cards. This adds an aspect of chance to the game, and helps make every game you play different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A more attainable goal of playing to just 6 virus-free objects is recommended by some players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
