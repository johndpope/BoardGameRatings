							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Red Masque</name>
									
			<description>The Red Death is running rampant throughout the country, claiming countless lives. In an attempt to avoid this plague, Prince Prospero and a thousand of his closest friends have shut themselves inside the seven rooms of his castellated abbey. One night, the prince decides to throw a masquerade ball to keep his friends entertained. But while this ball is in full swing, a masked figure, of who had not been seen before, has started to make its way throughout the rooms of the abbey. Angered by this figure&amp;rsquo;s mask of a plague ridden corpse, the prince tried to kill the figure but was killed in the process. Now the prince&amp;rsquo;s nobles are hunting for the masked figure that at some point covered its mask with another. Now nobody knows who is who in this game of bluffing, deduction, and hand management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game for 2 to 6 players, the game begins with the abbey of seven rooms being built and each player receiving one role card. The roles are kept hidden as they will be revealed during game play. Each player then selects one of the seven rooms where they will start the game. On each player's turn they will have a variety of actions that will allow them to trap, kill, or reveal other players, move throughout the abbey, or use a key to unlock a trap. They can perform these actions by using the cards that they draw. The goal of the game is to be the first collect five victory points and can do so by being a Noble alive at the end of the round or by not being trapped at the end of the round if playing as The Red Death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awards&lt;br/&gt;2014 MicroGame Contest Best Theme&lt;br/&gt;2014 MicroGame Contest People's Choice - 4th Place&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
