							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mathological Liar: Grade 2</name>
									
			<description>Can you detect which suspects are the mathological liars? This card game is based on fun mini math mysteries. Each round of card play is a new case. Players are each dealt a suspect card. There are 4 suspects per case, one or more who may be guilty. One player reads aloud the case summary. Then, all players silently read their suspect&amp;rsquo;s alibi. If the math in their suspect&amp;rsquo;s alibi is correct, then he is innocent. Incorrect math indicates guilt. Players decide if their suspect is innocent or guilty and later take turns vocalizing their verdict and mathematical reasoning. Points are awarded based on correct determination of a suspect&amp;rsquo;s innocence or guilt and also for describing why the guilty party&amp;rsquo;s alibi did not jive (i.e., why the math was incorrect). The winner is the player with the most points after a pre-determined number of rounds or time limit set at the beginning of game play. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to draw on a variety of math skills to solve these whodunit mysteries as each game includes 50 different cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
