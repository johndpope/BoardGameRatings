							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Maya Pyramid</name>
									
			<description>Maya Pyramid is a card game that has some similarity to the &amp;quot;Pyramid&amp;quot; Solitaire game. As the name suggests, the game entails that players form card pyramids. However, the groups of cards used to form pyramids have to add up to 11. The game uses a deck of 42 cards and 1 joker. The functions look extremely straightforward at a glance, but the game has its own intriguing points. The game requires players to dismantle a set of 24 - 26 cards as quickly as possible. The 24 - 26 cards are face up and another set of help cards are face down. The trick is the more cards that players can dismantle without using the set of help cards, the more points they will score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
