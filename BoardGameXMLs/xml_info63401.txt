							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Deer Stalking</name>
									
			<description>In this game which is on a single sheet of paper (Approx 11&amp;quot; x 10&amp;quot; ) one player takes the deer and the others divide the 5 hunters between them. The deer is placed on the round dot in the center of the board and the hunters on dots near the ferry. Moves are made dot to dot along the lines with the hunters being unable to cross water and must use land crossings to get from place to place. The deer  can of course cross the water anywhere. If the deer gets to the moutains he wins, if the hunters trap the deer and he cannot move they win. Info obtained from Oxford University Library&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
