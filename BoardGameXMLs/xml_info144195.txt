			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sooner or later every wandering Adventurer finds his way to Sorandib, whether the aim is to hide out from authority, find work as a sell-sword or simply to loot its treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sorandib is an ancient city in catastrophic decline. While there are districts wher law and order hold sway, no single force exercises control over the whole city and outside its walls there is near anarchy to the West, while Taskan soldiers maintain some order in the East to keep the road to the imperial heartlands open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sorandib has been kept alive by two things: its control over the trade in Fengo, a drug harvested from the weeds that choke lake Barur to the North; and the creations of the Guild of Artificers, a centuries-old association of sorcerer-scientists who are famous for their inventions, feats of engineering and practical devices &amp;ndash; many of which are built into the very fabric of the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just as the Emperor owes his immortality to magic provided by the king of Sorandib, the city will surely play a role in his final ascension to the heavens. The cult of Thesh in Taskay has its eye on direct control not only of the Artificers but of the fire-demon Sorantar who is the city&amp;rsquo;s god. The Iron Simulacrum himself looks to Sorandib as the place he will discover his fate when the Emperor departs the physical plane, where he might be unmade in such a way as to find the key to a continued existence as an independent soul. Sorandib could be the scene of Treason on a world-shattering scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Age of Treason: The Iron Companion provides a comprehensive view of this famous city, including maps, floor plans, NPCs, cults, scenarios and rules for creating Artifice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also in this book are new spells, price lists, new rules for training, henchmen and hirelings, running a business and using Passion traits in the setting. Comprehensive Spirit Magic rules synthesise the Legend rules and the Setting rules into a single document, and statistics are provided for Elementals, including the bizarre Flesh Elemental, the Blemmye.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the fully detailed scenarios set in Sorandib, the Companion describes six major treasonous plots to form the backdrop for further adventures, as well as suggested plotlines for scenarios set on the wild frontiers of Marangia and Kitan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
