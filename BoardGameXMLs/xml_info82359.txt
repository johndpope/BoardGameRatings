			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pervo is a simple roleplaying game, written by Tomas HV M&amp;oslash;rkrid, who is a Norwegian games designer. This is the english version. It's all about violence!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pervo caters for the DM's need to avenge himself on all and every player he ever has been forced to entertain. No player will ever be worth anything in this game, neither their characters. Players and characters are the scum of roleplaying games. In Pervo they will be driven away and exterminated!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When leading a game of Pervo you may call yourself a DM, meaning &amp;quot;Deux ex Machina&amp;quot; (God in the machine). You may also prefer to call yourself a GM, meaning &amp;quot;Godman&amp;quot;. You may call yourself an ET, meaning &amp;quot;Egotistical&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Emotional Topman&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Elevated Terran&amp;quot; or whatever. You may call yourself anything. You may even choose to elevate your own name, making it into the most glorious title ever given to a man. You are the leader of the game, and none shall ever question your position. Your name is grace to the players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pervo is best played with a lot of players (to make them last a while). 10-20 is best. Cramp them around the table, each and every one. They must all have a small space at the edge of the table, where they can place their character-sheet (blank before the game starts) and rest their elbows (at least one of them).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the game has commenced Pervo has three rules. These rules are absolute. The DM intereprets them at his will, and no player will ever stray from them, nor dispute them or the DM's rulings on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
