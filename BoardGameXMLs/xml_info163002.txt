			<description>This is a set of rules for playing games representing small battles in the mid-Eighteenth Century period of European history, using 20-25mm size model soldiers. The rules cover the period from when all European nations adopted the three-man-deep platoon firing system up until the rise of the mass conscript armies of the Napoleonic era; very roughly A.D. 1740-1790, when musketry weight of fire ruled the battlefield. The rules do not try to recreate every aspect of 18th Century warfare; for example, the rules ignore most of the complexities of maneuver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are intended only to model the &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; tactics of the period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are designed for games using 6-12 units per side. A game like this should take about four hours for a pair of opponents familiar with the rules to complete. Typical game setup involves two fairly equal forces facing one another across a game table laid out with terrain models representing hills, woods, streams, etc. Victory conditions to win the game may vary widely, but usually one player wins when a stated number of the enemy&amp;rsquo;s units have been destroyed or routed off the game table before a set number of turns have been played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
