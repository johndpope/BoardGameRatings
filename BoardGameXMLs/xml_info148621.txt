			<description>In Circus Divas, a two-player dice-buying game, you play the owner of a Depression-era circus going from town to town parting fools and their money. But in order to do that, you need to hire some help and, ultimately, earn more than the rival circus that keeps hitting the same towns you do and draining your profits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player can hire performers for his or her circus from a common pool. Those performers each allow the player to roll one additional die for profit, from the lowly d4 to the mighty - but unpredictable - d20. But these performers can prove to be real divas. When a performer rolls a 1, he or she throws a diva's tantrum and has to be consoled - or he or she will quit. And if you're consoling one diva, you can't console another if they should have a tantrum, so choose carefully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach $100 in savings wins. Play time takes about 15 minutes and requires at least one d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20 to play. Counters for money are also helpful, but pencil and paper could work just fine. Enjoy it, and please let me know what you think!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
