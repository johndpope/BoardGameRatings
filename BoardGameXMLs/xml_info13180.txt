			<description>The playing board of F&amp;auml;rgpass consists of a 5x5 grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the first phase of the game, the players take turns filling the grid with black and white chits, one in each space except one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second phase, the players take turns placing another type of chit that has a 1x2 shape, and that has two colored dots on it: white-white, white-black or black-black. Each chit must be placed so that it corresponds to the chits placed during the first phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player that can't legally place a chit in the second phase loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
