			<description>Subtitle: The Modern Adventure RPG&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ancient Mysteries &amp;amp; Lost Treasures is a role-playing game set in the modern day. It is about a secret program in which teams consisting of highly trained field agents use covert ops and scientific research to tackle scientific, solve ancient mysteries and track down legendary treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although primarily a modern adventure-thriller game, Ancient Mysteries &amp;amp; Lost Treasures can be used to play more pulp-like adventures, in the Indiana Jones style. These games would be set in the 1930&amp;rsquo;s through to about the 1950&amp;rsquo;s but the style of game wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of Ancient Mysteries &amp;amp; Lost Treasures is brimming with exploration, conspiracies, adventure and discovery.  It should take the characters across the world and back again; to ruins of lost civilizations, sites of mysterious power, underwater caverns, Aztec temples, Egyptian tombs,  Atlantean  palaces and Tibetan monasteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is about age-old secrets guarded by or sought by secret societies, shadowy cabals and other enemy groups competing for the same goals or opposing the PCs every step of the way in a race against time; the Templars, the Masons, the Illuminati, Nazis and other covert governmental or religious agencies are all possibilities in a game of Ancient Mysteries &amp;amp; Lost Treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add into the mix a legendary artifact or a world-shattering discovery hidden away by the ancients &amp;ndash; the Holy Grail, the Ark of the Covenant, Excalibur, the Spear of Destiny, scientific discoveries before their time, the secret of eternal youth or evidence of alien visitors to earth or something else that will rock current scientific thought to its foundations and you have the ingredients for a rollicking good game of Ancient Mysteries &amp;amp; Lost Treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
