			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dear Boss,&lt;br/&gt;I keep on hearing the police have caught me but they wont fix me just yet. I have laughed when they look so clever and talk about being on the right track. That joke about Leather Apron gave me real fits. I am down on whores and I shant quit ripping them till I do get buckled. Grand work the last job was. I gave the lady no time to squeal. How can they catch me now. I love my work and want to start again. You will soon hear of me with my funny little games. I saved some of the proper red stuff in a ginger beer bottle over the last job to write with but it went thick like glue and I cant use it. Red ink is fit enough I hope ha. ha. The next job I do I shall clip the ladys ears off and send to the police officers just for jolly wouldn't you. Keep this letter back till I do a bit more work, then give it out straight. My knife's so nice and sharp I want to get to work right away if I get a chance. Good Luck.&lt;br/&gt;Yours truly&lt;br/&gt;Jack the Ripper&lt;br/&gt;Dont mind me giving the trade name&lt;br/&gt;PS Wasnt good enough to post this before I got all the red ink off my hands curse it No luck yet. They say I'm a doctor now. ha ha&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this letter a dark legend was born. Jack the Ripper was probably not the first serial killer but he was the first to become a media sensation and possibly (if the letters he sent were genuine) the first to seek the attention of the newly powerful media for himself. Whether the letters were genuine or not, their affect on the public was profound. The populace's fear was heightened and the police, especially the newly formed Scotland Yard were made to look like fools, taunted by a killer just out of reach. The sensation created by the &amp;quot;Dear Boss&amp;quot; letter is one that has been imitated by later serial killers to the point that sending taunting letters to the media and police has become one of the signatures of the true serial killer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This short Blood and Relics (2nd Edition) sourcebook presents the Redjacks, a cult that worships &amp;quot;Saucy Jack&amp;quot;, a creature of pure hate. They kill at his behest, killing women, disemboweling or beheading them and performing the rituals of sacrifice on the streets themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your job? Stop the Redjacks if at all possible. Keep the Ripper out of our world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
