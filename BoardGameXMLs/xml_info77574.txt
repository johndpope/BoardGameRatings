			<description>Crash Tag Team Racing is a racing video game published by Sierra Entertainment and developed by Radical Entertainment for the PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, Xbox and PlayStation Portable. The player takes control of Crash Bandicoot, who must retrieve the Black Power Gem of Ebenezer Von Clutch, along with the missing Power Gems in each of the five themed areas of the park. The player will compete in races and minigames to earn Wumpa Coins, the park's currency, and Power Crystals, find the Power Gem needed to open up the five areas of the park, and ultimately unveil the mystery of the Power Gem thief's identity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the player explores the park, race gates can be entered to unlock new racetracks, battle arenas, stunt tracks, and driving minigames. Extra Wumpa Coins and Power Crystals can be earned by playing driving minigames, some of which involve driving for the best lap time, crashing into as many obstacles as possible, shooting at trackside objects, and shooting at moving cars. Characters with an icon over their heads can be talked to unlock cars, weapon upgrades, clothing, or to play minigames. The player can smash crates and collect Wumpa Coins in order to buy rewards such as new clothing; drinking Wumpa Whip gives the player a temporary coin multiplier that earns extra money from Wumpa Coins and crates. Collecting Power Crystals is required to unlock the Power Gem at the end of a themed area, which unlocks an additional area of the theme park. Mini-cartoons, called &amp;quot;Die-O-Ramas&amp;quot;, can also be unlocked; these cutscenes display Crash being killed off in various, and largely humorous ways. Unlocking all 34 Die-O-Ramas unlocks another costume for Crash. The Die-O-Ramas can be viewed at any time under the Extras section in the main menu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main hook of Crash Tag Team Racing is the &amp;quot;clashing&amp;quot; feature found during the racing sections of the game. The player can &amp;quot;clash&amp;quot; with another vehicle by pressing a certain button depending on the gaming platform. The player's vehicle will merge with a nearby opponent's vehicle, and the player will then take control of a powerful turret weapon to shoot at other vehicles. The turret can not only be used to shoot at enemy cars, but also to take out incoming attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Crash Tag Team Racing,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
