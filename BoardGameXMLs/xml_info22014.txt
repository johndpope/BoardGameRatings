			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;GO mental&amp;reg; FUNDAmental can be played either as a stand-alone game or in conjunction with the classic GO mental&amp;reg; so that younger and older players can play, learn and enjoy together!  Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a kid or just a kid at heart, no one&amp;rsquo;s left out.  And, with the Junior Rules, players even younger than 8 can join in with cards you design especially for them! With GO mental&amp;reg; FUNDAmental the entire family can GO mental&amp;reg; at the same time!&lt;br/&gt; Plus, with questions carefully tailored not just towards what kids know or should know but also to what kids care about, with GO mental&amp;reg; FUNDAmental, the interest never flags.  It mixes a cunning kaleidoscope of education and entertainment, school stuff and cool stuff, in a constantly changing flurry of facts and fun from math and music to Mary Kate and Ashley; from science and sports to SpongeBob and Spiderman; from geography and history to Star Wars and dinosaurs; from basic biology to Bob the Builder.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
