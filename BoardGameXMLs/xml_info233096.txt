			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;仔ぶた急便 (Piglet's Delivery Service)&lt;br/&gt;Once upon a time Mother Pig asked her piglets to delivery some packages. In order to deliver the packages, the piglets decided to form their own delivery companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When delivering a package for receipt confirmation they received a hoof print rather than a signature. Each of the piglets' companies compete to see who makes the speediest deliveries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, the goal is to move the three pig pieces to the four home bases (other than your own) and collect four hoof print chips before anyone else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls three piglets, starting with all three piglet pieces placed on their home base. There are a total of 5 home bases, one for each player from the center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, players also draw animal tiles and add them to their hand. After drawing a tile, the player carries out all of the following actions, in any order, during their turn: moving a piglet, placing an animal tile, and returning a piglet. Throw away tiles to ensure a player&amp;rsquo;s hand does not exceed three tiles. The game ends when a player successfully moves their piglets to the other four home bases and collects all the hoof prints to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving a piglet - This action, in combination with the below action (placing an animal tile), can only be carried out a maximum of three times during a single turn (e.g., place one animal tile + move 2 spaces).  A player may move their piglet one space in any direction. The player can also use the secret passage spaces to travel even further. However, except for the home base spaces, a piglet cannot move to a space that is already occupied by another piglet. In addition, if a piglet moves onto a space with an animal tile placed on it, they must obey the law of that tile. If a piglet successfully moves to a home base, they can receive the hoof print from that base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Placing an animal tile - This action, in combination with the above action (moving a piglet), can only be carried out a maximum of three times (e.g., place two animal tiles + move 1 spaces). A player places an animal tile from their hand onto an open space. An open space is a space where no animal tiles or piglets are currently placed. However, some tiles can take the place of other tiles and some tiles cannot be placed on some spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Returning a piglet - This action can be used an unlimited number of times per turn. Move one piglet that is not currently placed on your home base back to your home base. At the same time, you can add a tile (without a piglet piece placed on top) into your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ある日、お母さんぶたは仔ぶたたちに荷物運びのお手伝いを頼みました。子ぶたたちは荷物を運ぶために運送会社を作りました。荷物を渡したら、サインの代わりに足跡のハンコを貰います。&lt;br/&gt;さあ競争です。誰よりも早くみんなの家に荷物を運んでしまいましょう。&lt;br/&gt;このゲームの目的は、3匹の仔ぶたコマを動かして自分以外の4か所の拠点を回り、他の誰よりも早く4つの足跡チップを集めることです。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
