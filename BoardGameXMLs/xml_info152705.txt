			<description>The goal of the game is to eliminate all other players and be the last with a tent on the board. To accomplish this, the players have to search for gold and steal tents from each other. The tents are moved by the roll of a die. If a tent reaches a space with an opposing tent, it's put over this tent and has captured it. Captured tents can be freed by the same maneuver. Freed and captured tents can be secured or released by taking them to one's base camp. Tents arriving at the gold claim at the center of the board get one goldnugget. For 3 nuggets a player can get a captured tent back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
