			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dementium II is a survival horror game developed by Renegade Kid for the Nintendo DS. It is the sequel to Dementium: The Ward, and takes place five weeks after the events of the first game. The player controls William Redmoor after he wakes up in the Bright Dawn Treatment centre shortly after having brain surgery. Once he is returned to his cell, the world shifts into an evil form allowing him to escape. This world-shifting mechanic is present throughout the game. Game mechanics are similar to Dementium II&amp;rsquo;s predecessor, but this game improves on mobility, allowing the player to jump and crouch as well as an updated map system that shows areas that have already been explored. Items can also be carried for later use. Dementium II can be completed in approximately 5 hours by a seasoned gamer, which makes it shorter than many other action adventure games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
