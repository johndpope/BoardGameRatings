			<description>A One Round Living Jungle Adventure for Mid/High-Level Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ancient Enemy #3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrible things are happening in the jungle!  It started a few moons ago, when some of you were sent on a mission to make peace with the snake people.  Odd as that sounds, Bengoukee insisted that the snake people were vital to the survival of Malatra.  And when you went, you were indeed able to make peace, with difficulty.  But the worst part of it was the vision you witnessed.  And those of you who were not there have heard the story many times in the past few months.  Tiger is returning!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
