			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTES FROM THE TIME MACHINE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I wrote &amp;quot;Demon Bean Falling&amp;quot; in the winter of 1994/1995, when I was a senior at the University of Notre Dame. I'd been running a regular RIFTS campaign for my friends since 1990, and had become obsessed with two things: becoming a writer, and working for Palladium Books. The material in this book (along with the material in its companion, &amp;quot;The Banwok Hunters&amp;quot;) reflect a lot of the original material I wrote and used in my ongoing RIFTS campaign during that time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I submitted both the manuscript for this book and &amp;quot;The Banwok Hunters&amp;quot; to Palladium Books in the spring of 1995. For a while, it looked like Palladium might publish them. Ultimately, they didn't. I learned a lot from that experience, though, and ultimately it helped me to get published, and to become a better writer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both &amp;quot;Demon Heart Falling&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Banwok Hunters&amp;quot; were put in storage, and were forgotten. I moved on to other games, and other things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast-forward just about fifteen years later, to the fall of 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While looking for some other old games in the attic, I found one of the original copies of &amp;quot;Demon Heart Falling&amp;quot; - probably the only copy still in existence. I'd printed some copies of it for my friends way back in the day, complete with a cover and comb binding. I'd assumed that all copies - including my own - were long-lost to the ravages of time. Wrong. Here was the last copy, staring me in the face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I re-read it. And liked it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not the greatest book in the world, I'II be honest. For that matter, it's probably not good. It's decent. It's an excellent reflection of the author I was back then - raw, hungry, passionate, and practically exploding with ideas. It lacks a lot of the polish and refinement needed from a more experienced writer, which could've made it into something far better than what it was. But it's not terrible. It's just a glimpse at the author I was, and the author I would become.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I present it to you, for your enjoyment. If you can use any of this stuff in your own RIFTS game, awesome. Let me know about it. If not ... well, I hope you enjoy what you read, and it at least makes you smile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warts, flaws and all, I'm proud of this one. It told me that I could be a writer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
