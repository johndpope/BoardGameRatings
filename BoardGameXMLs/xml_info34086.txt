			<description>Extrapolated from description by eBay seller Walnutts for ebay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2 fold, chromo-lithographed Game Board measures approx. 10 1/4&amp;rdquo; x 20&amp;rdquo; and features 2 images in the center - one showing the &amp;ldquo;Good&amp;rdquo; Errand Boy and the &amp;ldquo;Bad&amp;rdquo; Errand Boy and the other the interior of a Banking Office. Scenes at each corner of the Board and text the spaces on the board relate to various events (both positive and negative) in the career of a Errand Boy. The object of the game is to work your way up from &amp;quot;Applicant&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Banker&amp;rdquo; using the spinner located on the game board to decide on movement.The game box features chromo-lithographed paste down illustration of an American street scene with the dedicated Errand Boy protecting his package while a roust-about competitor is seen dropping his packages, smoking a cheroot, getting in a fight and generally messing up his duty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
