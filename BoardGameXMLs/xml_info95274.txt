			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sangokushi Eiketsuden is the first title in a spinoff series of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms turn-based strategy games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game centres around the narrative of Liu Bei&amp;rsquo;s achievements in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. Beginning during the Yellow Turban Rebellion, players control Liu Bei and his officers during his rise to claiming the emperor title. Unlike the parent series, which is presented in a neutral manner, Sangokushi Eiketsuden emphasizes Liu Bei as a hero and demonizes his rivals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each stage has players prepare their force by equipping their officers with items and arranging them for battle. After the battle, the player may converse with nearby allies to gain advice on the coming battles. The battle interface is a square grid where officers and armies are deployed. At most, one unit can occupy a square. There are a number of objectives on each stage that must be completed for victory. If a key allied officer is lost in battle, it will result in defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
