			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working hard this week?  Have a Traveller game to run this weekend?  Need a world on which to place your adventure?  No problem.  We've done the work for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written with the busy Referee in mind, this product provides a new world in which to base adventures.  Details such as the system characteristics, the government, the law, and the culture have been laid out so all you have to do is drop it into your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And short of ideas?  We've even added a few adventure hooks to get your creative juices flowing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your characters can can be challenged by the rough mountainous terrain or the repressive government.  Or maybe simply intrigued by the mystery of the Gediminus Wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
