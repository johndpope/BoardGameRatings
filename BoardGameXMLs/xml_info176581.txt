			<description>Network Negotiator is a game about the television industry. Players represent high-powered executives who buy and sell TV programs. The game was developed as a promotional item for Turner Broadcasting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is the accumulation of television ratings points. After each player is given one million dollars and assigned a company (CNN, TBS, Headline News, etc.) an assortment of programs will be available for purchase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The session proceeds for a previously agreed upon number of rounds as players negotiate and gather ratings points. An executive can choose a risky move with ratings based on the roll of the dice or accept &amp;quot;guaranteed&amp;quot; ratings with a safe choice. A special set of Monkey Wrench cards can be used to wreck another player's deal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game a Blockbuster Round is played with three unique programs (Election Night Coverage. etc.) are auctioned and ratings points are totaled. The player with the highest ratings is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a colorful board, play money, a score pad, 40 Program cards, 16 Monkey Wrench cards, 3 Blockbuster cards, dice, rules, and a storage insert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
