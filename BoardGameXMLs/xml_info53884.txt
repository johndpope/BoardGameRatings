							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sword and Crown</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;The Sword and Crown is an event unrivaled in Anuirean politics. Every five years, rulers come from across the land to renew friendships, cement alliances, and provoke their enemies with poisoned words and sharpened swords. Wheels turn within wheels, and plots abound. It's politics as usual in Anuire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Except this conclave is different. Not only is it taking place in the PCs' kingdom, but before the festivities can even commence, someone wages an attack on Prince Avan and kidnaps his daughter. And to whom to the regents turn to rescue the princess? The hosts, of course! The PCs must win their way past dangerous bandits and treacherous elves and discover a path through darkest caverns where the slightest misstep means death. Only then does the real threat become apparent!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure contains a 64-page book crammed with details about the setting, the situation, and the major characters, plus a full-color mapsheet. It is designed for use with the BIRTHRIGHT boxed set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
