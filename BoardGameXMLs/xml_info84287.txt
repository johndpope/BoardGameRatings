			<description>Laser Squad Nemesis (LSN) is a 2002 multiplayer turn-based tactics computer game developed by Codo Technologies. The lead designer, Julian Gollop, previously designed the X-COM series and the original Laser Squad.  Although Laser Squad Nemesis is a sequel to X-COM, Gollop did not own the rights to the X-COM: UFO Defense name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laser Squad Nemesis is a game of turn-based isometric combat, where players issue orders to a squad of soldiers or aliens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, the player gives orders to their troops, previews probable effects of those orders, and submits them to the LSN server via the web interface, or through email. Orders are resolved simultaneously after both players have submitted their orders, and the consequences of the round are sent back to both players. The result of the previous turn is viewed in a real time ten-second video, with pause, slow motion and rewind (multiple turns) options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Laser Squad Nemesis,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Redeveloped from X-COM: UFO Defense.  Although Laser Squad Nemesis is a sequel to X-COM, Gollop does not own the rights to the X-COM: UFO Defense name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
