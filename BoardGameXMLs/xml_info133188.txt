							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Haunting of the Abandoned Amusement Park</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs are a group of crime solving teens who hear about a recently abandoned amusement park that has become haunted. Locals hear weird howling from the park and see odd lights at night. They go to check it out and are subjected to alien, unearthly horrors, their sanity is tested to the limits and for some, their lives are violently ended. Characters are built on 10 dice, hooks and tales allowed, pumping allowed but no other advanced options are used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two extra rules are in place and are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Fright Checks &amp;ndash; When PCs face frightening things, or a Hook related phobia, they roll a fright check. They roll their highest Fearless type clich&amp;eacute; against a TN (starting TNs listed for the event adding 5 per level of clich&amp;eacute; inappropriateness). Failure causes a loss of a die in that clich&amp;eacute; &amp;ndash; if it falls to zero, that PC is reduced to a panicky incoherent mess, rolling at half dice until the end of the adventure. After failing or passing a roll, that PC need not roll again for the same event.&lt;br/&gt;     Zero Combat Dice &amp;ndash; Anyone losing the last die in a clich&amp;eacute; due to combat or violent happenings is dead. Usually messily. dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
