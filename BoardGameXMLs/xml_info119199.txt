			<description>From the cassette inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poor little Henry is the hen-pecked hero of this domestic tale. One night Henry can take no more. He steals his wages from his wife's purse, sneaks out of the house being careful not to wake the baby or trip over the cat, and heads for the bright lights to have some fun. Trouble is he runs out of money. His only way to raise some cash is to gamble his few remaining pounds on the spinning wheel of the roulette table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just as Henry is getting into his evening at the tables his wife - Mad Martha - has noticed his absence. Realising Henry has absconded with the housekeeping she sets out after him with an axe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guess what part you play in this happy tale? That's right, you are Henry. Watch out for that axe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A combination of primarily traditional text adventure with the occasional graphical action screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
