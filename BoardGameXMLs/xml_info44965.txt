			<description>From the text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This setting is designed to play out intense post-apocalyptic scenarios. Unlike most after-the-bomb settings, this one deals with the emotional fallout, rather than the physical or cultural.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humanity lives in sheltered, isolated communities scattered around the globe&amp;mdash;the last vestiges of civilization. Life in these bubbles is tolerable, but horriﬁcally bland. There is no more self-determination, no joie de vivre, no cross-cultures, sub-cultures or alternatives. All go to work, do their job, come home, seek to assuage their yawning emotional hunger, and eventually drift off to sleep in front of the television only to wake up tired and stiff to begin it all again. These are the Meek, and they are possessed of Need. Eventually life wrecks them. Each of them knows this and they seek to dull the pain. This is the Need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
