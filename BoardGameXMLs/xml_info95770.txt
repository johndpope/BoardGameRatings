							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Outpost on the Edge of the Far Reaches</name>
									
			<description>Front cover blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ancient outpost, abandoned centuries ago by a empire in decline, sits atop a lonely hill overlooking a bleak wilderness. Why was it deserted and left unattended all those years? Surely treasures that once littered the courtyard must have been claimed long ago. But still... vague murmurings of a hidden cellar have been overheard as well as visions of long dead veterans still haunting the battlements. Surely tales told in the evening in front of a fire to frighten gullible travelers. Perhaps there is something more here than meets the eye?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elements in this adventure module have been left open enough to be adaptable with most old-school style fantasy role-playing game rules and worlds and should fit easily into any GM's sandbox with but a few alterations and modifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
