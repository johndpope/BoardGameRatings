							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sugarplum Chronicles</name>
									
			<description>A dark curse has fallen over the Kingdom of Sugarplum, and the Frosted Throne sits empty.  As a Dream Mage with incredible powers and powerful ambitions you must set out on a journey across the four realms to take the crown for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it will not be easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemies and Encounters will test you along the Candy Road, dangerous Nightmares haunt your quest, other Dream Mages will do their best to sabotage your endeavor, and even if you do take the crown for yourself, you will have to fight to keep it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sugarplum Chronicles is a candy-themed adventure game in which the first goal is to make it to the Crown Tile before any other players.  The second, and final, goal is to be the last surviving Player.  During their turn, players will first roll to move, and decide which direction they want to move in and whether or not they want to stop at Candy Shops or Landmarks along the way.  Depending on the color of the tile that Players land on, they will either face an enemy or encounter (red), draw a nightmare or dream card (black), receive a Lemon Drop treasure (yellow), explore a Landmark (purple), or have a rest (green).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first Player to reach the crown tile will then hunt down the other players and face off in D-20 based combat featuring edible weapons and items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sugarplum Chronicles includes over 45 unique enemies, 'edible' weapons and items, an exciting PVP endgame, and player interaction through spells, mercenaries, magic teddy bears, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
