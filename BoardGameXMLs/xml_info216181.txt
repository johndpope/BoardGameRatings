			<description>Free Print and Play solo soccer replay simulation with rules for pitting two historical teams against each other, generating commentary describing the events of a match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 18 pages of rules and tables.  A player needs to provide two six-sided dice.  Each turn the dice are rolled and the Action Table is consulted.  A team strives on each possession to accumulate enough Advances to attempt a shot on goal.  They begin each possession with 0 Advances and typically may shoot after reaching 3 Advances, at which point a roll is made on the Shot Table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each possession continues until a team either manages a shot, or loses the ball due to a result on the Action Table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Gaffer's Call Soccer match will provide the narrative of a game, including substitutions, rare plays, yellow and red cards, goal scorers and assisters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
