			<description>'Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bally Arcade (or Astrocade) is probably the most undersung of the home computer systems, and undeservedly so.  The color graphics and sound capabilities were, and in many cases still are, years ahead of the competition...Was I crazy then, to attempt to write an adventure game for the Bally?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario of the game is straightforward...[there is] as hidden treasure deep in a cave, and you want to go in, find it, and bring it out.  That's it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cavern Quest was written by Bruce Jaeger.  The program was published as type-in source code in Creative Computing Vol. 9, No. 7, July 1983.  Versions were provided for the Bally Arcade and the VIC-20.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
