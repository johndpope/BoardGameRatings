			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Battle Isle is hex based strategy war game similar to History Line 1914-1918.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Main plot evolves around Skynet Titan supercomputer trying to take over the plant of Chromor and Drullish survivors (the player) trying to defend it.&lt;br/&gt;It has a relatively light learning curve due to the fact that new units are introduced throughout the campaign. &lt;br/&gt;Game features light logistic component as well - you can occupy and use a number of supply, repair and manufacture buildings which lets you reinforce your army. It is important because units are able to collect experience points and thus improve their fighting potency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be played either vs. AI or vs. human opponent as well (hot seat).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
