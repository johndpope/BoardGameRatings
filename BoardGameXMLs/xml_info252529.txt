			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to my scenario. I have written myself as the protagonist, and the whole thing is all about me. Am I hugely self-absorbed, or is there something more going on here?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's what provoked the scenario - at Fastaval 2000, early in the morning, the way to my bedroom was blocked by an angry young man with a North Jutland accent.  He wanted to tell something to me, his superior.  Great (or stupid) as I am, I spent two full hours listening as he told me how arrogant, lazy, self-promoting, etc., that I am - how all I want to do is see my own name everywhere.  Obviously, his own profound contributions had been entirely overlooked...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well... this is the most profound revenge I can imagine.  This scenario is the most obvious attempt I can make to promote myself within the Danish roleplaying sphere.  Nobody will play this scenario without knowing a heck of a lot more about me than they have ever wanted to know.  Just wait and see - it's all about me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And it's all David Brauner's fault.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
