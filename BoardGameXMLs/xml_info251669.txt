			<description>Welcome to Impact Financial! As newly hired junior financial analysts, the company has sent you promote awareness of global social impact initiatives doing well in the stock market. You&amp;rsquo;ll be given a monthly budget to invest in the stock market. Do well and the organization leaders will approve your application to become a full fledged financial analyst!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impact Financial Jr. is a version of the full game Impact Financial designed to cater classroom type settings with large number of players. These teacher&amp;rsquo;s components can be printed out or pre-rolled into a presentation. The students simply need the worksheet and a pen to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in eight rounds. In each round there is a target behavior of the market which can swing depending on the token drawn by the facilitator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the stocks go up and down, players then look at their player sheet and write down their purchases and sales in their appropriate stock boxes. Their buying power is not carried over per round so they must make sound investments throughout the eight rounds of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the game ends whoever has the highest value wins! Tie-breaks for the most diverse portfolio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
