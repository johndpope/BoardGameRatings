			<description>This is a basic roll-and-move game -- similar to Snakes and Ladders -- where the goal is simply to be the first to reach the finish space. The game board consists of a series of spaces, each requiring the player to perform some drinking-related task. &amp;quot;Staggers&amp;quot; allow the player to skip spaces ahead (like the Ladders) and &amp;quot;Pukes&amp;quot; cause the player to lose ground (like the Snakes). Due to the increasing level of intoxication of the players during the game, there is no guarantee that all (or any) players will make it to the final space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
