			<description>The match box was dropped and all the matches are mixed up. The goal of the game is to find as many matching pairs as possible. The game plays similar to the classic memory game Concentration, but there are a few twists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Half of the cards will be face down and the rest will be face up. The start player will lay down the cards in a 3x3 grid. Each player should look at the cards as they are being put down, as it is important to remember the cards &amp;amp; placement. Just like in the classic memory game, the players try to find a matching pair. Whoever says &amp;quot;match!&amp;quot; gets a try. When the cards match, that player takes the cards, which will score at the end of the game. If 2 different cards are picked, these go to the discard pile and the player receives one of the yellow burning matches. If no one else sees another match, the remaining cards are reshuffled and the next player places them in the grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all cards have been claimed, or if the 5 burning matches are in play. The player with the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
