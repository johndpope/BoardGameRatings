			<description>Land Ahead! is a fast-paced game in which players together explore an unexplored island. The players take turns placing six-sided island tiles, forming the coast lines, locations and roads of the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is highly strategic as tiles will have to be placed in ways that benefit you, forming roads for your player figure to follow. This while preventing other players from reaching the island&amp;rsquo;s locations before you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every time a location is discovered, a round event token is placed on top of the location. These tokens depict villages, castles and forests and trigger events when reached by one of the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you befriend a stray animal that can help you on your journey or will you be attacked by a fearsome monster? Perhaps find powerful equipment or valuable treasure?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game you will improve your abilities by finding equipment and placing it on the corresponding equipment slot of your player tile. All equipment will improve either your offense, defense or movement ability to some extent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you become powerful enough to defeat the monsters and win the game as the monster slayer? Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll become great at evading attacks while collecting treasure and win the game as the treasure hunter?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One thing is for sure - no two games will ever be the same!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
