			<description>Supercharge is one of the four Folio games included in North Africa Quad, but also sold separately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supercharge covers several battles around El Alamein in North Africa in 1942. In fact there are three scenarios:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1. Battle of Alam Halfa: A short offensive by the Afrika Korps attempting to push east (8 game turns).&lt;br/&gt;    2. Battle of El Alamein: The first British attack on the German line near El Alamein (15 turns).&lt;br/&gt;    3. Operation Supercharge: The big offensive that brokethrough the German lines and routed the Africa Korps (7 turns).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components consist of the following: a 'Standard' Rules fold-out 'sheet'(about 3-Full pages) for the game series; an 'Exclusive' Rules sheet(1-page); a 4-COLOR paper Mapsheet-(17&amp;quot; by 22&amp;quot;); a set of cardboard counters(around 120). Players must provide their OWN 6-sided DIE prior to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the Mapsheet are the Turn Record Track, a Terrain Key, and the set-up locations for the Units of both the 'Campaign' &amp;amp; 'Sidi Rezegh' games. Overall, the COLOR of the Mapsheet is WHITE with BLUE-(Water/Sea, Allied 'Fortified Box', Minefield Hex-sides), BROWN-(Rough), Light GRAY-(Broken), &amp;amp; Dark BROWN-(Roads, Trails). The Area encompassed by this Mapsheet is the coastal road and areas south centered on El Alamein, and Alam Halfa Ridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game counters are TAN-with BLACK print for Germans, TAN-with GREEN print for Italians, GREEN with BLACK print for British. Game scale is given as 1.7 Miles across each hex, each Turn represents 1-Day, and Units range in size from Battalion up to Brigade level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One unique thing of Supercharge is that the supply rules in the standard rules game are ignored completely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
