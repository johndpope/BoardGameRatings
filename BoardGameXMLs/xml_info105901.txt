			<description>In-Game Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Mission: Steer to avoid collision of Escort and Aliens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blast Aliens to collect bounty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More fuel after destruction of all Aliens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Stellar Escort you are called upon to protect a friendly spaceship from waves of attacking aliens. Viewing the action from the viewscreen of your spaceship, you must steer your craft to place the enemy aliens in the center of the screen where your laser blasts are targeted. However, the ship you are escorting also appears on your viewscreen, and it moves when you do. So as you steer your ship you must avoid causing the aliens to collide with the friendly ship. Then there is also the matter of needing to eliminate all the aliens in a wave before you run out of fuel...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first-person &amp;quot;viewscreen&amp;quot; perspective of the game is enhanced by the aliens starting off as small dots which become larger and take shape as they close with your ship. However, the ships are not rendered as 3-D objects, two-dimensional images are used. The game records high scores which can be saved to disk in the floppy version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The iconic Flagship alien, which appeared in Big Five's seven previous TRS-80 games, is notably absent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stellar Escort was the first Big Five release not programmed by Bill Hogue. Programmer Jeff Zinn wrote the program in his spare time and Big Five agreed to sell it on a royalty basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some information obtained from the official Big Five Software website: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
