			<description>Ably assisted by a monkey sidekick and a labradoodle professor, Aqua Boy is an intrepid underwater adventurer &amp;ndash; scouring the uncharted depths for mysterious, long-forgotten artifacts. Unfortunately, his latest mission has gone drastically wrong!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take control of Aqua Boy as he emerges from the wreckage of his submarine, embarking on an epic adventure through the ruins of a sunken city. Meet a host of eccentric characters, from fussy bureaucrats to mercenary bees; upgrade your weapons and defences, acquiring new abilities that open up previously inaccessible areas; do battle with all kinds of strange creatures, including five bosses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
