			<description>A game similar to Black Box (but more complex), in which players must guess a hidden pattern by shooting rays into a grid. The obstacles can absorb, reflect or deviate the rays, and the players must guess the obstacles positions just by knowing entrance and exit of that ray. Rays can make very complex routes before exiting. Choosing the most tricky position when it's your turn to decide the secret combination can be as difficult as trying to guess it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
