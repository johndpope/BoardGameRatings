			<description>After collecting a large amount of food, the penguins have returned to feed his family. In &amp;quot;Treasure Antartic&amp;quot; [sic] penguins reach their shelter to get the victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will control your penguin and must travel around the game board to the end using move cards (for walking and jumping) and dices (to slide). Players can also take action cards where action may &amp;quot;rest&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;pushing another penguin&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;seal control&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start the game, the Penguins have 10 fish (energy to move on the board), which will be losing while advancing around the board (the rest energy can be recovered). The first player to reach the end of the board with at least 3 fish wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
