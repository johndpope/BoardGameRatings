			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Midnight Club: Street Racing is an arcade-style racing game for the Playstation 2. Players take the role of a New York cab driver that becomes engrossed in the underground world of late-night street racing. The game includes a Career mode, as well as a number of multiplayer options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Career mode, there are a number of different missions available. Most missions involve tracking down opponents to race, then tailing them for long enough to provoke a challenge. The challenge race is a match between the player and the opponent`s entire posse. Other races are one-on-one duels with rival drivers. Winning races will unlock bonus cars to a player`s garage. In addition to New York, players can unlock London as a playable region after progressing far enough in the first metropolis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The races are open-ended, simply requiring players to pass a certain number of checkpoints. There are a number of different routes to victory in each race, allowing players to carve their own path through the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arcade mode multiplayer options include head-to-head races, checkpoint matches, and a capture-the-flag mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gameboy Advance releases of the game were designed to emulate the Playstation 2 versions, but were restricted to an overhead view by the system capabilities. Aside from the overhead cam, the game plays very similarly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
