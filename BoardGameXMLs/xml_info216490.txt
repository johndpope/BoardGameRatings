							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mage Wars Arena: Premium Magnetic Status Board</name>
									
			<description>From Manufacturer: &lt;br/&gt;Our Premium Magnetic Status Boards offer Mage Wars players a more robust way to keep track of their battle statistics during play. If you're looking for an alternative solution to the Core Set's cardboard status boards, or just looking to add more status boards to your play group, this is it! Each board provides magnetic pawns that mark your stats that help prevent shifting of cubes and values during the match if the boards are bumped or moved unexpectedly. Each board comes with 4 colored pawns for marking your Channel value, Mana Supply, Damage and Life. Each purchase is for one premium board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
