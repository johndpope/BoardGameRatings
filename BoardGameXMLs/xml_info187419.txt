							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Sundered World</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the cathedral drifts before the angel gate the priests begin chanting prayers, beseeching it to open a path so that they may once again begin the Golden Pilgrimage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A ship loaded with firewater and other contraband from the City of Brass drifts silently through the Deep Astral, hoping to evade border islands...and whatever lurks in the darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a kytheran raiding fleet swiftly approaches, the soldiers of a dwarven multi-fort load elemental cores into an array of fire lances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thoughtform trembling with nervousness in front of so many enlightened Astral weavers, a t&amp;rsquo;pual battlemind begins its graduating shape-kata exam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mining vessel launches a series of towing chains into a stabilized earth mote. They begin to reel it in, hoping it won&amp;rsquo;t fluctuate before they can extract usable ore to process later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The consuming darkness crawls towards the cold, pale spires of the elven city Astrazalian. Most of the inhabitants retreat behind closed doors: only the White Owls, nobility and the ignorant dare tread outside before it passes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Sundered World is a fantastic, kind of gonzo campaign setting for Dungeon World. It takes place in the shattered remnants of the worlds, which were ravaged during a cosmic war between the gods and primordials (which wiped them all out in the process). It includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Ten races, each with their own race moves, to better allow you to determine how much your race affects you (and serve as a foundation in case you want to flesh out an entire racial class). There's also guidelines and suggestions for using them in &amp;quot;default&amp;quot; Dungeon World games.&lt;br/&gt;    Six new classes.&lt;br/&gt;    New weapons, armor, dungeon gear (including poisons), services, transport options, hireling skills, buildings, and magic items.&lt;br/&gt;    Materials to further customize your weapons and armor: bind a wind spirit to your spear so that it flies further, shape a shield out of black ice, or don sturdy-yet-weightless armor shaped from raw astral essence.&lt;br/&gt;    Ships, both magical and mundane, to help you get around the Remnants, Maelstrom, and the darker regions beyond. There's ship-specific moves, plenty of example ships to choose from, and a section to help you build an entirely custom ship of your own design.&lt;br/&gt;    World moves for drifting through the astral, willing objects into existence using astral essence, lingering on as a ghost when you die, and more.&lt;br/&gt;    Eleven new monster settings, detailing glorious-yet-terrifying angels, sinister devils, cold, emotionless machines from the pre-Sundering era, spirits that managed to survive the Sundering, and strange beasts that were changed during the Sundering, or managed to adapt.&lt;br/&gt;    Six varied example campaign and adventure fronts to get you started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
