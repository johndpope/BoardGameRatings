			<description>introduction:&lt;br/&gt;The default presumption of Stars Without Number is that while  a skilled unarmed combatant can be a dangerous foe, there&amp;iexcl; s no  substitute for a gun. Unarmed combatants never need to worry  about being disarmed and are perilous enemies even when stripped  of their equipment, but most PCs will sensibly prefer to pick up a  combat shotgun or shear rifle when they have the opportunity. Such  rules model most flavors of science fiction and correspond to most  players&amp;iexcl;  intuitive expectations about how combat ought to play out.  Guns are the weapons of choice, with primitive weaponry as backup  and unarmed combat as a choice of last resort&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not every group prefers to go with this hierarchy. Some GMs and  players prefer game worlds in which choosing to fight unarmed is  a mechanically viable choice, and the expert unarmed combatant is  no worse off than the expert rifleman. The following optional rules  give a boost to unarmed combat so that the level 6 warrior with  Combat/Unarmed-3 is every bit as lethal as his comrade who has  specialized in projectile weaponry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
