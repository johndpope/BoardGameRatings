			<description>There are 48 cards, representing 12 months with 4 weeks each. These are randomly laid out (face-down) in a 12x4 &amp;quot;calendar&amp;quot; grid. The players take turns to flip open a card and place it in the correct position for the card on the calendar. They also pick up the card that was in that position before, look at it and place it (face-down) in the position they first picked up a card from. A player who places the fourth card in any month gets to keep all four cards from that month. The player with most months is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
