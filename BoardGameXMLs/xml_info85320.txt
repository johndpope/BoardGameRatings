							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Antaire: Dungeons</name>
									
			<description>Explore the hidden dungeons of the land of Antaire.  Fight your way through the dungeon, avoiding its traps, fighting monsters and most importantly collecting your gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Antaire: Dungeons is a competitive dungeon exploration game.  Players compete against the dungeon and each other, trying to leave with the most gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed to allow infinite replay.  All players start with one of eight characters (Knight, Barbarian, Archer, Thief, Mage, Healer, Druid, Necromancer) on a beginning tile.  As the game progresses the dungeon is extended by adding tiles consisting of corridors, rooms, and importantly shops and most importantly the exit tile.  Shops allow the player to buy new equipment for their character, increasing his or her abilities, or heal damage from the dangers of the dungeon. Players themselves add monsters, traps and treasure within the dungeon to either their advantage or opponents disadvantage, leaving everybody to play.  Death in the game is only final if the exit appears, extending the overall player interaction to the last possible moment.  And don't worry, if a character exits the dungeon, the player may still play, using the dungeon and its inhabitants to stop other players exiting and defeating them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
