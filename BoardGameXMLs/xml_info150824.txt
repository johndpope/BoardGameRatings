							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pumpkin Hill</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of an autumn feast the villagers have set up a display of scarily carved pumpkins on a nearby hill. What was intended as a curiously morbid attraction for the celebrating revelers has turned far more deadly and sinister over night though. For unknown reasons some of the&lt;br/&gt;pumpkins have grown horns of rusty iron and tentacles that are entirely out of place on any regular pumpkin. As if that was not worse enough the pumpkins have animated and are now roaming the hill. As the first celebrating villagers discovered, much to their dismay, these unnatural beasts are not in the mood to celebrate at all. At least it seems like the pumpkins, lead by the largest of their number sitting atop the hill, can not leave the haunted hill. Yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
