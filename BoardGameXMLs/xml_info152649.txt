							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Historical Turning Points: Mallory&#039;s World</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the waning years of the Third Succession War, Takashi Kurita moved to take Mallory's World from House Davion&amp;rsquo;s Federated Suns. Taking advantage of Davion&amp;rsquo;s preparations elsewhere, the Coordinator dispatched several regiments only to be thwarted by First Prince Ian Davion. Though the First Prince met his death at the hands of Yorinaga Kurita, the DCMS ultimately failed the Coordinator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three years later, House Kurita tried again. In one of the most legendary battles in BattleTech history, Yorinaga Kurita faced mercenary commander Morgan Kell. When it was over, a deadly rivalry had been born that would shape the destinies of men and nations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historical Turning Points: Mallory&amp;rsquo;s World takes events from the Third Succession War and expands them using the phenomenally successful Turning Points PDF exclusive format. Return to an earlier time in BattleTech history, when centuries of Succession Wars have honed an animosity to a razor&amp;rsquo;s edge between the Great Houses of Davion and Kurita!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, inserting it into their own campaigns and even create their own scenarios. This PDF exclusive includes a detailed map of the planet of Mallory&amp;rsquo;s World, a rundown of the forces involved in the conflict, and several tracks that players can use to run simple lance-on-lance battles, or stage up to a world-wide invasion. Only the players&amp;rsquo; imaginations are the limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
