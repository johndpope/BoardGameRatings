							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death by Corium Light</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death by Corium Light is a Darwin&amp;rsquo;s World adventure suitable for characters of levels 8-10. The Corium Mines of Lil&amp;rsquo; Vegas are one of the most infamous locations of the Twisted Earth. Word is spreading across the wasteland about this near legendary source of corium, a vast pit in the earth from which the priceless glowing stuff seems to flow in endless quantities &amp;ndash; and people are coming, from near and far, to earn their share working the mines. But there is a secret that few people know, and even fewer live to tell about &amp;ndash; people aren&amp;rsquo;t leaving town, and what few visitors manage to escape are telling tales of slavery, suffering, and thousands being worked to death. Not that this bothers most people, but then there are those stories of strange creatures living in the tunnels of the mines, stories that are threatening to topple it all&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
