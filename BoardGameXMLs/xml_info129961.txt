							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">STRYKER: US Mechanized Operations in the War on Terror</name>
									
			<description>STRYKER-20 puts you in command of a US Army Stryker mechanized unit against an OPFOR (Opposition Forces) formation. This is a two player game: US Player and OPFOR Player. The US Player controls the Stryker Combat Team. There are two levels of scenario: Company Commander to provide an introduction to the missions; and battalion, to provide a full simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Opposition Forces (OPFOR) player controls enemy units and also manages various randomized incidents within the area of operations. The game also can be played by teams of players, each commanding different element of a force.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As much as possible, STRYKER uses standard US military terminology to create a simulation experience that can be used by service members with a minimum of special knowledge of gaming, and can also be used to train civilian personnel in military procedure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General Course of Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player selects a Mission card from the deck. You organize your Stryker Combat Team, which, depending on the scenario, may be one company, two companies, or a full battalion. You then deploy your Team on the game map.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic unit in the game is a platoon (some units represent smaller teams/squads). There are also markers representing various kinds of Fire and Surveillance Support, as well as civilians and items which would appear in a combat zone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in scenarios, called Missions. To win a scenario, you must accomplish your mission objective.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
