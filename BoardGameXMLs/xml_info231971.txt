			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To complete the course in the shortest time possible by taking from the move pack as few cards as possible. Any number of people may play but this is an against the clock race and each player races in turn with normally only one skier on the course at any one time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preparation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set up the board, draw for order of play by cutting the shuffled pack of move cards and the highest card takes the first turn. The Slalom is a two-legged race where the fastest time on aggregate is the winner and the second leg is run in reverse order to the first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start of the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the move and start cards and take the top start card and then 14 move cards. Any number from 0 to 9 of these 14 move cards may be discarded by playing them face downwards and incurring a small penalty of additions to the time of 0.01 secs for each card discarded. This decision to discard (or not)a number of move cards can only be made before the start and from the initial 14 cards dealt. The further  move cards which will be required may be taken from the top of the pack at anytime but all cards taken add one second each to the time whether played or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The run commences by playing one of the move cards and so as the first bend is a left hand turn just 2 spaces from the start then a black 2 followed by any black card will make the first turn a perfect one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time display board should be maintained after each move allowing for standard course time (marked on the race board), start-move-error-skill cards and the last decimal place is determined by the value of the move card last played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After reaching the final turn line a player may cross the finishing line by playing any red card of value 2 or greater or a red 1 move card followed by any card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After crossing the finishing line a check should be made of all cards in play to confirm the display time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
