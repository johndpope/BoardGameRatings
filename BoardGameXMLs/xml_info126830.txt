			<description>Baroj (barriers) is a breaktrough/race board game inspired on the Robert Abbot's masterpiece &amp;quot;Epaminondas&amp;quot;, wich can be played on a square or a hexagonal grid. Pieces move 1 or 2 cells forward orthogonally and diagonally, (sideways and backwards moves are not allowed) and captures are made by jumping orthogonally over an adjacent  friendly piece and falling on an adjacent enemy piece, in straight line. Captures can be made in any of 4 directions (so backwards and sideways captures are allowed, but not diagonally). The goal of the game is to place and keep 2 of your pieces on your enemy&amp;acute;s first row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best board sizes recommended are 7x8 or 8x8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played on a hexagonal grid with 5 or 6 cells per side. Here, pieces can move even sideways, but not backward.  The moved piece must advance forward at least one cell at the end of the turn. Captures are made in straight line in any of 6 directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
