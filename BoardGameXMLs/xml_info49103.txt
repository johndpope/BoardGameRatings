							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Turjan&#039;s Tome of Beauty and Horror</name>
									
			<description>If you are more interested in dark fantasy than humorous escapades, or collecting the last 100 Spells rather than conning a stall holder of his terces, then this is the tome for you. The first volume of Jack Vance's Dying Earth has a very different tone to the later books. It has elements of horror, powerful sorcery, and even genuine heroics. This supplements lets you roleplay these puissant magicians, questers and driven heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Gain options for Magician characters, and get advice on playing Turjan-level campaigns&lt;br/&gt;     Encompass new, esoteric spells, scribbled by madmen and fraught with danger in their use&lt;br/&gt;     Face untold peril as you follow adventure hooks set on the Dying Earth and beyond&lt;br/&gt;     Uncover arcane items from the ruins, or guarded by otherworld beings&lt;br/&gt;     Gain new powers (Tweaks) such as &amp;quot;Occult Horrors too Numerous to Detail&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;     Discover contacts and potential enemies of cruelty and renown,&lt;br/&gt;     Create Vat creatures as retainers, bodyguards or even companions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
