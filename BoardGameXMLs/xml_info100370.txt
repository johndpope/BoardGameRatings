			<description>These are strange days for Aghaus. By order of the Magistrate, the Royal Guard is to assemble for deployment in two days&amp;rsquo; time. It has been years since I last left the capital, and further still that I can remember such a command being issued! But what need is there for a Royal Guard, when no King sits upon the throne? Though my oath binds me to his service, the Magistrate is not my liege. He rules in the absence of a rightful heir.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My men await their orders; they too are uneasy. It is for their sake that I stay my tongue, and place my faith in the Almighty that my fears are unfounded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tomorrow, we make for the East.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash;Captain Creval of the Royal Guard, in the 895th year of our Empire&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;18 months in the making, Ash, SRRN&amp;rsquo;s full length RPG for the iPhone and iPod Touch is finally ready for release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed exclusively for the iPhone, Ash is an original turn-based RPG, featuring an all-new, intuitive touch-based interface, lush visuals licensed from Enterbrain, beautifully orchestrated music, and a wonderfully compelling story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ash tells the story of two mercenaries on the fringes of the Empire of Aghaus, a once-great kingdom now fallen into ruin after the death of its king five years prior. When a routine contract takes an unexpected turn, the two men are gradually embroiled in a conflict that consumes the entire continent&amp;mdash;and brings to light the mercenaries&amp;rsquo; mysterious pasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
