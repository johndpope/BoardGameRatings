							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">An Invitation in Yellow</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators are invited over for dinner by an old aquaintance whom they haven't heard from for years. He has something to show them which is equally magificent and horrifying. From the moment they step off the train at Dartsmouth nothing is as it should be, and their most valuable ally may turn out to be their worst enemy&amp;mdash;but will they realize what is going on before it is too late?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Invitation in Yellow is a short Call of Cthulhu scenario written by Patrick Viggo Moeller for 3-4 investigators, based in the fictional town of Dartsmouth, Massaschusetts. The scenario is nominated for five hours of play, and is an excellent introductory scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
