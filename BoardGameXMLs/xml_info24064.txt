			<description>Oh, no!  The barnyard critters have gotten loose! And it's your job to round them up. The objective of the game is to 'round up' the most points worth of critters, which consist of different barnyard animals that vary in point value.&lt;br/&gt;  However, the critters move on their own; so you have to direct them to your corral with fences or surround the critter out in the field with fences.&lt;br/&gt;  Fences are played by laying down a fence card and placing fences on the 'Ranch' grid. The fence cards have different patterns on them, which limit how fences can be played.&lt;br/&gt;  Each player also has one 'Stampede!!!' tile that can be used to cause every critter on the board to move at once and possibly escape.  Beware!  There are Stampede!!! tiles mixed in with the critters, as well...&lt;br/&gt;  Once every critter is either caught or escapes, the game ends and the person with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
