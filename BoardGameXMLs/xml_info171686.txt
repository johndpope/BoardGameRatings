							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wallenstein: Military Leaders â€“ Expansion Module 3</name>
									
			<description>In the Wallenstein: Military Leaders expansion, each player receives one military leader figure to place on one of his controlled counties. While performing actions in this county, he receives extra benefits, such as reduced costs by 1 when constructing buildings or additional grain when producing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the turn, he moves the leader to an adjacent county under his control, if possible, while leaving a marker at the old location. The more markers you have on the board at the end of the game, the more points you're awarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wallenstein: Military Leaders was presented as a Kickstarter exclusive while also possibly being available at conventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
