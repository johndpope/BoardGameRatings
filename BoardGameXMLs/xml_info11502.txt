			<description>A game on the clash between protesters and police at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Released with Strategy &amp;amp; Tactics magazine #21 (January 1970) along with Flight of the Goeben. Also available from SPI as a separate game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Per Jim Dunnigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;[Chicago, Chicago! was a] serious attempt to model the situation...Non-war games were never expected to be hits...While most game topics were selected by S&amp;amp;T readers, we did allow ourselves an &amp;quot;editor's choice&amp;quot; once a year, and this was often  something like the Chicago game.&amp;quot;  Dunnigan went on to say he didn't favor the hippies or cops in the conflict.  &amp;quot;I was always interested in modeling non-military conflicts. You can't take sides if you want to do it right.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(e-mails with Neopeius, 9-13 and 14, 2011)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
