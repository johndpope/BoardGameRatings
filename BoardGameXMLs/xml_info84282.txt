							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prototype: Nemesis</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An expert in observation and training techniques, a Nemesis is both teacher and student. He is always on the lookout for a new technique to add to his repertoire. His ability to instantly learn and duplicate the fighting abilities of his opponents makes this character a deadly and unpredictable combatant. However, what makes a Nemesis most dangerous is his ability to boost the capabilities of his minions while he stays safely in the shadows. Most Nemesis begin their careers in spy services and special military units. Others are self-taught criminals and hired guns. They all make their living by training the foot soldiers of crime bosses, dictators and madmen. While a Nemesis is fully capable of doing the dirty work themselves, they are more comfortable allowing their henchmen and trainees handle less demanding tasks. Generally a Nemesis will hold back and save his strength for the most challenging opponents and the most daunting missions. This 6 page PDF is just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Espionage campaign world, including Haven: Full Metal Zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
