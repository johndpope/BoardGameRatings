			<description>The ancient Dragons of the Black Mountains once claimed that they controlled all their eyes could see. The valleys and plains that stretched out from the foot fo their lofty eerie was their hunting ground and they commanded that special type of respect that only abject terror generates from all who lived beneath their dark shadow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon Wars is a tongue-in-cheek miniatures game featuring Halflings and Dragons in a battle for survival! This fully self-contained game contains over eighty 15mm pieces which consists of: 60 Halflings, 2 Dwarf Cannons and crew, 4 Undead Dragons, 8 Dragons, 3 Halfling houses as well as the rules you need for the game. If you like your games simple and silly, then this is for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
