			<description>My only variation game, this is a true 4 player Backgammon game, not a team game, but for 4 individual players. Not only is it a great game for those that already know backgammon but it also makes a great conversation piece set up on the coffee table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a couple difference from the original in the set up rules and the throw rules; &amp;amp; there's also a nice little rule of my own thrown in that you might like to play. Recommended Ages 9+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
