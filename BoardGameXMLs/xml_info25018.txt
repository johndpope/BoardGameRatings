			<description>A childrens action Roulette game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is essentially a circular roulette style plastic dish with a central dimpled scoring track surrounding a &amp;quot;bullseye&amp;quot; track.  Using the corner mounted spring loaded shooters the aim of the game is to shoot your plastic balls (green or yellow) into the roulette wheel aiming to score as many points as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The version I have includes 4 different scorecards which sit in the center straddling the &amp;quot;bullseye&amp;quot; track.  The games are  aceball, cannonball, cue ball, and fruitball each having its own scoring system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aceball - Probably the most advanced game variant having a rising multiplier style score for face cards and picture cards, bullseye track representing a joker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cannonball - My personal favorite, rising scores nearer the center of a ship, gaps between ships score 0 and the bullseye scores 25.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cueball - Based on a snooker scoring system with 1 point for reds and rising values for the colored balls , &amp;quot;bullseye&amp;quot; track representing a pocketed cue ball and no score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fruitball - A fruitmachine scoring system with points awarded for tricks of three same symbols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The copy I have is incomplete (as far as I can tell) and I cannot tell you how many balls came with the game nor any of the exact rules as these were printed on the inside of the box lid which has long since disappeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
