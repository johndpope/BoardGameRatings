			<description>Z Gate Crashers is a 1 to 5 player monster hunting adventure (card game), where the goal is to survive an onslaught of invading monsters. Using various combinations of weapons and bonuses, players try to dispatch the monsters.&lt;br/&gt;You and up to 4 friends are a band of mercenary monster hunters. Your job is to contain the evil abominations that come crawling out of large filthy stinking holes in the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your team are deployed behind protective energy units called GATEs.&lt;br/&gt;These GATEs are powered by a new energy source that&amp;rsquo;s harvested from killing the nasty monsters, called Soulbits.&lt;br/&gt;Soulbits are your lifeblood and your currency. You use them to keep your GATE energized, and you protected from attack.&lt;br/&gt;You can also trade in the soulbits you earn, for more weapons and bonus cards, to help you defeat even more nasties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is simple, you&amp;rsquo;ve got to survive.&lt;br/&gt;But more than mere survive, a successful GATEr needs to thrive by harvesting as many soulbits as possible.&lt;br/&gt;The Player with the most soulbits at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when either all of the players or all of the monsters are dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsters are distributed in Wave cards, that show the different types, distributions, and amounts of each invading wave of monsters.&lt;br/&gt;During their turn, each player draws a wave card, and using monster cards and monster-life tokens, they line each up to create the monster attack track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsters typically emerge at the hole and during initiative, take a varied number of steps to get closer to the gate and do damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player (typically) has first-attack initiative. Using acquired weapons and bonus cards, in various stacked, chained, offensive, and defensive combinations; the player tries to kill as many nasties as possible and collect those soulbits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monsters next get their move and attack actions, using initiative tokens.&lt;br/&gt;An initiative token is placed under the monster card that will next act.&lt;br/&gt;The initiative token (typically) moves sequentially down the track (and back around), with monsters getting 4 such actions in a &amp;ldquo;Normal Difficulty&amp;rdquo; game. The location and move-direction of the initiative token along the monster track can be altered based on certain Wave Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a monster card has initiative, all monsters on that card get to move (one step closer to the gate) and then if able, attack. &lt;br/&gt;All monsters attack when at the gate but do so in a variety of different ways and with differing effects.&lt;br/&gt;The player rolls to save against an attacking monster. A successful roll gains the player a bonus soulbit, but a failed roll will incur (sometimes cumulative) damage to the gate. &lt;br/&gt;During initiative, some monsters also get a bonus attack that they take regardless of their distance from the gate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player survives, play moves on to the next player to see how they do.&lt;br/&gt;A recovery session is granted at the end of each round, allowing players a chance to buy more loot, recover from various effects, and trade with other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game difficulty and experience are controlled in the distribution of wave cards, allowing for highly dynamic and varied gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;When wave cards run out, play continues in the same order until either all players or all monsters are dead.&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most soulbits, at the end, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
