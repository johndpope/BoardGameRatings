			<description>&amp;quot;Custer's Revenge (also known as Westward Ho  and The White Man Came) is a pornographic video game made for the Atari 2600 by Mystique, a company that produced a number of adult video game titles for the system. The main character was based on General George Custer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has received significant criticism because of its crude simulation of an apparent rape of a Native American woman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the player controls the character of General George Armstrong Custer, depicted as a man wearing nothing but a cavalry hat, boots, and a bandana, sporting a visible erection. Custer has to overcome arrow attacks to reach the other side of the screen. His goal is to have intercourse with a naked, large-breasted Native American woman named Revenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Custer's Revenge gained notoriety for its plot. Sold in a sealed package labeled &amp;quot;NOT FOR SALE TO MINORS&amp;quot; and selling for $49.95, it acknowledged that children might nonetheless see the game. The game's literature stated &amp;quot;if the kids catch you and should ask, tell them Custer and the maiden are just dancing.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Groups such as Women Against Pornography, Native American spokespersons, and critics of the video game industry in general protested the game. Andrea Dworkin claimed the game &amp;quot;generated many gang rapes of Native American women.&amp;quot; Activists tried pressuring legislators to outlaw the game, which Oklahoma City, Oklahoma did. Multiple Industries pursued an $11 million lawsuit against Suffolk County, New York and legislator Philip Nolan &amp;quot;because of a resolution authorizing the county executive to take action to halt sales and distribution&amp;quot; of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aside from complaints over the game's sexual content, the game was poorly received due to poor gameplay and graphics; the two characters' appearances have been compared to Lego bricks or cardboard boxes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Custer's_Revenge,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
