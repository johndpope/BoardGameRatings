							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Future Price Guide</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within these pages, every item in the the Future portion of the SRD has had its value translated into credits just like the [Modern Price Guide] did for the Modern SRD. You don't realize just how much equipment is in The Future until you see it all listed together like it is here in the Future Price Guide.&lt;br/&gt;Buying new complex equipment and selling used equipment is abstract and clumsy with the Purchase DC system. It's easy to see what you are buying and selling using Credits! If you have embraced roleplaying in the future, but you miss the excitement of purchasing your own equipment, now you can!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
