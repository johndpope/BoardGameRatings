							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fantastic Footgear</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few adventurers worry about whether or not their choice of boots match their armor, or whether or not a given magic item is currently &amp;ldquo;buy one get one free,&amp;rdquo; but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that it isn&amp;rsquo;t important to choose your magic gear with care. As much as shoe shopping might seem anathema to hardened veterans of deep, dark dungeons, the fact of the matter is that the most successful adventurers come prepared with gear for every occasion, and that means that the more options, the better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well The Ebon Vault series has always been about providing more options, and this time we turn our eye towards the feet slot, providing over 50 brand new wondrous items for the feet slot, all of which were designed with abilities designed to tie into and evoke the flavor of footgear, as well as ensure that there&amp;rsquo;s something in everyone&amp;rsquo;s price range, all the way from 500 gp to 180,000 gp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In case that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, the book also contains 25 new magical horseshoes, designed for mounts and animal companions of nearly every description. It also contains 25 new pieces of cursed footgear, and five intelligent pairs of footgear that not only come with unique special abilities and full statistics, but also have detailed background and personality descriptions to make them come alive in your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a player who wants to make sure that his characters have all the best options, or a GMs who want to ensure that the next treasure is as exciting as possible (whether because of an exciting and unique magic item, or a cursed item that is more fun at the table and less likely to make your players riot), this is the book for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
