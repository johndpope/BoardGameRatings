			<description>A fantasy themed multi-player Mastermind style deduction game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A (not really) fantasy game of deduction for 3-5 players. Five spirits are captured in five amulets. The wizards try to find out their correct placements on the altar to cast the freeing spell. Succeeding means honour, failure means&lt;br/&gt;eternal doom.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer's note: &amp;quot;This game, years old and deriving from boring school times, is nothing else but a master mind clone, but a funky multi-player one.  Experienced players should not need more than 5-6 questions. This is not really a party game, since all players stare at their notes and beg each active player for a thinking break :) - give it a try.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
