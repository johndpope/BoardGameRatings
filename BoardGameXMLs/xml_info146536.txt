							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Worgs</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on the vicious worg. Normally relegated to little more than mounts for goblins and their ilk, these menacing, evil wolves actually have quite a bit to offer the average GM. In this book, you&amp;rsquo;ll find the mocking worg (CR 3), which can alter its voice to bait dangerous traps, and can steal the voices&amp;mdash;and even spellcasting ability&amp;mdash;of its victims. You&amp;rsquo;ll also find the shadow worg (CR 5), a creature that is physically healed by darkness and has numerous shadow-related powers, foremost of which is the ability to summon shadow wolves to fight on its behalf. Finally, there is the great speaker worg (CR 9), an ancient and terrible creature that possesses a strange magic that grows stronger the nearer it comes to death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
