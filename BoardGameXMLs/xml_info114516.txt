			<description>Adolf Brunner&amp;rsquo;s twin daughters, Frey and Freya have been raised as living weapons whose sole purpose is destroying Adolf&amp;rsquo;s enemies. Inheriting bestial spirit power from their mother Tuan Dalyr and modified with enhanced physical abilities due to their father&amp;rsquo;s experiments, they are terrifyingly inhuman predators. Frey and Freya aren&amp;rsquo;t driven by evil and cruelty, sadly depravity and death is all they have ever known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Azur Alliance Prowler - Lv. 40&lt;br/&gt; At 5 | Dm 3 | Df 10 | Ar 0 | LP: 12 | Re 10 | Mo 12/16 | AP 3/4&lt;br/&gt; Innate abilities: Open Movement&lt;br/&gt; Unbound: At the end of the Maintenance phase roll a dice.&lt;br/&gt; On 6+, Frey suffers Berserk Lvl 1.&lt;br/&gt; oo - Stealth (Subterfuge, Effect)&lt;br/&gt; Frey becomes Hidden.
