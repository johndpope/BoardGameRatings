							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New Horizon Player&#039;s Guide, 2nd Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to a world that is not our own. Mankind&amp;rsquo;s new home among the stars is more than they ever imagined when they left Earth. The settlers are surrounded by bizarre alien creatures that are often as deadly as they are amazing. Their lives are filled with the wonders of technology, but are held together by the strength of their resolve. Mankind walks this new world hand in hand with wafans, their sister race of sentient living machines, designed during the darker days of humanity&amp;rsquo;s past. This is the world we live in, this is New Horizon. New Horizon is a roleplaying game that incorporates elements of science fiction, fantasy, utopian and dystopian fiction, and speculative fiction. New Horizon is a setting where advanced technologies and futuristic innovations are interweaved with the primeval roughness of an untamed world. It is a place where technology and nature are often seen struggling against one another, each protecting itself from the spread of the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
