			<description>Llamatron is a computer game written by Jeff Minter of Llamasoft, and released as shareware in 1991 for the Atari ST. The game was converted to the Commodore Amiga and MS-DOS the following year. It is very similar in gameplay to the 1982 arcade game Robotron: 2084, although filtered through Jeff Minter's distinctive style. The title screen gives the title as Llamatron: 2112.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a llama which can move on a single-screen playfield. The llama constantly fires a stream of white energy bolts in the direction it is moving. The player can 'hold' the fire direction, so that the llama can move freely whilst firing in a direction; alternatively the player can control the game with two joysticks, choosing the move and fire directions independently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large flock of enemies attempt to attack the llama, and must all be destroyed in order to end the wave (level) and progress to the next wave. Contact with any enemy causes instant death. These enemies, referred to in the game as grunts, take a variety of forms, ranging from boxes of Rizla cigarette papers to the Eye of Providence, taking in cans of Coca-Cola, hamburgers and cutlery along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llamatron Llamatron]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
