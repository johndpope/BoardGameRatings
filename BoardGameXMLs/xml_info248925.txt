			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omega Labyrinth Z is a &amp;quot;rogue-like&amp;quot; RPG mixed with sexy/erotic imagery and situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like rogue-likes, the mechanism is a grid-based, randomly generated dungeon rooms and corridors, random enemies and random item drops. Each floor contains one staircase that leads to the next floor, and the goal of the game is to clear a set number of floors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sexy/erotic parts of the game are mostly represented by 2D flash-style animated imagery: The girls' breasts all wobble during dialogue, the gained XP in the dungeon makes the girls' breast grow, saving a captured girl consists of a half-naked picture where the player must &amp;quot;rub off&amp;quot; vines or threads, if an &amp;quot;unknown&amp;quot; item is found, the girl must rub it between her breasts, and all permanent level-ups are performed in an erotic mini-game where the player must touch the girl in sensitive spots, turning her on and eventually resulting in an orgasm-like spasm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a sequel to Omega Labyrinth, and features all of the original characters plus a few more, including a masochist lolita-type girl who carries a teddy bear and who always want to be spanked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
