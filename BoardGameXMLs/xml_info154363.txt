			<description>The Battle of Kulikovo was fought between the armies of the Golden Horde under the command of Mamai, and various Russian principalities under the united command of Prince Dmitri of Moscow. The battle took place on 8 September 1380, at the Kulikovo Field near the Don River and was won by Dmitri, who became known as Donskoy (of the Don) after the battle. Although the victory did not end the Mongol rule over the Russian principalities, it is widely regarded by Russian historians as the turning point when Mongol influence began to wane and Muscovite power to rise&amp;mdash;a process that eventually led to Muscovite independence and formation of the modern Russian state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a typical hex and counter game. Initiative is determined in each scenario and kept for the entire game. Players perform their actions in order, with possible reactions (when enemy units enter missle range). Example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Player A moves cavalry (reaction fire possible)&lt;br/&gt;2. Cavalry of player A attacks&lt;br/&gt;3. Player A moves infantry (reaction fire possible)&lt;br/&gt;4. Infantry of player A attacks&lt;br/&gt;5. Player B moves cavalry etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is determined by terrain and unit type. Battles are determined by comparing unit strength, which is modified by various factors (armor, charge, terrain, leaders etc.), and dice roll. Interesting elements of game mechanics include: fatigue of units, morale and cavalry movement (turning requires more space).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
