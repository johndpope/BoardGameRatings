			<description>Grab your binoculars and join the Wild Goose team on a Trackin&amp;rsquo; Animals photo safari! Three different games in each box have players chasing animals across the continents, through the oceans, and even back in time. Collect and assemble animal photos, draw and trade cards to make matching pairs, and correctly answer trivia questions to win these games, but watch out for all kinds of crazy twists when special Wild Cards appear! Each set contains 56 cards and directions for three different games to play. Ages 5 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
