			<description>From the Web Page&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get your weekly dose of adventure with D&amp;amp;D Cliffhangers serialized modules! Every week you can read a new installment of a continuing adventure -- all you need to do is stay one week ahead of your players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Miguel Duran&amp;rsquo;s The Hallowed Hills a party of low-level adventurers must explore a system of underground caverns recently discovered beneath the Monastery of the Risen Star. But this is more than just a casual dungeon crawl &amp;ndash; the group must locate and, if possible, rescue the three members of the Order who went down before them and never returned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This four-part adventure is designed for four to six 3rd-level adventurers, though DMs should be able to modify it for parties of varying sizes and/or levels fairly easily. For larger parties, simply increase the number of monsters until the Encounter Levels are appropriate. Alternatively, if your group comprises especially potent player characters, you can change the monster types to something more challenging &amp;ndash; that is, use ghasts rather than ghouls, bugbears rather than orcs, and so forth. The Hallowed Hills is adaptable for use in the World of Greyhawk, another D&amp;amp;D campaign setting, or a world of your own creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
