			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanded Professions: The Woodsman Brings the Savage Wilds Home&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is designed to expand upon the premise of a single Professional Edge representing a an entire profession&amp;rsquo;s career path by creating a tree of Edges from that base profession, allowing for a more direct concept and development focus as the character progresses while still allowing for adaptability and wide variation by accommodating unrelated Edges. These so-called &amp;ldquo;profession trees&amp;rdquo; represent a shared vision and likely direction of advancement in both career and purpose that may be enjoyed by the sort of hero who would pursue the indicated occupation beyond the rudiments of the initial Professional Edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this offering, you&amp;rsquo;ll find the woodsman profession tree. Woodsmen are masters of the wilds. They are far more at home far from civilization, amongst untamed environments than they are around the teeming masses and trappings of culture and refinement. As such, they are capable of developing skills and talents that reflect their chosen lifestyle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
