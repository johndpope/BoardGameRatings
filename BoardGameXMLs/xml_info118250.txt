							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SFX Skills: Enochian Theurgy</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For every actions, there is an equal and opposite reaction!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enochian Theurgy. The concepts of Black Magic are well known, through a variety of media, not so well known however are those practitioners of Magic that adopt a different Philosophy, that of Enochian Magic. Based on the summoning of Angelic spirits Enochian Theurgy is to Diabolism what Day is to Night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SFX Skills: Enochian Theurgy is the second installment in the SFX Skills series, which details a new highly adaptable system of FX for modern (and fantasy) d20 role playing. Based within the feat and skill structures common to most d20 systems, SFX Skills are easily added to almost any game with a minimum of adjustments. SFX Skills also offer the ability to run both &amp;ldquo;high&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;low&amp;rdquo; magic games, even games consisting of elements of each, using the same system. SFX Skills: Enochian Theurgy is a self-contained toolkit for adding the angelic magical tradition of Enochian Theurgy to your game, including rules for using SFX Skills, feats for controlling their access, and a new Background for scholars of occult lore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SFX Skills: Enochian Theurgy was designed to be flexible and scalable for characters of 1st to 20th level, while maintaining a strong thematic focus that keeps Enochian Theurgy from becoming &amp;ldquo;just another magic system&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
