			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ptolus Sketchbook line is a great resource for players and DMs to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; more of the City by the Spire. Created by the artists who set the architectural tone for the Ptolus book, every sketchbook focuses on a different district. Together they expand Ptolus with illustrations of buildings not pictured in the core book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in a Ptolus Sketchbook?&lt;br/&gt;- Building illustrations inspired by Monte&amp;rsquo;s descriptions.&lt;br/&gt;- Illustrations of details which could be found in the featured buildings (signs, furniture, typical items).&lt;br/&gt;- Blank handouts of letters, advertisements, etc. which can be easily customized to your needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every Ptolus Sketchbook from The Forge Studios consists of two parts. The first one is stylized and consists of illustrations made on a parchment background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second part is a set of black and white illustrations which can be easily printed or presented to players during a session, in order to enrich the locale&amp;rsquo;s description and create a more precise presentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ptolus Sketchbook vol. 1:Midtown is the first part of a series illustrating Monte Cook&amp;rsquo;s City by the Spire. The supplement focuses on the district with which adventurers are most familiar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ptolus Sketchbook vol. 1:Midtown consists of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 6 neighborhood overviews including:&lt;br/&gt;Emerald Hill&lt;br/&gt;Fairbriar&lt;br/&gt;Katterwood&lt;br/&gt;Longbottom&lt;br/&gt;The Mane&lt;br/&gt;Narred&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 13 building visualizations including:&lt;br/&gt;Avery's Armor&lt;br/&gt;Black Swan&lt;br/&gt;The Cloud Theatre&lt;br/&gt;Danbury's&lt;br/&gt;Fish Market&lt;br/&gt;The Goat&lt;br/&gt;Havan's Haven&lt;br/&gt;Ladris' Fine Foods&lt;br/&gt;North Point Restaurant&lt;br/&gt;Potters'&lt;br/&gt;Row Bathhouse&lt;br/&gt;Saches&lt;br/&gt;Terrek Nal's House&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 33 detail illustrations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- and 7 handouts including :&lt;br/&gt;Three sample buildings&amp;rsquo; signs&lt;br/&gt;A street name sign&lt;br/&gt;A menu&lt;br/&gt;Two sample advertisements&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
