			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the revised edition of Pestilence: the Book of Diseases. I&amp;rsquo;m very happy to bring you this updated version of one of Fat Goblin&amp;rsquo;s earliest works, and I hope you all enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it! Contained within are a myriad of diseases designed to strike fear into the hearts of your players, as well as rules for creating virulent, hyper-contagious plagues to ravage the denizens of your world. The text of this document remains faithful to the original; only a few changes have been made to the rules, updating them and polishing them here and there. The biggest change that long-time fans will recognize is the inclusion of new rules regarding alchemically-engineered plagues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
