							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Art of Christian Conversation</name>
									
			<description>A new game from the makers of The Art of Conversation: The Art of Christian Conversation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the website:&lt;br/&gt; The Art of Christian Conversation is an innovative and inspiring way for Christians, (and those exploring) to get to know themselves - and God - better. Carefully researched, tested, trialled and refined, TAOC Christian offers new angles and avenues to think about, and discuss, Christian faith and life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Louise Howland and Keith Lamb, authors of the original best-selling titles, TAOC The Art of Conversation, have collaborated for this special edition with Ross and Suzette Bowerman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 300 Christian Communication-builders ranging from the profound to the light-hearted, plus a comprehensive Christian Communication Guidebook, TAOC makes it easy to share and discuss feelings, ideas and experiences related to faith and religious living in a harmonious way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all TAOC editions, it&amp;rsquo;s not a quiz &amp;ndash; and whilst there are myriad of opportunities to learn, it&amp;rsquo;s never about who knows the most. Rather, it&amp;rsquo;s a communication tool that draws on personal experiences, thoughts and reactions to facilitate fascinating discussions and new insights. It also encourages clear communication and respectful listening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TAOC is a handy icebreaker when a new group of people come together and helps people who already know each other take their relationships to new levels. Ideal for small groups, bible study, fellowship, education and the home, TAOC can be played by family, friends, workmates, students or even solitary players. TAOC is suitable for players aged from four to 104.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
