			<description>In Pixelmon, also known as &amp;quot;Prehistoric Pixelmon - The Deckbuilding Game&amp;quot;, 2 to 5 players tame, train and battle with pixellated prehistoric monsters in order to win Prizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to win the most prizes after 8 game turns, whereby the first 5 turns are for taming and training your Pixelmon only, whereas in turns 6 to 8 and possibly beyond, players battle each other with their fighting teams of three Pixelmon each. The &amp;quot;last man standing&amp;quot; in a battle will be awarded a prize card and the player with the most prize cards after three battles were fought is declared victor (in case of ties, additional turns will be held until one player emerges victorious).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a deckbuilding game on the lines of Dominion, Thunderstone, Nightfall and others as each player will start out with one Starting Pixelmon and a Starting Deck associated with it. Over the course of the game players will build up and optimize their decks by &amp;quot;learning&amp;quot; (buying from a supply) new attacks which they can use in battle phase to overcome the other player's Pixelmon teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will be illustrated in glorious retro-style pixel artwork and graphics by the game's designer himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
