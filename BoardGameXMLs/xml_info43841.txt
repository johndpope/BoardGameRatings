							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Land of Og</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players continue to no use big words play Og in Land of Og! It's more fun than you can shake a club at. Revised rules, expanded rules, live action rules and more for Og: The Role Playing Game. All of this in one book that continues the spirit of a prehistoric world of limited words and unlimited fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included inside is one new word(!) and the full version of Og: The Game of Senseless Prehistoric Combat, the game that started it all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's everything we missed in the first book and more! Not since the invention of the wheel has there been this much fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;64 page, full color cover, perfect bound, stand-alone book that does not require Og: The Role Playing Game to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Check out the Land of Og expansion and sourcebook: The Complete Caveman's Club Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
