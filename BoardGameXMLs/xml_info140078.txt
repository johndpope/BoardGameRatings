							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Six</name>
									
			<description>Card game published as a fund-raiser for a charity that cares for greyhounds after their racing career ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game best played with 4 players plus one caller [the caller can be one of the players).&lt;br/&gt;One pack of 52 cards are dealt out with 13 cards to each of the 4 players. The caller also has a deck of cards which is dealt by turning up one card at a time and names the card for all to hear, i.e. Suzie 1, Phoenix 6, Smart Dresser etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the card called out places the card from his/her hand face upwards on the table. The caller continues to call out the names of the cards until a player lays down the last card in his/her hand and calls out Super Six.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the caller calls out the card dealt the card is placed on the table so that a cross-check can be taken for the winning hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are a little odd. One would expect only to have greyhound cards but not so, there are Mascot, Trophy, Kennel, and four individual cards that have no category to fit them in. I think the original game must have been more complicated, taking advantage of all these cards but as publication date drew near, the charity probably felt worried about this and cut out all rules except as described above, reducing the game to little more than Lotto.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
