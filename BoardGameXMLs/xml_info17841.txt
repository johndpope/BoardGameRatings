							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Petticoat Lane</name>
									
			<description>A trading game based on the famous London market of the same name.  The board is molded plastic, and it came with hundreds of counters, cards and scrip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;Buying and selling is fun when you play Petticoat Lane, where each player tries to become the most successful trader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has his own market stall, which he opens with a stock of highly unusual articles, never before offered for sale.  As the game progresses he sells these articles, and with the money made, buys more stock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player tries to outsell his trading rivals by attempting to corner the market on some articles, by changing his prices, and by holding promotional sales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one of the players succeeds in selling all his stock.  The winner is the player who has made the most money - unsold stock has no value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
