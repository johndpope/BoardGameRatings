			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The secrets of Terris revealed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remote lands of the Terris Dominance are the oldest and most mysterious region of Scadrial, predating the Final Empire itself. For over a thousand years, the proud Terris people have endured brutal systematic oppression by the Lord Ruler, guided and counseled by the shadowy Keepers and protected by their unique power of Feruchemy. But whyhave they survived, and what is their plan? There&amp;rsquo;s always another secret&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt; Terris: Wrought of Copper is an essential supplement for the Mistborn Adventure Game, designed for players, Narrators, and fans of the Mistborn novels. Developed in cooperation with Brandon Sanderson, this guide expands the canon of the novels, providing a detailed look at the history of the Terris Dominance and its people. Inside you&amp;rsquo;ll find a guide to the city of Tathingdwen, the heart of Terris society, as well as an exploration of both the secretive Terris Synod and the nascent Terris Resistance, plus all-new insights into the awesome power of Feruchemy.&lt;br/&gt; For players of the Mistborn Adventure Game, there&amp;rsquo;s a bevy of new rules for creating and playing your own Terris Hero, including new Stunts, equipment, metalminds, and a new ability: Networks!&lt;br/&gt; Also included is an epic adventure, &amp;quot;Justice, like Ash,&amp;quot; which sweeps your Crew into events that shake the Final Empire to its very foundations! A powerful Obligator has been murdered, a Terrisman stands accused as the killer, and it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to uncover the truth. Your hunt will take you from the paved streets of Luthadel to the ancient cobblestones of Tathingdwen and the farthest reaches of the Terris Dominance. Can you catch the culprit before the Lord Ruler&amp;rsquo;s wrath is unleashed across Terris? The fate of an entire people rests on your shoulders&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
