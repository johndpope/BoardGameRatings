			<description>The movie-theater game from S&amp;amp;R from the end of the 1940's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with thick cardboard movie-theaters which have a wooden stand nailed onto them.&lt;br/&gt;Into these stands, cards can be slotted-in,  depicting various fictitious movies in comical style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When every player has drawn such a card dice rolling begins with several specially made dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The movies generate different income(represented by colorful and thick cardboard chips), and also have different rental price in order to keep on showing particular movie in your own theater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under certain circumstances you can drag a movie star into your theater who is represented by a small little red car and who enhances your income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when all movies provided with the game have been shown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pure dice-luck, but if you're prepared to get into it you're rewarded by pure nostalgia, the components and artwork. One of the most sought-after S&amp;amp;R games !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
