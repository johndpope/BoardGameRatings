							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Void and Meddler - Episode 2</name>
									
			<description>A clandestine queer club where pure hormones are distributed to the city&amp;rsquo;s residents, a pirated film circulating on the black market, two detectives and a lizard investigating a disappearance, Fyn sinks even deeper into the surreal reality of the city night. Experience a brand new episode packed with psychedelic detail that plunges the player into the deepest thoughts of this unsympathetic character. Engulfed by the sound and fury of organic bass and aggressive synthesizers, even more strange and twisted mysteries await you. Even though the world around you may seem unreal, unlike you, it won't forget who you are and what you've done. The night shifts, the city calls you, and the radio crackles&amp;hellip; Slowly goes the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
