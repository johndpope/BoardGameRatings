			<description>Cleaver the Pit, Version 1.0 is a Miniatures Game sold as a limited run of saddle stitched 12 page book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players create characters that fight in an arena. The characters are represented by a series of stats from which to extrapolate combat. The stats are generated randomly. Combat is conducted through a series of dice rolls and counter rolls to determine if one character hits another. Armor, weapons and skills can effect the outcome of each dice roll. Once a hit is scored, damage is determined. Once a character has exhausted his life points, the character is dead. The player creates a character. The character enters the arena. The character fights until dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
