			<description>&amp;quot;There are more things in Heaven &amp;amp; Earth&amp;hellip; than are dreamt of in your philosophy.&amp;quot; Potter's Lake is a small, midwestern town where local legends, wives tales, and sightings of the supernatural abound. Practically every house that has been standing for more than twenty years has reported a haunting of one variety or another, and quirky doesn't even begin to describe some of the townsfolk. In short, Potter's Lake is a strange and unusual place. However, these bizarre happenings are only symptoms of a greater malady, a cancer that will consume this town then spread across the world. Something sinister is brewing in Potter's Lake, and if left unchecked, humanity itself stands at risk. Heaven &amp;amp; Earth is a role-playing game of surrealism, horror, and absurdity. In the small community of Potter's Lake, strange things are afoot. Players assume the roles of ordinary people caught in an epic greater than they can possibly imagine. They will be swept into the extraordinary events that plague this town with frightening regularity. It is up to them to unlock the secrets of Potter's Lake and discover the truth of what is really going on before it's too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
