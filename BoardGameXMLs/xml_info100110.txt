			<description>49 cards. There are six races (suits) - British, Turkish, Indian, Choctaw, Negro, Japanese. Each race has 8 ranked cards, starting with The Baby and ending with The King. The cards are also numbered from 1 to 8.&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 6 counters. Take out the Old Maid card as it is not used in the main game. Then the cards are dealt out to each player but an extra hand should also be dealt. This extra hand should remain face down and kept out of the game. Therefore, a few cards are not in play so will cause 'Stops' as the game proceeds.&lt;br/&gt;The first player plays a card and announces its number and race. The next player must play the next card in rank for that race if he has it. If he doesn't then he says &amp;quot;I pass&amp;quot;. There will probably come a point when the next highest card is not in play because all players will pass. In this case the player who played the last card, plays to the next round of play.&lt;br/&gt;The Japanese Baby is a special card that allows the player to play it after he has just added a legal card, crying &amp;quot;Spin&amp;quot; as he does so. This means that the card he last played becomes a stop.&lt;br/&gt;The game stops when one player has run out of cards. There are various rewards and forfeits and the player with the most counters wins.&lt;br/&gt;Rules are included for the main game and two variants, Pool Spin and Old Maid (the publisher having added an Old Maid card for this version).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
