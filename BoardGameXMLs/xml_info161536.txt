			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wordplay combines the fun and challenge of creating new words with the high speed, card-playing dynamics of gin rummy. Use the cards in your hand to make new words or add to the words already created by other players. Be creative and accumulate points to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the youngest student learning to read, Wordplay is a challenging and stimulating educational tool. Wordplay is also a perfect family and party game, and a creative challenge for mature minds. It is just the right amount of action-packed word creation and fun. Wordplay never plays the same way twice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
