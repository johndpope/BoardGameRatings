			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;A city like any other, a day like any other, except.  At eleven fifty nine PM people vanished.  Not Joe from the news stand or Jane from the coffee shop, no those who are gone are those who hold our city together.  All the heroes but you, are gone, most of the police and firemen also have vanished.  Can you hold the city together, are you up to the challenge of &amp;quot;The day of deeds?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the adventure &amp;quot;The day of deeds&amp;quot;  We offer the GM the ability to put heroes through the paces, in a city enveloped in chaos with little or no backup.  This adventure uses a random system to ensure a new experience each time it is played.  It is made for any size or power level group, and can be played multiple times with out repetition.  This adventure will easily fit into any city campaign and can be run with little to no preparation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
