			<description>DESCRIPTION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;F.E.A.R. 3 (stylized in the logo as F.3.A.R) is a first person-shooter developed by Day 1 Studios for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and the OnLive cloud gaming service as a sequel to the game F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin and the third installment of the F.E.A.R. series. It was announced on April 8, 2010 and is stated to include John Carpenter helping on the cinematics as well as writer Steve Niles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;F.E.A.R. 3 includes features such as co-op, an evolved cover system, and more scares, according to Day 1 Studios founder and president Denny Thorley. In the game, the players control either Point Man or Paxton Fettel, the protagonist and antagonist, respectively, from the first game, F.E.A.R.. The controls for the Point Man are the same, with shooting enemies and slowing time. As Fettel, you assist the Point Man by using telekinesis, stun, possession, and other abilities. Also, the game has both online and offline Co-Op play. And as confirmed at last year's E3, there is split-screen Co-Op. Once you complete a level as Point Man, in the single player mode, you can then replay that level as Paxton Fettel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four game modes that are going to be included in F.E.A.R. 3 multiplayer. The four game modes are &amp;quot;F---ing Run&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Contractions&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Soul Survivor&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Soul King&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;F---ing Run&amp;quot; features 4 players running through waves of enemies, all the while running from Alma's massive &amp;quot;Wall of Death.&amp;quot; The players start off in a safe room and proceed through levels, killing enemies within a certain amount of time. There are several safe rooms throughout the mode, and if a player is downed, one of the co-op players can revive them. If one player is killed the game is over. &amp;quot;Contractions&amp;quot; is a survival round-based game mode where you must barricade and stock up weapons against 20 waves of enemies from the F.E.A.R. 3 single player, similar to Call of Duty's &amp;quot;Nazi Zombies,&amp;quot; although the farther you increase through the waves the tougher it gets by adding a fog effect that creeps closer and closer making the map much more dangerous. &amp;quot;Soul Survivor&amp;quot; has four players pitted against each other with one player playing as a &amp;quot;Spectre&amp;quot; in which he or she has to possess enemies to kill the other three players and turn them into Spectres before the time runs out. &amp;quot;Soul King&amp;quot; is similar to Soul Survivor but with the exception that all the players play as Spectres and must possess enemies to kill each other and collect dropped souls. Teamwork and cooperation is needed for players to win in the game modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;F.E.A.R. 3&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STORY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight months ago, Point Man and his F.E.A.R. squad were tapped to stop an unknown man who had commandeered a secret battalion of telepathically-controlled supersoldiers at the Armacham research facility in the Northwestern US city of Fairport. During the mission Point Man learned that the man wasn&amp;rsquo;t working alone. In fact, the very people Point Man was working to destroy were his telepathic, cannibalistic brother, Paxton Fettel, and his tortured and psychically powerful mother, Alma Wade&amp;mdash;products of Armacham&amp;rsquo;s perverse paranormal experiments. Despite this revelation, Point Man moved forward with the standing F.E.A.R. team orders to stop the targets at any cost. In a last-ditch attempt to end the pair&amp;rsquo;s homicidal rampage, the F.E.A.R. team set in motion an explosive series of events that seemingly accomplished their goal but at the cost of ravaging the city, its inhabitants and almost all of Point Man&amp;rsquo;s squad mates.&lt;br/&gt; For months following the blast, events in Fairport have made it clear that Alma&amp;rsquo;s psychic influence survived&amp;mdash;and worse, her paranormal power is growing and spilling into reality. Now her supernatural agony repeatedly rocks the city as she attempts to secure the survival of her bloodline and reunite her family. Armacham&amp;rsquo;s security force remains violently focused on eliminating all evidence of the events in the city, and the remaining F.E.A.R squad carries on the mission to stop Alma.&lt;br/&gt; With the chain of command broken and Point Man calling his own shots, where will his allegiance lie? With his brother Paxton Fettel, back from the dead, arriving with an unclear agenda and refusing to leave Point Man&amp;rsquo;s side? With his pregnant mother Alma and her horrifically twisted, yet immensely powerful paranormal existence? Or with his remaining F.E.A.R. squad brethren who are hell bent on saving the world, but at the cost of destroying the only blood ties Point Man has ever had?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
