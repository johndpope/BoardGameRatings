			<description>This is a very simple card game designed for kids. Each player has a handful of Gangsters that they have to place before a Judge (5 cards), or send to Prison (1 card). Which Judge you send your gangster to depends on a die roll, and if there is already a Gangster there, you instead must take that Gangster back into your hand. A roll of a 6 allows you to send a Gangster to prison, and there is always room there. Or you can break a Gangster out of prison and send them to another player&amp;amp;#039;s hand. A round is played until one player disposes of their last gangster, and all other gangsters left in hand are worth negative points. Play to an agreed upon time limit or a specified number of rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
