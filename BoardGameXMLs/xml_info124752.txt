Vigilance Press proudly presents our newest product line, Due Vigilance, a line of villain teams to drop into your superhero campaigns. Issue one, The Oktobermen, features a sinister group of ne'er-do-wells with a supernatural bent. Not for the faint of heart, these villains aren't afraid to play dirty:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Springheeled Jack leads a team of ghosts, witches, shapeshifters, and other blackhearted mercenaries to help him achieve his goal: gathering 1,313 souls to promote himself to full-demon status so he can inherit his true power! This book describes the characters in Mutants and Masterminds Third Edition rules, gives you a relationship chart to see how they interact with each other, a set of standees for the characters, full-color artwork, and more! You also get several ideas for adventures, and two npcs to help jump-start one of the adventure seeds. The PDF also comes with the full set of characters in Hero Lab portfolio form, as well as artwork for each character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the sinister nature of the characters, this product is aimed at older teens and up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
