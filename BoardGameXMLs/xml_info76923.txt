							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sins of a Solar Empire: Entrenchment</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;After nearly 15 years, the war which raged across dozens of star systems is nearing a stand-still. The great fleets of the Trader Emergency Coalition, the Vasari Empire and the Advent are near stalemate. With the fronts temporarily stabilized, there is time to regroup, and entrench. Great defensive battlestations are being deployed and critical choke points fortified. Will this buy the TEC, Vasari or Advent enough time to organize an all-out offensive?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entrenchment is the first micro-expansion for Sins of a Solar Empire, adding new structures, new technologies, and numerous other improvements to one of the most popular and award-winning PC titles of 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore entirely new strategies with new units like starbases, mine layers, and defense busters and brand new research technologies to customize and improve them. Each race relies more on their unique strengths than ever before, resulting in new defensive options and the necessary evolution of new offensive strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
