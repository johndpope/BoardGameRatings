							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ambush at Altair</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mobile Infantry has many tools and weapons at its disposal. Carried throughout the galaxy by the power of the Cherenkov Drive, armed to the teeth with the most advanced weapons and heavily armoured, the Mobile Infantry is a devastating force indeed. Yet these advantages pale in comparison to the one thing that makes the finest soldiers in the history of humanity so very effective- support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Mobile Infantry trooper has access to a logistical support system of nearly perfect efficiency. All the ammunition, weaponry, supplies and vehicles he needs for any mission are automatically supplied to him. He need not worry about ammunition shortages, about his armour running out of power, about any damage done to his vehicle. SICON provides him with a safety net of more ammunition, more armour, more vehicles. In Ambush at Altair however, the troopers must learn to work without the usual safety net.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ambush at Altair is an extended series of missions for a squad of Mobile Infantry troopers, taking place entirely on the planet of Altair V.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ambush at Altair is intended for a group of four to six Mobile Infantry Player Characters of 6th to 7th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
