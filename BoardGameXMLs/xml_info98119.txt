			<description>Box cover US PC release&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's 1939 and the world stands on the brink of a conflict the likes of which has never been seen. You are drafted into the Air Force and rushed through training. You are young, inexperienced, and in control of the most advanced flying fighting machine your country has to offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring WWII-era aircraft and a wealth of historically inspired scenarios, Air Conflicts is a thrill ride for any computer pilot with its intense dogfights, daring bombing raids, and vivid aerial missions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Developer Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Air Conflicts is an exciting new arcade flight combat game set in World War II. You take part in a series of Campaigns each simulating a different part of the war - from the Battle of Britain to the Fall of Berlin. Unlike other games where you can get stuck on a tough mission, in Air Conflicts, you need not complete a mission to advance in the campaign. Succeed or fail, the war goes on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Campaign spans a year of World War II, and is particular to one of the three sides - the RAF, the Luftwaffe and the Soviet Red Air Force. For example, the RAF&amp;rsquo;s North Africa Campaign runs from December 1941 (Operation Compass) to November 1942 (the second battle of El Alamein).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each month, there will be various Missions that can be taken, at different Battlefields. By flying these missions, you can improve your Service Record, and thus earn promotion to higher Ranks. Total victory in a mission can earn you Medals, but even partial success (or failure) can still be help the war effort - provided you manage to damage or destroy enemy planes or facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successes that advance your Service Record also advance the war effort, and overall victory or defeat for your side is determined by their final Rank at the end of the Campaign (and the selected difficulty level). Also, by shooting down enemy planes and bombing enemy targets, you score Kills which in turn unlock New Planes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Help your side win victory - or just try and survive the enemy onslaught!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is basically an arcade action shooter. Basic flight control mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this 2006 PC game, the player can fly 12 planes (4 per side). The game includes roughly some 200 missions and offers multiplayer deathmatch and team deathmatch modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2009 the game was ported to PSP, with loss of the multiplayer team deathmatch mode and the addition of an American USAAF campaign&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
