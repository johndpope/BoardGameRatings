			<description>It is the 1830's. The United States is a young republic, at whose heart is a constitution guaranteeing the rights and privileges of all its citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A stone's throw away, on the other side of the Niagara River, is Upper Canada. Here rights and privileges are determined by familial and social connections. The province is controlled by a small clique of Tories who govern the province as though it were a family business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opposing these ruling elites are the Reformers - men who espouse dangerous, American ideas: Justice, liberty, and equality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game of the Upper Canada Rebellion, players assume the role of Tory or Reformer. Using an impulse system and point-to-movement, players move their leaders throughout the province rallying supporters, and react to historical events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Reformer, through legislation, petition, and rebellion must cause enough trouble in the province that Her Majesty's Government takes notice.  But be careful! Cause too much trouble and your rag-tag rebels could find themselves squaring-off against regiments of British regulars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tory, through control of the churches, and intimidation, must retain the status quo. Don't be too harsh, however, lest Her Majesty's Government get wind of your corruptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
