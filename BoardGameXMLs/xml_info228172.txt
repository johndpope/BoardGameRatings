			<description>A card game for 2-4+ players in which players are Snake Oil Salesmen (USA circa late 1800&amp;rsquo;s) selling their wares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck. There are 8 types of cards: &lt;br/&gt;N = Name Cards&lt;br/&gt;G = Gimmick Cards&lt;br/&gt;C = Claim Cards&lt;br/&gt;F = Formulation Cards&lt;br/&gt;I = Ingredient Cards&lt;br/&gt;B = Bonus Cards&lt;br/&gt;S = Special Cards&lt;br/&gt;P = Poison Cards&lt;br/&gt; Each player is dealt 7 cards. Players then take turns.  Each turn has 4 phases: &lt;br/&gt;1.  Draw Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Draw 1 card from the top of the deck and put it in your hand&lt;br/&gt;2.  Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Discard 1 special card to activate its special effect. &lt;br/&gt;(Poison cards are a type of special card - discard a poison card to cause a target opponent to discard 1 random card from his Victory Pile.) &lt;br/&gt;-   Players may trade cards.&lt;br/&gt;3.  Meld Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   You may make a Meld. A Meld must contain: &lt;br/&gt;    -   Exactly 1 Name Card&lt;br/&gt;    -   Exactly 1 Formulation Card&lt;br/&gt;    -   1 or 2 Gimmick Cards&lt;br/&gt;    -   1 or 2 Ingredient Cards&lt;br/&gt;    -   1 or more Claim Cards&lt;br/&gt;    -   Zero or 1 Bonus Cards&lt;br/&gt;-   Each card has a Victory Point (VP) value. Place these Meld cards into your Score Pile. The total VP in your score pile is your Score at the end of the game. &lt;br/&gt;4.  End Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all players have passed.  A player must pass at the end of their turn if there are no cards left in the deck. &lt;br/&gt; The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
