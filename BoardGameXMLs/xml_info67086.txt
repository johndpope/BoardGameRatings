			<description>From the Back of the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to reach the score of 21.  Each player gets to flick three NAK pieces.  The first player reaching the score of 21 or more is the winner.  A set of dice adds to the fun and excitement.  To complete the challenge and skill of the game there are two additional holes in the board, a pink hole and a blue hole; the hopes and hazards of each player.  For these holes there are two sets of cards, a pink set and a blue set.  Each time a player's NAK piece falls into either of these holes the corresponding card is selected and the special instructions are followed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
