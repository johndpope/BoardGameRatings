			<description>Super Air Diver (スーパーエアダイバー) - also known as Lock On in North America - is a jet fighter game that has the classic one man vs. the forces of evil formula.  After a vicious warlord threatens the nations of the world, the United Nations have recruited an experienced pilot by the name of Jake Steel in order to bring peace back to the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player will participate in a variety of missions against both air and ground forces and can fly in four different aircraft (the British made Panavia Tornado ADV, the Japanese Mitsubishi F-2 fighter, the A-10 Thunderbolt II and the F-14 Tomcat). The player can use the strengths of each airplane to their advantage along with their powerful weaponry such as M61 Vulcans cannons and heat seeking missiles against enemy jet fighters, tanks and other various enemies scattered throughout each mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sequel Super Air Diver 2 was released exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Air Diver&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
