			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are about to embark on a story about a successful scientist; who was a prodigy in his profession, but would soon fall victim because of his own success.  He was indeed a family man who loved his daughter dearly, rivaled only by his own work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you continue on with the doctor&amp;rsquo;s story, it is tailored to suit any story line for any campaign.  Also includes characters to drop in and use right away straight from the good doctors past (to be used as heroes or villains the choice is yours), to present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
