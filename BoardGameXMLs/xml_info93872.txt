							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nuclear War</name>
									
			<description>Nuclear War is a single player turn-based strategy game developed by New World Computing and released for the Amiga in 1989. It presents a satirical, cartoonish nuclear battle between five world powers, in which the winner is whoever retains some population when everyone else on earth is dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The introduction includes a homage to Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player - one human, four computer-controlled - is represented by a caricature of a national leader. If there is a computer-controlled winner at the end of the game, that leader is depicted jumping for joy in the middle of a blasted wasteland, crowing &amp;quot;I won! I won!&amp;quot;. If the player wins only the high score board is shown. Once a player (computer or human) loses, all of their stockpiled weapons are automatically launched. It's possible for a game to have no winner because of this. If this happens, a cut scene of the earth shattering and exploding is shown, and the high score table appears (though without any new entries.)&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_War_%28video_game%29,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_War_%28video_game%29,&amp;q...&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
