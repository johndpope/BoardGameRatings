			<description>The NES-101 model of the Nintendo Entertainment System (informally known as the NES 2, the &amp;quot;top loading&amp;quot; model, or simply the &amp;quot;top loader&amp;quot;) is a compact, top-loading redesign of the original Nintendo Entertainment System control deck and game controllers released by Nintendo  in 1993.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nintendo marketed the NES-101 model as the Nintendo Entertainment System Control Deck, exactly the same as the original NES-001 model, only with a &amp;quot;new design&amp;quot; logo on the packaging. It retailed in North America for US $49.99 (equivalent to US $75.00 today). This was at a significantly lower price point than the already released Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The NES-101 model is stylistically similar to the HVC-101 model of the Family Computer, which was released in Japan at roughly the same time, but differs in a number of its specifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Nintendo Entertainment System (Model NES-101)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
