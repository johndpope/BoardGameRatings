							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Time &amp; Time Again</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In Time &amp;amp; Time Again, you can stand beside Napoleon at Borodino, watch the pyramids being raised, journey down the Mississippi with Sam Clemens, travel with Marco Polo to Far Cathay, join the legions and cross the Rubicon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The T&amp;sup2; game system features complete rules for character generation and skills with the most realistic combat system, armed and unarmed, ever published. Chapters cover climate, geography, languages, economics, travel, manners and morals, society and culture, technology and more. The physics of Temporal Translation (time travel or T&amp;sup2;), are presented in sufficient detail to allow for easy use while preventing paradox. There are maps and charts, character sheets and three complete scenarios. Just add dice, players and imagination! Welcome to the BTA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is what you've always wanted to do... this is the game you've been waiting to play.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
