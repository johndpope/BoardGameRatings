			<description>Tunes is played either by two players or two teams. The game is played by selecting a card that has the notes for a popular melody printed on it. This card is placed in a special holder with numerous slots that can open to reveal one note at a time. Numbered tiles are then drawn randomly from a bag that tell which note to reveal. The melody that is visible is then sang, sight-read, or played on an instrument. The player who is able to identify the melody with the least amount of notes shown is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes card packs for various genres of music including classical and religious hymns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
