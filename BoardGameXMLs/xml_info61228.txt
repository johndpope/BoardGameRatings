			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you looking for a product that will satisfy your every need? Are you looking for a product that will sing you to sleep at night and shave your stubbly face in the morning? Then you probably want Braun's new singing shaver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If, however, you are looking for an RPG supplement that is a little on the odd side for FREE, then you've come to the right place. The Book of Oafish Might is a 34-page excursion into the slightly (ok, VERY) eccentric side of gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;What, pray tell,&amp;quot; you may ask, &amp;quot;is included in this dismal little product?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, Olaf, how about:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;  Ten uses for a pre-animated iron golem! &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;  &amp;quot;New&amp;quot; fantasy prose, aged for more than 13 years! &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;  Odd creatures such as the lurking lettuce and the forum troll! &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;  New and bizarre templates to create creatures from the ridiculous to the ridiculously sublimely ridiculous! &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;  A table of contents! &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;  Ubiquitous new spells and feats! &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;  And much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what are you waiting for? It's free, it's fun, and it's printed on 100% recycled electrons to save the environment! Download yours today and see for yourself why no one in their right mind is talking about The Book of Oafish Might!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
