			<description>Rules for the North American Indian Wars, covering the period from the French and Indian War to the last stand of the Sioux at Wounded Knee. The Eastern Woodland, Plains, Rocky Mountain and South-Western tribes and their British, French, Spanish, Mexican and American opponents are all catered for. Based on the mechanisms used in Death In The Dark Continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game aims to represent fairly large scale battles instead of the skirmishes usually played out with Wild West games. The rules come complete with a quick reference section, contents list, and army lists for all the major combatants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
