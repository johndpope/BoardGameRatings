			<description>The Luck Mitigation Die is meant to add varying levels of fun and chance to DIG: the Card Game.  It has three blank faces and three faces with icons that correspond to three types of cards in the game: Tunnel, Cave-In, and Gemstone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple and Fun Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Each time you draw a Cave-In Card, roll the Luck Mitigation Die:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;         If you roll a blank, nothing happens. Continue drawing, if appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;         If you roll the Cave-In Icon, activate the Cave-In Card. Stop drawing cards for that Tunnel.&lt;br/&gt;         If you roll the Tunnel Icon, play a free, next-level Tunnel. Continue drawing cards, if appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;         If you roll the Gemstone Icon, draw one extra card.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you encounter another Cave-In during any successive card draws, follow the steps above again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced Strategic Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Before you draw a card during the Mine Phase, you may choose to pay for use of the Luck Mitigation Die as follows: Apprentice Dwarves: 1 Gold, Journeymen Dwarves: 2 Gold, and Master Dwarves: 3 Gold. You may make this payment (to the bank) with only one dwarf per Day.&lt;br/&gt;     Draw cards from the Mine deck, as appropriate, one card at a time. If you draw a Cave-In Card, roll the Luck Mitigation Die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;         If you roll a blank, nothing happens. Continue drawing, if appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;         If you roll the Cave-In Icon, activate the Cave-In Card. Stop drawing cards for this Tunnel.&lt;br/&gt;         If you roll the Tunnel Icon, play a free, next-level Tunnel. Continue drawing cards, if appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;         If you roll the Gemstone Icon, draw one extra card.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you encounter another Cave-In during any successive card draws, activate the Cave-In as normal--do not roll the die again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
