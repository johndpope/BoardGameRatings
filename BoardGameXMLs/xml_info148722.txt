							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Saving Stetson City</name>
									
			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;January 5th, 1868. Somewhere in Eldorado County, Arizona. Early on a quiet Sunday, you ride into Stetson City. The faithful folk of the&lt;br/&gt;town are at worship &amp;ndash; and most other sorts of folk are probably sleeping off last night&amp;rsquo;s revelries. Suddenly, the silence is broken sharply as shots ring out from the other side of town. You gallop in that direction, but arrive only in time to see a dust cloud fading in the distance -- riders heading for the hills. Later, trembling townsfolk tell you that Hoover&amp;rsquo;s Liquor Store was robbed; only the latest in a string of crimes plaguing Stetson City since Sheriff McCade was slain, two months ago. A Committee of Concerned Citizens (CCC) has been formed, but they are no match for hardened criminals, and the situation has reached a dire state. The CCC seeks your help in reclaiming the town, bringing it back from its lawless state. Is the mayhem just the random work of rowdies and bandits, or is there a coordinating intelligence behind some of the criminal activities? There are some decent, brave men in Stetson City -- men that you should be able to convince to join you as hired guns -- but they need leaders. That is where you come in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saving Stetson City is a Wild West Campaign Setting developed for use with the Go Fer Yer Gun Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
