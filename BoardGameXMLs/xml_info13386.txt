							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hack N&#039; Slash</name>
									
			<description>Hack N' Slash is a humorous dungeon crawl. Start out as a one of several poor adventurers armed only with your pointy stick. Each of the various roles has its own special abilities and advantages and you roll dice for others. As you gain experience, your stats increase, and you can beat up bigger monsters. There's also going after your fellow players to take their stuff too. You may run into such foes as the Polite Cultists and/or Winston Churchill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
