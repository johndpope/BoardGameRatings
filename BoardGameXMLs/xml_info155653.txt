			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantastic adventures deserve fantastic magic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add a little, or a lot, of magic to your games with the Universal Adventures Spell Deck.  Shake the earth, disrupt the undead, blast your enemies with fire and ice, conjure light and more, with the Universal Adventures Spell Deck.  Universal Adventures Spell Deck presents you with fifty-four spell cards for any game that uses magic.  Drawn from six different realms of magic, each of the spell cards includes the name of the spell, description of its casting, range, area, duration and effect of the spell.  The spells can be used with any fantasy adventure game, or any genre that uses magic, with little, or no, adaptation.  Use the spells as part of your game&amp;rsquo;s current magic system, to replace it, or as a source of special abilities for new or current classes or professions.  Keep your game moving quickly by having the spell card on hand whenever the spell is cast.  Game Masters can quickly create scrolls by drawing a spell card from the appropriate deck.  Need to determine starting spells for a new character or determine what spells an encountered character knows?  Draw a card from the Spell deck.  Need to know what spells are available at the local Wizard&amp;rsquo;s Guild?  Draw some cards from the Spell deck.  Does your game system use a &amp;quot;memorization&amp;quot; style of magic?  No need to write down the spells your character prepares, just select the cards your character has prepared and discard them as they are cast.  There are plenty of uses in your fantasy games for the Universal Adventures Spell Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
