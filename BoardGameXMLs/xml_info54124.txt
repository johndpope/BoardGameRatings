			<description>In the World of ChessCraft, there are 4 races. Each race represented by a different colour. Orc is Red, Undead is Black, Human is Blue and Elf is Green. Each has their own unique abilities to influence the game play. Orc has piece promotion and piece destruction. Undead has graveyard manipulation and piece control. Human has piece position and board manipulation. Elf has card manipulation. The battle has just began!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ChessCraft is an abstract game played with cards, for 1 vs 1 or 2 vs 2 players. Each game takes around 30 min to 1 hr. Contents of the full games are:&lt;br/&gt;a)    32 pieces&lt;br/&gt;b)    75 cards&lt;br/&gt;c)    16 board tiles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the game are &lt;br/&gt;(1) Capture the opponent king &lt;br/&gt;(2) Accumulate 20 or more cards per player &lt;br/&gt;(3) When the king reaches the opponent&amp;rsquo;s summoning board tile&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns to place the board tiles. At the beginning of each player's turn, he draws 1 card from a common draw pile. During his turn, the player has to make a move on one of his pieces. At any time during his turn, he can &lt;br/&gt;(1) Summon basic or advanced pieces &lt;br/&gt;(2) Promote basic pieces to advanced pieces &lt;br/&gt;(3) Play cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do these 3 actions, costs must be paid first, which means discarding cards equal to the cost face down to a common discard pile. Whenever a card is played, the opponent may respond by playing a card. Cards are resolved first in last out. During opponent's turn, player may also play cards. Player can also modify the movement, capture or interaction with opposing piece of a piece in play by paying the cost of a Piece Modifier Action card. The effects of the modification lasts only the turn the card is played. Unsummoned pieces are in each player&amp;rsquo;s reserve. When the pieces are captured (or destroyed), they are placed in each player&amp;rsquo;s graveyard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 types of cards. Actions go to the discard pile face up immediately while Permanents stay in play in front of the player who played them. Kings cannot be targeted or affected by cards unless specified. Player may not Check the opponent if he plays any card prior to his Move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each 2x2 board tile has a coloured circle in one of the squares. The circle indicates the square as a terrain of that colour. At the beginning of a player&amp;rsquo;s turn, if his pieces occupy all 4 terrains of his own colour, he can draw 1 more card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discussion forum can be found here&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3869101#3869101&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3869101#3869101&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
