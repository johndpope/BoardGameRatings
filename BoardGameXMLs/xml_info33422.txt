			<description>This is a version of Boggle played with cards.  Each player is dealt 10 cards, then has three minutes to make as many words with their hand of cards as they can.  Like Scrabble, each letter has a point score associated with it, so that each word can be scored.  The game has 4 levels of difficulty.  At higher levels, players get larger hands of cards, and their words must have more letters in order to score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with rules in English &amp;amp; Spanish, the deck of cards, and a sand timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
