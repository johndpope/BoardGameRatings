							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Knights of the Lily</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Order of the Lily, a secret society of noblemen, grew wary of the Project Safeguard and the Enforcers quite soon after the first announcement of it's intentions. The Order knew that eventually, the Project was doomed to fail. After all, how would people accept the authority of an organization who they had no influence at all?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a long discussion, the Overseers of the Order decided to start preparing for the worst. They recruited some of the world's most talented people and began training them to counter the possible threat of the Enforcers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, after a year of vigorous training, the Knights are ready to begin their mission: end the oppression of the Enforce and stop the Project Safeguard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
