							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Captain Midnight&#039;s Treasure</name>
									
			<description>In Captain Midnight&amp;rsquo;s Treasure, you take on the role of a pirate on a crew that has just returned from a very successful raid and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to divide the loot in typical pirate fashion, with dice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Captain Midnight&amp;rsquo;s Treasure is a family friendly, easy to learn, fast paced dice game that provides for challenging strategic game decisions in a fun environment. This game will test your knowledge of odds and probabilities, as well as help you teach them to younger upcoming gamers, as you decide when to push your luck and roll again, or stay with what you have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;You have 5 dice and 3 rolls to get as much treasure as you can from the pot before everyone else does. The game starts off by rolling the dice to determine the Swabbie. After that each person rolls the dice, with the Swabbie going last, trying to get a Ship, Captain, and Crew, with the last two dice determining how much treasure you get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But since you are pirates, it&amp;rsquo;s not going to be that easy! First, you have to make sure you get enough treasure to beat the Swabbie or else you have to pay him his dues. Then, certain rolls will cause you to lose your treasure or allow you to take treasure from other players, or even become Captain Midnight himself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And of course the one with the most gold at the end wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
