							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vacation USA</name>
									
			<description>In Vacation USA, players roll dice and move around the board to various locations. They may opt to take a vacation on any landmark site they land on, or hold their money in hopes of landing on higher point value sites later. Players also may purchase Insurance cards one at a time (one at the start of the game, one on landing upon a white state), and must draw Hazard cards on red states. Hazards cost money, but may be ignored with the proper insurance. Each player may also borrow $1000 from the bank up to two times in the game to cover expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Vacation USA is to be the first player to accumulate at least 2500 points without owing any money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vacation USA claims to be an &amp;quot;Educational Experience&amp;quot;, aiding the players in learning about U.S. vacation sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
