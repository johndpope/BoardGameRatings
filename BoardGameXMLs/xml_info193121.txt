			<description>Four members of the prestigious &amp;quot;Club of Adventurers&amp;quot; in London have made a bet amongst themselves to see who can travel to the eight most legendary places in the world over 75 weeks and learn the most about these places while visiting. Whoever ends up with the most reputation wins the bet and the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, each player starts with a few randomly-dealt knowledge cards, with these cards corresponding to some of the eight legendary locations: Atlantis, Himalayas, the pyramids of Egypt, and so on. On a turn, a character moves to a location of their choice, spending time to do based on what shows on the game board. At each location, the player can either collect additional knowledge (i.e. cards, with the player collecting cards based on the method showing at the specific location) or discard cards that match this location in order to place a diary token in their color on this space; the more cards they discard, the more points they might possibly earn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those points are only possible points because four times during the 75 weeks, the Club members meet again in London to compare their knowledge about the legends, and because time is at a premium, only the five most promising stories can be told. What stories will these be? Well, in game terms, one of the places that players can visit while traveling is Club headquarters in London, and here players can drop cards that they've collected. During the scoring phase, these cards are shuffled, then five different locations revealed &amp;mdash; and these five locations are the only ones that score. Thus, the more often you share knowledge about a particular location, the more likely it is to score &amp;mdash; but the less valuable it will be for you since you cannot use that knowledge for your diary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
