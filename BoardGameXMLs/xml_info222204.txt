							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lost in Narration</name>
									
			<description>A fast interactive battle of narration, between 2 to 6 wizard storytellers, on 4 fantasy themed stories. &lt;br/&gt;In this game, wizard storytellers compete in forming and completing four different stories. They all have great ideas to propose for each story theme, but who has the best ones? You are a fantastic wizard storyteller: Manage your story cards &amp;ndash; place them on the board as parts of stories or discard them. Gather fantasy coins, buy spells and cast them wisely. Your goal is to add parts of stories and complete them, in order to score story points. The more spectacular a story is, the more points it&amp;rsquo;s worth, but to whom? The best contributors score, but the storyteller with the final word gets extra credit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
