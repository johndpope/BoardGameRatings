			<description>From ZX Spectrum instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEFENDERS OF THE EARTH is based on the very popular T.V. series of the same name. The Defenders, four super heroes from the Golden Age of Comics are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FLASH GORDON - The Team Leader.&lt;br/&gt;MANDRAKE THE MAGICIAN - A master of illusion.&lt;br/&gt;LOTHAR - The strongest man in the world.&lt;br/&gt;THE PHANTOM - Has the strength of ten tigers at his command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are aided and abetted by their pet mascot ZUFFY.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Team - Invincible, Ready, Able and Willing to Defend the Earth at all times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The courage and skill of the Defenders is put to the ultimate test by the evil of their arch enemy MING THE MERCILESS. He knows that only the Defenders stand in the way of his plan to be Master of the World. To stop them he abducts their children and takes them to the dark dungeons of his Fortress. He issues&lt;br/&gt;a dire warning - Interfere and your children die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A daring plan is conceived and put into action. Detection by the highly sophisticated intruder alarm would mean the instant death of the children and so Flash will enter the dark and dangerous fortress alone in the hope that he will be able to pass undetected through the intruder systems. Flash agrees to&lt;br/&gt;summon the other Defenders to his aid should he need it. Lothar and the Phantom will use their incredible strength, Mandrake will use his occult magical powers to confound the forces of evil under Ming's command and even Zuffy offers his help in whatever way he can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flash, armed with a powerful handgun, transports into Ming's fortress with the future of the world in the balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
