							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tinker Fox</name>
									
			<description>A miniatures rules system designed to recreate garrison warfare in the English Midlands during the English Civil War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;What we wanted to do in Tinker Fox was to drop you into the boots of a Governor of a district in the English Civil War. A Governor does more than fight battles. He must first and foremost follow his masters&amp;rsquo; orders. They are usually vague, and it is up to him to come up with a plan to implement them. He must then try to get his subordinates to carry out his detailed instructions. Unfortunately they often have their own agendas and personalities that he must deal with. He must also run an extensive civil government, which is not directly simulated, but is represented by delays and obstructions they naturally cause to military matters.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Tinker Fox will generate numerous and varied types of battles with whatever troops are present in the campaign. These can be replayed using our new Very Civile Actions! cards now available as a variant for Spanish Fury, Actions! Let the games begin!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components consist of a rulebook, quick reference data sheet, unit control sheet, mapsheet and a set of counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
