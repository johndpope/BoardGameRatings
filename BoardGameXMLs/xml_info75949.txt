			<description>[&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clavell&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clavell&lt;/a&gt;'s_Shogun From Wikipedia]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;James Clavell's Shōgun is an interactive fiction computer game written by Dave Lebling and released by Infocom in 1989. Like most of Infocom's games, it was released for several popular computer platforms of the time, such as the Apple II and PC. As the title indicates, the game is based on the book Shōgun by James Clavell. It is Infocom's thirty-third game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game reproduces many of the novel's &amp;quot;scenes&amp;quot;, few of which are interconnected in any way. The player assumes the role of John Blackthorne, Pilot-Major of the Dutch trading ship Erasmus. During a voyage in the Pacific Ocean in the year 1600, the Erasmus is shipwrecked in Japan. Blackthorne must survive in a land where every custom is as unfamiliar to him as the language. After learning some of the society's ways, he is drawn into a political struggle between warlords and falls in love with a Japanese woman. Eventually he embraces Japanese life and is honored as a samurai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
