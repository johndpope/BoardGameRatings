			<description>In 相場操縦 (Market Manipulation), each player secretly represents a company, with as many companies in the game as the number of players. Each company in the game has a deck of eight tiles, with point values on the back of these tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The start player in a round draws one tile from each company, looks at the point values for each of them, discards one from play, then places the others in a column with some of them above the break-even line (a thick string) and others below. Each other player in turn either moves one tile from the top of the column to the bottom (or vice versa) while keeping the column in the same position relative to the break-even line or moves the column up or down by one level. The starting player for the round does this action last, then this position rotates clockwise, and the next starting player begins another round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After eight rounds, the game ends and the point values of all tiles above the break-even line are revealed. The player who owns the company with the highest collective value wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
