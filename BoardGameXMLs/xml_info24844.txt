			<description>'Starsiege: Rebellion' is a miniatures game set in Sierra/Dynamix's &amp;quot;Starsiege&amp;quot; universe.  Forces present include the Imperials (humans from Earth), Rebels (human colonials on Mars who stumble into advanced alien technology to allow them to rebel), and Cybrids (humanity's long-time enemy...machines who attempted to destroy their creators several times in the past, and each time being beaten back).  At the point of the game, the Cybrids had established a final base around Pluto from which they began a new invasion after the humans started fighting amongst themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are not many 'scenarios', but the production values are pretty decent - and the game box includes a bucket of miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay features unit activation as a combination of laying chits by units and rolling a die, and the combat has some very elegant twists that make it resolve FAST - only 2 dice (one determined by range, the other determined by skill of the firing unit) for are needed to resolve all damage from an attack.  As a result, the game is not very &amp;quot;nitty gritty&amp;quot;, like Battletech, but takes a higher-level view of action.  Scenarios played with a dozen units would be over in half an hour, easily, and scenarios with many dozens of units would be playable in an afternoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boxed set includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     96-page rulebook &lt;br/&gt;     29 vehicle data cards&lt;br/&gt;     Master Equipment/Master Weapons Reference Card&lt;br/&gt;     Meeting Engagement Scenario Setup Card&lt;br/&gt;     FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) Sheet&lt;br/&gt;     80 full-color die-cut counters&lt;br/&gt;     5 full-color die-cut templates&lt;br/&gt;     5 dice (4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 12-sided) &lt;br/&gt;     18 unpainted miniatures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imperial&lt;br/&gt;- 4 Talon Scout Hercs &lt;br/&gt;- 4 Obsidian Hover Tanks &lt;br/&gt;- 1 Minotaur Herc &lt;br/&gt;Cybrid &lt;br/&gt;- 4 Seeker Scout Hercs &lt;br/&gt;- 4 Manta Hover Tanks &lt;br/&gt;- 1 Shepherd Herc &lt;br/&gt;- 4 hills (thermal plastic, flocked, from 2&amp;quot; to 7&amp;quot; across)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
