			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;Do you know the Taster-lots family? You don't?! No wonder; they come from a very distant planet and they touched down on earth by accident. When they visit a supermarket they are overwhelmed by the tons of food because on their planet there is only pink striped slimy sea grass. So they start tasting everything: cheese, chocolate, butter, plums, frozen pizza,&lt;br/&gt;spinach, potato chips, canned fish, raspberry marmalade&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;Suddenly their faces go all funny with squares. &amp;ldquo;I feel really sick!&amp;rdquo; moans Tim Taster-lots. &amp;ldquo;I have eaten so much I can't move&amp;rdquo;, complains Daddy Taster-lots. They all know they have eaten too much. But what should they have eaten and how? Can you help?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the game you collect the foodstuff that your body needs during the day. Doing so, you should collect neither too much nor too little foodstuff. The food pyramid printed on your stamp sheet shows how much and which foods you should eat during the day. Each little box of the pyramid corresponds to one portion of the foodstuff shown.&lt;br/&gt;Example: Your body needs 4 portions of fruit and vegetables while you should only eat 1 portion of sweets (a portion is as much as fits in your hand).&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to be the first to have checked all the boxes on your nutritional sheet with a stamp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
