			<description>Succes-s iv is a two-player abstract strategy game played on a 9x9 grid with each player having 9 cubes and 9 cylinders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cylinders may advance forward a single square, jump over a piece occupying the square in front of it, or capture a piece diagonally in front of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cubes move like cylinders, but may also capture diagonally backwards.  In addition, the value of the cube may be changed, increasing its forward range.  In the advanced rules, a cube may become frozen or dead if it advances behind the enemy pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to bring two cylinders across the board, occupying squares in the row closest to your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
