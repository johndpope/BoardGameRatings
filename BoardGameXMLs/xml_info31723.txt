			<description>Players try to peg out by rolling dice combinations that match the different lanes on the wooden, cribbage-like pegging board. For instance, the peg in your 6 lane moves one space closer to home with every 6 you have rolled on the dice. Once you peg out on a given lane, you now score victory points every time you roll that number. Opportunities exist to bump your opponent back by landing on him, or to have your roll count double, depending on your peg position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But first, each time you roll the dice, you have to set aside any pair of dice that add up to seven! If the first throw doesn't look good enough, you may take one re-roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
