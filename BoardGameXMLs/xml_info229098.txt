			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago, a clan of dwarves established a mining settlement near a rich vein of ore. Unfortunately, a tribe of Hill Giants soon stumbled onto the settlement and decided to -prey on its inhabitants. Outmatched by the brutes, the dwarves sought a way to even the odds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combining powerful magics with the designs of their best engineers, the dwarves created pilot-able golems they dubbed &amp;ldquo;Golemechs&amp;rdquo;. The Hill Giants were routed quickly by the mechanizes warriors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, the Golemechs themselves soon became a greater problem. Seeing their new inventions as an opportunity to dominate, the dwarves began invading their neighbors. With the machines leading the charge, their small settlement soon became a burgeoning kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tired of the clan&amp;rsquo;s aggression, the nearby countries united their armies against the dwarves and defeated them and their Golemechs. In the ages since, Golemechs have become rare trophies; prized by those who dare to use them and feared by those who face their wrath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
