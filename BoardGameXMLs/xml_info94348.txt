							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Shattered City</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;The Shattered City is a dizzying maelstrom of islets and fragments of ruins rich in both salvage and danger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shattered City has chewed up, and spat out countless scavengers and adventurers, but enough have returned battered, and wounded but with valuable, and vital salvage that it still remains the Sundered Skies primary source of salvage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shattered City Island Guide is the second in a series of Sundered Skies modules which builds upon information contained in both Sundered Skies and the Sundered Skies Companion. It contains a new Background Edge for those born within the ruined city. Details on both the Bright Cabal and the Sons of Spire and their schemes and ambitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The archetypal and terrifying Pirate Lords and many of the major wonders which can be found out in the ruins complete with enough scenario seeds to kickstart a mini campaign. This Guide also details several important NPC's who have the potential to become the heroes grudging allies or bitter enemies and finally details several creatures and hazards new to the Sundered Skies including the tragic Ancient Ghost, which has haunted the skies since the Sundering, the horrifying Soulstorm with the power to destroy an island, and the ominous carrion crowe which both feeds upon and augments necromantic energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
