							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Runequest Character Sheets</name>
									
			<description>Taken from the advert in White Dwarf (Issue 37 - Jan 1983)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character &amp;amp; Adventure Sheets for Runequest&lt;br/&gt;Games Workshop have revised and amended the character record sheet as published in the Runequest rule book so that players can have a permanent and east-to-read record of their character without damaging their copy of the game. We have also designed a smaller &amp;quot;adventure sheet&amp;quot; which is ideal for use during adventures. The sheet covers spells in mind, equipment, current finances, damage and remaining hits and power points. You get 30 character sheets and 80 adventure sheets for just &amp;pound;1.99.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
