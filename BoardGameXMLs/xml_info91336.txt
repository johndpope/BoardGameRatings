			<description>A CCG of Monsters released for the super market companies Match, Smatch and Louis Delhaize in Belgium. Each package includes 5 cards with the entire collection existing out of 216 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules for the game are simple: Every player takes at least 5 cards face down. Now the first player takes the first card from his deck and plays the power shown in the left upper corner, which all have a specific score. Now the other players take the first card from their own deck and compare the score of the chosen power. The player with the highest score on that characteristic wins the round. The game goes on until one person has won all the cards in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are alternate rules to play with a bigger deck untill one player has lost 20 cards; Then the one with most cards wins. Or you can play with a toll deciding the power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
