			<description>From the publisher's web page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terras is a fantasy roleplaying game.  In Terras, players take on the characters of people in a medieval world where different forms of magic exist. To play you need three things: A GM, some players (1 to however many you want, though I think four is best), and a 20 sided and a six sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four races in the world of Terras: Humans, Fenir, Orthans, and Elehdel. There are also many cultures that are covered after the races. Each races&amp;rsquo; histories, cultures and abilities are all covered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
