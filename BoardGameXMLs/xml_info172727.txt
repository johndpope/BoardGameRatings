							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mechanica Companion</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stronger.  Faster.  Better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanical muscles and alloy bone under armored flesh.  Enhanced organs, built-in weaponry, and modifications to suit everything that an adventurer might need.  Whether you're making it out of clockwork and enchanted metals in the Fantasy Era, alloy and laminate in the Near-Modern Era, or using bio-polymers and smart-carbon in the Space Era, it's all the same thing; Mechanica.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This companion for the Victory System includes over a hundred and fifty items of Mechanica for your Victory System campaigns.  Choose from prosthetic replacements to whole-body enhancements and sensory gear to surpass the functionality of mere flesh and bone.  Make a Character into a cyborg a bit at a time, or go full out and convert the intellect into living data to occupy a super-powerful artificial body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just be warned; Mechanica is a relatively quick path to tremendous power and enhanced abilities, but there might be a price to pay beyond money.  For every bit of metal that strengthens the Character, a bit of flesh must be discarded.  One should wonder how much of a person can be replaced before that person isn't that person any more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a supplement for The Victory System; you will need the Core Rulebook to play.  This book updates the Mechanica selections avaiable in the Victory System Core Rulebook, Beasts of Victory, and Prosthetica.  It may also be useful to have a copy of the Victory System Equipment Manual, particularly if you would like to create custom Mechanica of your own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
