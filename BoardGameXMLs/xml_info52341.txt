			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the beginning, all was enveloped in Chaos.  Hope had fled from the hearts of Humanity and Darkness had entered our souls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then came the Cardinal, and He shed Light into the Darkness.  He called upon our salvation from within our very selves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He illuminated the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dark Legion responded with murderous force, but the Cardinal stood strong, and strengthened by His strength, we, his Brotherhood, stood with him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So now we fight, not only against the threat from beyond the reach of our fading sun, but the decay attacking us from within. And just as the Cardinal lays waste to the alien battlescapes, He shows us our inner foes so that we may smite them with all our righteous fury.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now is the time to stand against the Darkness,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;to stand with the Cardinal and His Brotherhood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now is the time for heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;The Brotherhood&amp;quot;, you will find everything you need to know about the most proud and powerful association in the fantastic world of Mutant Chronicles - The glorious Brotherhood.  You'll find descriptions of Inquisitors, Mystics, Mortificators, the Cardinal, the Archangels, the Sacred Warriors, the Fury Elite Guard, Retributor Carbines and Castigator spears, the Icarus jet-fighter, Artifacts, the First Cathedral, four new aspects of the Art with more than twenty new spells, seventeen new backgrounds, unique Brotherhood skills and special events, Heart of Symmetry: a complete adventure, plus much more...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
