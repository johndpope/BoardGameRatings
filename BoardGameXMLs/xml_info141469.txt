			<description>First expansion for the base game introducing 13 guards per player&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translated from the box:&lt;br/&gt;Your guards take on the opposing army of equally powerful guards in this Castle Garden expansion. Can you outsmart the enemy? Are you faster? Then you have chance to capture the opposing guards.&lt;br/&gt;in this game of attaque and seduction it's a matter of timing and insight.: be too greedy and you might loose your head, too careful and your enemy captures you instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nerves of steel might help you master this expansion of Castle Garden&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
