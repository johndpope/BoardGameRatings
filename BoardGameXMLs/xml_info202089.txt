			<description>A Pathfinder Roleplaying Game GM&amp;rsquo;s Resource supplement by Stephen Radney-MacFarland&lt;br/&gt;Most dwarven holds are vast and ordered halls filled with solemn and stoic craftsfolk. But that&amp;rsquo;s not Feigrvidr. Some say it&amp;rsquo;s not a dwarf hold at all, but rather a lawless mining camp ruled by dwarf thugs and ruthless agents of the ruling thane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Founded less than three years ago by Svingal Halfbeard, the ore coming from a vale carved out of the headlands of the Titan Peaks is of the greatest purity and the works coming forth from Feigrvidr&amp;rsquo;s forges are both subtle and ingenious, rivalling those of any ordered dwarven stronghold. The great wealth coming from the foot of the Titan Peaks was only the beginning, now with the discovery of ancient and abandoned giant halls deeper in the mountains&amp;rsquo; spires; adventurers are flocking to the camp, increasing its wealth and its danger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Village Backdrops are short, richly detailed supplements that each present a single village ready to insert into almost any home campaign. Perfect for use as a waystop on the road to adventure, as an adventure site themselves or as a PC&amp;rsquo;s home, Village Backdrop present the details so the busy GM can focus on crafting exciting, compelling adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For free samples head over to Raging Swan's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a Dual Format PDF. The downloadable ZIP file contains two versions, one optimised for printing and use on a normal computer and one optimised for use on a mobile device such as an iPad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
