			<description>Life is tough when you are a mad scientist trying to resurrect the dead.&lt;br/&gt;Body parts are hard to find, your hired help is unreliable, reanimating lifeless corpses makes your electricity bills skyrocket and those nosy police officers just keep showing up...!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neck-Back-Toe reimplements the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe as a solo card game. Every round, nine action cards are laid out in a grid. The player chooses one action at a time, but when three actions in one row on the grid have been taken, the round ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dig up the body parts you need, suture them together and give them life! Then sell your &amp;quot;creations&amp;quot; on the black market before the police catch on to your plans. Hurry! Your reputation at the Mad Scientist Seminar is at stake!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
