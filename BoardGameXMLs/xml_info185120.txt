			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swansong is a story roleplaying game about a rock band&amp;rsquo;s final tour. Not just any band. But a record-shattering supergroup. For decades the band changed its look, members, and stage show, but their hypnotic music gave meaning and voice to generations and their rallying fans never waivered. Now, age and tedium have reduced the band to a shell of its former self. Bickering, politics, and music industry woes threaten to stop the tour before it even starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
