			<description>Little Fox has caught a cold. Can you help to find him a cure? The bat has broken its wing. Do you know what to do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps &amp;quot;Nighty Night&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Little Fox Music Box&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Nighty Night Circus&amp;quot; comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies. In the animal doctor's office, located in a magical treehouse, the animals are waiting to be cured. Kids are playfully guided through applying treatments that they might have experienced themselves: measuring temperatures, taking medicine, getting a plaster. And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
