			<description>Source: Back Cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unflatten your cardboard Characters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike Fantasy genre roleplaying, Science Fiction games have studiously depended upon character backgrounds to give their heroes skills and professions. yet like their fantasy brethren, SF adventurers are usually nothing more than two-legged weapon platforms or under-utilized organic parts of 50 ton battle machines. Sure, they served with the space marines, picked up a few skills and a gigawatt microdoom blaster, but they're still a bunch of lifeless statistics -nothing bu flat lusterless characters no different from a hundred other ex-space marines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Central Casting is detailed, stand-alone system of tables, charts, and roleplaying guidelines for creating thoroughly individualized roleplay characters. By following simple, step-by-step instructions, both gamemasters and players can give life to player and non-player characters alike!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
