			<description>What is Zombie Rush? It's a cartoonish strategic and life treating choice card game by C&amp;amp;M Games. The Zombies are at it again, and they are very hungry for fresh human brains. The object of the game is to try not to be the main breakfast, lunch, or dinner, of course. Stay alive by avoiding a certain amount of Zombie cards. But you have to be on your toes and make quick decisions or it can cost you your brains. But don't panic, you've got your old faithful shotgun and handgun to help you out. It shouldn't be a big problem, or will it? Components of the game consist of 88 Cards and easy-to-play Rule sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
