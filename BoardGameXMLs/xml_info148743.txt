			<description>A &amp;quot;Maya the bee&amp;quot; themed memory and dexterity game for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme&lt;br/&gt;A thunderstorm is coming! Maya the bee and her friends are trying to bring home as much honey as possible before it gets too wet. Who'll manage to collect the most honey?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game&lt;br/&gt;Collect the most honey by remembering where the honey is and by skillfully throwing your token in the right places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;The 32 square meadow tiles (4 water lilies, 6 honey flowers, 22 dandelions) are shuffled and placed face down in the middle of the table. They form the meadow.&lt;br/&gt;The player tokens (Maya, Willie, Flip, Beatrix) are placed at the edge of the meadow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns throwing their player token on the meadow tiles. If your token lands on one or more meadow tiles, you place the tile face-up next to the meadow (if it is a water lily), place it face-up in front of you (dandelion) or place it face-up in front of you and get to look at two of the face-down meadow tiles and place them in a spot of your choice in the meadow (honey flower). If your token lands on another player's token, you have to give him/her one of the tiles you've collected.&lt;br/&gt;When a player turns over the fourth water lily, he/she finishes the turn, and then the game ends. The player with the most flower tiles wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
