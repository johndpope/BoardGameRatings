			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pair of deaths at an isolated facility in Mars' polar region has prompted an investigation into the safety and security of its inhabitants. Accidents happen, but MarsCo wants to be sure an accident was all this was. Your party is tasked with the difficult job of examining evidence, searching the facility, piecing together stories, and figuring out if the reports being sent back to MarsCo are the truth, or simply a cover for something significantly more sinister. If the latter is true, they can transform the operation into a criminal investigation. Of course, that would put in the same building with a potential murderer. Tread carefully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Echoes is a MarsCo contract for parties of any size, centered around themes of investigation, intrigue and horror. It is recommend for players who are familiar with the HSD universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This contract runs best if the Guide has read it, but the players have not! For player convienience, printing has been enabled on this title. However, the images in this .pdf have not been optimized for print, and will be a little fuzzy on paper. For sharp, crisp images and vibrant color on a printed page, purchase the print version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
