			<description>Players use their colored balls (either black or white) to capture colored balls of different values (yellow one point, blue two points, and red three points).  Although a player's main goal is to capture the colored balls, it is possible to capture your opponent's balls through scoring actions.  If a player finds themselves in a position where they cannot move their opponent may still continue to score until either the original player can move again or neither can move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three official alternate scoring methods:  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Junior - all one balls are one point.  &lt;br/&gt;    Senior - Points are tallied when a player captures the balls of another player.  &lt;br/&gt;    Indigestion - Yellow worth -1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
