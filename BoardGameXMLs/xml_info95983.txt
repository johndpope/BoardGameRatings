			<description>This is a trick-taking game for the Decktet. The game was first published in the Decktet Book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who leads a trick with a two-suited card picks one of the card's two suits, and other players must follow that suit. However, the second suit on a card might still be trump - so it's possible to follow non-trump suit and trump in at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bidding is in broad categories, with the possible bids being none of the tricks, some of the tricks, or most of the tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
