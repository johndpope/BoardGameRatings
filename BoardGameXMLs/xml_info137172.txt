							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hangsim</name>
									
			<description>With the wind in your hair, you can be at the controls of your hang-glider, microlite, paraglider or glider in different regions of the world. These have been studied in particular detail so that pilot training can be as true-to-life as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gliders behave and handle just like in real life. Each flight model has been studied and approved by many light aviation pilots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hangsim is the first light aviation simulator&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outside environment is astonishingly real with 3D clouds moving in the direction of the wind, and thermals allowing all types of flight (thermalling, ridge soaring...).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As for the simulator's artificial intelligence, it will make you shiver, generating countless intelligent gliders in the sky. Imagine the result by taking part in the competitions, placing yourself side-by-side with other virtual pilots willing to take any risks to win the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Hangsim, you can become initiated into unpowered flight through pleasure flights, challenges and competitions taken directly from international contests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Archived Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
