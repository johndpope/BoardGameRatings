			<description>Number of players: 1&amp;ndash;50&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game: The object of the game is to be the player who can stack the most Stonehenge disks in a single stack within 60 seconds, that won't fall over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: Have a level playing area with enough room to allow people to stack disks into a single pile. The box lid is recommended to be empty, flipped upside down, and set in the middle of the playing area to be used for stacking. The box lid enables disks to fall over and not roll away and get lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set aside all the disks into one large area off to the side, sorting them my color. You will also need to have a space for players to hold as many disks as they bid they can stack, and also the neutral figure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clear the stacking area (empty the lid and flip it upside down)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One person acts as timer for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player who stacks the amount of disks he bid in a single stack, with the neutral figure on top (before time runs out) that doesn't fall over before time runs out, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
