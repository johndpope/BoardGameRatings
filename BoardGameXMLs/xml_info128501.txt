			<description>In this game, players attempt to collect potatoes of different sizes and types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of cardboard potatoes are placed face-down on the table. The first player may now attempt to retrieve one or more potatoes using his index finger, following certain rules. After his turn ends, new potatoes are added to replace the ones he has taken away, and the next player takes his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until no potatoes are left. Then, each players collection of potatoes are scored. Points are given for the majority of each type of potatoe, as well as for the number of potatoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
