			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The makers of Trilogy now bring you an exciting NEW card game of skill, luck, strategy, and memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reveal 4 is a fast moving battle of memories in which individuals or teams match mind power to see who can be the first to &amp;quot;Reveal 4.&amp;quot; Watch out! Just when you think you are about to win,  your opponent can cunningly pull the rug out from under you. Rules are included for the basic game and advanced games.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published by Ellis and Frazier Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Reveal 4, two teams of partners are dealt four cards each. First the cards are dealt face up, and then are turned over for no one to see. Players then take turns drawing from the &amp;quot;Trade&amp;quot; pile, which allows them to turn over cards and trade them with other players' cards, as well as mix up theirs or someone else's hand, or trade with the draw pile. When a player thinks (s)he has a complete set of four cards, the player announces it and turns their cards over. If the cards are four of a kind, the player gets a new hand. Otherwise, they lose their next turn. The first team to successfully reveal two complete sets wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
