							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Martello</name>
									
			<description>Martello is played on a 6x6 grid board. 36 stones in 6 different colors and 6 different patterns are shuffled and placed on the board before the game begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played with 1, 2 or 3 players. While the basic rules are equal for any number of players, the playing area can be different and the winning condition is always different!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movements can be done vertically or horizontally, but a move without capturing another stone of the same color or pattern is not allowed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Differences between the 3 versions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 player game: played on the whole board, trying to capture all stones and ending up with only 1 single stone on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 player game: each player plays on 4 rows (meaning that 2 rows are for both players) and tries to clean his rows better than the opponent&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 player game: played on the whole board and trying to eliminate all stones of a secretly chosen color first&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
