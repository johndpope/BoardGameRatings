							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Global Domination</name>
									
			<description>Global Domination is a 1993 strategy computer game modeled closely on the popular board game, Risk. Impressions Games expanded on the game dividing the world into more territories, adding unit types which could be controlled in a mini-game, adding the concept of unit obsolescence, valuing regions higher or lower than others (for income), and adding the ability to fund intelligence operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like Risk, Global Domination is a turn-based game. Each game starts with the players being allocated a few random territories across the globe. The player would then be allocated a certain number of points to invest in purchasing units, researching technology or spending in intelligence operations. Players could then use their units to claim neutral or &amp;quot;brown&amp;quot; territories or invade other player territories. Players would often have to be careful not to spread their forces to thin lest they risk territories revolting (or turning into &amp;quot;purple territories&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player attacks or defends a territory, he/she can choose to either auto-resolve battles or micro-manage it. Micro-managing the battle results in a mini-game that simulates the battlefield where combat takes place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players could choose to challenge other humans or a selection of AI mostly based on famous world leaders. Each AI player had a different strategy and their competency and aggressiveness varied. Some of the AI players featured in the game include historical figures such as General Custer, Napoleon Bonaparte and Queen Victoria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Global Domination (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
