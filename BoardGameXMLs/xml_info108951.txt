							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hunger of the Iron Mage  (Fantasy Craft)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something lurks in the shadows beneath the mountain. Something hungry. A twisted secret from a lost dwarven hall creeps up from the depths, and a party of stalwart heroes must brave the dangers of the Jagged Reaches to put an end to its machinations. Will you take up the mantle of hero and face off against the horrors that dwell in the mountain's shadow, or will you fall victim to... the hunger of the Iron Mage?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunger of the Iron Mage is designed for a party of four to six characters of any experience level, and serves as a continuation of the Old School Fantasy series, a nice one-off, or a side trek to drop into your ongoing fantasy campaign. It is an adventure filled with danger, adventure, an insane wizard, secret tunnels, and more troglodytes than you can shake a stick at. Remember those days when sometimes you just wanted to let your hair down, grab some dice, and have an excuse to kill things? Good. This one's for you. Remember, Reality Blurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
