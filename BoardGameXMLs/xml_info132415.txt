							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dodge the Dragon Card Game</name>
									
			<description>A card game for children. 49 cards are shuffled and dealt face down. Players sort their cards and place any pairs face down on the table. If a player has three cards that are the same, he keeps one card in his hand and places the pair face down on the table. If a player has four matching cards (2 pairs) he can put all four down on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player to the left of the dealer goes first. He makes a fan out of his cards and holds them, face down, to the player on his left. That player chooses one card from the fan without seeing it. If the card makes a pair with a card he has in his hand, he can put the new pair face down on the table. If not, he keeps the card. Now he fans out his cards for the player sitting to his left. Play continues in a circle, with players choosing cards and putting down pairs. Once a player has played all of his cards, he is safe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to discard all of your cards and not get left holding the dragon. The game is over when everyone has played all of their cards. The player left holding the dragon loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
