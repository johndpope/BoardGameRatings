			<description>Radfahrerspiel is a cycling bases race game produced in East Germany in 1955. It has simple roll &amp;amp; moves mechanics and the goal is to reach the finish first by completing a track as soon as possible. On that track the players also have to pass a railway crossover. Three cars have to be moved, too, and can be used to block other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
