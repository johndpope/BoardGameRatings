							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blackwolf Manor</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blackwolf Manor lies on the narrow run of land between the river and the city walls. This stretch of prime waterfront real estate is home to a mix of high-class shops, storehouses, and the occasional residence. The 'manor' was built by Nickolai Blackwolf a century ago - before the nearby port grew into a bustling city. While the estate has been sold off piecemeal over the years, the old house is still called a manor and is home to last of the Blackwolf family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue presents a detailed map of an urban two-story house, its outbuildings, and courtyard. To facilitate use with miniatures, the map has a 1 inch grid built into the artwork. Descriptions are given for the house and its inhabitants - ready for customization to your story and system of choice. With ample guest rooms and an attached stable, the house would serve as an excellent home for a group of adventurers. There is easy access to the city and a private dock out back. Part of the storehouse has even been converted into barracks for up to ten followers of any sort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An overview of the location and its occupants.&lt;br/&gt;     Full color, miniature-scale map broken into 9 pages for easy printing.&lt;br/&gt;     Black and white versions of the map pages.&lt;br/&gt;     A 24x36 inch poster image at 1 inch = 5 feet scale.&lt;br/&gt;     A version of the poster map with no text or spoilers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a home between adventures, or the location of the adventure itself, Blackwolf Manor can help bring your game to life. When its time to play, Zero Hour cartography is ready!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
