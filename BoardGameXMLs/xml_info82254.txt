							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Adventurer&#039;s Handbook: A Guide to Role-Playing Games</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Return with us now to those thrilling days of Tolkien, Moorcock - even King Arthur's Britain. Now you can do more than read these (and other) charming fantasies. YOU can be a King - or a Princess - or a Dragon if you like. With this creative new book you can explore, conquer, and perhaps even amass a fortune.&lt;br/&gt; The Adventurer's Handbook takes you to the world of fantasy - a world of role-playing games in which the players create and control characters who live their imaginary lives in a specially made game land. You can base your games in such well-known fantasies as Tolkien's Middle Earth, Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea, or Moorcock's Young Kingdoms. Or if originality is your forte, you can create your own unique world of wonder and clone a hero of your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;this book contains a core set of rules, very similar, but simpler, to Chaosium's Basic Role-Playing system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
