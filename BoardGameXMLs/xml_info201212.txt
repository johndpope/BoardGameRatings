							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vampire: The Eternal Struggle â€“ Keepers of Tradition</name>
									
			<description>Keepers of Tradition is an expansion set for Vampire: The Eternal Struggle, published by White Wolf in 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keepers of Tradition focuses on the Camarilla, and the set's four preconstructed starter decks feature the Brujah, Malkavian, Toreador and Ventrue clans. Two of the other Camarilla-affiliated clans (Nosferatu and Tremere) would each later share a starter deck with a different bloodline in the Heirs of the Blood expansion set. While the Gangrel were no longer in the Camarilla at this point in the Vampire: The Masquerade metaplot, they were still included in this set, although not to the same extent as the other six clans; additionally, they would not receive another starter deck of their own before V:TES was cancelled (their previous and only starter deck was for the Anarchs set).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
