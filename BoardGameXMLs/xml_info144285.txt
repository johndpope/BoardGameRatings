			<description>A Card-Driven Action Strategy Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planet Antaeras was a thriving world, full of majestic beauty and alive with a natural flow of magic that extended to all its inhabitants. This magic was its most precious commodity&amp;hellip;but would also prove to be its downfall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ages-long civil war between the Brotherhood of Steam and the Reptilisaur Empire has now become a three-way battle with the appearance of the Corrupted Legion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARCANITE WARS is a strategy card game for two players where you must harvest resources, construct a base, train units, explore the terrain around you, and battle the enemy army. The player who destroys his opponent's Headquarters is victorious!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are familiar with the concepts behind the Real-Time Strategy game genre (think Command and Conquer, StarCraft, Age of Empires, etc), then you will easily pick up the flow of this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Core Set comes complete with a set of Terrain cards and three races:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; The Brotherhood of Steam&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; The Reptilisaur Empire&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; The Corrupted Legion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of these races uses two decks: its Race deck (Units, buildings, and Workers) and Event deck (consisting of special abilities and ways to add to Units' strength on the battlefield). Each race has different strengths and plays differently from the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything you need to play is included - just grab another player and let the battle begin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
