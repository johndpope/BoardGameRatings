			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Andre Ching, a young Barizian noble, defied his family and escaped to Cor, where he served in the military, showing his worth in the war with Horde. After two years of service Andre was assigned to an elite squad of scouts, where he regularly delivered reports on monster activity. He was reckless and daring, and enjoyed taking risks, but a month ago the army lost contact with him and declared him Missing In Action. However, Stuart Ching, Andre&amp;rsquo;s father, after receiving this information about his son, has decided to learn what actually happened in Cor&amp;rsquo;s jungles. The solution to this riddle will be far more complex than it seems and will lead the heroes to all the planets of the Eclipse system, pitting them against a vile cultist plot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Web of Intrigue is a short campaing for Nemezis, consisting of 4 Savage Tales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
