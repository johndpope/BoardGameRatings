			<description>From the description on the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Flying Knee Drop, the Sleeper or even the Scorpion Death Lock, use any of these favourite holds from genuine WCW Wrestlers to out fight you opponent in this exciting board game.&lt;br/&gt;Watch the tension mount as you count down with the referee and try to recover from a Pindown, Submission or Knockout!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use your team partner to tag an manoeuvre your opponent.  However you play, you'll need all your wits plus a little luck to win some belts and ultimately the WCW Championship Cup.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls two wrestlers, one in and one outside the ring.  Play Action Cards to manoeuvre around the ring, once your wrestlers are on the same square in the ring, you must challenge each other to a Pindown, Submission or Knockout.  Whoever plays the highest Action Card wins the challenge! If it's a knockout, the loser gets 10 die rolls to get a six else he's counted out!  If it's a pindown or a submission, the loser gets just three rolls to score a six.  If you have to take two pindown/submission cards, you lose the bout!  The winner takes a Championship Belt card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to three Championship Belts wins the Ultimate Championship cup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes several variants for making the game longer, including rules for tagging, double teaming and for a 4 player, 8 wrestler super size match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bizarrely, the game only has rules for two OR four player (NOT three).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
