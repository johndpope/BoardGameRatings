			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the ultimate race to build a bunny society on planet Earth, Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey pits players against each other as they struggle to gain Civilization Points, by building cities and increasing their bunny populations. Players gain points by developing their own civilizations or by using zany weapons and hilarious scenarios to destroy their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Green deck has a Crops-based theme which also includes fruits, vegetables and marvelous cards such as Transplanted Troop which allows players to steal bunnies and Reversal Of Order which helps dictate the order of card play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
