			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seas are still running high from last night's storm.  The troops have started loading into the landing crafts, anxious to get to land or anywhere away from the rolling Mediterranean.  The High Command has assured you that with the force under your command it will be impossible for the Axis forces to stop you from taking control of Sicily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have been given command of the defense of Sicily.  Report have been coming in every 20 to 30 minutes of another Allied landing.  The High Command has promised you that in the event of an Allied landing you will be given sufficient reinforcements to destroy them on the beaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components include one rule booklet, one 19&amp;quot; x 25&amp;quot; map board, four counter sheets, playing charts, one six-sided die, and two plastic bags.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
