							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">D-Percent - 100 Modern Zombies</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D-Percent - 100 Modern Zombies puts a horde in your hands! The dead walk and hunger for the living, and your players hunger for some description! Presented within are one hundred formerly living humans given some physical description, clothing, items of interest, and visible injury, if any. Some will have weapons imbedded in the their flesh or other signs of previous encounters with mankind. Others carry packs or other supplies that may be of use. Keep your shambling masses entertaining and varied with this two-page list.&lt;br/&gt;Warning: This product gives brief but often graphic description of humans slain by the violence of a zombie uprising. Part of the intense horror of a zombie infestation is it equally affects the young, the old, the rich, the poor, the black, the white, and so on. The devastation crosses all of mankind's boundaries, and this product tries to represent that. This is a game product; if there is some portion you dislike, change it for the type of game you wish to run. There are no pictures of death or gore, but please use discretion when determining if this product is appropriate for you or your audience. The Black Falcon Games D-Percent line has a number of other random generators that can enhance your game but do not contain this level of violence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your players zigged when you expect a zag. They asked you a question you didn't anticipate. You want to add details and avoid being repetitive. You need a ready supply of random generators! Welcome to D-Percent, Black Falcon Games' line of ready-to-use lists of themed items. Simply roll d%, consult the chart, and you have a handy detail right on hand!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is not specific to any particular game system, instead taking a neutral generic stance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
