			<description>Roll the die, and it'll show one of 6 colors.  Pick a piece of that color, and fit it into your 5x5 rack.  If there are no pieces left of the color rolled, then steal one of that color from someone else's rack!  When someone gets a full rack, the round ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the 6 colors contain 7 pieces: 3 odd-shaped 5-square pieces (with 3 symbols), 1 3-square 'corner' (with 2 symbols), 1 2-square (with 1 symbol), and 2 1-squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring is achieved by matching the symbols either beside each other, or at angles, for 1 point per unique pair.  If you can't fit a piece in your rack, you get -1 per piece.  If you achieved the full rack, and called PUZZLE PERFECTION to end the round, then you get 5 extra points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played for several rounds, as agreed upon before the game started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
