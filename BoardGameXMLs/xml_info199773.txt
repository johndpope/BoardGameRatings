			<description>Cats &amp;amp; Caverns is a cooperative game for 2-6 players where you play the role of a house cat&amp;ndash;ahem&amp;ndash;feline hero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your team are working to rid the realm&amp;ndash;your home&amp;ndash;of a Big Cheese, along with his villainous rats, that has taken up residence in a nearby network of caverns under the house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traps have been laid and henchmen lie in wait for you. Defeat them for treasure&amp;ndash;things around the house, really&amp;ndash;and continue to until you find and defeat the Big Cheese!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While adventuring in the caverns:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A lineup is created based on the number of players&lt;br/&gt;     Villains and traps are ordered by speed.&lt;br/&gt;     Heroes each roll a D20, adding their speed bonuses, and join the battle lineup in order.  Heroes can, at the start of battle, choose to be later in the lineup for strategic purposes.&lt;br/&gt;     Once ordered, heroes will take their turns, attacking or disarming traps as desired.  &lt;br/&gt;     When each cavern is cleared, they will then roll on potential loot based on the Cavern Card and the battle mode (cat or beast) chosen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
