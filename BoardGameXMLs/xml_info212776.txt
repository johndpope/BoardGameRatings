			<description>A Game of Sorcerous Sex&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oppressive heat and soft, sticky flesh. Red wine like mana. The day kept us inside but the night ate the sun and soon the locusts were buzzing. The stars stuck in place. Everything bathed in blue and yellow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We took our shoes off and stepped onto the yard off the deck, dirt and grass stuck to my tights. We spun over the ground half-naked like the earth spun through orbit, and when we were done, you bit my neck like a vampire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spectral poison running down my neck. It changed me. It dripped over me. And then it became me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
