			<description>Micropolis is a family city-building game with a modular board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, roll two 10-sided dice, then select actions to perform using the numbers you rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Acquire Property &amp;mdash; Place a roof token on a city block bearing the rolled number. (Once you have two roof tokens on a city block, no one else can build on it any longer.) You can use 0 as a wild to place on any number, and doubles grant you a free bonus action of placing a single roof on any city block where you already have a roof.&lt;br/&gt;     Construct Buildings &amp;mdash; Remove roof tokens from the footprint of the building specified on the contract card (you must have sole or shared control of each city block in question), and then place the appropriate building pieces as depicted on the contract card. Bonuses and penalties specified on the card for positioning relative to other features apply.&lt;br/&gt;     Build Monorail Line &amp;mdash; Start the monorail line between city blocks, or extend the existing line, if it has already been started.&lt;br/&gt;     Acquire a City Tile from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;     Place a City Tile adjacent to existing tiles.&lt;br/&gt;     Reroll&lt;br/&gt;     Exchange Contract Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once both Contract decks are depleted, the endgame is triggered, giving each player one more turn. The player who has accumulated the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
