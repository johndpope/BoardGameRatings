			<description>Bombers Attack!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map is of two opposing forces with a &amp;quot;Neutral Zone&amp;quot; in between.  The units include bombers, fighters and artillery (including a long range artillery).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to score Seven hits on the enemy city.  Battles can occur between fighters, and bombers as well as air to ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems to be one in a series that includes Stukas Greifen an and Flieger Greifen an.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the Biplanes it appears to be a product of the 1930s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
