							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shopping Madness</name>
									
			<description>This British Gibson party game consists of 12 cards each listing 12 items to be purchased, with a price and another item to be purchased next. The cards are placed in various locations around the house or garden, and each player is given a shopping card that begins with a first item to be found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players move from one list card to another in search of the right items, noting the price of each. The first player to correctly fill a shopping card wins. Prices are used to check accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game is undated, it was probably issued in 1971 or shortly thereafter, since prices are listed in decimal pounds and pence, including the half penny. The game would have been a fun way to get used to the new decimal system, launched in 1971, and certainly preceded the elimination of the half-penny in 1984.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
