			<description>AGES is a deckbuilding card game with a historical theme. In this game, each player will travel to historical events and exotic locations while seeking the help of the historical Elite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever visited a museum? Did you see displays filled with prints of paintings, replicas of rare artifacts, and animatronic presidents? Did you ever wish you could see the real thing?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to AGES, a Deckbuilding card game designed for 2 to 4 players, ages 14+. The average game will last 30-60 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In AGES, each player will travel back in time to collect artifacts, historical figures, locations, and check out famous events throughout the history of mankind. Whoever assembles the greatest historical collection will be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wage a war of the ages as you travel through time recruiting history's most influential people. Which path will you choose? Will you take solace in Art? Will you go the path of the righteous and seek out the Good? Or will you go the path of the conqueror and seek out Evil? Perhaps the knowledge contained within Science? The choice is yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the way, players will need to pick up various Icons to activate the cards they purchase. To do this, players need to remember that AGES isn't just the name of the game, it's also an acronym: Art, Good, Evil, and Science&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So get ready to talk strategy with Napoleon, visit the California Gold Rush, and hold the Dead Sea Scrolls in your hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until a face-up supply of cards representing key historical individuals has been exhausted with victory going to the player with the highest point total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
