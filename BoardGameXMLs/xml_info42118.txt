			<description>Battle of the Gods is a game of conflict for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.  Each player plays the role of a god, trying to amass the strongest following.  You do this by building clans of contiguous followers around the outer ring of Stonehenge.  The larger the clan, the better its score ((s - 1)&amp;sup2; for s, clan size, up to 6).  Additionally, you may place an incarnation of your divine self as part of a clan in order to protect that clan from attack.  On your turn, you simply place yourself or a follower, or eliminate an opponent's follower - or discard any number of cards.  In any event, you replenish your hand at the end of the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends one round after either the deck is exhausted, the outer ring is full, or a player plays her last follower.  Each player scores 1 point for each follower (and deity) she has on the board, plus the scores for her clans.  Highest score wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
