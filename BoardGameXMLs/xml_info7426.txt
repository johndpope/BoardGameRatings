			<description>Here's all the excitement of an afternoon at the old ball park -- The difference is you play the game. You figure your plays -- your strategy. The game gives you the results. Home runs -- grounder to second -- foul -- strike. It's all here in Computer Baseball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electronic Data Controls Corporation released a series of electronic board games under their &amp;quot;Computer Games&amp;quot; line, primarily consisting of two-player sports games. The games all used large wooden game boards depicting the playing field and a  game matrix of various results. Each end of the game board had a set of buttons (i.e. offense and defense) that, depending on the combination pressed, would cause a light to illuminate next to one of the rows on the game matrix. The players would then consult the appropriate column to find out what happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
