			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Follow the greats like Colonel Fawcett into the dense jungles of the tropics. This verdant biome offers a selection of herbs not seen anywhere else in the world, well, except for ubiquitine, and the recipes the natives have developed for these plants are as odd, if not odder, than the base plants themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first expansion for The Herbalist Base Class, Welcome to the Jungle includes 16 herbs in the new &amp;quot;tropics&amp;quot;, updates to classic recipes, and a set of 6 new recipes that combine the herbs of the tropics with the herbs of the rest of the world for ridiculous and fun effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are the requisite biome summary and biome list tables for daily &amp;quot;spell&amp;quot; generation and recordkeeping, as well as all herb point values for those who like making custom biomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a special bonus, a small selection of 4 herbs that didn't make the final cut, but are still plenty of fun, are included to ease the creation of custom biomes with biome-unaffiliated Interjection Games content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Create blistering welts that reduce maximum Dexterity bonus with poison ivy's bas ass grandma, black poison wood! Dissolve your enemies entirely with manmelter vine! Bring on the DoTs with candlelit lichen, a recipe combination of acidbite lichen and the new emperor's candlesticks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
