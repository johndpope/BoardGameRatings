			<description>&amp;quot;It's magnetic! Hilarious! Fast and furious fun!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A two player children's TV tie-in game produced by Berwick in the UK in 1970s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game consists of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- thin raised cardboard board with 4 small pegs in the centre to secure a cardboard chimney piece&lt;br/&gt;- 2 thin cardboard walls, one of them with a chimney attached; the walls have slots in them to denote doors. The chimney has a small slot on one side to denote a mouse hole. &lt;br/&gt;- 2 plastic pegs to secure the walls&lt;br/&gt;- 1 plastic &amp;quot;cap&amp;quot; to the chimney&lt;br/&gt;- 3 plastic doors&lt;br/&gt;- 2 plastic and cardboard sections that move - a fridge and a bookcase&lt;br/&gt;- a cardboard kennel&lt;br/&gt;- a cardboard shelf&lt;br/&gt;- 5 cardboard Jerry &amp;quot;life&amp;quot; cards&lt;br/&gt;- 2 plastic cheese pieces&lt;br/&gt;- 1 plastic sausage piece&lt;br/&gt;- 1 plastic dog bowl&lt;br/&gt;- two plastic rods with magnets attached, the larger one used to control Tom, the smaller to control Jerry&lt;br/&gt;- two plastic and card magnetic playing pieces, one for Tom and one for Jerry&lt;br/&gt;- assembly instructions and rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a rod with a magnet on end of it. The rods are slid under the raised game board and used to control the playing pieces. The rod controlling the Tom playing piece attracts the Jerry playing piece as well as the Tom playing piece.&lt;br/&gt; The object of the game is for the player controlling Jerry to get three items of food into the mouse hole whilst avoiding capture by the player controlling Tom. To achieve this they have 5 lives, represented by 5 cards. If the player controlling Jerry places three items of food into the mouse hole before they lose the 5 live cards, they win. If not, then the player controlling Tom wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A variant of Balyna Magnetic Super Soccer, for smaller children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components were made of thin cardboard and plastic, and were therefore easily ripped/bent/broken. That, combined with the frantic nature of the game, means that complete copies in good condition are extremely hard to find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
