							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Royal Cup: Icebreaker</name>
									
			<description>There are two versions of this game:&lt;br/&gt;Royal Cup Icebreaker (the regular version) &amp;amp; Royal Cup Firemaker (the adult, NSFW version)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a strategic game designed to help shy, reserved and otherwise introverted people break the metaphorical ice, come out of their shells, get out of their comfort zones and let loose. It is similar to King's Cup but IT ISN'T King's Cup (we cannot stress this enough).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game works like this: players take turns picking cards and responding to the actions on the cards, you could pick cards like Licktator, Royal Interrogator, Queen of Hearts, Secrets and many more. The objective of the game is to play your friends, making them share as much as humanly possible about their deepest darkest secrets. Players continue picking cards and fulfilling its actions until either the chain of cards is broken--which results in that player being kicked out of the game--or a Licktator takes a player out, immediately ending their Licktatorship. The last player remaining in the game, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a lot of fun, has a lot of elements from traditional games such as spin the bottle, never have I ever, truth or dare and other games, and it has a lot of hilarious rules such as No Cursing, Hodor!, CPR, Eunuch, Premature Pants/Long Live the King and many more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is available in four languages (English, German, Spanish and Persian).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
