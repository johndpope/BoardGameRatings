			<description>For setup each player gets a big red pair of plastic glasses on which different parts of masks can be attached: one part for the hat (or top of the head), one for the nose, two for the ears, and one for the eyes (some of the later also hinder sight).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player take turns to roll a six sided custom die with faces, which determine, which part can be added to a face. Then everybody tries to first hit the correct &amp;quot;button&amp;quot; tile in front of the players, to be allowed to place such a part onto another player. Additionally there is a &amp;quot;wild&amp;quot; die face, which allows to place any part and a &amp;quot;bad luck&amp;quot; one, were another player may put a part onto the player, who rolled the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever is first full attached with all pieces looses the game and a photography can be taken from him or her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
