							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Kingslayers</name>
									
			<description>From the rear cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trap was sprung with great effect: an assassin lay dead in the King's bedchamber, both daggers still in hand. The King's mages quickly determined that the assassin was nothing more than an unfortunate fool - one of many - who succumbed to the will of the Kingslayers; twin daggers possessed of great power and a single minded desire to spread chaos through the death of all who would rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mages could find no means of destroying the Kingslayers, and those who tried risked becoming enslaved by their fierce will. The King's most trusted advisor, Filiaren, reasoned that t if they could not be destroyed, then they must be hidden. He knew of a place, far from civilization and unmarked on any map, where the residents had no sense of leadership amongst themselves. Here it was hoped that the daggers could be guarded by those who would be swayed by the daggers' call.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For forty years, the daggers remained hidden and the world knew relative calm. Filiaren has not heard from the guardians for far too long, and his fears were confirmed when he went to investigate. The daggers are missing, and it is only a matter of time befor they continue their campaign against order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armed with new information suggesting that the daggers can be destroyed, Filiaren has turned to the Acaeum Adventurer's Guild to undertake a most dangerous mission: find and retrieve the Kingslayers, and carry them across the planes to the CHaos Forge to be unmade. Does this band of adventurers still have what it takes to survive a challenge of this magnitude? Will they rid the world at last of the threat of the Kingslayers, or will they succumb to the will of the daggers, becoming just another set of pawns in their murderous game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
