			<description>From the Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tokyo. The turn of the millennium. The glittering skyline, which once rivaled any in the world, lies cracked and crumbling under the weight of an oppressive evil. One man, the tyrannical Levih Rah, has created a Demon City in Shinjuku, the heart of Tokyo. That's just the beginning. Rah's mission is to destroy the world by opening a gate to the Demon Void, which will turn Earth into a living Hell. In three days, the world as we know it will be no longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hope. For years, no one had dared to enter the city infested by Rah's evil minions - until now. Desperate to save the life of her captured father, the beautiful Sayaka Rama ventures into Shinjuku with the aid of Kyoya Izayoi, a Tokyo teenager skilled in the mysterious martial art of Nenpo. With assistance from a cynical and aged mystic, a streetwise youth, and an enigmatic spiritual healer, Kyoya and Sayaka might actually have a chance to defeat the dark sorcerer, Rah...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This role-playing game is based on the popular feature-length 1988 Japanese animated action-adventure horror film, from the original work of Hideyuki Kikuchi. You can now join the fight against the dark powers of Levih Rah, or be a part of the demon hordes that terrorize Shinjuku. The game features the intuitive and easy-to-learn Tri-Stat System game mechanics, which is fully compatible with Guardians of Order's other anime role-playing games. Additionally, the book offers extensive resources and references and for Demon City Shinjuku fans (including an extensive movie summary and detailed character bios), and a full-color gallery of spectacular animation art. The ideal role-playing game for fans of Japanese anime, or occult-gothic horror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
