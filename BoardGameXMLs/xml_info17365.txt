							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Black Belt: The Karate Game</name>
									
			<description>From the instruction manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Become a master of the ancient Martial Art of Karate. Use wit, skill, and luck to battle your opponents as you progress from white-belted novice to Black Belt of the eighth degree!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is actually played with the use of cards depicting different karate maneuvers (attack and defense) and generic kung-fu weapons (like sai and nuchukus). Players turn cards over, and a rock-paper-scissors effect determines the winner. The players advance around the board, challenging each other and winning belts until they can advance to the Master Sparring Circle, where they must defeat two opponents at the same time to become the true Black Belt Champion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the black-and-white cards that feature only the names of the moves they represent, to the 4-color gameboard covered in Yin-Yang symbols, to the box cover featuring two Karate Black Belt Masters fighting in silhouette against the backdrop of a setting sun, this apparently self-published item (Jim Co.?) is really not much fun as a game, but worth a few chuckles as a curiosity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
