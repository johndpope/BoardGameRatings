							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MatchUp Cards</name>
									
			<description>Matchup Cards is a card game made up of 26 pairs of matched cards plus one odd card. Decks of cards have different themes and the matched cards feature pictures that fit the theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt eight cards each. The remaining cards are placed face down to form a stock and players take turns drawing a card from the stock. If a player forms a matched pair of cards, the pair is displayed face up in front of the player. When the stock is exhausted, players continue to play by drawing a card from the next player in the sequence of play. When a player runs out of cards, that player drops out of play. In the end, one player is left with the odd card - this player loses regardless of how many pairs he or she has formed. Of the other players, the player with the most pairs wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight pairs of matched cards are also designated as Command Cards. After a player forms a pair of of such cards, they can use the pair once (instead of drawing a card) to execute a special action. There are four different Command Cards:&lt;br/&gt;1) Reverse - these reverse the direction of play&lt;br/&gt;2) Take Two - the player can designate any player (including himself or herself) to select another player from which to draw two cards&lt;br/&gt;3) Give One - the player can designate any player (including himself or herself) to give a card to another player of their choice&lt;br/&gt;4) Miss Turn - the player can designate any player (including himself or herself) to miss their turn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must use up their Command Cards before they run out of cards. If they still have unused Command Cards when they run out of cards in hand, they receive one card from every other player for every unused Command Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some themes that have been used for MatchUp Cards:&lt;br/&gt;Australian MatchUps&lt;br/&gt;Guo Nian MatchUps (Chinese New Year MatchUps)&lt;br/&gt;Asian Civilisations - Our Cultures Within&lt;br/&gt;World War II - Remembering Bukit Chandu &amp;amp; Old Ford Factory&lt;br/&gt;Halloween MatchUps&lt;br/&gt;The Peranakans - Vignettes of a Proud Culture&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
