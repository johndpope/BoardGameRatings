			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Multiverse Adventures system is designed to be complete and capable of simulating any setting. The same versatile rules are used to create all the elements of the setting, whether they be humans, elves, monsters, robots, vehicles, or equipment. The design system is simple and the powers and abilities that can be assigned to each element are almost infinitely customisable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules use a simple ranking system for every element of the game. There are no separate systems of rules for characters, monsters, magic, vehicles, superpowers etc. They can all be modelled using the same simple but flexible system. It's easy to use, easy to remember, but incredibly versatile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with lots of examples of characters, monsters, vehicles and equipment to show how the system can be used to simulate the elements of almost any setting. This means you can set a game in your favourite sci-fi universe, a fantasy setting you designed yourself, or any other setting you can think of. So get a copy and use the system to make your favourite manga universe, novel setting or movie background into a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
