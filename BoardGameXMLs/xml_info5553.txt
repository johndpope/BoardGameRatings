			<description>Subtitled &amp;quot;The Othello Card Game&amp;quot;, Parity consists of a deck of 51 cards, each containing a 2x3 grid of black and white Othello pieces, plus a Centerpiece Card containing the familiar starting pattern of two black and two white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in rounds, in which each player plays one card on the table adjacent to the Centerpiece Card or previously played cards.  Whoever played the card that &amp;quot;captured&amp;quot; the most pieces of one color in that round (using the normal Othello capturing rules) picks up all the cards from that round and puts them in his score pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all the cards have been played, the winner is the player who has scored the most cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
