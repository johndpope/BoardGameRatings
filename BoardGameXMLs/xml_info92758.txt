			<description>M.A.X.: Mechanized Assault &amp;amp; Exploration is a turn-based strategy game released for DOS in 1996. The objective of the game is to colonize various alien planets by building eco-spheres for your colonists to live in and defending them against enemies. In 2008 the game was released on Good Old Games in a bundle with the game's sequel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Concord, an alliance of aliens called the Star Lords, have drafted humankind to fight their wars of planetary control for them. When a dispute over a planet between two or more Star Lords arises, the conflict is settled by mechanized forces and the victor's colonists can live on that world. The player assumes the role of a M.A.X. Commander, a human brain in a robotic shell designed to command robotic fighting units to take control of a planet and its resources. There are eight human clans that the player can choose to command, each with a specific in-game advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game offers a large campaign, 24 single missions, and 4 planets with 6 locations each for custom battles:&lt;br/&gt;Single-player Game:&lt;br/&gt;- Training missions.&lt;br/&gt;- Single missions.&lt;br/&gt;- Custom game with up to 3 AI antagonists.&lt;br/&gt;- Custom scenario.&lt;br/&gt;- Campaign game.&lt;br/&gt;Multi-player Game:&lt;br/&gt;- Host network game.&lt;br/&gt;- Join network game.&lt;br/&gt;- Modem game.&lt;br/&gt;- Serial game.&lt;br/&gt;- Hot seat.&lt;br/&gt;- Hot seat scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mechanized Assault &amp;amp; Exploration,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
