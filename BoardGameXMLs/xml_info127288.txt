			<description>The biggest challange to making these games has always been, How to keep it fresh and new. After making the 8th game in the adventure series, My Heroes wanted very much to keep the mercanaries. The quests got to big for the original board. So we created a bigger board. My first Son wanted more fighting, my second Son wanted more treasure, and I wanted more furniture. Add to this all the monsters, cards, tiles and rules from all the expansions and we created the Masters' Series. This is a very exciting adventure that we're sure your going to love. It will require a bit of work on your part to create the board and tiles. You will need to buy quite a few extra monsters and furniture for the game. But all of this is provided for you in the making a Masters' Series game booklet. &lt;br/&gt;The pages for this adventure are available to download at &amp;quot;Dragonkingdoms.co.uk&amp;quot; and yahoo's group site &amp;quot;HeroQuest- hero quest&amp;quot; for free. You do need to join the group to access the file's section where they are stored. The photo section of this site will allow you to read the story and look at the maps to see if this game is something you would like to play. Your adventure awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
