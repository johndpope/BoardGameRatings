			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why are ability checks only ability checks, while untrained skill checks are skill checks? Why can't your massive fighter learn to be good at breaking down doors, and therefore get more than his Strength bonus to the attempt?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Skill for Everything presents mechanics that allow ability checks, saving throws and attack rolls to have nearly the same degree of flexibility and customization as skill checks. While this is a significant addition to the most popular OGL game system, the design is modular - allowing you to adopt either the new ability check / saving throw mechanics, the attack roll mechanics, or both - and can be applied to existing characters and campaigns with minimal fuss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
