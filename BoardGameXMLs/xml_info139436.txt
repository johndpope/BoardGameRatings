							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rival Corporations: D.E.A.T.H. PLC</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Rival Corporations: D.E.A.T.H. PLC is the first of the books covering the eight rival corporations to the F.E.A.R. Corporation. Each of these fan supplements will have details of the public and shadow project along with stats on NPCs, any extra rules and options, and so forth to help the Storyteller and players use them more effectively in a campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please remember that these rival corporations are not real, so trying to hunt down their offices to enlist to help them take over the world will not work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEATH PLC is all about discovery and life. They are dedicated to the reforestation of the earth and the environment, though making money in the process never hurts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rival Corporation supplements focus on the key personnel of the corporation, as well their projects, areas of work and even their shadow projects. Included are some plot hooks and game mechanics to help put it all together in your own campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
