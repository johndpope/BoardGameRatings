			<description>Get ready for laughing afternoons where your family and friends will take on the most ridiculous identities and try to describe, interpret or draw them so that others can guess.&lt;br/&gt;Players form groups. A player starts by choosing an easy or difficult card. He then draws a card from each different deck available, A, B and C showing it only to his teammate. Those cards have different identities in order 1, 2 and 3. The other team, without knowing and seeing the cards has to choose 3 numbers between 1 and 3, which will be the sequence of the identities that the previous team must try to describe.   &lt;br/&gt;You then have to describe those identities to your teammate. If he correctly guess an easy identity he scores 1 points, and if he guess a difficult one he will score 3 points.   &lt;br/&gt;The team who scores more points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
