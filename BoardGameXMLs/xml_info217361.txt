							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Colonial Gothic Rulebook: Third Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Drums of War Sound&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The great nations of Europe struggle for control of the New World. Native Americans struggle for their land and their lives. Planters and traders struggle for wealth and position. A new nation struggles to be born.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But look beneath the surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsters stalk the woods. Angry ghosts and spiteful witches plague the villagers. Explorers search for lost cities and fabled treasures. Ancient evils are awakened. There is a secret history, and this history deals with events that took place in the shadows. These events played a role in the history of the American colonies and the Revolution that few know about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The truth is hidden, and plots are afoot. Events are moving behind the scenes, and lurking in the shadows are agents with their own agenda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All have read about the founding of America. This history shows what led to the American Revolution and the cry for independence. The history is clear, and there is no real dispute over these events. You know the history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or do you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a secret history that deals with events taking place in the shadows. These events played a role in the history of the American colonies and the Revolution few know about. From the crowded streets of New York City, to the deep country trails of Georgia, the shadows teem with enemies of conflicting agendas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War is coming. The Siege of Boston is lifted, and General Washington is leading the Continental Army to New York. The enemies are many, but as to who they are, you do not know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colonial Gothic is a supernatural historical horror roleplaying game set during the dawn of the American Revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revised, rewritten and redesigned Colonial Gothic Rulebook 3rd Edition provides players and Gamemasters what they need to run adventures during the American Revolution. Everything you need to run a historical supernatural horror game is found in this book: rules covering the use of magic and alchemy, in-depth information on the life and times of the colonies, a bestiary of monsters pulled straight from the period; the possibilities are endless. Using a fast and simple mechanic, setting up and running a game of Colonial Gothic has never been easier. Plus, this 3rd Edition Rulebook is fully compatible with all previous Colonial Gothic adventures and sourcebooks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the time has come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War is here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose your side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
