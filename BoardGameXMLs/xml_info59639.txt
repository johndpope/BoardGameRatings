			<description>This is a fun educational game in which you take care of birds and learn about them. The artwork of the components is amazing. Everything, the birds, trees and rodents look like the ones in real life. The aim of the game is to be able to feed the animals. You throw a dice and draw a card. The cards will educate you about the life of four different kind of birds and also tell you whether you can help those birds in your turn or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
