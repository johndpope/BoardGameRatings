			<description>Each player starts with four horses. The first player to get all his horses behind the finish line wins the race. If a horse gets on a space already occupied by the horse of another player, it sends this horse back to the starting line. Horses on a space of their own color are safe. Several horses of the same color may occupy the same space. If a player rolls a 1 he may roll again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the players chose to bet on the winner of the race, the winner of the game is the player who won the bet. Since the bets are revealed only after the end of the game, the players can hinder or favor their favorite to influence the outcome of the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
