			<description>From the DVG website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our first venture into the Euro/Mass Market!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A &amp;ldquo;Family&amp;rdquo; card game. It's a card game for 2 to 6 players. Each player plays a mob boss trying to take over the top spot in New York City. The game is designed to be a low complexity family game and takes about 45-60 minutes to play. The tone is very light and very socially interactive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to take control of different places and people in the &amp;quot;Neighborhood&amp;quot;. As you do so, you gain reputation. The first player to reach the reputation goal wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's the cool part of the game...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cornerstone to the game is the &amp;quot;Vendetta&amp;quot; mechanic. If I take control of the local Delicatessen, I get some Reputation points. If you then come and Whack (destroy) the Deli, you take the Reputation points I gained from controlling Deli.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But wait!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you Whack my Deli, you must give me some of your Vendetta counters. The specific number is noted on the Deli card. If I attack you in the future, I can spend your Vendetta counters to pump up my attack against your places and people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, the more you Whack a player, the more bonuses they have in the future to Whack you back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This does 2 cool things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, you get the whole &amp;quot;Grudge&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Now it's personal&amp;quot; aspect of mob warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, even if a player gets Whacked hard, he still has the resources to make a comeback. Which means until a player wins, everyone has a shot at winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design came together very fast, and the artist, Jerry, is doing a great job of capturing the light feel we're going for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
