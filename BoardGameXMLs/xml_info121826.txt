			<description>SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neil Strauss, seven-time New York Times bestselling author who brought you the international bestselling seduction books The Game and Rules of the Game is back with one question in mind: &amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rsquo;s Got Game?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rsquo;s Got Game?&amp;rdquo; adds a new twist to being social and can be played anywhere. Whether or not you&amp;rsquo;re currently a player or playette, there is more game in this box than in most people&amp;rsquo;s brains. Play it for fun, for training, or for a better social lubricator than alcohol. Like The Game itself, these cards can be used to break the ice and get to know people&amp;mdash;whether strangers or your own partner&amp;mdash;in minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rsquo;s Got Game?&amp;rdquo; is engineered to bring out the fun and attractive qualities in every player. From physical challenges to personality tests to secret conspiracies, &amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rsquo;s Got Game?&amp;rdquo; has it all. So if you&amp;rsquo;re looking to turn an ordinary night into a memorable adventure, this is the game for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns running game (script cards) on each other. The player with the most points after 12 script cards + The Final Challenge wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, one player is THE LEADER. THE LEADER reads a script card aloud to all the players. The script card, for example, can consist of personality tests, fun loaded questions, charade-like questions, handwriting analysis, palm reading, physical challenges, secret conspiracy missions, and more. The players respond to the script card accordingly. The player(s) who win the round receives points. (The script card states how many points the card is worth.) After each script card is completed, the next player going clockwise becomes THE LEADER. The player with the most points after 12 script cards + The Final Challenge wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
