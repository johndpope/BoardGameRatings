			<description>Match colours, quick reaction: A blue father cat, a red mother cat... Quick! You must be the first to find their 3 kittens!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players have two big cats, each face down. Kittens are also face down, but at the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players must find three kittens in the same color as their big cats , like a memo. The first player who has collected all her kittens must shout &amp;quot;MIAOU&amp;quot;, the turn is over and he wins a &amp;quot;mouse&amp;quot; pawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is repeated until a player gets five mice pawns. He will be the winner of the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
