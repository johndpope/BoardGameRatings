			<description>From the box description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The excitement of baseball comes alive in CARD BASEBALL. You're the manager. Choose your team of nine batters. Decide who is the home team and batter up! Your favorite player steps to the plate, and with a combination of a role of the die, the choosing of a HIT, PLUS, or OUT card, and reading the STATS on the back of your player's baseball card, you're in for a fun nine innings of baseball strategy - just as if you were managing your own big league team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With CARD BASEBALL, you can play division, inter-division, all-star, play-off, old timers, or world series games. The possibilities are as big as your card collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With CARD BASEBALL, you can use any baseball card collection that includes STATS of your favorite players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, get your peanuts and popcorn, open your stadium board, choose your team, and &amp;quot;PLAY BALL!&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Contents:&lt;br/&gt;- One baseball stadium board&lt;br/&gt;- 2 white die&lt;br/&gt;- 1 red die&lt;br/&gt;- Score pads&lt;br/&gt;- 40 HIT cards&lt;br/&gt;- 40 PLUS cards&lt;br/&gt;- 40 OUT cards&lt;br/&gt;- 2 Batter Cards&lt;br/&gt;- 1 Token to track OUTS&lt;br/&gt;- Complete set of rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOT included:&lt;br/&gt;- Your favorite set of baseball cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
