							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">StormWinds 1.5</name>
									
			<description>A number of new changes have been made including a restart campaign button and new challenge missions!&lt;br/&gt;StormWinds 1.5 is a huge upgrade made to the original StormWinds. Although the first game did fairly well, a lot of suggestions were brought and I felt like we could do better. This then, is the result of hundreds of user comments and reviews. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a big step up, and I hope you all enjoy it!&lt;br/&gt;StormWinds places the player in a steampunk setting, facing a massive invasion of airships and other flying contraptions. A blend between a tower defense game and a shooter, you must choose your defenses then use them personally to gain victory.&lt;br/&gt;This game is by far Hero Interactive&amp;rsquo;s largest to date- over 10 people had a hand in the game at some stage in development. Players who make the purchase now get access to 2 new campaigns, new weapons, new enemies, a new boss, new challenge missions (as they come out), and cheat codes. In addition, when the beta of Bubble Tanks 2 is released, extra content purchasers will be invited to join in!&lt;br/&gt;A big thank you to everyone who supported the game, gave great feedback, and helped to bring this better version online!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
