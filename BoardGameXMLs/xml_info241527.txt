							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ninja Bees</name>
									
			<description>It turns out that competition for flowers and the pollen that they produce has become fierce. Regular bees can't tack it. Killer bees can'd do it either. Who can? Ninja bees!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Ninja Bee starts in a Hive and has to wage a stealthy path through charted territory to a flower and back safely to the Hive. But beware, for other bees are looking for the same flowers and are not above sabotaging your mission - in fact they relish the chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ninja Bees is a competitive card game for two or three players.&lt;br/&gt;It is mentally challenging (meaning it will hurt your head).&lt;br/&gt;It may ruin all of your friendships.&lt;br/&gt;Includes 46 cards play cards and 2 instruction cards, all 3.25&amp;quot; x 3.75&amp;quot; hexagonal and in a beautiful box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
