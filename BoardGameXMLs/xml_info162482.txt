			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 35th Century, Earth is the planet of the Space-Republicans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth may be the Motherworld, but any homo sapiens with brains, balls or convictions lit out for deep space decades ago. Industrialization has crippled the globe- every inch of the planet is bought and paid for by somebody. Someone (probably one of that bastard Plantaganet&amp;rsquo;s inner circle) owns every inch of land, sea or sky. Advertising neon is bio-welded to every tree, factories staffed by endless legions of goggled worker drones cover the entirety of what used to be called &amp;lsquo;states&amp;rsquo;, before the planet unified. Mindlessly inoffensive muzak drifts from ambient speaker droids shaped like chrome magpies, and there&amp;rsquo;s an ICG approved church on every street corner. There&amp;rsquo;s no &amp;lsquo;there&amp;rsquo; on Earth anymore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mombassa looks exactly like Dien Bein Phu, which looks exactly like Austin, which looks exactly like London and Moscow and Calgary and Melbourne and Paris and&amp;hellip;you get the idea. Imagine a shopping mall the size of what used to be a planet, and that&amp;rsquo;s Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You know the jackboot currently standing on your throat? Well, it belongs to a Command soldier of some kind. You want to know the exact make and model of the boot, and the stats on the @$$hole whose foot is inside it? Read on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will also find new Cultural Templates like The Star Virgin and Vidiots, a host of jack-booted cyborgs and even the President of Earth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
