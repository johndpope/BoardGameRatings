							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Post-Apocalyptic Vampire Wars</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is role-playing game set after the apocalypse. In 2050 the worst symptoms of environmental collapse began to be seen. The fall of civilization did not come suddenly, it came slowly and inexorably. Dust came in a swirling blanket, carried by wind storms, gradually spreading across the whole globe, and blocking out direct sunlight. Even as the skies dimmed, temperatures climbed and then there came a time of destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crops failed without sunlight, wars over scarce resources spread across the surface of the planet. Wars fought by people and by newly designed robots. And, without direct sunlight, an ancient scourge was able to emerge from the shadows. Vampires began to stalk the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some small pockets of civilization have survived the cataclysm that destroyed their world. These tiny communities are sometimes built in the remains of once glorious cities, sometimes they are isolated outposts in the desert. At the helm of each compound is a warlord, cult leader or other form of dictator. Living in the compound means you don't starve to death and aren't ripped to shreds by desert crazies. People will give up many freedoms in order to be safe, and most warlords run their compound with an iron hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For activities that are risky and benefit the compound, there are incentives. The brave warriors and scavengers who go out on raids, and who bring back the supplies needed for the compound to survive, are the nobility of the community. Join them, climb into your customized battle car and compete for the scarce resources of a blasted world, stalked by horror, with glory the only reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
