							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gold Keeper</name>
									
			<description>Gold Keeper is a small but dynamic and funny game. Here you can find cynical humor as well as non-stop gameplay and perfect 3D-graphics. This game is a perfect time-killer for the small sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your character is a demon, who lives in a cave and defends his treasures, which he has been building up for years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your enemies are avid villagers from the settlement lying nearby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their aim is to steal your gold and to kill you. Your aim is to rebuff the insolent robbers using all means including the hammer and the hatchet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a sign near the entrance to your cave, saying &amp;laquo;Violators will be killed! Survivors will be killed again!&amp;raquo; And nobody can say that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t advised!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
