							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blade Runner</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Blade Runner is a point and click adventure game, developed by Westwood Studios for the PC. Rather than re-tell the 1982 Blade Runner film, the developers created a different story set in the same universe, serving as a side story. The game was published by Virgin Interactive Entertainment and released in 1997.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player assumes the role of &amp;quot;Blade Runner&amp;quot; Ray McCoy, who must hunt down a group of replicants&amp;mdash;bioengineered beings&amp;mdash;in 2019 Los Angeles. The new story takes place at the same time as the events of the film. Several of the film's characters are also in the game, with the original actors returning to voice them. Although the film's main character, Deckard, only appears fleetingly in a non speaking role in Blade Runner, he is referred to multiple times, and his recent activities are mentioned by non-player characters. Other parallels with the film include the in-game reproduction of several prominent locations, buildings, and scenes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Blade_Runner_(1997_video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
