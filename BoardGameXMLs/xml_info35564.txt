			<description>Contents include: two pencils, two standard dice, one shaker cup, and a pad of score sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The score sheet has a staggered (steps) grid of six rows with the numbers one through 6.  The players take turns rolling the dice, and if available, circle a number on their score sheet.  For example, if a player rolls a three and a six, they can circle the number 6 on the third row, or the number 3 on the sixth row. If both possibilities have already been selected, they must cross off any available remaining number of their choosing left on their score sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all players' score sheets have all numbers either circled or crossed off, all of any single number have been circled, all of any row have been circled, or the one vertical row which contains the numbers 1 to 6 has been completely circled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players then total the circled numbers in each row and total each row. Then they add any bonus points they may have received for a complete row, diagonal, or column.  The player with the most total points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
