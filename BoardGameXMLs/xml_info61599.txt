			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have what it takes to get the Scoop?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find out in the Boomtown Planet &amp;ndash; Saturday Edition!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Boomtown Planet &amp;ndash; Saturday Edition is a tip of the fedora to those famous newspapermen and newspaperwomen of the past. &lt;br/&gt;Set in the Dirty 30s, in the fictional city of Boomtown, you are an employee of Boomtown&amp;rsquo;s number daily, the Boomtown Planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boomtown, however, is not your ordinary city. Sure there are bootlegging mobsters, crooked politicians, and scheming businessmen. But there other things besides&amp;hellip;mad scientists, giant robots, monsters, and things that go bump in the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s inconsequential to a hard-bitten reporter or a hard-boiled gumshoe. There&amp;rsquo;s a story out there that needs to be found and told. And it&amp;rsquo;s your job to do it, regardless of the peril.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For quick play, play pre-made PCs or select a template. Or custom build a character to suit your gaming needs. Character creation is quick and painless. Game-play is open ended. Play pickup games or carefully crafted campaigns. It&amp;rsquo;s all up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A complete, easy to use, rule-set with a thorough chargen section&lt;br/&gt;- An introduction to the 30s era and the journalism of the day&lt;br/&gt;- Loads of setting detail on the city of Boomtown, including unique NPCs and a full list of mooks and monsters. &lt;br/&gt;- Try your hand at small town reporter. This game includes setting detail on the small town of Hail River, including unique NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
