			<description>The player will be able to classify the Officer ranks (O-1 to O-6) of Armed Services including Branch of Service, rank, device worn, and number/arrangement of stripes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to get three of a kind, four of a kind, and/or a &amp;quot;straight&amp;quot; (consecutive string of Officer ranks) within any singular specific Armed Service. Each player takes his/her turn in reviewing their own hand, drawing one card from the draw deck, or selecting the first face-up card in the discard deck. Then, he/she discards one unwanted card, and the game proceeds to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;If he has one of demanded combinations he shouts &amp;quot;Salute!&amp;quot; immediately. The remaining players are allowed one more turn to try to match, or exceed the hand of the player who commanded, &amp;quot;SALUTE!&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;Every combinations score. The first player to total 500 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;60 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
