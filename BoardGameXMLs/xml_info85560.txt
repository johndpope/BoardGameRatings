			<description>This is basically a two-player version of the 1970's game Perfection, in which you have a set of plastic shapes that fit into holes on the board. The board is pushed down into a spring-loaded box with a timer. When you fit all your shapes into the right holes, you turn off the timer. If you don't turn it off in time, it pops and sends all your pieces flying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poppin' Puzzlers is exactly like that except each player has his own set of pieces, orange or yellow, and you play on opposite sides of the game unit. There are 20 pieces for each player. The pieces get stored in a compartment on the top of the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
