			<description>&amp;quot; with user comments&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mario vs. Donkey Kong is a Game Boy Advance spiritual sequel to the first Donkey Kong game for Game Boy. The game concept revolves around a combination of platform and puzzle elements, challenging Mario to find keys, reach a locked door, and rescue mini-Marios. This game revives Mario and Donkey Kong's old rivalry. The game's sequel, Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis, is on the Nintendo DS. This is the seventh Mario game for the Game Boy Advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is an evolution of Donkey Kong Plus, a title on display at E3 2002. During the show, Plus had a feature that allowed players to design and save their own levels on the GameCube, then copy them across to the Game Boy Advance using a link cable. It was essentially an updated version of Donkey Kong '94, but the game had disappeared by the following year. It was replaced with the pre-rendered graphics and gameplay additions of Mario vs. Donkey Kong. The Create-a-Level feature was removed from this version (but appears in its sequel).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's boss fights feature heavy use of barrels. There are also three barrels on the cover.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mario_vs._Donkey_Kong,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
