							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alaska Double Takes</name>
									
			<description>Alaska Double Takes is based on matching 48 spectacular photos of unique and scenic Alaskan Images.  The rules are simple, but the challenge is sophisticated enough to intrigue players of all ages!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Double Takes is to find matching pairs of photos.  Start by spreading the cards face down on the playing surface. The first player turns over two of the cards at random.  If the pair of cards turned over (for all to see) is not a matching pair, then the player turns them face down in the same position and the next player gets a turn.  If the pair forms a match, the player claims the cards and gets to turn over two more cards.  Play continues until all matches are found and claimed.  The winner is he player claiming the most matching pairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
