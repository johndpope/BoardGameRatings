							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Edgar Bergen &amp; Charlie McCarthy&#039;s Game of Topper</name>
									
			<description>Edgar Bergen's and Charlie McCarthy's Game of Topper has 8 wooden Toppers, one deck of 36 special playing cards, a score pad and a playing board. The number of toppers used in the game is always one less than the number of players playing. the deck is made up of 36 cards in books of 4 cards each. A book consists of 4 cards having the same number. As many books are used as number of players in the game, so if you only have 6 players your starting deck would d have only 24 cards (6 books of 4).&lt;br/&gt;How to play. The dealer places the toppers on the playing board in the center of the table. He then shuffles and distributes the card face down to everyone. The object of the game is to get a complete book of cards in their hand. You do this by passing one card to the player on his left. That player decides if he wants to keep the card and give a different card or if he wants to pass the card on to the next player. This goes on until a player has 4 cards the same in his hand at which time that player then grabs a topper from the center of the board and then everyone else tries to make a mad grab for a remaining toppers. Of course since there is always one topper less than the number of players playing one will not get a topper. that player accumulates the letter T on his score card. Each additional time that the player gets no topper another letter in the word TOPPER is accumulated. The first player who has TOPPER next to his name loses the round and sits out the rest of the game which is then played with less cards and less toppers. Eventually only one player remains and he wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
