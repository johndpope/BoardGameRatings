							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wings of Glory: World War 2 – Avro Lancaster B Mk.III</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Avro Lancaster is a British four-engine World War II heavy bomber, designed and built by Avro for the Royal Air Force (RAF). It first saw active service with RAF Bomber Command in 1942 and, as the strategic bombing offensive over Europe gathered momentum, it became the main heavy bomber used by the RAF. The &amp;quot;Lanc&amp;quot;, as it was affectionately known, became the most famous and most successful of the Second World War night bombers, delivering 608,612 long tons of bombs in 156,000 sorties. Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW2 Wings of Glory Special Pack is a ready-to-play large size model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW2 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards, as well as specific rules and components necessary to use the airplane. Bonus contents in this pack include one double-sided industrial complex card and special rules. This is not a complete game. To play, you must own a WW2 Rules and Accessories Pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
