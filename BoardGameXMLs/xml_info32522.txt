							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Apple&#039;s Way</name>
									
			<description>Listed in American Games, #4488.  1974, TV, Board Game.  Based on the short lived eponymous 1974 television series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of game: The Apple family likes to do things together and in this game, the players have fun matching cards of their many activities. As players move around the path of the board, they try to stop on certain squares so they can pick up a green card that would show some activity that would match a yellow card in their hand. When a player has matched a green card from the board with a yellow card from their hand, both cards are discarded and out of the game. Green and yellow are common apple colors, after all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the game is the first player to discard all of his cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
