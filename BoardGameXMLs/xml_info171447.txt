			<description>In Bad Bunnies, players try to play their cards wisely in order to force others out of the round so that they can claim all of the played cards for themselves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of each round, each player has seven cards in hand, with the cards valued 1-13. The first player plays any card, then calls &amp;quot;Higher&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Lower&amp;quot;; the next player must play an appropriate card or pass, laying down her cards and stepping out of the round. Instead of playing higher or lower, however, a player can play a card of the same value, saying &amp;quot;Double up&amp;quot;, which forces all subsequent players to also play a card of the same value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two escape valves exist in the game: A player can always play a 7 &amp;mdash; the large joker &amp;mdash; no matter what was played previously, with this player calling out &amp;quot;Higher&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Lower&amp;quot; as normal. A player can play a 1 &amp;mdash; the small joker &amp;mdash; no matter whether &amp;quot;Higher&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Lower&amp;quot; was called, but a 1 can't be played on doubled cards; the 1 can itself be doubled, with only a 7 being able to break the doubling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as all but one player have passed for the round, the round ends and the lone player still in the round receives one point for each played card. A round might also end by players running out of cards in hand, but the final card played in a round that ends this way cannot be a joker (unless a joker was also the next-to-last card). Once a round ends, players have the option to ditch their hand, after which everyone refills their hand to seven cards and a new round begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to have at least sixty points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
