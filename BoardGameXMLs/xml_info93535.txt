			<description>Join your friend Billy Lee, the heroic master of the Martial Arts, on a mission to rescue Marian from Jimmy, the evil crime boss.  Players compete to be the first to get both of their playing pieces through the dangerous streets to Jimmy's hideout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To complete the rescue, you must get BOTH your markers to the finish space before your opponent.  One of your markers is you - and the other marker is your friend Billy Lee.  Don't forget - it takes BOTH your markers to foil the crime boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player going first snaps the dice.  Move forward the number of spaces shown.  Than snap the dice again, looking only at the 2 dice with the fighters on them.  Go to the fighter table to see who won the fight.  If you are on a 1, 2, or 3 space, move your marker forward or backward that many spaces depending on if you won or lost.  If you are on a Billy Lee square and you won, move your marker that is farther behind up to the one that is ahead.  If you lost, move the marker that is ahead back to the marker that is behind.  First to get both of their markers to the finish space is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
