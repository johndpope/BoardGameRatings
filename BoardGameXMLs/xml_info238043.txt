			<description>A Hallow's Eve Special&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The village of Schreckenburg is an ancient settlement, having been founded many centuries ago. The neighboring forest, once called the Summer Glades, has since swallowed up the stubborn community, enveloping it within a dense maze of twisted trees and thick shrubs. Many souls have been lost to it, drawn within by its dark beauty and mysterious allure. The forest is wild, and in its shadows something thrives!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just before winter, the folks of Schreckenburg honor an old tradition to keep the dark spirits of the forest at bay. On Hallow&amp;rsquo;s Eve they must offer a sacrifice to the Well in the Woods. For centuries, this practice has kept the village safe, and no spirit has invaded the land of mankind. However, this year the Will of the Forest will be tested, for no longer will Schreckenburg families throw away the lives of their children just to appease an entity that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist... or does it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 4-6 hour adventure for 6th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distributed as a 35-page PDF scenario and a 10-page PDF player's supplement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
