			<description>Batman: The Video Game was released for the Sega Mega Drive, which was inspired by the Tim Burton directed Batman film from 1989. The Mega Drive/Genesis version was also produced by Sunsoft. Critics were impressed by its graphics, sound, and playability. Similar to the NES version, it had limited commercial success because it took so long for the final product to be released, due to Nintendo's former policy of producing titles for a Nintendo system exclusively. By the time this policy was abandoned, the game was released in 1990.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similarities and differences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the NES, this version stays closer to the plot of the film, and features the Batmobile and Batwing in the form of horizontal shooting levels. While the NES version allows three unique weapons and unlimited continues, the Genesis version only has the Batarang as a special weapon with limited continues. The grappling hook is an additional item. The game also deviates from the film plot because in the film, Batman attempts to save Napier from falling into the chemicals, but fails. However in the game, Batman actually knocks Napier into the vat. This game has several cutscenes, with the player advancing to the next destination after defeating a boss character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Batman (Sega Mega Drive)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
