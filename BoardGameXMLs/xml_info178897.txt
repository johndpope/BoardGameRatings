			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A walled hill town. The raised approaches to its outcrop lie long ago cast down; its belltower stands silent over streets of tumbled ruin thick with new growth. The banished huddle. Legatees press.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Condensed to one page for slipping in among other materials, this sandbox-oriented content is intended as an easily absorbed framework for improvisation to be adapted by the user as preferred for a wider setting and specific system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It presents core ideas and key numbers to fall back on, with general approaches that can be applied in other situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The content covers map generation on the fly for an abstracted town as well as suggestions for aspects of the locality, including a banished folk, overgrown streets, buildings, caverns and a toll taken and heard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town could be detailed using Pseudohistorical Buildings on 2+ Dice, its caverns simplified or extended using one or more of the maps in the Location, Landscape &amp;amp; World bundle, not least The Acrid Well and The Low Mere. The banished could be developed with items from Character: Odds &amp; Ends Found on the Olde Worlde Adventurer and the legatees using Character: More or Less Promising Olde Worlde Adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
