							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Steam Dragon&#039;s Revenge</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for characters of 5th-7th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hundred years ago the steam dragon Glorack made her home within the Fallow glacier, not far from the village of Trommel. She emerged from her lair to pillage the countryside, scalding peasants, roasting knights within their own armor, and rending countless brave souls with her talons. Glorack hoarded gold from dwarven holds, elven jewelry, gnomish magical items, and coin from many unfortunate nobles. Finally an intrepid band of heroes penetrated her ice caves to destroy her. When they inflicted a seemingly mortal blow on Glorack, the dragon's carcass and her treasure melted deep into the ice in the scorching steam and blood that poured from her body. The steam dragon was vanquished. For a century the lands near the Fallow Range glacier fields enjoyed freedom from Glorack's tyranny. Now Glorack has returned!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The villagers of Trommel fear that the dreaded steam dragon has somehow risen from emtombment within the deep ice of the Fallow glacier . Scouts report signs that a dragon has moved back into the icy wastelands. Trommel's elders have already sponsored several expeditions to destroy the steam dragon, but none have returned. Brave youngsters from the village and experienced adventurers from lands afar climbed into the glacier and assaulted the steam dragon's lair. If they weren't cooked alive by Glorack's scalding breath, they probably froze to death trapped in an icy crevasse or a frigid underground lake. Nobody ever discovered their remains or stories of their true demise. The village elders offer to equip adventurers heading into the Fallow Range, seeking the glacier and the small cave at its base. Although they can grant no reward for slaying the steam dragon, they relinquish all rights to Glorack's treasure to anyone who destroys her before she rises from her icy lair to terrorize the countryside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
