							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Followers of the Gnome Pantheon</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gnome pantheon consists of three gods, though many gnomes worship dwarven gods as well. Charis the Gnome Father has a loose organization that oversees the harvest, funerals, and the defense of the earth. The Church of the Wanderer is devoted to Kela, goddess of exploration, craftsmen, smiths, and merchants. Her decentralized church enjoys crafting, making money, and traveling. Meiroc the Mad Inventor is served by the Church of the Gear; a contentious lot constantly striving for greater power amongst themselves. Inventors and engineers of all races are welcome, as long as they constantly maintain their expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
