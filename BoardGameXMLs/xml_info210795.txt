			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this rollicking alt-history adventure for Savage Worlds, magic is awakened in the early 20th Century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1920, at the same time alcohol was banned, a Prohibition against Sorcery was passed by the US Congress. The law deported all denizens of Faerie out of the country and prohibited the practice of magic for any reason other than law enforcement or national defense. Spell books and magic items were burned in the streets and all known portals to Faerie were sealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But when sorcery is outlawed, only outlaws will be sorcerers...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this pick-up adventure, the players take on the roles of romanticized Depression Era bandits in the mold of John Dillinger or Bonnie and Clyde.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The public sees them as modern-day, spell-slinging Robin Hoods for taking on the banks that have foreclosed on so many. Despite the adulation they enjoy as folk heroes, it's a dangerous life as they prowl the Midwestern country roads looking for their next score. The FBI's wizards (and the dark magic they wield) are never too far behind...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note - This adventure is set in the same universe as Kaiser's Gate. In order to make this adventure easier to use for a quick pick-up game - it uses the standard magic system for Savage Worlds. Kaiser's Gate is not required to enjoy this adventure. But it's pretty awesome and if you like alt-history in your Savage Worlds fun, you should pick it up. With a little conversion this adventure can be used with Kaiser's Gate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure includes pregenerated PCs to make it easier to use as a quick pickup adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
