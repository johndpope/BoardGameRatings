							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Codic Keep</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the name Codic Keep used to have prestige associated with it in the past, it is now a crumbling fortress blasted years ago by a large tornado. Now the ruin sits next to a swamp and is pretty much left ignored. Recently word has reached Feastelburg that strange lights have been noticed near the keep and many have wondered if the wanted criminal relative has returned to reclaim the property. Wanted posters of &amp;ldquo;Si&amp;rdquo; Codic have been circulating for quite some time with a reward of 1500 gp for his capture. Who&amp;rsquo;s up for a swamp trip?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for a medium level party and a DM.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
