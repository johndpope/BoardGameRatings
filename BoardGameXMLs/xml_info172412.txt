			<description>In Director's Cut: The Card Game, players are Hollywood movie producers in the early 20th century. Each player will try to put together the best movie-making teams in order to maximise the profit from each movie they make.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As movie producers, players will hire cast and crew from a central shared market, while trying to deny their opponent access to key cast and crew members. Once a player has assembled a set of cast and crew cards, they will play these cards to produce a movie from a shared set of screenplays. Each screenplay has its own set of cast requirements and awards cash and other bonuses, based on the quality of the production. The richest player at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Director's Cut: The Card Game is a game about set collection and resource management. It's suitable for 2 players and takes around 15 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
