							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">From the Bags of Giants</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Giant Collection of Treasures!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides being large, the one thing that giants all seem to have in common is their tendency to collect strange and unusual treasures in the oversized bags that they carry with them as they roam across the land. While gems, gold, and magic items are all things that you can find in a giant&amp;rsquo;s bag, there are also plenty of &amp;ldquo;treasures&amp;rdquo; that only a giant could love, such as half-eaten goats or a stone tablet too worn to read. Most of a giant&amp;rsquo;s treasures fall somewhere in between, however, taking the form of odd or unusual art objects, captive creatures, and other strange things that can potentially be of value, but are more than just hard currency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other books have provided simple tables with a handful of suggestions for what kinds of mundane objects you might find in a giants&amp;rsquo; bag, but the limited number of entries and the nature of the content can make giants&amp;rsquo; bags fairly forgettable quickly, instead of an exciting source of unpredictable treasure and plot hooks. This book contains four d% tables for use in determining the contents of a giant&amp;rsquo;s bag, one each for cloud, fire, frost, and hill giants. Since each table is tailored to a specific giant, and there are no repeated entries, that makes for 400 weird and unusual things to find in giants&amp;rsquo; bags (or any other place you find yourself wishing for a strange and surprising bit of treasure). Even more, for each type of giant bag, there is a new unique magic item, never seen elsewhere, each of which is included in this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
