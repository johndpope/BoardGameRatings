			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Love is a nefarious retro platformer game where the player has to pass through increasingly challenging levels.  During the game, players can set respawn points on solid ground as they progress through the levels.  The game awards points based on how few lives you lose, and how few respawn points you use to complete the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Love was initially released as a 20-level game in 2008, but was later updated and released in 2010 as Love+, with only 11 levels.  Later editions have included Love+ Custom, which enables players to create and load custom levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
