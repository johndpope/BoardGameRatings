							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Migration Game</name>
									
			<description>Each player starts out with a flock of 500 geese and 100 energy points.  By rolling the die and following the instructions on the cards, players simulate the full migration of their flock.  Along the way, each player's flock will encounter conditions, both favorable and unfavorable, that actual geese might face during their annual migration.  The player who completes the migration with the highest score is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
