			<description>The game features three different modes: TV Guide, Zapping, and Marathon. Featuring eight differently-themed channels, TV Guide mode challenges players to beat high scores to unlock more games and earn bonus prizes to decorate their player profiles with. Zapping mode provides instant access to any currently unlocked game. Up to four players can join the party in Marathon mode where everyone plays five randomly selected games in a row and competes for the highest score. Players can take on the one hundred and one challenges alone to access every last game, or make it a family competition, and see who can unlock the most games. Up to four profiles can be saved per console so each player's individual progress is maintained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;101-in-1 Party Megamix&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
