							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Constructed: A Fellowship Expansion Pack</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hello. I have been ordered to assist you. Please allow me the freedom to do so. I will not get in your way. I intend to be as useful to you as possible on your journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am a designated combat unit built for battle. I will ensure our adventure goes smoothly and simply. There will be no major distractions and we will finish this assignment quickly. That is what I was ordered to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I feel like there's so much more to the world...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that is irrelevant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I was Constructed for this purpose and this purpose alone. We will succeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Constructed is the third Fellowship expansion pack. This one contains new toys for both player and overlord. The Contructed is a new playbook, a hero of the fellowship, who was built specifically for the job. The Machines are a new army for the Overlord to draw on, an entire legion of specialized units with which to crush the Overlord's enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Constructed is perfect. They were built to be. But perfection is lonely, and they have no society to call their own. The Constructed is one of a kind. They are made to follow orders and succeed at any cost, and they are very good at both. The Constructed offers you a chance to play a powerful hero with nothing to lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as The Constructed if you like being different from the rest of the group, if you want to follow everyone's lead, if you want to focus on only your hero and how they approach the world, or if you just want to be a cool robot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Machines are an army of specialists - each machine has a job, and it does exclusively that job. It is rare for a machine to do anything outside of its programming, so as long as you aren't their job, you should be fine. Unfortunately, the Overlord has just set their job to &amp;quot;war,&amp;quot; and you are in the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
