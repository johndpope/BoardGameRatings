			<description>The No Game was published in A Gamut of Games, a word by Sid Sackson:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;As promissed, here is The No Game. This is not one that I created myself, thought I wish I had. It is a great party game, taking fifteen minutes to prepare, one minute to explain, and as much time to play as the guests wish to devote to it.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a very simple party game in wich each player receives a ribbon. When a player makes another to say 'No', he can take all ribbons from that player. The game continues until a pre determined time, when the player with the most ribbons is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;         Locate a nice prize.&lt;br/&gt;         As everyone enters the party, pin a small ribbon on their clothes, one per person.&lt;br/&gt;         After everyone has arrived, gather them together and give a speech similar to the following:&lt;br/&gt;             &amp;ldquo;The object of tonight&amp;rsquo;s game is to collect the most ribbons. To collect ribbons, you must have an opponent say the word &amp;lsquo;No&amp;rsquo; to you. Upon uttering that word, you may promptly collect every ribbon currently pinned on them; they are yours, at least until you say &amp;lsquo;No.&amp;rsquo; Other words, phrases, and actions, like &amp;lsquo;Nah,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Certainly not,&amp;rsquo; and a swift slap, are perfectly valid; only uttering the word &amp;lsquo;No&amp;rsquo; causes a lack of ribbons. At [some time here], the person with the most ribbons wins the game, and receives a nice prize.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;         Play as the speech above states.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
