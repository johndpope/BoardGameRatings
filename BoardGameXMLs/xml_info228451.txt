			<description>A card game for 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck comprising 7 Suites: Brothers, Villain, Location, Alchemy, Friend, Plot, Theme. Each Suite has 13 cards ranked from 1 to 13.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 5 cards. Players take turns with each turn having four phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Draw Phase.  &lt;br/&gt;Draw 2 cards from the top of the deck and put them in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Action Phase.  &lt;br/&gt;You may play (discard) exactly one card from your hand. This will have an effect depending on the suite of the card: &lt;br/&gt;-   Brothers: Draw 3 cards and discard any 2 cards from your hand. &lt;br/&gt;-   Villain: Opponent must discard 2 random cards.&lt;br/&gt;-   Location: Look at an opponent&amp;rsquo;s hand. Draw 1 card from the deck. &lt;br/&gt;-   Alchemy: Cannot be discarded in action phase.  However,  &lt;br/&gt;extra Alchemy cards count as wild cards in meld phase. &lt;br/&gt;-   Friend: Draw top 2 cards of the deck and put them in your hand. &lt;br/&gt;-   Plot: Steal 1 random card from an opponent&amp;rsquo;s hand. &lt;br/&gt;-   Theme: Take 1 target card from the discard and put it in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Meld Phase&lt;br/&gt;If possible, you may make a Meld. There are 4 types of meld:&lt;br/&gt;-   7 cards, one from each of the 7 suites  &lt;br/&gt;-   7 cards all from the same suite&lt;br/&gt;-   7 cards in consecutive Rank Order&lt;br/&gt;-   7 cards of the same rank (This is very difficult and consequently automatically wins the game)  &lt;br/&gt;Immediately discard the Meld after you reveal it, then draw 5 new cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. End Phase&lt;br/&gt;Max hand size is 9 cards. Discard excess cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to make 5 melds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
