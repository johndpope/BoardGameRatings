			<description>Poly-Y is an abstract strategy connection board game for two players. It is the successor of The Game of Y and the precursor of Star and *Star.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete to capture the majority of corners of the board. A player captures a corner by making a Y with his pieces that connects the two sides adjacent to the corner with any other side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poly-Y does not have a standard board. It can be played on any board that has the following characteristics:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An equal number of cells along each side&lt;br/&gt;     An odd number of sides; 5- and 9-sided boards are preferred&lt;br/&gt;     Tessellated by mostly six-sided cells&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from Mudcrack Y &amp;amp; Poly-Y (1975) by Craige Schensted and Charles Titus and Connection Games (2005) by Cameron Browne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
