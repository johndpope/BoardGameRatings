			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume Six of the unofficial 3rd-party expansion to the hit party game Cards Against Humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here in the VSC labs, we've been hard at work for the last year, attempting to isolate a new set of cards with--theoretically--unlimited laughter potential. I'll admit, things were touch and go there for a while, between the betrayal of Dr. Weisen and her acolytes, and the mysterious &amp;quot;accident&amp;quot; that took the life of Mr. Slowpokes, our office sloth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...But every tragedy begets a triumph, and so we are proud to introduce Crabs Adjust Humidity: Volume Six. Fresh from the smoking wreckage of Testing Bay Three, we bring you another deck of 112 cards so vile and morally-bankrupt, someone may try to elect it president.&lt;br/&gt;Includes: 80 white cards, 32 black cards&lt;br/&gt;Professionally printed on linen-finish, casino-quality cards.&lt;br/&gt;100% compatible with Cards Against Humanity.&lt;br/&gt;Custom serialized hologram on every box, so you know you're not getting a counterfeit.&lt;br/&gt;Has no real moral compass.&lt;br/&gt;Do not refrigerate after opening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
