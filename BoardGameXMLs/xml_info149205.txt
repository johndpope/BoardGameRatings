			<description>Fantasy Flight Games is proud to announce resin House cards for each of the six Great Houses represented in A Game of Thrones: The Card Game! Now you can boldly state your allegiance for your favorite House by displaying its heraldry and claiming power on a stylish resin House card as you battle your way to the Iron Throne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you engage in the fierce battles and twisted intrigues of Westeros, you can collect power on a House card bearing the direwolf of House Stark, the lion of House Lannister, or the three-headed dragon of House Targaryen. Perhaps you will exhibit the crowned stag of House Baratheon or the sun-and-spear of House Martell, or even the fearsome kraken of House Greyjoy. No matter which House you support on the field of battle, these resin House cards will serve you well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
