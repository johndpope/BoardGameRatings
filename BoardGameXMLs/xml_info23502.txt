			<description>&amp;quot;The Sky's the Limit&amp;quot; is described as a game of aircraft trading and management. It was published by BAE Systems, the British aerospace and defense company, as a promotional product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to travel from your starting city, purchase at least one aircraft from the bank whilst at a city in each continent, and then return to your starting city, making the most of all business opportunities en route. Along the way, you will encounter opportunities to improve you journey or your financial situation, or events that conspire against you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An interesting extract from the rules: &amp;quot;The most trustworthy player is chosen as the banker. If a trustworthy player can't be agreed upon, the banker shall be the oldest player.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
