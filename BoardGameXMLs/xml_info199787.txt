							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Federation Game</name>
									
			<description>A version of 'snakes and ladders' themed around the federation of the Australian colonies. The numbered board spaces from 1841 to 1901 represent years. Players roll the die and move towards 1901, moving up ladders and down snakes if they land on these. In addition, some spaces require a player to answer a trivia card on some topic of Australian constitutional history. A correct or wrong answer moves the player forward or back 2 spaces respectively .&lt;br/&gt;Comes with folding board with rules printed on it, and deck of 34 cards. The die and player tokens required for play do not seem to have been included. &lt;br/&gt;Produced by the Departments of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
