			<description>A game for garden lovers. The board illustrates 4 gardens during winter. Each garden is divided in to squares with botanical names and a centre piece of 2 squares. Card cut out square tiles are similarly named and show summer bloom and garden furnishings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll the dice in turn. 4,5 or 6 allows you to take a tile from the pile. 1,2 or 3 forces you to return a tile to the heap. As the game progresses you make your own store for discarding weeds or duplicates back to the pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planting is not as easy as you think! Many items for the garden are quickly collected as there are many copies. However, some items are rare and difficult to find. The first to finish, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A rare, well designed and beautiful game. The designs vary but the contents are identical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
