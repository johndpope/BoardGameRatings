			<description>Blackguards 2 will stay an SRPG focussing on turn-based, strategic battles with a group of scoundrels as anti-heroes. Some of the best-known Blackguards from the first game will be part of the team again &amp;ndash; unfortunately, their lives didn&amp;rsquo;t go very well since then. Dwarf Naurim, for example, has rest on his fame as a successful gladiator and defeater of the Nine Hordes. He used his popularity for shady businesses and excessive parties and got quite potbellied &amp;ndash; not a very good condition for battles, and so he hung up his axe and ditched his old gang, as long as they wouldn't yield any profit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blackguards 2 will again be based on the RPG rulebook of The Dark Eye, but it will come along with some revisions, optimisations and simplifications. The gameplay will focus on turn-based battles once more &amp;ndash; this time the players have to conquer Cassia&amp;rsquo;s lands and defend them against intruders when the need arises. As in a fraction-based game the enemies can recapture the territories from the Blackguards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
