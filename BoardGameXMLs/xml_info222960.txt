							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DOS! Twice the fun of UNO</name>
									
			<description>Components: 108 cards, a dry erase pen, and magic erasable tablet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to get rid of all your 10 starting cards by forming sentences with your opponents. Players play one word card from their hand at the time, thereby adding to the sentence already on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player cannot go he picks up DOS (two) cards and either continues the sentence or starts afresh.  Trump cards spice up the game with wild animal sounds, improv, laziness annoyance and full stops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has two cards left anyone can call out DOS!! to enter DOS mode. In DOS Mode players are not bound to playing one card at the time but, at their turn, can add unlimited words provided it makes sense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When challenged, players get 60 seconds to draw a picture of the current sentence, to convince the other players that it makes sense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game creator is Alessandro Schueli, design credit goes to Ariel Lee, and special thanks to SCAD (Savannah College of Art and Design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
