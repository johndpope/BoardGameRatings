			<description>Notch - A Tumbledum dice game from REMCO from 1955. This is a very simple game where you turn a tumbler over. That tumbler has dice in it which results in your roll for the turn. You can land on various spaces on a board (that board is actually a rolled up piece of plastic that has to be opened and flattened before you can play) There are go back spaces and there are GET NOTCHES spaces for capturing outlaws. When you reach the finish space the one with the most notches wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
