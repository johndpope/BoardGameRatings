							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Emperor of the World</name>
									
			<description>From the Developer/Publisher:  &lt;br/&gt;You want to rule the world. You have plans to do just that. Execute your plans, and maybe some pesky Rebels, before anyone else does. In the end, they will call you &amp;quot;Emperor&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emperor of the World is a casual game of reaching your goals before anyone else can. The rules are simple. Roll 2 dice. Turn over a token of one of the numbers rolled. If, at the end of your turn, the tokens listed on your Imperial Plans cards are light-side up, you score that card. First person to score two Imperial Goals cards is the Emperor. Just be wary of those pesky Rebels that show up to ruin your plans anytime you roll a 12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
