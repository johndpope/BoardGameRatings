More than monsters and underground hazards await: the intrepid adventurers uncover a wide-reaching plot that puts their skills and knowledge of the Broken Road to the test!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Perils of the Broken Road&amp;quot; also contains an eight-page gazetteer of Fibblebrod, the launching point for this adventure and a frontier boom town suitable for use in any game world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Perils of the Broken Road&amp;quot; is an underground and urban adventure for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game suitable for any game world.
