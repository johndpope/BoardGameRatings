							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Labyrinth (1980/TRS-80)</name>
									
			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Labyrinth is a full scale, three-dimensional adventure. You move through a gigantic labyrinth depicted graphically on your monitor in 3-D perspective. Scattered through this nightmare are a multitude of objects and incredible obstacles. In addition, a minotaur prowls the lonely corridors, and given the chance, will kill you. You must find the necessary means to destroy the minotaur. Once armed, you may have to lure the monster into your clutches. He is no fool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The corridors of Labyrinth loop through space and time. Maps are encouraged, but may show strange convolutions of reality. Pits are not necessarily fatal. Periodically you will need more torches and food. Darkness and starvation are fatal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Labyrinth is gigantic. There are over 550 locations. Be patient. You will not solve Labyrinth during the first week. Or the first month. Make maps. And above all, BE CAREFUL!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
