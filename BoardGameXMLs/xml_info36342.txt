			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the &amp;lsquo;Owzat Games' version of an old favourite in the speedway and gaming world, Speedway Scene II. The realistic replay simulation of the wonderful and exciting world of top class motor cycle speedway. Produced under licence from Lambourne Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have not changed the basic game very much; there are now provisions on the charts for the &amp;ldquo;first bend bunching&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;two minutes&amp;rdquo; rules but other than that we have left a gaming classic well alone. Rather, we have aimed at producing a more colourful and attractive package, hopefully easier to use and improving the feel of being at a speedway meet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old plastic boards have gone in favour of a card version; this was done to enable us to produce a colour depiction of a speedway stadium. We hope you approve. If you find the board a little thin, try pasting the two halves onto some thicker card; I personally have not found the need and I believe the card track provided actually lies flat better than the old colour plastic versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
