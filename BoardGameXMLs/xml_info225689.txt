			<description>Warlords of Terra  has been classified as BTCG or Battlefield Trading Card Game, due to its main difference in game mechanics: there exists a REAL BATTLEFIELD in which our troops will have to move and cross, for us to reach our opponent's lines and defeat them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you like classic TCG mechanics but want something really NEW, and a true new strategic component which will make you develop your strategies at a higher level, this is your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players start with 20 life points, and our goal is reducing opponent's life to 0 or below. But to achieve that we need to cast our troops in our invocation line (first line)and cross with them all the battlefield, fighting enemy troops to reach their lines and &amp;quot;hit&amp;quot; them equal to our troops ATK value. As said, 20 points means victory. The fact troops need to move makes them have an unusual basic value: they have ATTACK/LIFE and SPEED (number of zones -cells- they can run in a turn).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But troops, objects and the rest of cards aren't played for free. It's fundamental to produce mana and gold for that. With this purpose, we will build &amp;quot;Place&amp;quot; cards with a cost and production amount. So, each turn we will add mana and gold equal to 1 plus the production indicated by our place cards. A good curve in resources production means a good match development, and that will make us stronger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Important: place cards are separated from &amp;quot;battle cards&amp;quot; (the rest: troops, objects, spells...), for us to choose what we want to draw each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a players' phase, they prepare all &amp;quot;turned&amp;quot; (exhausted) cards, add resources, build places, invoke troops or forge objects, then go to tactical phase, in which they can move troops one by one, cast spells, play hero skills, equip objects, fight against enemy troops or hit enemy player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sudden spells can be also played in response to opponent's actions, in order to disable their strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 1vs1 game which would charm any card+strategy game lover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We resume it with a single sentence: &lt;br/&gt;END OF GAME. CHALLENGE BEGINS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
