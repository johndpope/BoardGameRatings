			<description>When a player lands with his pawn on a question square on the board he has one minute and thirty seconds to answer a question that either stimulates his short or his long term memory. If he doesn't succeed he has to return his pawn to the previous position. The game box mentions a minimum age of 60, this is a joke of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
