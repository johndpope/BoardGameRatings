							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frenzy</name>
									
			<description>Frenzy is an abstract game where players represent schools of fish and/or feeding sharks. Played on an 8x8 grid, the school of fish is represented by 32 stones and the sharks by 2 stones. The school fish move like pieces in Chinese checkers and the sharks move like kings in chess, capturing fish in the same fashion. The sharks win if they can eliminate the school, but a shark is also immobilized if at any time there are no adjacent fish. The school wins by immobilizing both sharks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This can also be played with multiple boards allowing each player to play as the school on one board and the sharks on the other. By adding more boards the game can be expanded to more than two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
