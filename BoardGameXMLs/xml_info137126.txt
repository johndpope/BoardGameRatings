							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Willi und die Wunder dieser Welt</name>
									
			<description>A game themed on the German movie of the same title. Willi, a reporter, is traveling around the world and takes the players with him to tell them about the wonders of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game: All players try to reach the wonders depicted on their cards with the balloons on the game board. Whoever is first to reach five of his/her wonders and takes a picture of them wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: Each of the five balloon pieces is put on the corresponding starting point of the board. Each player gets three Willi chips, three compasses and three pips to go with the compasses. The cards are shuffled and each player gets a hand of five cards. Players only see their own cards. The remaining cards form the draw deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: The game is played in several rounds, and each round consists of several legs: rolling the colour die to select a balloon for the round (all players move the same balloon during a round), discarding a card and drawing a new one (optional), choosing directions by marking them with the pip on their compasses, and moving the balloons on the board according to the directions on the compasses. If the balloon lands on a space that shows a wonder that is depicted on a player's card, he/she &amp;quot;takes a picture&amp;quot; (says &amp;quot;Click!&amp;quot; and reads the information about the wonder from his/her card) and draws a new card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Balloon movement in more detail: Balloon movement is done in three stages per round. First, the start player chooses one of his/her three compasses, then the next player etc. until all players have resolved all their three compasses. A player may choose not to move the balloon if they don't want to use a particular direction on one of their compasses, but they may not use that compass again in the same round.&lt;br/&gt;Spaces occupied by another balloon or a Willi chip (put on a space that the balloon leaves) are skipped. If a balloon reaches the edge of the board in north or south direction, no further movement in that direction is possible; the eastern and western edges of the map allow crossing over to the other side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
