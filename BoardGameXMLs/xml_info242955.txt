			<description>The player is an enterpreneur running his own transport company.&lt;br/&gt;He needs to lay tracks on a difficult terrain, invent and build new vehicles, define routes and compete against economy itself to make as much profit as possible. By transporting passengers and cargo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the famous games from the 90s and especially by Chris Sawyer's Transport Tycoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mashinky aims to combine the best from 3D visualisation and addictiveness of the isometric gameplay. It all takes place on a procedurally generated world that acts as a sandbox with endless possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding the best strategy is never the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every game is different. It's up to you to find the best opportunities, invent the most fitting vehicles, expand industries and improve your stations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is up to you to adapt to the challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
