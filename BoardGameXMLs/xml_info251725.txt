			<description>Love and Hate is a meta-game that can be played with any point based game. Each player gets a public identity card and a secret love and hate card. You add your love's score to yours and subtract your hate's score to determine who won &amp;quot;Love and Hate&amp;quot; after you finish playing the host game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing time is only one minute because it adds less than a minute to the playing time of the host game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
