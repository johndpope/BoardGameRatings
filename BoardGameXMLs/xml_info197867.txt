All players try to make at the same time the maximal amount of matches combining one transparent and one shadow card.&lt;br/&gt;The player with most matches at the end is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;in another play variant all the transparent cards are open in the table and the shadow cards are shuffled and open one at a time.
