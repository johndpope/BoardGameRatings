			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dunno Dice is an incremental game about rolling dice. The result of the rolling determines how much gold, experience and blue points you earn in the current turn. Gold is used to purchase additional dice or improvements for your existing ones. Experience give you perks, such as additional gold when rolling specific combinations. And blue points are used to earn additional turns to the basic 10 per game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to earn one million gold in one turn. Once you have consumed all the available turns, the game ends and you start anew, keeping some of the perks and bonus you've earned in previous attempts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not an idle game because nothing happens when you are not actively playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
