			<description>Each turn the player draws a card from the supply deck and moves one space. If he announces he has a pair or more, he is entitled to Bonus Moves. You may bluff announcing a pair, three of a kind or four of a kind. The other players may challenge and if the bluffer has the cards he make make the bonus moves and the challenger moves back 4 spaces. If the player is bluffing and doesn't have the cards, he moves back 4 spaces. In addition there are instruction cards that move all ships ahead and penalty instruction cards that move the player backwards. In addition there is a cardboard torpedo which can be fired to move ahead. The winner is the first player to cross the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
