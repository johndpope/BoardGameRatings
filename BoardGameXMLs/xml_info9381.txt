			<description>1996 card game of futuristic mecha battles in the 21st century. Anime-style art credited to &amp;quot;Dolphin Meat&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Hunger&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Bud&amp;quot;, Scott Roberts and &amp;quot;Sledgehammer&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 2 9&amp;quot;x11&amp;quot;, double-sided, loose pages. (The first has the rules. The second has appendices containing a list of all Frames and Systems, pre-designed Frames, sample missions, and templates for use designing new Frame cards.) 108 rectangular (non-rounded edge, non-laminated) cards, divided into 12 double-sided Frame cards, 36 System cards, 12 Terrain cards, and 48 Action cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: Player take on the roles of mecha pilots and divide themselves into two teams. They design their mecha with Frame and System cards, and then arrange terrain cards in a line to form the field of battle. Each turn, players exchange movement and fire until the designated end-game is reached. Different scenarios have different victory conditions, from destroying the opposing frames to devastating the Terrain cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expansions were promised, but to my knowledge were never released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
