							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Bomberman</name>
									
			<description>Super Bomberman is the first video game in the Bomberman series to appear on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is also the first 4-player game that was released on the SNES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic gameplay involved in Super Bomberman is relatively simple. The game takes place on a single non-scrolling screen. The screen shows the top down view of a 7x6 grid. The grid restricts the movement of characters so they can only move horizontally or vertically around the screen. Pressing the 'A' button will make your Bomberman drop a bomb at his feet. This bomb will pulse for a few seconds (allowing you time to run away) and then explode, shooting flames horizontally and vertically. The game revolves around the idea of using these bomb blasts to destroy walls and enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Super Bomberman , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
