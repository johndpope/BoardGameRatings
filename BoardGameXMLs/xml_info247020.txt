			<description>A dexterity game for any number of persons - engrossing, dynamic and entertaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ball is placed in the hollow provided in the launching pad. The pad is then slightly pressed down and released suddenly. If the ball passes through a hole in the turret and falls through it, the number of points won is that marked on the hole plus that marked on the hollow in the field the ball comes to rest in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players can either agree on a certain number of rounds or on a certain figure to be reached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
