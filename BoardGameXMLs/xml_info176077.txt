			<description>A simple colour matching game with spinner-based play by Orchard Toys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a field board with six coloured spots on it.  Players then take it in turns to spin.  If a colour matching a spot on their board comes up, they take a sheep stand-up wearing that colour and place it on the appropriate spot on their board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who fills their board with six sheep first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a wildcard spot on the spinner, allowing players to choose the colour themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Can you be the first to collect all of your sheep?&lt;br/&gt;Gather your flock in this fun colour matching game for young players!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
