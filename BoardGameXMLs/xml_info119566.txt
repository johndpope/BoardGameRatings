							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Feats Volume I</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a collection of feats culled from the Races of Evernor series, including feats from the soon-to-be released Races of Evernor, Part III. In addition to these, several brand-new feats were added for flavor and variety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since many of the feats were originally designed specifically for the races found in Races of Evernor, Parts I-III, this collection of feats has been re-edited so that the unique abilities of those races can be more accessible to almost any character. Most can now be used by almost in race in virtually any campaign! That said, a few feats are still better suited for unusual PCs or world settings (monstrous PCs, aquatic campaigns, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feats Volume I contains nearly 90 feats and is the perfect product for DMs and players who want a wider variety of special abilities for their campaigns or characters. It is also a boon for those not necessarily interested in new PC races that want access to many of the feats in the RoE series of supplements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
