			<description>The setting is the world following the end of the nuclear winter scenario from the first Midwinter game. Players take on the role of Atlantic Federation's covert operative working to liberate a chain of tropical Slave Isles from the oppressive Saharan Empire, who run the African continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The missions are generally open-ended, allowing the player to approach them in whatever fashion is desired. Each island has different objectives (sabotage, assassinations, etc.), and the order in which these are tackled is up to the player. The game attempts to create a detailed open world by providing a number of different characters and different vehicles that the player can interact with. Vehicles include land, air, and sea vessels (players can hijack any enemy-operated vehicle), although all of them control in more or less the same basic manner. The graphics are relatively rudimentary 3D, although typical for the time period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Flames of Freedom&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
