			<description>This game consists of two sub-games. In the first game players take the role of journalists and try to get to the sat-van as quick as possible in order to upload the three pictures they have to capture in this game. The pictures are all Berlin-buildings or sites and have a UFO sighting on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Malefiz kind of adaptation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second part the game,  journalists try to get the cover-story before the other players can by running up the stairs of the publisher trying to beat the others to his office.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
