							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Invasion: Sicily</name>
									
			<description>The Allied invasion of Axis-held Sicily, called Operation Husky, 10 July 1943 - 17 August 1943, was one of the greatest seaborne invasions of World War II.  This game allows players to re-enact the invasion.This was the third game in the Rand Command Series, Volume 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a small (17&amp;quot;x16&amp;quot;) map and 72 unit counters representing armor, infantry, mech, parachute, glider and ranger/commando units, varying in size from battalion to brigade. Airpower and naval gunfire are handled abstractly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three scenarios: historical, free setup using historical units, and variable historical occurrences. Short rules and a low unit count make the game move quickly, but it can last up to 25 turns.  The rules include optional rules and several scenarios (including a couple of &amp;quot;What Ifs&amp;quot;), and an historical commentary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Allies have more units and the ability to make sea invasions, but they also have the burden of attack. The Axis need to make wise use of the difficult terrain to delay the Allied advance.  Points are awarded to players based on objectives either captured or held... the player amassing the highest number of points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
