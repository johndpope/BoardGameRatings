			<description>A Goose-type game, published in a book called More Games, Puzzles and Pastimes, published by Odhams Press in 1959.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules:&lt;br/&gt;This game is for two players, each with a differently coloured counter or button. Each player throws the dice in turn, starting on the arrow from London, and moving forward the number of spaces thrown on the dice. If you alight on a green space you move forward as indicated, on a red space you pay the penalty shown. The first to reach HOME wins, but you must throw the exact number. The method of transport changes along the route, as seen at the side of the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
