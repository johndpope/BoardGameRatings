			<description>Zehnkampf (=Decathlon) is a dice game with very short rules. All 10 Decathlon events are decided by simple dice rolls, but the rules for the running events are a little more confusing and require some work in order to understand them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the 10 events are scored just like a real Decathlon. The result of this is, that some events have bigger point ranges than others, so it would be better to make an extra effort in these events... but since it's a simple dice game, there is no room to make extra efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
