			<description>Promotional game published for promoting the International Harvest company, who made agricultural vehicles and machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You compete against other farmers and aim to be the first one to harvest your crop. You can chose either wheat, hay, cotton, or corn to plant (what you choose makes no difference to your tactics or ambitions).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You throw dice to move up your section of the board. At intervals there are white boxes. This is where you must change your implement before moving past the white boxes. Again, it doesn't affect your tactics about which implement to use next, you must use all of them at some stage if you want to win the game. First to do just that, wins. At times you will be instructed to draw a 'Whoa' card. As usual, this will perhaps help you or hinder you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was distributed by International Harvester dealers. The playing board is made of vinyl and folds up easily to fit in the box. The game consists of 2 small dice, Whoa cards and Implement cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
