			<description>Battle UP is a game of two halves. First, you build up your hand of cards, each card adding to your ability to defeat the other players in the combat that follows. Then, after a round of bidding and wagering on how likely you are to win, you use your cards to fight with the other players, attempting to reduce their health to zero while keeping yours. At the end of the round, the winner takes all of the tokens, and another round begins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
