			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are Portia Forthwright, an inventor with a dream&amp;mdash;to build the world&amp;rsquo;s first steam-powered bicycle. Grapple with adversity and time to advance along the technology tree, but if you succumb to despair, your dream will be lost to the scrap heap of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a solitaire game about invention in a steam-punk universe. The game uses play with a traditional 52-card deck to manipulate four elements (inspiration, willpower, materials, and technology) around clock faces. When two or more of these elements are in-sync, advancement is possible. However, Portia has periods of time when her work always suffers, and work within those hours causes a regression. Regress often enough and despair sets in. Advance to the top of the technology tree, and you have invented Portia Forthwright&amp;rsquo;s Celebrated Steam Driven Velocipede.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
