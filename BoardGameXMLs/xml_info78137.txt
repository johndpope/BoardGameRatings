			<description>From the back of the game case&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a world where mythology and technology are one, a young rebel and his ragtag crew of friends are unwittingly drawn into a holy war being waged by the bloodthirsty General Faulkner and his mercenary forces.  Guide the charismatic Bastion as he realizes his destiny to lead the rebellion against the Junaris Kingdom, and to save the people of his world from an eternity of oppression.  Lead powerful squadrons of robotic warriors into battle and take complete command of their actions.  Smite your foes with cleaving swords, piercing spears, and sizzling magic spells.  Use the terrain to your advantage and maneuver your forces into superior combat positions.  Witness the results of your tactical decisions in glorious 3D combat sequences.  With almost 60 missions and five unique endings, your social life will disappear without a trace, and the best part is...you won't care!  To battle, then!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
