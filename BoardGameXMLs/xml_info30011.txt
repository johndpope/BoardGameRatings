							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orbit, a Brain Game</name>
									
			<description>A simple trivia game.  Large cards with questions on one side and drawings on the other.  Each drawing is different and is a clue to the theme of the questions.  Answer a question on the card correctly and you can move forward and be asked the next question on the card.  You keep going until all questions on the card have been asked, but if you get a wrong answer you could move backward.  The first player around the board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
