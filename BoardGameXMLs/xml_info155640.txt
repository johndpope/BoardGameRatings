			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the times when you don&amp;rsquo;t know what your characters might find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsters, secret compartments, treasure and more await the brave adventurer within the Universal Adventures Search Deck.  Universal Adventures Search Deck is a set of fifty-four cards for use with any fantasy adventure game.  Each of the cards provides the result of a search of a dungeon area, such as a room, chamber or corridor.  If a character searches a dungeon area and you are not sure what they might find, draw a card from the Search deck and find out.  The cards range from encounters with monsters and traps, to treasure, weapons, armor, equipment, secret compartments and more.  Most of the cards list six possible results, adding even more variety to the outcome.  The Search cards can be used independently or in conjunction with other Universal Adventures products.  Use them in solo games or group games without a Game Master.  As a Game Master use them to fill in details for portions of your own adventures or in any other way you see fit.  With Universal Adventures products, you&amp;rsquo;ll always have the tools to play your games, your way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
