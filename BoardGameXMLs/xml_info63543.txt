			<description>From publisher website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Horus Heresy board game, the most legendary battle in the history of the Warhammer 40,000 universe unfolds across the razed plains of Terra and in the frozen orbit above. Deadly fighting ranges from the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s golden Inner Palace to Horus&amp;rsquo;s flagship, the Vengeful Spirit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking the side of traitor or loyalist, two players control either fearless Space Marine legions or deviant Chaos Space Marines, mighty Titans, Imperial Armies both loyal and traitorous, and a fearsome array of other units, including the Emperor and Horus themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An innovative order and initiative system forces each side to carefully consider the commands they issue to their troops. A dramatic, card-driven combat system incorporates escalating damage, gives players the opportunity to allocate resources between attack and defense, and brings to bear the unique special powers of each unit type, from fortification-destroying Titans to the perverse daemons of Chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This legendary tale of treachery and heroism is brought to vibrant life with over one hundred magnificent sculpted plastic playing pieces. The stunning three-dimensional map of Terra brilliantly portrays the landscape immediately surrounding the Imperial Palace, from the magma-filled crevasses to the fortifications that offer the Imperial player protection against both enemy assault and orbital bombardments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each one of these structures, as well as the Imperial Palace itself, have been expertly sculpted, and rise above the landscape to create a truly immersive experience. The fortifications of Terra have never looked more formidable! Once the board is set up with playing pieces and terrain for your first game, it will be a wonder to behold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horus Heresy includes six scenarios that differ in both difficulty and style. The first scenario, titled Brother Against Brother, is recommended for all new players as it provides predetermined starting locations for both player's forces. It is a well balanced version of the Battle for Terra, and also presents a roughly historical recreation of the conflict's events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horus Heresy is a board game that pits two players against each other to recreate the most famous battle of Warhammer 40,000&amp;rsquo;s rich history, in which the Warmaster Horus&amp;rsquo;s betrayal of the Emperor comes to its climax. Taking the side of either traitor or loyalist, players control a fearsome array of units, including the Emperor and Horus themselves. Brother fights brother, and the universe hangs in the balance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not to be confused with Horus Heresy (1993), the original 1993 Games Workshop game of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
