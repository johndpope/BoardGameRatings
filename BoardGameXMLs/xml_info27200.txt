							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fiabe e Pedali</name>
									
			<description>One of several games released in Italy by Corriere dei Piccoli . Fiabe e Pedali (released in June 1962) is considered the weirdest of them. This game is translated as &amp;ldquo;Fables and Pedals&amp;rdquo;. The rules start with: &amp;ldquo;Since France is the country of fables, we have thought of a game that unites sport to the fascination of fables&amp;rdquo;. Like many cycling games this one is also based on the famous Tour de France, it featured simplistic role and move mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
