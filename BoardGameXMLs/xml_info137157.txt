							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scene It? Harry Potter Second Edition Deluxe</name>
									
			<description>The Scene It? family of games are popular-culture trivia games built primarily around viewing video-clips. Players roll the dice, move around the board, and answer trivia about anything from television, sports, or movie slogans to popular music and the romantic lives of celebrities. Two categories, however, allow you to watch questions presented on a DVD. Some questions have everyone racing to fill in the blanks. Other questions let players watch a movie or TV clip, then answer questions about the clip, the movie or show, or the actors/directors involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Harry Potter versions of Scene It! feature film clips, puzzlers, and questions based on the Harry Potter movies. Player test their knowledge of this world-famous book and movie series, and challenge each other to see how much they really know about Quidditch, Transfiguration, or the Dark Arts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher: &amp;ldquo;Fun for wizards and muggles! You don't have to be a Fifth Year at Hogwarts to do well at Scene It?: Harry Potter. On-screen challenges test your powers of observation, word play and puzzle-solving skills, so even if you don't know the first thing about how to brew a Polyjuice Potion, you'll still have a great time playing Scene It?: Harry Potter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Deluxe 2nd edition of Scene It!: Harry Potter includes new movie clips and puzzlers from the first five movies about &amp;ldquo;The Boy Who Lived,&amp;rdquo; new Question Cards, two new Tokens, and a set of 4 exclusive Harry Potter Trading Cards. Packaged in a Collectible Tin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
