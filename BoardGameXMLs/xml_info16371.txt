			<description>One year after releasing the highly-regarded game and art object Die HolzerSiebeN by Friedensreich Hundertwasser, Kosmos is releasing another art game, this time with James Rizzi - albeit in a much lower price category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game idea, invented by Reiner Knizia, is very simple but tense. The 28 large Rizzi art cards have values between 0 and 6; each of the two players receives twelve. On a player's turn, they must discard a card from their hand. To discard, a player must either create a new discard pile or place the card on an existing discard pile - but in that case, the value of the card must be exactly one higher than the card onto which it is to be placed. If there are already three discard piles on the table, then a player has no choice but to discard to one of the piles. If he can't, then he has lost the round and receives as many glass beads as cards left in his hand. The first player to get six glass beads is the loser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;James Rizzi is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As of 2006 -- It appears that this game may never have been published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
