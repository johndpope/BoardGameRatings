							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Magic Wear III</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We dug into the back of our magic wardrobe and found 50 new articles of apparel for use with d20 fantasy settings. Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sample:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robe of Elemental Summoning (fire)&lt;br/&gt;The wearer of this robe can cast resist elements (fire) upon themselves three times per day (as described in the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Player's Handbook, Third Edition). This spell makes the robe appear as though it were made of fire. The robe is adorned with six images of fire elementals. Once per day the wearer can use the robe to summon a medium size fire elemental. This ability functions similar to a monster summoning V spell (as described in the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Player's Handbook, Third Edition). Each time this spell is used one of the images on the robe will vanish. Once the last image vanishes the robe loses its abilities and becomes worthless. Both spells function as though cast at 10th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
