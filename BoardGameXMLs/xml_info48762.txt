							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Companion Jorune: Burdoth</name>
									
			<description>From the cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is your companion to the realm of Burdoth. It contains timelines, detailed&lt;br/&gt;histories, and maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;READY FOR SOME GAMING?&lt;br/&gt;Why not start your group in southern Glounda, searching for crystal dust. If your players survive the croid, let them pick up a pibber pet in Sutor, and then on to Glounda, where those darling pets will end up on a plate if your players aren't careful. Sail up the Lusail river to Lus'ikai for some Sarla wine-tasting. Take the shortcut to Lelligire in the rainy season - when you arrive you may find your clothes a bit worn, but in this fabric capital you can buy the best. Make an appearance in Sydra sporting your new Lelligirian duds - the players are sure to be noticed, but not necessarily admired. After a dichandra hunt with the Thiven in the Cushindell marshes, take your players home through the Gauss valley; they can see the rebuilding of Khaun Gauss and the ruins of Ninindrue. After a rest in Ardoth, your players will be ready for more exploring - the entire realm of Heridoth still awaits them, yet they have barely begun to explore Burdoth, their home realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
