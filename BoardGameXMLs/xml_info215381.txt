							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Andoria</name>
									
			<description>A unique take on both the card combat genre of games like Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone, and deck building games like Dominion and Legendary, Andoria is a fast paced game of tactics and diplomacy for 2- 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to gain the most &amp;ldquo;Power&amp;rdquo; by doing the most damage to enemy player's Kingdoms - but they're not going to make it easy. You will have to strategically use Gold to buy different Tactics, Equipment, and Battlefield cards from a shared center Row to fit your play style and adapt to your opponents, recruit Units to aide your chosen Hero that you&amp;rsquo;ll level up over the course of the game, strategically block, attack, move between Zones, use Abilities, and most importantly decide not just how and which of these to do, but the order in which to do them with our dynamic Round System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
