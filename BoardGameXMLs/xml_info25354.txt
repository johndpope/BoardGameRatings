			<description>Your rocket ship is a time machine made by Professor Smarty, the world's greatest scientist.  He wants you to journey back to the age of dinosaurs to catch the best ones for his new zoo - the DinoZoo.  If you do, he will make you Head DinoZookeeper.  You get points by catching dinosaurs and getting bonus chips.  The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
