			<description>Hey, it is my third game. I am 15 years old and live in Moscow/Russia. Ok, now about game. In this game you can control 25! types of business. Each business gives you income. When you start business, income increases and you receive more money per second. Also you can buy upgrades. When you will have enough money, you can hire managers, who will run your businesses automatically. Each type of business has it&amp;rsquo;s own business run time. When you will have a lot of money, you can reset the game and buy some bonuses on credits. Also you can level up in this game. This game also has other features. I think that is all. And sorry 4 my bad English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
