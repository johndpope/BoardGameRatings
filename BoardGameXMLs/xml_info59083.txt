							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Poopsock! The MMORPG Addict Card Game</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;    This game has been unpublished as of 2012 pending a complete overhaul and some quality control. It will be back, I promise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-In a nutshell-&lt;br/&gt;Not for the easily-offended, Poopsock! Is a simple satirical card game in which a group of MMORPG addicts are playing their newest game of choice tirelessly to be the first to Maximum Level. Every round represents a night in which the players play the game and otherwise hassle each other to gain the most Levels. Whoever gets to the predetermined goal Level (typically between 50-70 to start) is the winner and may gloat until physically assaulted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poopsock! focuses on humor, while presenting a somewhat abstract resource management game which is great to play with friends. You can combine more than one set to accomodate more than 5 players and expansions are on the way soon. If you or anyone you know has ever played World of Warcraft, EverQuest, Final Fantasy Online, or any other MMORPG, then Poopsock! is going to be a hit with your group!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poopsock &amp;ndash; 1. (n) A vital part of any dedicated [MMORPG] player's equipment. A poopsock eliminates the need to go all the way to the bathroom, which wastes valuable leveling time.&lt;br/&gt;2. (v) To obsessively and excessively play a game, usually an MMORPG, usually for hours on end and to the exclusion of all other concerns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poopsocker &amp;ndash; 1. (n) In reference to players of MMORPG's that instead of taking a break to go to the bathroom, they take off their sock, defecate in it, and throw it aside for later disposal. Refers to someone who stays up all day and all night to play an MMORPG.&lt;br/&gt;Source: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.urbandictionary.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
