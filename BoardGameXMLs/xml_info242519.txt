			<description>Memorize your spellbook or strap on your longsword - it's time to Battle In: The Dungeon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab up to three friends (or play solo!), pick a hero and jump into the fray.  Enter a room, battle monsters of all types - skeletons, goblins and bears, oh my! (and dozens more) - and leverage your hero's skills to survive.  Loot your foes and move on to the next room.  If you can make it through seven rooms you're pretty good; if you can make it through ten rooms you can call yourself an epic hero, worthy of bards tales from here until the end of time.  But be warned - sometimes the best laid plans fall apart once you set foot in the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics of the game are easy.  Flip over a room card which gives you bonuses/penalties/adjustments.  Deal out monster cards (the same number as the number of heroes who entered the dungeon).  Order them by their Initiative score.  Then fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fighting is dead simple - if you can do basic math you can play.  Take your hero's attack value, roll a 20-sided die (included) and add them together.  Subtract the monster's defense value and if what's left is more than 10 it's a hit.  Subtract your hero's damage from the monster's hit points (represented by cubes) then move to the next hero or monster in line.  Once you get to the end you start again until either all the heroes or all the monsters are defeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But don't let that fool you - this isn't a &amp;quot;beat level 1 monsters, then move to level 2&amp;quot; kind of dungeon.  Sure, you might find a lowly kobold in the first room, but you might also find a brown bear.  Or a zombie.  Or a dragon.  Because let's face it - knowing what you're going to find is just plain boring.  And there's nothing boring when when there's a Battle In: The Dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
