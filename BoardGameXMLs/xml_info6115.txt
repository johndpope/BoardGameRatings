							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">I Ching la voie du Ta Tchouan</name>
									
			<description>The way of the Ta tchouan (named I CHING in France) gather two players in the same goal : drawing a path through the board with identical square pawns (named Quarks) in order to reach the opposite edge with their color own, black or white, yin or yang... Each quark is composed by an equal part of the way for the two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the &amp;quot;Book of Changes&amp;quot; like the Go does, this connection game provided a wide panel of strategy with only two simple rules : &lt;br/&gt;- INFLUENCE : you can't play around the last Quark played&lt;br/&gt;- OPPOSITION : you can't break the paths, instead, you should build at least one of them by playing adjacent Quarks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initially build for a 6x6 pawn game, the cards provided in the Ta Tchouan box allow you to play on a 7x7, and it's not physically bound except by the time you need to play on an infinite x infinite board !!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
