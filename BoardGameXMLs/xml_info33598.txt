			<description>Small game, published on Tactics magazine in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;Though it is really a small magazine game, this game covers all aspects of galactic warfare.&lt;br/&gt;The key point is that at the start every power has really very limited capacity.  Because of this reason, the small map is really big enough for expanding, and even the regular capacity for other game is really a special ability.&lt;br/&gt;Very clever design.&lt;br/&gt;But unfortunately even in Japan this game is neglected, because this game is attached with not the boardgame issue but with the RPG issue.&lt;br/&gt;If you found this in the auction and you love sci-fi boardgames, please take it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
