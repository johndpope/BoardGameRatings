							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Empires of Steam</name>
									
			<description>A revolution of industry is in full swing.  Everywhere you look, people and animal power are being replaced by steam-powered machines.  Steam rises from every street corner, filling the city with noise and commotion.  It is the industrial revolution at the height of Victorian England.  A new technology called the link is on the rise and you want to profit from it.  The link makes it possible to live in the sky.  People are clamoring for the chance to visit or live high overhead.  You decide to sink all you have into the venture.  It is all or nothing.  Empires of steam documents the rise of your empire as it grows on water, land and in the great expanse overhead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start with 5 coin cards.  With each turn, add additional cards thru maneuvers and purchases.  Build your deck to gain more maneuvering and purchasing power.  But wait, the point of the game is not to build your deck, rather its to build your empire.  Grown your empire by placing cards into your empire, but once they are in your empire, they can no longer be used to grow your deck.  Find the right balance to beat your opponents.  Many cards in your empire have a population associated with it.  In the end, the winner is the player with the most population in their empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just be careful, because as you are focusing on your deck and empire, another may be ready to attack with the saboteur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a deck building, card placing game of strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
