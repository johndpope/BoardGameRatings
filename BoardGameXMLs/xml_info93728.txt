			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ninja. These shadow warriors fonn some of the most iconic images of the stealthy hero. Their skill is literally the stuff of legends and their origins are shrouded in mystery. It's no secret that the ninja has captured the imagination of the West for decades now, and that of Japan for centuries before. It may then come as no surprise that when we first started discussing a book devoted to stealthy characters, we decided to produce a book dedicated entirely to these mysterious and celebrated figures. While it is true that ninja have a long history with roleplaying games, dnd indeed the 3.5 OGL has seen several different imaginings of the ninja, never before have they been presented as they are here in Ancient Warriors: Way of the Ninja.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
