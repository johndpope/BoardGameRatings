			<description>This children's game has the players playing the role of &amp;quot;travelers&amp;quot; through Bibleland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a pawn which is in the shape of a plastic dinosaur toy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take turns flipping over the top card of the deck.  The player moves their dinosaur to the next space with that color. If the dinosaur lands on special spaces (rainbow, Noah's ark, etc) called &amp;quot;gifts&amp;quot; they take a special card depicting that &amp;quot;gift&amp;quot; from the pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who is first to go around the track back to the start OR collect all 5 of the prizes is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Bibleland is a fun educational board game for children ages three and up.
