							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arnold Takes Command: The Battle of Bemis Heights</name>
									
			<description>Arnold Takes Command is a new kind of card-driven wargame for two players, ages 12 to 99. Unlike most of its siblings, in this game movement plays an insignificant role. Additionally, prior experience with traditional wargames isn&amp;rsquo;t required. ATC isn&amp;rsquo;t a dice-rolling slugfest or a &amp;ldquo;take that&amp;rdquo; affair. Here, it&amp;rsquo;s all about the card play: what to play, when to play it, what to discard, what to track, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has two distinct phases, just like the actual battle. Players use action cards of various types to attack, defend, gain initiative, maneuver, emulate morale, take cover, use &amp;ldquo;fog of war&amp;rdquo; to their advantage, and so forth. Single &amp;ldquo;duds&amp;rdquo; are discarded, but pairs have a useful purpose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A preponderance of &amp;ldquo;split&amp;rdquo; action cards ensures a nice variance from game to game. Components include 70+ cards and two maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
