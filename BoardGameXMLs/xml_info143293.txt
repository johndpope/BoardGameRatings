			<description>This is a different sort of trick-taking cardgame, playable with a regular deck of cards (part of the deck).  Part of the inspiration for the game is the concept of free will vs determinism, and the verses in the Bible texts of Romans 8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, the game is for two players only.  Second, one player knows what all the cards are that are dealt and decides which hands are to be given to each player, stacks their hand and always leads with their hand.  The other player ends up picking trump suit, without fully knowing what all the cards are in (unlike the player who stacked their hand).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included with the game is a variant that adds bidding, with each player bidding differently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
