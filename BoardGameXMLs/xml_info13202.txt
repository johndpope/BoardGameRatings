			<description>The Stripey Hole is a board game about a prison escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the players are prisoners attempting to leave the prison, either by serving out their sentence, or escaping. Prisoners will move around the prison, collecting objects which they can combine with other objects which allow them to attempt escape, either by fooling the guards, bribing the guards, or even tunneling out of the prison, or sneaking out the air ducts. The first prisoner to leave the prison by any means is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
