			<description>Get the Gummies is the simple, yet strategic, trick-taking card game in which you try to score as many points as possible by grabbing all the adorable gummy bears you can get your hands on, while sabotaging the progress of your opponents!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How To Play&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the deck. Deal each player 10 cards. Set the remaining cards aside. The player to the dealer's left has first turn and begins the hand's first trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each trick consists of every player placing 1 card into the center of the playing surface, in clockwise order. The first card played determines the trick's dominant color. The next cards played must be the same color, unless a player doesn't have one (in which case any card must be used). The player with the largest gummy bear of the dominant color takes the trick. Players score 1 point for every card taken, as well as bonus and penalty points listed on special cards. The trick taker choses the first card to play for the next trick. Special cards may not be played first in a trick. If a player beginning a trick has only a special card left to play, the trick is void and he or she is assessed a -5 point penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all tricks for the hand have been played, the points scored by each player should be tallied and recorded on paper. Several hands are to be played to allow points to accumulate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to score 100 points, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
