							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cherche</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cherche are a brotherhood of adventurous, law-bending, adrenaline-addicted vampires. Dedicating their undead lives to a Coven, Cherche are often found in small packs running the streets and causing problems. Deciding the Blood Laws are open to interpretation, Cherche are often a plague on the streets within their territories, walking a fine line between keeping the Blood Laws and violating them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When choosing from the mortal world, Cherche take first from those who lived in the limelight but fell too soon. Injured surfers, skaters, bikers, etc are first choice to become a Cherche given a new lease on life. It is through this life that each Coven parties the night away and enjoys their unlife to the fullest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With no real single Dark Gift, Cherche are the only one of the three modern Bloodlines to wield three Dark Gifts, although they are somewhat less powerful in contrast. Cherche are the vampires most summoned to a Great House and the first to start a war between the vampires of a territory and the Werewolves. Within the Midwest the Mahigan (werewolves) are at war with the Cherche and the war shows no signs of slowing down (as referenced in the City of Interest: Grand Rapids Sourcebook).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
