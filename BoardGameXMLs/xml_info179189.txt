							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cults and Cultists</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doomsday cults. Snake cults. Cthulhu cults. Cults devoted to aliens, musicians, or politicians. Even cults devoted to cargo gods. There are cults dedicated to just about anything you can think of. So why not include more of them in our roleplaying game sessions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No matter what flavor of cult you need, you can probably find one in our world or just about any world and genre you roleplay a character in. But sometimes you want something unique. That's where Insta-NPCs #9: Cults and Cultists comes in!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cults and Cultists includes ten separate tables for everything from determining the size of your cult and how long they've been around to what they're after, how isolated they are, their level of commitment, and more! It also includes five different example cults and four NPCs you can use right out of the box, plus a worksheet you can print any time you want to go through the process quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Brotherhood of the Spade and Bertram Greyne (Fantasy)&lt;br/&gt;    Sisterhood of the Long Summer and Malda Obret (Fantasy)&lt;br/&gt;    Confederacy of Five Points and Father Singh (Fantasy)&lt;br/&gt;    The Moreau Ideal and Sako Mashai (Modern/Cyberpunk)&lt;br/&gt;    and the Teeth of the Dragon (Fantasy)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plenty of ideas to start with before you even start rolling dice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
