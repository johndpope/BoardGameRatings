							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Knock The Clock</name>
									
			<description>The game comes with a deck of 25 cards (4 colors numbered 1-6 &amp;amp; a joker) plus a large comical plastic clock which serves as a timer and scoring device.  The full deck is only required for a full complement of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players are dealt 4 cards, except the player to the dealer's left who receives 5 (the 'captain').  The clock is wound and held until the deal is completed; the timer is then released.  Cards are passed to the left on the direction of the captain until one player has four-of-a-kind; this player places their cards on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as this happens, opponents do the same, regardless of cards held at the time.  This procedure mimics 'snap' and the player whose hand is on top also stops the clock timer and scores the amount indicated on the dial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When any one player reaches 25 points, the game is over.  The winner is the player with the lowest score at that time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
