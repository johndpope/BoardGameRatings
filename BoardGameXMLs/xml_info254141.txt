							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Relic</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Relic is a short, site based adventure that gained its inspiration from the 1997 movie also known as The Relic.  It is a supernatural horror film directed by Peter Hyams and it stars Penelope Ann Miller, Tom Sizemore and Linda Hunt. The movie itself is based on the novel of the same name by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure utilizes the creature featured in the movie (known there as a kothoga but here altered to kothoggo) and tries to recreate events and the sense of horror that occurred in the movie.  The setup is different however, and the ordeal that the players will have to go through is only designed to last for one session of adventuring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is ideally designed for four players who should be around 5th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
