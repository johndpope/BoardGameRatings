			<description>Pick up two of the face-down tin cans, shake each one. If the sounds are identical, you have a matching pair, keep it, and search for the next pair.&lt;br/&gt;The 12 pairs of tin cans have transparent covers, each pair contains different seeds of different size, weight (and color, though the latter does not play a big role here &amp;ndash; one could use it also as a standard memory game for hearing-impaired people, of course). Some similar sized seeds produce VERY similar sounds, so the game is not at all easy.&lt;br/&gt;The game box also contains a booklet explaining the different seeds in detail (it unfortunately does not explain the game rules, but then any one familiar with Memory games will not need any explanation).&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Horch&amp;quot; is kind of an old-fashioned German word for &amp;quot;Listen!&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
