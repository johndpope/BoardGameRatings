							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beware of the Spirits of the Woods</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you want strange, supernatural encounters that you can confront your players with when they travel through a forest? Something that is a tad more scary or spooky than an ambush of a pack of wolves or a raging owlbear? Beware of the Spirits of the Woods provides you with six such encounters. None of them should be used as a random encounter, as they are in no case something that may happen each and every day to a group of travelers. They are something  special, that perhaps happens once every couple of month (or even less often), or something that happens in a certain, cursed or hexed part of the woods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All creatures encountered are supernatural (pixies, sprites and spirits) and chaotic, magical beings. Clerical spells like Protection from Evil will affect them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
