			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Books regularly show up in dungeons, whether they're on the shelves of a vast library, locked in a secret compartment inside an old desk, or stuffed into the pack of that dead adventurer who was kinf enough to trigger all the traps so you didn't have to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GMs often struggle to come up with new and interesting ways to make books interesting, falling back on &amp;quot;it's just a book&amp;quot;. We aim to fix that. Trinkets - Books is intended to inject more detailed descriptions, variety and flavour into your RPG worlds. The tables you'll find inside this book are system-agnostic, but work most easily in a fantasy setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this download you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    tables for generating new and unique books that your players will treasure&lt;br/&gt;    more unusual types of written records from primitive carvings through to ornate and mysterious tomes&lt;br/&gt;    over 100 pre-built ideas for books ready to drop straight into your game&lt;br/&gt;    adventure hooks, NPCs, and new locations to help flesh out the books in your world&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
