							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vengeful Curses</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powerful Magic to Punish Those Who Wronged You&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In folklore and mythology, and often in more modern fantasy media, curses are powerful things, and not to be taken lightly, and there are few things that have as much potential to ruin your life than a witch or wizard who feels that you have wronged them in some way. In Pathfinder, however, curses often lack much bite to begin with, and are quickly dealt with by casting remove curse. What is it that makes the curses in the fairy tales so much more powerful than the curses you have access to in the game? There are many answers to that question, but one of them, is the power of vengeance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The eleven spells contained within this book are far more powerful&amp;mdash;and much harder to get rid of&amp;mdash;than most curses in the game. Inflict the target with an instant and all-but-incurable magical form of leprosy. Steal his ability to speak entirely. Have each harmful spell he casts turned back upon him (at a three-for-one ratio)! Fill him with an endless, insatiable hunger, or taint his seed, so that all of his progeny are horrifying demons. This magical power has a catch, however: each curse in the book functions only if the target performed some specific action to wrong you (or someone else), thus leaving themselves open to the curse&amp;rsquo;s power. What exactly it takes to be vulnerable to the curse varies from spell to spell: for some, simply casting a harmful spell, or attacking a flat-footed creature is enough. For others, the target might need to mock a god or religion, to be unfaithful to their lover, or to tell a lie. Whatever the crime, this book has a powerful curse dedicated to punishing those who performed it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
