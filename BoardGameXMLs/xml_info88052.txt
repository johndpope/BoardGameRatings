			<description>From the PDF introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author's Note: I'd like to thank Ralph Pierre Lamourt for his invaluable aid in constructing maps for Dragons of Faerun. Beyond providing masterful aid with specific maps, he also showed me how to make them myself, so for that I am tremendously grateful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragons of Faer√ªn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When books are written at Wizards of the Coast, there is usually material left &amp;quot;on the cutting room floor,&amp;quot; so to speak. Dragons of Faerun was a massive undertaking last summer, and there was plenty of extra material. This enhancement introduces you to two new monsters: The first is a new spawn of Tiamat; the second is a new template that can be applied to any dragon to make it even more dangerous in its own lair (and harmless elsewhere)--the hoarder dragon. Introduce these to your players right away, and watch them freak as the next dragon hoard attacks them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
