							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">Le Jeu Du Dictionnaire</name>
									
			<description>This game teaches French. Each player takes a turn by using a dictionary (2 are included in the game) to pick a word based on a card that the player has drawn from a card deck. He tells it out loud, without spelling it. Anyone who can spell the word correctly  wins extra points at the end of the round. The dictionary holder writes down the definition on his paper. Each player must then write the correct spelling of the word and a definition for the word.  Even if the player does not know the definition of the word, he must bluff one that will be the most believable.  All sheets are then turned over to the dictionary holder so that he can number them and mix them up. Then he will read each definition out loud. He is allowed to repeat them up to 3 times.  Then everyone votes for the definition they think is the right one!  Points are given for getting the right spelling of the word, and for every vote each player got etc. The first player to reach 40 points  is declared the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
