							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Blood War of Saxon</name>
									
			<description>from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This is a short solo for Tunnels and Trolls. It is suitable for Level 1 to 3 characters with no more than 20 adds. There is no magic matrix, so spellcasters will have to adjudicate the effects of spells for themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the fertile pastures of the southern realm lies the torn village of Saxon. For generations two families, the Slavin and the Furriers have been at great debate over the ownership of a singular field. Ordinarily this would not lead to such a drawn out feud but, as the only place that a rare and valuable herb grows, there is much to be gained from staking a claim here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
