			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LarpJam is a workshop to create larps using a collaborative process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like a reality TV cooking show for larp design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players work in small groups, cooking up original larps under tight time limits. Each group is given a couple of secret ingredients to inspire and challenge their creative process. Then, groups trade larps and continue cooking away on a different &amp;quot;dish&amp;quot; than they started with! In a few hours players write three different playable larps, and everyone had a hand in designing each one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players in LarpJam learn about larp design by doing it, and they will often surprise themselves with the quality of what they create. Anyone who is interested in roleplaying games is entirely qualified to play LarpJam, including people who have never larped. This workshop works for precisely the same reasons that larp works: a group of people collaborating and improvising together creates something bigger than any one person can produce alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
