			<description>Promotional game for Commerzbank in Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game title means Business Plan as players are asked to give their plans to the bank who will then give them a loan and, hopefully, the players will make a profit before the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a simple roll and move game. However there is some choice because each player has two pawns and may move both by splitting the dice roll; i.e. You roll a 5 and a 2, one pawn may move 5 and the other 2 or vice versa. The board squares feature many actions that may be taken or investment opportunities that may be taken up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends at the end of a round when a pre-determined time has run out. The player with the most money, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
