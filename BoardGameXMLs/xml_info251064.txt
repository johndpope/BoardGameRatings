			<description>Innkeeper Brewers is a quick 2-player game where players are two opposing Inn landlords, racing to be the best inn-keepers in the village by providing the villagers with beer as quickly as possible, and have the nicest Inn in the village too, by upgrading it with fancy nick-nacks.  Harvest barley, brew it into beer, sell that beer to villagers, then invest your well-earned money for Victory Points (VPs), and/or buy Inn upgrades to improve your Inn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you move your pawn along its assigned row/column of a 4x4 action grid, to activate the action on the card in the grid that is the cross-reference of your pawn and your opponent's pawn.  Wherever you move to on your turn will influence which actions your opponent has available on their next turn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actions include gaining barley, brewing barley into beer, selling beer to the villagers at various sale rates, exchanging money for VPs, or spending money on upgrades for your Inn.  Inn Upgrades provide the player with special unique powers they can then use for the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends once one player reaches 20 VPs, or all the Inn upgrade cards are bought; the other player takes a final turn, then the player with the most VPs is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
