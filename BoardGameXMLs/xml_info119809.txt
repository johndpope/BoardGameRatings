			<description>An educational game about the WTO and how global economy is working. The two ressources chosen here as examples are cotton and coffee. The players play different countries (Vietnam / Kamerun / USA / EU)with different starting conditions. They invest money (&amp;quot;oro&amp;quot;) into their own economic engine (and organize their domestic economy) and buy and sell the products on the global market. After two rounds (each containing 5 phases), there is a &amp;quot;minister`s  conference&amp;quot;, where players discuss and negotiate about different game rules, that will be valid until the next conference.&lt;br/&gt;There are also event cards and negative reactions of the people like &amp;quot;strike&amp;quot;, when the domestic economy is not organized well.&lt;br/&gt;Winner of the game is NOT the one with the most money in absolute terms, but who has best developed his country relatively to the starting conditions.&lt;br/&gt;The game was designed by a young woman as her &amp;quot;high school diploma / exam thesis&amp;quot; in Switzerland and was further developed and published by the &amp;quot;EvB&amp;quot; (Erkl&amp;auml;rung von Bern / Bern Declaration) and distributed by Murmel Spielwerkstatt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
