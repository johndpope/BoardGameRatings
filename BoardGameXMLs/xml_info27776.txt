			<description>A game in the same vein as 'Mad Libs':&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A chosen player becomes the narrator, who reads the 'crime story'. When the narrator comes to a blank in the text, the active player (which may include the narrator) draws a card from the deck and quickly reads it aloud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards contain words which tend toward absurdist relationships with the rest of the text of the story. Some of the cards are worth points to the player who drew them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also features 30 blank cards, for you to supply the names of friends, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the most points (which were gained from random card draw). The game is therefore entirely random as presented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
