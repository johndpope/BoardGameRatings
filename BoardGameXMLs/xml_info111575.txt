							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Treasure of Tannis</name>
									
			<description>From the website&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Tannis. Its very name suggests a world before this one, artifacts of untold power and perilous, cunning challenges awaiting all who would dare seek vaults closed by the Angels themselves. This lost city has been known for Ages, haunting the dreams and the myth-memories of Men, calling them to perish in a vain search for its fabled artifacts. Now, however, the lost city has been found, and the King himself has given you the key to its treasure vaults. Can you cross the burning desert and find the city? Will you survive the perils lurking within the city? Are you worthy of the lost treasures of Tannis?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
