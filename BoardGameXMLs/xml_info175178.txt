			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've got to beat the best &amp;mdash; and that means taking to the many different autodueling arenas across the Car Wars world and testing yourself under all kinds of conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Car Wars Arenas gives hardcore autoduelists more exciting locations to showcase their skills and blow away their opponents. The boxed set contains five one-sided 22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; arena maps and a booklet detailing the special features of each arena. The rules will also cover revised versions of popular variants like corporate team dueling, an AADA pro circuit, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arena designs in Car Wars Arenas have appeared in various Car Wars supplements (including the Car Wars Arena Book and The AADA Duel Circuit: L'Outrance), but only as scaled-down maps. In this set, they come out of the box ready to play in full Car Wars Classic scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
