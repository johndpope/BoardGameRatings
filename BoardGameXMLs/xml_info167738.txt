			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just a peaceful zombie enjoying a nice day in the woods. And humans have to come along and spoil your day by putting a pitchfork through you. After climbing out of the grave they put you in, you are just trying to get away from the humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time things right for a more powerful launch. Then jump on rats, avoid humans and their weapons, gather coins, jump to avoid obstacles, avoid bats, and avoid pits. Once your play ends head to the shop to buy upgrades to improve your chances next play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
