			<description>In Polarity Magnetic Game, players are supposed to use the magnetic opposites to hold their structure together - only they can't see them so they don't know which sides will stick! Polarity Magnetic Game is a unique playing experience, where kids learn how magnetism works by trying to stick the 2-colored magnetic blocks together to build towers. But, since the Force Field shifts with each piece added, kids never know which pieces will stick! The challenging Polarity Magnetic Game will keep kids guessing as they keep building! Game includes 48 magnets in 24 MindBlocks. For 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
