							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trucks, Trains, Boats and Planes game</name>
									
			<description>A pursuit type game similar to Candyland for little boys produced in 1963.  Game was released with 3 other children's games by the publisher in the hopes of volumes of sales and profit in the children's game market in an eleventh hour effort to stave off bankruptcy.  The 4 games released were not good sellers and in late 1963 the company went bankrupt, only to reappear in 1964 under new management and the company prospered in the market.  Game uses a wooden die with faces of six different colors, a roll of the die shows the color space that the moving player advances to.  Some spaces call for a return to the beginning or a move backward.  The first player to the end of the track wins.  The board is marked with the themes of transportation by, well, trucks, trains, boats and planes!  The youngest player moves first, and the game can be played solitaire where the player tries to move the length of the track within an alloted number of rolls of the die.  Game stock number was 101 and original 1963 price was $.98  A similar pursuit game for little girls was called The Doll House game, and the two other 1963 children's titles were Imagination and What Time Is It?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
