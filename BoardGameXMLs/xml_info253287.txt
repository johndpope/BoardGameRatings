							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lethal Lairs: White Dragon</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s stop thinking of monsters as Hit Point pi&amp;ntilde;ata that drop loot. Lethal Lairs looks at the intellect and capabilities of various classic monsters and uses those abilities to create a lair for a world where self entitled sword and spell wielding psychopaths might bust in and try to kill you.&lt;br/&gt;These encounters can be plugged directly into any Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons style of game with little to no modification because the real value of the Lethal Lairs series is in concepts and ideas, not as a fully written module. They can be plugged directly into adventures to replace or enliven other set encounters, or used as the basis for a full adventure with the Lair being the final encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you get&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    9 page full colour PDF (cover, credits, introduction, map and 5 pages of additional content).&lt;br/&gt;    Detailed breakdown of the dangers within the lair and how to play them out.&lt;br/&gt;    List of additional cunning ploys and tricks which can be used to befuddle the party.&lt;br/&gt;    Battle Tactics - explaining how the creature uses their lair to best effect and how they will handle the invasion by the PCs.&lt;br/&gt;    Sample Encounter - using the D&amp;amp;D Rules Cyclopedia to present a fully formed encounter as an example of how the lair might be used.&lt;br/&gt;    Full colour map of the lair with key points marked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the Sample Encounter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each product includes a sample encounter based on the D&amp;amp;D Rules Cyclopedia aka Classic D&amp;amp;D. This includes a fully generated monster encounter complete with randomly determined treasure and detailed statistics block. Adjusting this encounter for other versions of D&amp;amp;D simply requires opening up the applicable monster book and redoing the stat block. The Introduction also explains how to convert applicable saving throws between 5th Edition and earlier editions of D&amp;amp;D. Remember, the mechanics of the lair is the key component of this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
