							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Horse: The Salty Troll</name>
									
			<description>The Salty Troll is the name of a store that deals in many different goods, but most importantly connections within the county.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This card is for the board game Dark Horse and may be used to add a Limited Action Space to the game. A player taking this Action always collects it last after all other Actions have been collected. The player will receive one Wild Die token and may look at the top two cards, from any card deck, and then put them back on top of that deck, face down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Came from SaltCon 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
