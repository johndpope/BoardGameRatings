							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rolomatic Bridge</name>
									
			<description>Great way to learn how to bid and play complex Bridge hands.  Endorsed by Charles Goren himself.  The Rolomatic Bridge machine has a roll of paper inside it with 100 Bridge hands printed on it.  You see the initial deal, then a quick turn of the wheel shows what cards the opponents play as well as what is recommended that you play.  Great learning tool for the moderately skilled Bridge player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
