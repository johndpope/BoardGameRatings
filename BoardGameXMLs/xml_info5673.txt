							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Perfect Crime</name>
									
			<description>The Perfect Crime is a detective game with a twist... one of the players is actually the &amp;quot;murderer&amp;quot;.  He constructs his crime, choosing his Victim, Scene, Time and Method.  The other players are Detectives.  They investigate the crime and try to discover which one among them is the Murderer.  Naturally, the Murderer also plays as a Detective and tries to avoid being exposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The roll of a die determines what type of investigation you may make on your turn.  Depending on the roll, the information that you receive may be secret or public.  All clues may be entered on the provided investigation pad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a detective wants to make an accusation he may do so on a hunch, without seeing all four pieces of evidence except on the 12th round, when all evidence MUST be shown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who was dealt the 'Murderer' must last 12 full rounds of investigation without being discovered to win.  If any other player makes a correct accusation, he wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
