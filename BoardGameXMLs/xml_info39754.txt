			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Create your own transportation mega corporation... But beware: The game experience is based on rules of reality. The game offers many scenarios, interesting changes and enjoyment for the whole family!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take command of a Truck and are bidding on Transportation Contracts, which state from where to where a freight needs to be transported. Training the truck driver to higher levels of his driver's license allows to bid for better paid contracts, containing goods with need for cooling, for example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delivery time for the active contract is marked on the turn clock, so that all players see how many turns a player has left to reach his target. If a player manages to move his truck on the map form startpoint to endpoint stated in the contract (movement via d6), he earns money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to contracts, event cards can be purchased, which allow for certain special actions (like blocking certain countries for all players or promoting a player's driver to next level).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends if either one player manages to deliver a freight to five different European countries pictured on the game's map or after the turn clock reaches a defined point. Winner is then the player with most money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
