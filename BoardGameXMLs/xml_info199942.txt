							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Egyptian Solitaire</name>
									
			<description>Egyptian Solitaire is a solitaire puzzle game using Icehouse Pieces. Imagine a game of Peg Solitaire getting combined with a Rubik's Cube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Goal of the game is to remove as many pyramids as possible from the 3x4 board to achieve the lowest score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is made up of 12 pyramid nests (a nest is a large pyramid  atop a medium pyramid, atop a small pyramid) on a 3x4 grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, use the top pyramid to hop over an adjacent top pyramid and land on the following location. Immediately remove the top pyramid that was hopped. The twist is that pyramids are only allowed to land on a pyramid of the same size or on an empty space on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When no more legal moves are possible, count the pips on all of the remaining pyramids on the board to get your final score. &lt;br/&gt;Larges = 3 pts. Mediums = 2 pts. Smalls = 1 pt. &lt;br/&gt;It is possible to end the game with 1 point. This is considered a perfect score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Egyptian Solitaire is featured in the recently succesful Kickstarter campaign of Pyramid Arcade by Looney Labs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
