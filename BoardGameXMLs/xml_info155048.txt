			<description>Paddington Photo is a roll and move game with a twist. The game is a small box game. It consists of a 3-piece (puzzle type) game board, 3 cardboard figures (Paddington, Mr. and Mrs. Brown) and 25 plastic chips as well as 2 colour dice. The game board has spots in red, blue yellow etc. round in a circle. In game variation one all 3 figures are placed randomly on the board. On his turn a player rolls both dice. He/she assigns each roll to a figure on the board and moves two figures according to the die roll. E.g. the dice show red and yellow: then the player must move 2 of the three figures. One on any red space, one on any yellow space. When the three figures are located next to each other a photo is shot. The player achieving the photo shot gets a chip as reward. Once a photo is completed the middle figure runs away to the opposite space of the same colour. After 20 photos are shot the game ends, player with the most chips wins. In a variation a photo is especially well taken when Paddington is in the middle. Then the player gets 2 chips for this kind of photo shot. After all 25 chips are exhausted the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
