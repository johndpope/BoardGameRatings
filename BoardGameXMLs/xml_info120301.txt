							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Murder&#039;s Mark</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The circus has come to town! But rather than herald a time of festive joy and exotic entertainment, this normally wondrous event instead heralds a sudden rash of violent murders. The victims bear the unmistakable mark of talons on their savaged bodies&amp;mdash;and it just so happens that this circus has among its exhibits numerous creatures capable of inflicting such wounds, not the least of which a mysterious sphinx. The folk who run the circus claim innocence, but as the murder spree continues, the town's patience swiftly wears thin and the threat of mob justice looms near. Desperate for aid in a town that's forbidden them to leave before an opportunity for justice presents itself, the carnies turn to adventurers for aid&amp;mdash;can they find the culprit before the murderer finds them? This Pathfinder adventure is for a group of four 1st-level characters, and takes place in the heartland of Varisia, a region featured in many beloved adventures including the classic Rise of the Runelords Anniversary Edition and upcoming Shattered Star Adventure Path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Murder&amp;rsquo;s Mark is an adventure for 1st-level characters, written for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and compatible with the 3.5 edition of the world&amp;rsquo;s oldest RPG. In addition to the adventure, this volume also features a brand-new monster and a gazetteer of a Varisian carnival suitable for use with any fantasy roleplaying campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pathfinder Modules are 32-page, high-quality, full-color, adventures using the Open Game License to work with both the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and the standard 3.5 fantasy RPG rules set. This Pathfinder Module includes new monsters, treasure, and a fully detailed bonus location that can be used as part of the adventure or in any other game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
