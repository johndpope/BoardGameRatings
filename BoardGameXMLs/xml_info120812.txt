							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GO Series: Undead Storm</name>
									
			<description>Six months after a mysterious meteorite strike, the undead have awoken and are taking over the city. You&amp;rsquo;ll face wave after wave of killer zombies with only some serious firepower to protect you. Play solo, or team up with your friends via DS Wireless Communications, and take the fight to the shuffling hordes. Solo zombie slayers can find other survivors to join them as allies. In Multi Play Mode, you can cooperate with up to three other friends via DS Wireless Communications. They'll have your back in the firefight against the undead, and can revive you if your health flatlines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Select one of four player characters and face down the zombie threat over a range of stages, from a horrific hospital to a hazardous chemical plant and the decimated downtown area. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re taking on rabid zombiefied plague dogs with your flamethrower, or using devastating Slaughter Grenades in an epic clash with a terrifying boss, the action is non-stop. What lies behind this zombie epidemic? Only you can discover the truth...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
