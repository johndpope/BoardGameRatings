							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beany  &amp; Cecil Ring Toss Game</name>
									
			<description>Simple Indoor ring toss game featuring Beany and Cecil the sea sick sea serpent cartoon characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has pictures of Captain Horatio Huffenpuff, Beany's kindly uncle and the Captain of the Leakin' Lena which takes the pals from one destination to the other. The Captain is always willing to instruct Beany and Cecil on their latest assignment, but refuses to put himself in any personal jeopardy, locking himself in the belowdecks for most of the episodes.&lt;br/&gt; Crowy, the navigator of the Leakin' Lena. He is a crow, and unsurprisingly spends most of his time in the crow's nest. He speaks in a squawky voice and has a tendency to faint dead away whenever the ship encounters some sort of hazard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dishonest John, the villain of the piece. He is dressed like a Simon Legree character, and he is constantly scheming to foil Beany and Cecil's adventures. His catchphrase is a sinister &amp;quot;Nya ha ha!&amp;quot;.
