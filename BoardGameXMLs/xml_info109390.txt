			<description>Simple roll and move game. The board depicts a mountain with the track running to the top. On the track are short-cuts and it will get more competitive because the track thins as it gets higher.It is a race to the summit. There are several pathways at the start of the game and quite a few obstacles to prevent the player from getting ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
