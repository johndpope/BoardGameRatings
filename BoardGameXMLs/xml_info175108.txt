			<description>Paws: Devious Dogs versus Crafty Cats is an easy to learn 2-8 player casual card game in the style of great classic games like Rummy, Uno, Hearts, and Crazy Eights and can be played in as little as 15 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all the cards from their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck is made up of Numbers and Colors. Each player is given 7 cards at the start of the game. On your turn you must play cards in a certain color and direction. It could be Higher or it could be Lower. &lt;br/&gt;Now, some cards in the game can be played as the Number &amp;amp; Color OR as a &amp;quot;special action&amp;quot;. These cards can affect the game in numerous ways. But, be careful with them as they can help you and they can also hurt you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch out. The Devious Dog is lurking somewhere in the Draw Deck. He is a troublemaker. If you happen to draw him, you cannot win the game. You must try and find a way to get rid of him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
