							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bull Chase</name>
									
			<description>After pitching their tents in the dark, campers awake to find that they have slept in the wrong colored tents!  To their horror, they also find they are in a field full of bulls!  The campers hurriedly try to reach their own tent to leave for home, but first have to cross the field and avoid the bulls.  &lt;br/&gt;The pieces are plastic people and the bulls are detailed plastic with flipper fronts, so they can toss the campers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
