			<description>Sieg in Afrika is an operational game of the campaign in North Africa from the first Italian advances in 1940 through the final battles in 1943. The players are placed in the positions of the overall theater commanders for North Africa. Each must direct the available forces of the in armored thrusts and parries across across the sands, escarpments, and mountains of Egypt, Libya, &amp;amp; Tunesia. Two situation maps and two sets of markers for plotting intelligence results and operation reports are provided. Two may play, or the computer will act as an opponent, capable of playing either side.&lt;br/&gt;Design &amp;amp; art by J.Kula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A type of game which was shortly popular with the upcoming of the home computer in the early 80's. Designers were still exploring the possibilities of uses for a home computer, and a few games have been published in that era where your computer was used as an Aide de Camp for boardgames. Avalon Hill's Tanktics is probably the best known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sieg in Afrika is particularly outstanding in the fact that fog of war is simulated by 2 identical maps and counter sets. Against a human player, the moves and actions are typed in the computer for resolvement purposes only. In 1 player mode, the computer also gives output on where the computer counters are placed. The software can be run on an Apple ][ or a Commodore 64.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
