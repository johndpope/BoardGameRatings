							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cartel: A Game for Real Estate Tycoons</name>
									
			<description>Yet another game named &amp;quot;Cartel&amp;quot;.  Cartel is extremely similar to Monopoly in that you spin a spinner to move one to six spaces, visiting different countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Holland, Italy, U.S.A.) on the board.  You may purchase properties in the different countries.  If you land on a country with an opponent's properties, you must pay rent to that player.  Some facets of Cartel that contrast it from Monopoly are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Each player may have houses in no more than five countries.&lt;br/&gt;     There are no blocks of properties:  Each country has one space on the board.&lt;br/&gt;     Once you land on a country space, you spin a spinner to determine whether you may build a house, may not build a house, or may build a house for free.&lt;br/&gt;     If you land on Try Your Luck, you spin the Lucky Spin spinner, and win money from the bank or lose money to the pool.  If your spin showed LUCKY POOL, you get the money in the pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
