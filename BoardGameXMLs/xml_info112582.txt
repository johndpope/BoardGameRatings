			<description>Somewhere in Europe, near a big sea, there is a small village called Leiuatajatek&amp;uuml;la (Inventors Village), where it is thought as honor to be able to build and invent your own stuff. Every year they have a competition for inventions.&lt;br/&gt;Who is the best inventor in the city? Maybe someone who can build a plane from paper and a string or a tractor from a old trumpet. Join in to take part in the best ever competition that ever was. This is a fast and tricky board game for 2 to 5 little inventors and fans of Lotte (Estonian animation), in where you have a lot of fun and no one will get hurt. Game fits for smaller and larger players, for academic and for school kids. Who wouldn't want to adventure with rabbit Adalbert and cat Bruno?&lt;br/&gt;Be the first to finish your invention and score most with it to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
