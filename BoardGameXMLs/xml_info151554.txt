			<description>Naughty? Or Nice? is a Christmas themed version of classic party games like Mafia or Werewolf. Great for holiday and family parties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play the game with naughty presents which remove the &amp;quot;elimination&amp;quot; typical of mafia and werewolf games. Or if you prefer the typical werewolf rules, you can use the Krampus cards and kidnap your fellow elves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a social deduction game where players are on naughty and nice teams. At nights, naughty elves break a present. During the days, the nice elves vote on who they think is naughty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one of two conditions are met: &lt;br/&gt;1.) All naughty elves are exiled and the nice elves win! &lt;br/&gt;2.) All the nice presents are destroyed and the naughty elves &lt;br/&gt;win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
