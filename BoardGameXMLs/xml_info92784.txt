							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Baal</name>
									
			<description>Baal is one of Psygnosis's less-popular titles, which featured the player as a &amp;quot;Time Warrior&amp;quot; sent into the recesses of hell to recover pieces of &amp;quot;The War Machine&amp;quot; which has been stolen by the evil minion, Baal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike most other Psygnosis titles such as Shadow of the Beast and Brataccas, this game didn't break any new ground, or receive critical or commercial success, as it is a simple platform-based shoot 'em up marred with loading times that many users described as &amp;quot;unbearable&amp;quot;. While it does feature Psygnosis's trademark overall macabre mood, it is one of the few of the company's games to go without their usual psychedelic Roger Dean artwork. This artwork was created by Melvyn Grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game had one unusual feature: On the Amiga, the power indicator light flashed in time with the soundtrack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Baal (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
