			<description>In Confusing Sun, players compete to spot particular combinations of flames and UFOs near the sun before anyone else can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic side of the game board has spaces numbered 1-10, and at the start of the game you place one card next to each space; cards show 1-3 flames, 1-3 UFOs, and some number of planets (including zero). On a turn, the active player  rolls the black die and red die, then places the flame/UFO indicator card so that red is associated with flames and black with UFOs (or vice versa). This indicator card shows how many flames and how many UFOs players need to spot &amp;ndash; for example, 1 flame and 3 UFOs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For all cards that show precisely this combination of icons, the player sums the numbers (1-10) next to these cards and yells out a total. The first player to do so claims these cards, which are worth one point each if they don't have planets. (If a card has planets, it's worth that many points.) One side on each die shows a star; when a star is next to an icon, that icon is ignored. If stars are next to both icons, you total the numbers next to cards that bear planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After replacing any cards claimed, the next player rolls the dice. The game continues until someone has twenty points; this player wins! For a more challenging game, use the reverse side of the game board, which has spaces numbered 11-20.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
