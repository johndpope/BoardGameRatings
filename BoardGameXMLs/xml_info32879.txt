			<description>A racing game were each player has to playing pieces. One is the mechanic that you move around building your car and finding replacement parts as the game goes on. There are many various parts so each player gets his own custom made car, with different abilities ad weaknesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other piece is a sand timer, that is used to represent your car on the race track. On a players turn, he choses whether he wants to move his mechanic or car, but when then sand has run out in the sand timer, the car is out of gas and you need to move the mechanic to refill the car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The race track has various hazards and shortcut, that may or may not interfere with your car, depending on what custom parts your car is made up of. You might want to move the mechanic around to find you better car parts, but in the end it is the player who first reaches the finish line with his car who wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
