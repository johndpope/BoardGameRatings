							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Race Cars: Tracks and Drivers</name>
									
			<description>In this simple roll-and-roll game, players roll dice and then move their Hot Wheels-style race cars around a large (22&amp;quot;x36&amp;quot;) mounted board featuring an oval race track.  The winner is the first driver to complete 36 laps, enter the victory lane, and then land in the winner's circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is complicated slightly by Lap Cards and Pit Cards.  Eight Lap Cards are drawn by each driver over the course of the game; these cards may instruct the players to move their cars or may indicate problems that require a visit to the pits.  The driver must be able to enter pit road within two turns or suffer further consequences, and each driver must draw a Pit Card (which may further delay re-entry) upon leaving pit road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 5 Racing Cars, 2 d6, 1 Score Pad for keeping track of laps  and Lap Cards, 1 Game Board, 30 Pit Cards, and 40 Lap Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
