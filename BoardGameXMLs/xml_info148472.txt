							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Take</name>
									
			<description>The Take is about crooked cops taking money. It is played over the course of several rounds. Each round, each player takes a bill(card) worth between 1 and 5 thousand dollars. In the second half of the game each player gets an opportunity to take an action after all players have taken their money for the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three ways to win the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    If the deck of cards runs out, the player with the most money wins at the end of the final round.&lt;br/&gt;    If a player correctly accuses a player of having the most money,the accuser immediately wins.&lt;br/&gt;    If a player correctly accuses another player of having the least money, the player with the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 basic actions that players can take by spending money from their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Stakeout: Adjust turn order.&lt;br/&gt;    Audit: Look at another player's cards.&lt;br/&gt;    Accuse: Accuse a player of having the most or least money.&lt;br/&gt;    Defame: Block a player from taking an action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
