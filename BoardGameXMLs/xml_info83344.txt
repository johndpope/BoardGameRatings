			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last Rebellion is a role-playing game developed for the PS3. The game is set in the world of Junovald, where all is governed by the will of two gods: Meitilia and Formival. Formival, the god of life, has begun restoring life to creatures that had once died, creating the unkillable Belzeds. Humanity prays to Meitilia, the god of death, for salvation, and Meitilia creates two groups of people, the Blades and the Sealers, who can defeat the monsters while working in concert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game follows the Blade Nine Asfel and the Sealer Aisha Romandine as they attempt to purge the Belzeds from the kingdom of Lorvin. Gameplay is similar to other RPGs, with free-roaming exploration and turn-based combat. The player controls both Aisha and Nine, and must which character is active as the two share a soul in-game (similar to in Trine). In combat the player can target particular body parts to handicap their opponent. Attacking the legs hinders movement, while attacking the arms reduces attack strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
