							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Diplomacy: Federation Variant</name>
									
			<description>Australia became a federation on the 1st of January 1901. So our history books tell us. The colonies came together, united into one nation. Not by an act of war, nor through violent action was a nation forged. How boring! No wonder I fell asleep in those Australian history classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is your chance to rewrite a nations history. Federation had failed. Instead of peaceful unity, war between the colonies is declared. All agreements between the colonies have been dissolved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is Spring 1901. The divisions between the colonies is fueled by a hunger to gain control over the continent. You are the colonies  governor and have already instructed the militia forces to be mustered and ready for action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will succeed to unify Australia? Who will forever be doomed to oblivion? What will you do to unite Australia?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Federation Diplomacy is a variant of the popular Hasbro game called Diplomacy. Were as Diplomacy is based in Europe with the great powers at the turn of the 20th century, Federation Diplomacy is set in Australasia in the same time. It requires a keen eye for tactics and the silver tongue of the diplomat to weave a web of alliances to see your selected colony dominate the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is played mainly by email with movement adjudicated by an electronic judge.
