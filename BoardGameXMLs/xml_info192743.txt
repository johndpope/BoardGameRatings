			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Does everybody have a limit? You'll find out playing this lively party game. No matter how well you know someone, you will know them better after playing this game. It measures the limits you didn't even know you had. So go ahead and answer that age old question, what's it gonna take? But if you kiss a boa constrictor, we had nothing to do with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this party game the active player draws two random hypothetical situations and a money card depicting an incentive.  The active player has to decide whether they would be willing to do either, both, or neither of the situations  for that specific reward indicated on the Money card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All other players cast their votes by using voting cards  to indicate which Hypothetical situations they think the Reader would do for the reward. All players responses are revealed and scoring Chips are earned for correct predictions of what the Reader Player would do. Each player at the table takes a turn, and then count up their chips. The winner is the person with the most scoring chips at the end of each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
