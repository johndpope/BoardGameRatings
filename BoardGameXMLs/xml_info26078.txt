			<description>Le Combat de l&amp;rsquo;Aigle (The Eagle's fight) is a tactical game system meant to simulate Napoleonic battles at the battalion scale. Large size battles are playable in one day. The game mechanism is close to miniatures, but the armies are included in the box as are several scenarios on the beginning of the 1809 campaign. Other volumes will follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several rules are very innovative; a focus on unit cohesion (visualized by file closers set behind the unit), the chain of command, a cavalry combat using waves of squadrons close to reality. Other elements, (e.g. the brigade move) can accelerate the game. The combat system is based on drawing cards and comparing them (a simpler system based on a single die roll is also included).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Le Combat de l&amp;rsquo;Aigle can be played three different ways :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* As a tactical system to simulate real or imaginary battles..&lt;br/&gt;    * As a miniature game system (Kip Trexel is the author of the campaign rules for Empire III). Basing and the use of miniatures, with single miniatures as file closers, are easy to adapt to any scale. Designed at first to be played with 6mm miniatures and doubling all distances included here, it can be converted to any scale with great ease..&lt;br/&gt;    * As a tactical extension of the Vol de lâ€™Aigle campaign system, to solve every important battle. The players can decide to switch to a more tactical system when a large battle occurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 5 scenarios on the opening moves of the 1809 campaign.&lt;br/&gt;Content (under ziplock):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* 1 rule book (32 pages).&lt;br/&gt;    * 18 hard paper counter sheets including the French and Austrian armies at the beginning of the 1809 campaign in Bavaria.&lt;br/&gt;    * 4 sheets of colorful player aid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players must provide numerical markers from 1 to 6 (we use 5mm dice).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
