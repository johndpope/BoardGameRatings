							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Proxy War</name>
									
			<description>The US and USSR are locked in a struggle for global superiority.  In Proxy War, players take either the role of the US or USSR to get their Superpower to the top.  However, direct involvement in the different regions of the world is kept to a minimum.  The two Superpowers are involved in a Proxy War: influencing the world without direct involvement.  Each Superpower will use their political clout to alter the Political Tilt or Political Value of a region.  For instance, the US might have a strong position in the Middle East.  The USSR may choose to reduce the Political Value of that region, making it less attractive to Uncle Sam.  Or the USSR may change the Political Tilt of that region so that it is more favorable to the Soviet Agenda.  By advancing global agendas, the two Superpowers gain or lose favor in a region depending on the local politics.  Through all the politicking, random global events will alter the world political view causing both Superpowers to adjust individual political manipulations in order to achieve global superiority.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
