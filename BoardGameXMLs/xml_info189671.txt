			<description>Petopia is a fast-paced, trapping and bluffing card game that a winner is the person who scores the goal of this game. You can choose your representative between dog or cat, who fights to win in the backyard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All cards will be shuffled and distributed 5 cards per each player.Every player will get the health-token depends on the number of players. For example, 3-5 people will receive 4 tokens per person while 6-8 players will get 5 tokens for each player.Players need to draw a card and set some traps to make competitors lose their health points. Following the rules, you have to tell your opponents some details of those traps that you set up. For example, types of those traps (real trap or fake trap). Moreover, each player needs to bluff and challenge other players to remove the set-up traps or decide to keep those traps there. In case that your opponents remove the real trap, they will not lose any health point. Nevertheless, If they make a wrong decision by keeping them or remove the fake one, they will lose their health points. In the latter case, the player (yourself) who sets up the traps will earn the health point instead. Please see the full description of this game by reading in the later part. (How to play section) Keep in mind that you should not trust anyone but should be aware of what others keep saying. The real relationship might not exist on this backyard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
