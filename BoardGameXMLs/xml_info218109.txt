							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Getaway to Asia!</name>
									
			<description>Players collect various types of resources&amp;mdash;money, time, special gear, tour guides, etc.&amp;mdash;that allow them to travel to cities in Asia and purchase travel experiences, which have point values.  Each player starts with a randomly dealt hand of five (5) unique Experience cards, each detailing a particular travel experience in a particular city. Players are able to draw other Experience cards through the course of the game.  Players purchase Experience cards from the five (5) in their hand, or from Experience cards that have already been played by other players.  The five (5) Experience cards in your hand do not count for points until they have been purchased by traveling to that particular city and exchanging the necessary Resource cards for it.  Only one player may &amp;ldquo;claim&amp;rdquo; a particular city and any experiences they purchase in that city.  There are five different categories of Experience cards:  Adventure, Sightseeing, Romance, Rest &amp;amp; Relaxation, and Culture &amp;amp; Service&lt;br/&gt; The game ends when a player has purchased at least one (1) of each category of Experience card and plays their Go Home card.  Players may choose to keep traveling and purchasing additional Experience cards if they wish, before playing their Go Home card to end the game.  Players use the Scoring Values card to calculate their total points. The player who plays their Go Home card first to end the game scores an additional 10 points.  The player with the highest point total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
