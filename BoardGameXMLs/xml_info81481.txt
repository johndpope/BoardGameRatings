							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Blues Brothers</name>
									
			<description>The Blues Brothers is a video game based on the band The Blues Brothers, where the object is to evade police in order to make it to a blues concert. The game was released for IBM PC, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, Commodore 64 and Atari ST in 1991, for the NES in 1992 and for the Game Boy in 1994. It was created by Titus and in gameplay is reminiscent of Capcom's Chip N' Dale series (1990), as well as Titus' own Titus the Fox. A sequel, Blues Brothers: Jukebox Adventure, was released for IBM PC and SNES in 1993 and for the Game Boy in 1994. The game received mixed reviews from fans of the film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters have the ability to pick up objects (generally boxes) and either put them down to stand on them, or throw them at enemies. Each level is a variation on the jumping theme, with the characters finding a necessary attribute (e.g. a guitar) somewhere in the level. The sixth and final level ends on-stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played by two players simultaneously, but the scrolling screen only focuses on one of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Blues Brothers (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
