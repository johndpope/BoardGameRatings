							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pirates of Van Zandt</name>
									
			<description>A pirate themed game for 3 to 4 players using one PiecePack (Full rules available at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.piecepack.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.piecepack.org/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls a ship full of pirates, and is allotted 2 actions a turn (to use with a list of 12 possible actions) allowing them to sail and walk around the board, trying to be the first to successfully dig up multiple pieces of treasure.  To this end, they may attack the other player's pirates and even try to board opposing ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game rules introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Loose lips sink ships, and due to the loosening of several lips by a little bit of grog, several groups of pirates just realized that they've all buried their treasure near each other, in the same group of islands! Now they've all rushed out, not as much to defend their own treasure, which has no doubt been ingeniously hidden, but to unearth the booty the other groups have hidden and claim it as their own.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
