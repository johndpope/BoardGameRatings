			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bowgentle welcomes you to the Kamarg and the famous and ancient Aigues Morte, seat of the Kamarg's protector, Count Brass. Here you will be introduced to the beauties and dangers of the Kamarg, learning something of its turbulent history and how Count Brass and his brave warriors helped make these ancient lands safe for its peoples. You shall learn of deeds of heroism and villainy, strangeness and magic. You shall also learn of its people and their customs, and why the Kamarg has always - and always shall be - aside from France. You shall witness its traditions and customs, and experience the hospitality of these great and gentle folk. We shall guide you through the wildlife of the Kamarg: its famed horned-horses, its bulls, its flamingoes - great enough to bear a rider in flight - and of course, of the dangers lurking within the swamps and waterways, such as the pitiful baragoon and other fearsome creatures that, even now, Count Brass and his warriors seek to commit to memory. So venture, dear traveller, and be welcomed! Castle Brass is yours to behold.Come feel and hear the song of the Mistral!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
