			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death Whine: The racing season is nearly over. Somehow, newly arrived to racing, swamped with debt, disliked by the sponsoring company and the other racers &amp;ndash; somehow, the Kid has persevered and has nearly finished a full year of racing. Even better, the Kid has started to become a Star. Yet, as the racing season prepares to climax in the Grand Cyclon, the Kid happens to learn who it was that killed the Parent in a &amp;ldquo;racing accident&amp;rdquo; all those years ago. What's more, the murderer's identity hits all too close to home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kid is entering the final race of the season. But is the Kid going to seek to win the Grand Cyclon and become a Star racer? Or is the Kid entering this race only to get revenge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
