			<description>Ryōshi is designed around a mixture of quantum physics and Shinto creation mythology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board based on fractal geometry, which is simply a pattern repeated from one scale to another. In this case, each area of hexagons is repeated in the larger area on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pattern of the kanji numbers in each area links them on the board and to all &amp;quot;creation boards&amp;quot; of the players. This allows for players to simulate some aspects of quantum physics as one kami can teleport from one area to another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, the general back story and theme is inspired from the very early and cryptic portions of texts that explain the early stages of creation as understood in Shinto beliefs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is purely strategic and is all based on kami movement and position. There are no dice or cards to dictate the fate of the game. You play as the heavenly kami, so praying to them for a &amp;quot;good roll&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;draw&amp;quot; would be futile anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
