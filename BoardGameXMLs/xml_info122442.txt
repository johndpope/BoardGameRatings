							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chasse aux Marsupilamis!</name>
									
			<description>Game play in Chasse aux Marsupilamis! resembles that of Pounce / Spitz pa&amp;szlig; auf! in that one player tries to capture one or more animals while everyone else yanks his animal off the table to keep it safe. The animal in question this game is Franquin's marsupilami &amp;ndash; the spotted leopardy dog with the incredibly lengthy tail. Each player has his own marsupilami, with the tail being a piece of string.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, the active player rolls three dice &amp;ndash; white, black and yellow &amp;ndash; and depending on the roll of the white die, players consult the black or yellow die (or possibly still the white) to see what they have to do. In some cases the active player tries to slam a cage on the marsupilamis, taking a food token from the owner of each animal he captures; in other cases the goal is the same, but the active player must pay everyone he doesn't capture. Sometimes the active player can fake a capture, taking food from anyone who feverishly yanks his marsupilami out of range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start the game with a number of food tokens, and the game ends as soon as one (or more) players has 15 tokens or 0 tokens. In either case, the player with the most tokens wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
