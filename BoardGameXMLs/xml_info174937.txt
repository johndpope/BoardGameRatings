			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Setting for any game system and a mini-RPG, with stats for -U- the Game of Stories!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nestled between affluent neighborhoods, shopping centers, and other suburban conveniences sits Zachary M. Morris High School. Here, the upper-middle class send their children to learn and prosper. This, however, is high school. It's not all that glorious. It is filled with judgmental views, popularity contests, grueling homework, after-school activities, and hormones. Between worrying about if they will have a date for Homecoming and trying to fit in their Glee club practice, everyone is worried about how popular they are on the Morris-meter Blog and if they will qualify for a scholarship at a state college.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this book, you'll find a complete Setting about the world of Morris High and a customized copy of -U- Essentials which gives you everything (except 3 six-sided die) to begin playing in this strange parallel of our own world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
