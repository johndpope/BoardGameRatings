			<description>The Shoot is an upcoming 2010 Rail shooter video game for the PlayStation 3, which will utilize the new PlayStation Move controllers. It was officially unveiled at the 2010 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players in the game have to help film a series of Hollywood action movies, thus the players have takes rather than lives in the game. The game's story consists of several scenes and overarching chapters each focused around different films. The game also contains subtle hints towards the current generation of Hollywood movies such as &amp;quot;Robotomus Crime&amp;quot; a play on the name Optimus Prime from the recent Transformers series of films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Shoot&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
