			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Organization of Wrestling is looking for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can YOU shamelessly and successfully promote the careers of your wrestlers in ways that would make Don King blush?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can YOU take on and defeat some of the most vicious and powerful men ever to step inside the squared circle?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, designed for 2-6 players, each player becomes a promoter, managing up to ten individual wrestlers and/or tag teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players then ENGAGE THEIR WRESTLERS IN (nearly) MORTAL COMBAT against the bloodthirsty minions of the opposing players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique but easy system is based on the rolls of two ten-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OVER 100 WRESTLING HOLDS and numerous Advantages (Mascot, Beautiful Woman In The Corner, etc.), so no two characters are alike in this role-playing experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
