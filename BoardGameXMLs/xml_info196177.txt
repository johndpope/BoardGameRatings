			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A compilation of Playbooks and tools for characters in games of Beyond the Wall and Other Adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Champions rise and fall by the company they keep&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are dangers throughout the land, but your home is not unguarded. A hero might spring from any number of origins: the children of the nobility, unlikely champions within the village, or wanderers from the land of faerie. Make your name, stand with your friends, and defend your family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meet new heroes, young and old...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes Young and Old compiles all of the free material from four addons for Beyond the Wall and Other Adventures, and gives more besides. This book helps players and gamemasters create their own Character Playbooks, tell stories with new spells, rituals, and magic items, and populate their villages and worlds with interesting NPCs and monsters. Also included are rules for the gnome, a new fantastic creature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Collected material from The Village, The Nobility, Dwarves, Elves, and Halflings, and The Elders, including old favorites, like the Nobleman&amp;rsquo;s Wild Daughter, the Assistant Beast Keeper, and the Dwarven Mentor.&lt;br/&gt;     Six new Character Playbooks, including the Knightless Squire, the Recluse Wizard, and the Gnomish Godparent.&lt;br/&gt;     New spells, rituals, magic items, rare herbs, traits, and bestiary entries.&lt;br/&gt;     Guidelines for making your own Character Playbooks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
