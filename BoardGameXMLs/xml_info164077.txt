			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to this new art free d100 system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why art free? Simply to keep the cost low and be able to offer a quality product that you all will enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How is this different from other d100 systems?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, it's a very familiar d100 system with some changes.  What it does instead is take the basic Renaissance rules and add all kinds of content to it including, new rules, ships, magic systems and even a whole chapter on magic items!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So how is it different? Simple! Movement in metres is now determined by your characteristics rather than by a static number.  As well, a new attribute for divine and spirit magic (Spirit) is introduced along with a whole new way of doing Divine and Sorcery magic that is new and refreshing.  The magic item chapter will blow you away as well.  Some of it may be familiar from the d20 SRD but the way it all works is new and will be enjoyable for sure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AS WELL.  A whole new expanded bestiary featuring old favourites from the d20 SRD, Legend and Renaissance along with a couple new ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a complete RPG and requires nothing else for play making this quite possibly a one stop shop.  Of course we hope it isn't and that you'll enjoy Magic &amp;amp; Flintlock products in the time to come!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
