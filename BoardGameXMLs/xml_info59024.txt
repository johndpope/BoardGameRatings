			<description>The game consists of 90 number cards (2x 1-10, 1x 11-20 in three colors), 12 action cards and 48 task cards. Each player receives a task cards and a number (eight or more) number or action cards. A move consists of either drawing a card and discarding two, or drawing two and discarding one. When a player has fulfilled his or her task, he or she gets to keep that task card as a point and draws a new one. Whoever fulfills three tasks first is the winner. Tasks are usually simple math things, such as getting pairs of cards that all sum up to the same number, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
