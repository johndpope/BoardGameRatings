			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your players will face not one, but two villains in this adventure set in the Metropolverse* setting. First they face the wise cracking Puzzler, only to find themselves face to face with the infamous Groddilla (a large green ape who is determined to over throw the specietocracy of the Humans!) However, before dealing with this sinister simian your players will have to work their way through some twists and complication of a few Sub Plots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included with this adventure are the graphics files for Groddilla. You get him in 4 different graphics formats in both black and white to use in your creative endeavours as you wish, just make sure my signature stays on the picture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    This is the town that broke Time and Space for in Metropolverse ALL REALITIES EXIST AT ONCE. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
