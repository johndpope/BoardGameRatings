			<description>Mystaria uses fairly typical Tactical RPG gameplay basics, though with a few innovations. The player manipulates characters along grid-based battlefields, upon which the characters may interact with objects, enemies, and other characters that are within their range. Battles are turn-based according to party; first the player maneuvers all his party members, then the enemy AI maneuvers all enemy units, then the player takes control again, and so on. Each turn, the player can move each character once and have them either attack, defend, cast a spell, or use an item. Unlike most Tactical RPGs, battles in Mystaria frequently require something other than eliminating all enemy units to be completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing as primarily Aragon, the player gathers a team of 12 heroes. The recruitment of team members, however, is non-linear and the story adjusts itself to the newest character that has joined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the characters have specific fighting techniques and will develop new techniques with practice. Which techniques are learned next depends on which already known techniques the characters practice, allowing creative development of each character. For example, utilizing Ferral's &amp;quot;Spear Attack&amp;quot; will lead to Ferral learning stronger Spear techniques such as &amp;quot;Spinning Spear&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Shish-kebob&amp;quot; more quickly, while using &amp;quot;Punch&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Kick&amp;quot; will help him acquire more Hand to Hand techniques such as &amp;quot;Martial Throw&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Hundred Hands&amp;quot;. Once acquired, new techniques must be added to the character's quick menu so that they can actually be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mystaria: The Realms of Lore&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
