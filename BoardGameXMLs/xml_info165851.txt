			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rat is among Germany's first generation of super weapons that helped turn the tide of the war in 1945. Armed with two 11-inch cannons, several anti-aircraft guns, a short-range artillery cannon, and a .60 caliber machine gun, the Rat is a battleship that cruises the land. Like a mobile fortress, it has more than 40 men aboard including a permanently embarked commando team and a medical officer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to a submarine, the Rat has a command deck, a sick bay, a brig, an engine room and more than 10 other rooms for storing ammunition, food, medical supplies, and even motor cycles. It serves as the centerpiece of battle groups and is both a communication hub and a long-range artillery weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This file includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     3 Photos of the Rat&lt;br/&gt;     1 Map (detailing 3 levels)&lt;br/&gt;     Crew list and command structure&lt;br/&gt;     History of the Rat engineering project&lt;br/&gt;     5 different ammunition loads (H.E.A.T.
