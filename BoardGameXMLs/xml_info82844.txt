							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Demolition Man (FPS)</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As featured on Entertainment Tonight - Demolition Man for the 3DO system is already hailed as the most true-to-the movie interactive video game experience ever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally. The power of 3DO. The action of a hit movie. The challenge of a video game. But deeper. And better. Because this time, you control the outcome of a real movie. With real stars (Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes), real suspense and real challenges that demand real skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It began in 1996 as a brutal battle between a dangerous cop (STALLONE) and an even more dangerous criminal (SNIPES). A red-hot feud that destroyed 30 innocent bystanders and forced both men to serve 36 years on ice. Thirty-six long years of rage and dreams of vindication. Now, it continues in 2032 in the futuristic city of San Angeles. A strange new world where weapons are outlawed, violence doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist and only one thing is clear: the future&amp;rsquo;s not big enough for the both of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Actually control cinematic-quality live action footage of Stallone as the Demolition Man in a game that merges movie and video footage so smoothly you&amp;rsquo;ll feel plunged into the film itself.&lt;br/&gt;     Contains never-before-seen footage of Stallone and Snipes filmed especially for this interactive adventure.&lt;br/&gt;     More genres of game play than our competitors have - 4 different types of game play including 3-D first person P.O.V. tunnel hunts, shooting galleries, car chases, and hand-to-hand combat&lt;br/&gt;     Unbelievably real 3-D environments with props, costumes, sound effects and sci-fi gadgetry taken directly from the Warner Bros./ Joel Silver (Die Hard and Lethal Weapon I and II) hit movie&lt;br/&gt;     Graphics, sound effects and 3-D rendered art that maximizes 3DO&amp;rsquo;s capabilities&lt;br/&gt;     American Laser Games Gamegun compatible&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
