			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Mission&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you become an agent, you dream of travel to exotic, faraway lands, gambling over mountains of chips in Monte Carlo, or sipping champagne overlooking the Riviera while reflecting upon a job well done. One does not, under any circumstances, think of Boise, Idaho, the Pumpkin Festival, or, be still my heart, a convergence of the two, yet you find yourself trampling through a dark, muddy corn field in the dead of night, looking for God knows what. Let&amp;rsquo;s back up a little bit to where it all began&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mission Brief&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People are disappearing in Boise&amp;mdash;five in the past week. Wanting to avoid a widespread panic, pranksters, or copycats across the country, local government officials have unsuccessfully attempted to handle the situation on their own. A few hours ago &amp;mdash; Natalie Brooks &amp;mdash; a friendly has reached out to Oblivion and the agents are sent to get to the root of the problem as discretely as possible. As such, only pistols or other small arms are available as part of loadouts and the characters are placed on a commercial flight with covers as FBI agents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
