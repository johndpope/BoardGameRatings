							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strange Magic Items: Composition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Strange Magic Items series splits a full codex of magic items into the three subsystems laid out in Strange Magic: ethermagic, truename magic, and musical composition. Each of these thirds has its own unique flavor, both in fluff and mechanics, and such compartmentalization allows those who only bought some of the constituent thirds of Strange Magic to pick up whatever new content interests them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Composers, it's time to go baton shopping! Strange Magic Items - Composition offers up a selection of magical equipment for the discerning man of music, from a series of conductor's batons to a dozen variants of sequin vests that can be piled on three at a time. Is that not enough sequins? Armor special abilities, hammer pants, rings, and even some named weapons can pile on sequin vest variant bonuses, making this entire supplement a pile of modular madness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then again, it's an Interjection Games release, so you already expected modularity in your modularity so you can modulate while you modulate, yes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Product Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    4 armor special abilities&lt;br/&gt;    1 specific magic armor - the conductor's overcoat&lt;br/&gt;    2 weapon special abilities&lt;br/&gt;    3 specific magic weapons&lt;br/&gt;    16 other magic items&lt;br/&gt;    the sequin vest modular magic item with 15 variants&lt;br/&gt;    the moor cowbell magic item with 11 variants&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
