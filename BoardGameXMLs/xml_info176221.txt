			<description>Pharaoh needs his newest pyramid to be built, and he turns to you, the various government contractors and architects to help him build it. Each player bids secretly the amount that they would pay Pharaoh to build his pyramid. The winner then gets to try to build the next block in Pharaoh's pyramid. As a reward for building each block, you will receive some of Pharaoh's valuable gold. The player with the most gold in the end wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is challenging to build Pharaoh's pyramid because you have to pay to supply enough people and resources to build each block. But that is left to chance. Each player determines how much they would like to spend on their roll, but they only get one opportunity to succeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is broken down into levels, rounds, and stages. There are three levels in the game, one for each layer of the pyramid. As the pyramid gets taller, the game gets more challenging. Each level is broken into rounds, one block is built each round. Will you end with the most of Pharaoh's gold?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
