							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Myrmidons Expansion</name>
									
			<description>The base game contains 12 myrmidon pieces (two each of six different types) (as well as a 6&amp;times;7 checkered board and a cotton case). This expansion contains 28 additional pieces (two each of 14 new different types) in order to provide quite a few additional playing configurations.  The base game allowed 720 starting combinations for each army, amounting to 518,400 distinct setups, with just its 6 pieces for each team.  The Myrmidons Expansion gives each player nearly two million (1,860,480) starting configurations, for well over three trillion (3,461,385,830,400) setups for a six-piece-per-side setup.  If you choose the new 12-piece-per-side option, each player will have nearly seven trillion (6,704,425,728,000) setups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion was first available through nestorbooster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
