			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ebethan Game Designs is proud to present four original class archetypes for use with Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition: The Heroes of Mind and Madness!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this pack are: The Anti-Mage, the Xanthine Mind, the Shadow, and the Oath of Secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rangers may now take up the path of the Anti-Mage, mentally prepared to take down their sorcerous foes before they can mutter their incantations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sorcerers of the Xanthine Mind origin bridge the gap between this reality and another. Their very presence warps the world around them, and their abilities fill their enemies minds with abject terror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rogues can now disappear as the Shadow: an operative trained to erase his very existence from the minds of those he comes across.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paladins with a bend towards the cryptic and occult may swear the Oath of Secrets: hidden knowledge and dark understanding keeps you one step ahead of those who would unveil the secrets of your order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
