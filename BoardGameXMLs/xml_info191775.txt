							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Manticore Power Armor</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eat Flechette!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The A-OSM Model XI Manticore is well-respected throughout the Core Systems as a power armor that brings strength without sacrificing speed or protection! Popular among Meteor Baron militias, Planetary Tech-Kings, and Core System arena fighters, the XI Manticore is more than a match for anyone who can&amp;rsquo;t afford the advantage of real power. Or at least, that's what the advertising hype says.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lily Compton, a well-known competitor in the DM (Death Match) circuit seems less impressed with its off-the shelf options. Her custom-mod Manticore trades flechette for plasma, and she's beefed up the armor plate in one arm. But it's still a Manticore, and she uses it to good effect!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes background and Pathfinder Roleplaying Game stats for the stock Manticore, Lily's modified suit, and Lily herself (a human daredevil, a class taken from Anachronistic Adventures but with all the rules to run her as presented included).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
