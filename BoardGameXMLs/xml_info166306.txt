			<description>In Comparity: Films, players must place their movie cards on the table in a grid according to when they think the movie was released and how much money they think it earned: the lower-left of the grid for low-earning movies and earlier release dates, and the upper-right of the grid for high-earning movies and later release dates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you can place a card in the grid or check if a previous player placed their card correctly. If you check and the placement is correct, you must draw a card, but if it was placed incorrectly then the person who played it must draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who manages to get rid of all their cards first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magellan also publishes another version of the game, Comparity: USSR, with the same gameplay but different cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
