			<description>A balancing/stacking dexterity game with a timing element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns trying to stack little plastic barrels and planks onto a platform. The platform has a timer built in that is turned on at the beginning of each turn and switched off at the end of turn. The platform turns/wobbles. If barrels fall down, the active player has to stack all the barrels in other players' colours before he/she is allowed to use the off-switch. If the time runs out, the platform tilts, all barrels tumble down and the game is over. The player who has the fewest barrels left wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The level of difficulty can be adjusted with a switch. A solo variant exists in which the player tries to beat either a time record or how many barrels they manage to stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
