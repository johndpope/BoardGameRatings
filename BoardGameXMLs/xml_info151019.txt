							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wargame: Poland 1939</name>
									
			<description>Developer Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Case White, the invasion of Poland 1939.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a wargame, developed in html5/javascript and Cocoonjs. Please post comments. Note that it requires higher end devices to work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game simulates the 1939 Axis invasion of Poland by Germany and their Slovakian allies. The game focuses on the Axis invasion, and does not cover the Soviet invasion.&lt;br/&gt;You can play against another player &amp;quot;hotseat&amp;quot; or else play either side against your device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay involves moving your units on a map of Poland. The map is organised into hexes to regulate movement. If you tap on a unit, hexes it can move to are highlighted in yellow. Tap on a highlighted hex to move there. If there is an enemy unit present, combat will occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The units represent the military formations actually present in 1939. Mostly these are divisions, but some are brigades or army headquarters. You can place (stack) up to five units in a single hex. Tapping on the hex will rotate the units, with the selected one at the top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Copyright DK Simulations Ltd&lt;br/&gt;Artwork by Gonzalo Santacruz de la Torre&lt;br/&gt;Map with permission from Poland Crushed by Schutze Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
