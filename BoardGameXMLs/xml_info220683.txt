			<description>Narrative Role-Playing in the Pulp Tradition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sword and sorcery remains a popular genre and has been since its inception in the 1930s. But this has undergone many changes in almost a century despite being one of the oldest of the &amp;quot;modern&amp;quot; fantasy styles, again, in testament to its enduring charm...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood of Pangea is sword and sorcery role-playing with some modern innovations. For instance, the rules are extremely simple and depend largely on narrative elements for character creation and general gameplay, including the ways of magic and sorcery, although none of this is new or even particularly modern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conceived in another time, sword and sorcery was a rugged literary genre, one born in the yellowed pages of cheap (and tawdry by the standard of the day) pulp magazines. Here the violent, and even sensual, thrills were devoured by what might be called the first generation of modern fantasy fans, and the attraction continues!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
