							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Under Construction</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At many large skyscraper or highrise building construction sites it is common practice that the finished lower floors are already rented out while higher floors are still being furnished and in some cases even higher floors are still under construction or not yet built at all. The case is similar here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This floor is still a bare bones concrete skeleton for the better part and the signs of ongoing construction can be seen everywhere. Pipes, boards, sacks of cement, tiles and carpets are stacked everywhere and still await their eventual use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Construction is making progress though, as the already tiles stairs up from the lower floor and the finished elevator indicate. Part of the floor has even been tiled already. Give the craftsmen a few more days to put in doors and plumbing as well as a few other odds and ends and the floor will be as good as finished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
