			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's see what's in his pockets. That might give us a clue to who he was.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This list features 100 items that might be found in the pockets or purse of someone in the 1920's. Some items are fairly boring (mints, subway tokens), while others tell a story (handwritten directions to a secret club, newspaper clipping about a recent theater opening), but all of them let you know something about the person who was carrying them. So, whether the party is trying to figure out the identity of a dead man or someone just happens to have rather light fingers, you'll be prepared with this list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
