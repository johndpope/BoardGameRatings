			<description>Kokkolan laivanvarustajat - Skeppsredarna i Gamla Carleby (Shipowners of Kokkola) is a historical boardgame where players try to become the richest shipowner in Northern Europe. The game takes place in the 18th and 19th centuries, when Kokkola was one of the most significant maritime towns in Finland and a major export hub, especially of tar and timber - essential commodities for the large navies of the major European powers of the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the beginning each player has a small ship which can carry one unit of cargo (initially, tar). Cargoes have a fixed buying price and profit depends on which port they are sold in. Each port provides 1 or 2 types of cargo, roughly historical - London wants tar and timber, provides luxuries and salt - and by trading in this way, players try to amass the biggest fortune before the cargoes run out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round a player can sell or buy cargo and buy a bigger ship (carries 2 units) or cannon, which protects from pirates. Movement is by dice rolling, and before sailing a player takes a 'sea-card' with varying results - a pilot who helps in reaching the next port, pirates who steal the cargo, favourable or adverse winds or a special price event. The latter are also historical, such as the unrest following the French Revolution causing increased demand for grain in Amsterdam, or events of the Crimean War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the last cargo is bought, the game ends and the player with most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
