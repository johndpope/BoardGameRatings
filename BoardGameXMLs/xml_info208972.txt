			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a Great Prize Comes Great Peril in this 8th-level pirate adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A richly laden imperial merchant ship caught on a sandbar presents a tempting target to a crew of daring pirates. Her holds may be bursting with swag, but they are also laden with soldiers, with a cruel captain at the helm. At any moment the sails of her imperial escorts may appear on the horizon, but your scurvy scalawags have found her first. A daring assault might bring you more plunder than you've seen in a year, but many pirates greedy for gold have lingered too long over a prize they thought safe, until an enemy fleet sent them to a watery grave. Can the PCs stage a lightning raid on the immobilized ship and get away with their ill-gotten gains? Dare they risk a Raid on the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s Hand?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raid on the Emperor's Hand is a 5E adventure for 8th level characters and is the latest in our series of pirate-themed Islands of Plunder adventures for the 5th Edition of the world's most famous roleplaying game. This adventure is easily dropped into any ocean voyage or as part of a full-fledged seafaring pirate campaign, and it can be used on its own or with the companion adventures in this series like Spices and Flesh, Tarin's Crown, and Scourge of the Steaming Isle! Grab this 26-page pirate adventure today and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
