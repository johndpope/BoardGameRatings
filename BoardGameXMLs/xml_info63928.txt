			<description>Portrays the disastrous Commonwealth raid against the German-held French port city of Dieppe in 1942. The game uses a simplified version of the D-Day at Omaha Beach system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(from Publisher website :)Operation Jubilee: Dieppe, August 1942 (OJ) is a purpose-designed solitaire game, by John Butterfield, simulating the disastrous Commonwealth raid against the German-held French port of Dieppe on 19 August 1942. It uses an evolution of his well-liked system from our earlier boxed game release: D-Day on Omaha Beach.&lt;br/&gt;Historically, a mixed force of Canadian troops and tanks and British Commandos landed on several beaches along a 16-mile stretch of coast, with a variety of objectives. While the commando raids on the flanks met with some success, the major action against Dieppe was a costly failure. It didn&amp;rsquo;t come close to achieving its objectives, and over 75 percent of that landing force were killed or captured. You control the CW forces assaulting the beaches and struggling to achieve their objectives against intense German resistance. The game system controls the German forces that oppose you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall 34x22&amp;rdquo; large-hex map, which is cut in half and reassembled into a 17&amp;quot;x42&amp;quot; play area, consists of three sector maps: the main map showing the French port of Dieppe and surrounding areas, and two smaller maps portraying coastal areas east and west of the main map. The main map is divided into four areas: Blue Beach, Dieppe town, Green Beach and Rear. Each hex represents 400 meters (438 yards) across; each game turn equals 20 minutes. Units of maneuver are companies and batteries; there are 176 large-size NATO-style and iconic counters in the mix.&lt;br/&gt; Rules cover such things as: coastal battery fire, random events, unit depth, command-control and communication, air attack, &amp;ldquo;what if&amp;rdquo; variants, amphibious warfare and much more. The game can be completed in about three to four hours. The turn sequence is as follows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I. CW Amphibious Transport Phase&lt;br/&gt;1. Unit Transport&lt;br/&gt;2. Landing Check&lt;br/&gt;II. Operations Phase&lt;br/&gt;III. Commonwealth Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;1. Beach Landings or Evacuation.&lt;br/&gt;2. CW Actions&lt;br/&gt;3. Recovery&lt;br/&gt;IV. End of Turn Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
