			<description>Time travel has recently been advanced far enough for humans to be able to travel back into history.  You are a historical scholar who wants to find out what really happened in history, not what you read about in the history books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your mission is to travel back into history to find out what really happened.  If you are successful, you will become a world renowned historian.  If you are not successful, you know the chances are high that you will not make it back alive&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
