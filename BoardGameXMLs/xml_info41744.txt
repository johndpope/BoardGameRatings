			<description>Sej is a dicing game of part chance and part skill for two players. It is a fictional game played in the novel &amp;quot;Serpent's Reach&amp;quot; by C. J. Cherryh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sej is played with two six-sided dice and three four-sided wands with symbols and colors on each wand face. The players alternately play Hands, which involves casting the wands; both players then roll the dice for procession of the points represented by the wands cast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The skill of the game is to determine whether to risk playing the Hand cast or to pass it. The game is won by the first player to accumulate 100 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
