			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Messerschmitt Bf.109 was one of the first truly modern fighters of WW2. Originally conceived as an interceptor, the Bf.109 fulfilled multiple roles, as bomber escort, fighter-bomber, ground&amp;ndash;attack aircraft, and reconnaissance aircraft. The final production version of the Bf.109 was the K series, or &amp;ldquo;Kurf&amp;uuml;rst.&amp;rdquo; Externally similar to the G series, it had a large number of internal and aerodynamic changes that improved its effectiveness and remedied existing flaws, which kept it competitive against rival fighters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Messerschmitt Bf.109 K&amp;ndash;4 (9./JG3)&lt;br/&gt;Belonging to the proud Jagdgeschwader 9, which fought throughout the war, this Bf.109 defended German borders from the Allied advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Messerschmitt Bf.109 K&amp;ndash;4 (1./JG77)&lt;br/&gt;Jagdgeschwader 77 used the last version of Bf.109 to fight in the Reichsverteidigung (defense of the Reich) during the last days of WW2, to slow the inevitable German defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Messerschmitt Bf.109 K&amp;ndash;4 (Hartmann)&lt;br/&gt;Major Erich Hartmann, the greatest Ace of all time with 352 aerial victories, piloted many different airplanes, including the latest versions of Bf.109.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each WW2 Wings of Glory&amp;reg; Airplane Pack is a ready&amp;ndash;to&amp;ndash;play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW2 Wings of Glory game product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
