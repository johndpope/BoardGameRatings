			<description>Basketball on the blacktop, fast and physical half court 3-on-3:  that's Street Basketball, a two-player flicking game played on a custom wood surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 3 discs representing the players on his or her team.  Players take turns flicking their discs driving and defending, and passing and shooting the basketball disc.  Each time the basketball drops into the hole in front of the backboard, your team scores a point--two points if you launch from behind the arc.  Thematic action Cards can be used at key points in the game to change the momentum in your favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules and cards are available to make a do-it-yourself version.  Build the game, and check the rock!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Note: included is a Soccer game on the opposite side of the board that plays similar to air hockey)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
