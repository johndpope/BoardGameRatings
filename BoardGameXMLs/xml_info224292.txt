			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Nothing says &amp;quot;you're done for&amp;quot; like a charging Rhynan...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rhynans are a race of horned, humanoid pachyderms. They possess great strength and an almost tribal attitude to modern life. Power among the Rhynans is based on physical might among the males, with ritual combat determining leadership of the Rhynan tribes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rhynans still inhabit their home world Orbos, with tribes leading nomadic lives on the surface. Agriculture has been moved off-world to stations in low orbit, while mining operations are conducted on nearby planets and asteroid belts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play the charging, powerful Rhynan and explore these lawful warriors and all of the things that they have to offer a group: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Incredibly strong and smart with natural armor as tough as any!&lt;br/&gt;    Resistant to cold and able to attack with their powerful horn!&lt;br/&gt;    Explore the Tribal Warrior racial archetype and learn about their flexible defense feature&lt;br/&gt;    Wield the mighty Barachas two-headed combat staff in battle to the terror of your foes or to pacify your enemies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
