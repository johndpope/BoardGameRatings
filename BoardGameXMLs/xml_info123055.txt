			<description>Pirates of Gold Cove is a trick-taking card game for the whole family. New players will find the game easy to play with waves of fun for everyone. Weathered card players will enjoy the strategy of play, as vast as the deep blue sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player that is dealt the ship starts the game, and each other player matches the color if they can, trying to take the trick with the highest numbered card of that color. There are cards that you want to capture for more points like treasure maps, chests, and gold coins. There is even one card that you want to avoid capturing, the dreaded Magistrate Burns. Once all the cards have been played and all tricks taken, the player that captured the Duchess Carmen receives the cards that were removed from the game, and perhaps even more points. Players total their points and are paid in gold and silver coins. Once all the coins are given out, the player with the most treasure is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes high-quality plastic coated playing cards and a sack full of gold and silver coins. Whimsical characters illustrated by Monte Moore in bright colors make the game as attractive as it is fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
