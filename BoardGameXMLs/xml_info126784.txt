							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">For They Are Legion</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They walk among us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Call them Demons, or Devils, or whatever you like, but the Hellborn moves amongst humanity, picking off the weak, corrupting the innocence, and exhorting the decadent. Why they here? We do not know. All that we can do is hope that they can be found and stopped before they bring down the final fall of man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And there is hope, there is always hope&amp;hellip; but for only those who are strong and brave enough to take on such a task. These few work for Pandora, a secret conspiracy dedicated to protecting humanity at any cost, and it is they who dedicate their lives to ensure we can live ours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For They Are Legion (FTAL) is a modern day game of investigation and horrors that sets determined and powerful humans against a veiled invasion of the demon, fiends and other entities from hell. Using the Mini Six game system, it allows players to take the role of chosen heroes, working for a special and secret organisation, as they attempt to track down and neutralise a threat that most of humanity can barely comprehend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individuals recruited for Pandora have their own unique abilities, although none are powerful enough to attempt to overcome a demon alone. Fortunately, few, if any demon is willing to face humanity in its true form, and these creatures instead look to corrupt and subvert mankind to its own ends; a trait that while hiding them from most mortals creates a trail that ultimately will lead to their undoing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But why have they come? That can not be answered. Perhaps they look to create their own power bases, or maybe finish the work of their lord Lucifer. It could be that they have been driven from hell, by their own kind or in some ongoing war with agents of God. Whatever the true reason for their arrival, we can only hope to discover it before it is too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
