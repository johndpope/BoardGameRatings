			<description>This simple game is played with a standard deck of cards. There is a pot won by the player who holds the highest trump at the end of the game. Each player is dealt 3 cards face down, and a trump is chosen. In a turn a player reveals the top card of her stack. If it is the highest trump at that moment, it can be kept or sold. This continues until all the cards are revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
