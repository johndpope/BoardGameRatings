			<description>Content:1 board, 4 Donald-pawns, 4 pawn holders, 32 playing cards with the different values&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fields on the game plan are numbered in sequenc from 1 to 71 and also show numbers on ther borders. These numbers tell the players which card they must play in order to leave each respective field.&lt;br/&gt;The active player calls out a number and plays a card face down. The other players now have the task: believe that number or don't believe.Ifthactive player was right but his card was doubted, then he can move by twice that number.The doubter has to go back the same amount. The opposite way it goes when the doubter is right.&lt;br/&gt;The game  is over as soon as a player reaches the finishing field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
