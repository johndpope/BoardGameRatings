			<description>Brocante is a interesting trade game, with a significant bit of luck, but also an important tactical element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players earn money while playing the lottery, and by reselling the objects which they accrue. The easy way is in the price of the objects. In each type, there are four prices. Most expensive is to be sold first. The prices are 3500, 2500, 1500 and 1000. Players collect the eight objects in a set, without doubles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to buy the objects that would complete other players' sets, especially to double the price when selling to the player who needs the object (and reap greater profits).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, while objects are purchased from most-to-least expensive, they are sold least-to-most expensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
