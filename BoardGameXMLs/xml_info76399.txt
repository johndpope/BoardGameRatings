							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heavy Metal Magic</name>
									
			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since rock and heavy metal in particular began it has always been linked to the darkest vices, black magic, and Satan worship, most of it a load of utter shit. The truth, if only you knew, now that would blow your mind farther than L S fucking D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Somewhere in a garage, some band cranked the watts a little too high, stirred up by hormones, by rage, by all the primal passionate things that fuel heavy metal, and they reached out with a chord so pure it pulled secrets down from the heavens, and up from the hells below. Magic, the arcane art, was reborn. It didn't take long to spread; the power itself was a rush greater than any drug, greater than the adulation of millions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But for everything, there is a price. And magic, it's got one hell of a letdown. You fuel it or it consumes you, you use it or it uses you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It didn't take long for the constant fueling and usage to draw lines in the sand between various bands. Some fighting the good fight, living the hedonism to its fullest, but fighting back at the things which devour and taint the pure exchange of power, passion, and heavy metal. Some fed without reutrn, those became the first to burn out, they used too much, without sharing, without relenting and it tainted them, some turned to demons to boost their power, the old Satan worship becoming all too real.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you're in a band. You have a voice, some talent, and the power. What do you do with it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
