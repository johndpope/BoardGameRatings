							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Leapin&#039; Letters</name>
									
			<description>Players try to obtain the plastic letters necessary to spell a nonsensical word printed on the player's card. These letters are drawn from the lid of the plastic container the game comes in. If a player draws a letter that he doesn't need, it is placed into a plastic device which catapults it into the air when a lever is hit, and any player who needs the letter to complete their word tries to catch it as it came down. First player to complete their word wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
