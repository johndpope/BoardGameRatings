			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MAC - Mobile Artificial Consciousness.  Any self-motivating machine intelligence designed to operate some kind of body that allows it mobility.  Of course, MACs are *able* to move, but like mobile homes, don't always do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robo - Shorthand for RObot BOdy.  Humans and MACs alike can pilot Robos, but MACs do a much better job and tend to dominate the scene... hence the name of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is for all the fans of giant robot cartoons and live action shows who want to roleplay those kind of characters, but have found other systems too wargame-like.  RoboMACs tries to have more of a dramatic, cinematic flavor to it, and tends to replace hard numbers with general traits and 'hooks.'  The bias will be towards RoboMACs as opposed to humans piloting Robos, and towards transforming Robos over static ones, due to the author's love of Hasbro's Transformers (TM) toys and cartoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
