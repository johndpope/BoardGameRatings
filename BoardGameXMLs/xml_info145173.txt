			<description>In White Lotus Masters, players use Focus to play cards, called Techniques, to attack opponents and to defend from incoming attacks. Players gain and lose Position in a struggle to see who will be victorious before either player runs out of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use the same seven cards to attack and defend, which leads to interesting decisions about how much to attack or if incoming attacks should be blocked at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play as an Air Master, a Water Master, a Fire Master, an Earth Master, or a Master Warrior. There are many ways to play, including a team game and random play. The game includes over 200 cards, making variety of play vast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available exclusively on thegamecrafter.com!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
