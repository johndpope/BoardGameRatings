							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Major Bowes Amateur Hour Game</name>
									
			<description>A simple, roll and move game with the object being to be the first player to acquire 5000 votes. Like the Bowes radio show, where if he did not like your act he rang a loud GONG signifying the end of your radio audition, the game has a couple of GONG spaces, where landing on them returns you to the beginning of the game (unlike the radio show where being gonged meant the end of your performance). Other spaces can make you go back some number of spaces. or move ahead some number of spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game (Popular Edition 1) is based on the MAJOR BOWES' Original Amateur hour on radio (the predecessor to the Ted Mack Amateur hour on TV in the early 1950's). Major Bowes who never was in the military insisted on being addressed by his self-proclaimed title of &amp;quot;MAJOR&amp;quot; also had a saying that he was famous for. He always said &amp;quot;ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!&amp;quot; after each performer had either finished his/her act or been gonged off the show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Famous words associated with the show and printed on the game board:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE SPINS AND WHERE SHE STOPS NOBODY KNOWS&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PUBLISHER: WARNER MFG CO, BENNINGTON, VT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
