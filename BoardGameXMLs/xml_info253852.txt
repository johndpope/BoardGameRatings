							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Honor Bound</name>
									
			<description>This game explores honor culture and masculinity through the lens of an old fashioned duel. The game starts just after a challenge is issued and follows the duelists, seconds, doctor, and judge as they struggle to de-escalate a fraught situation in a society that values reputation above all else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a game for exactly six players that takes roughly two hours to play. It starts with a workshop that will get you up to speed on the setting and themes of the game; you'll also establish the incident that triggered the duel. Once play begins, you'll be struggling to de-escalate the situation even as the characters negotiate the final details of weapons, ground, and range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
