			<description>Keno is a big game in most gambling houses in USA. Keno parlors have replaced Cocktail lounges in most of the resort Casinos.&lt;br/&gt;Depending upon which historian you listen to Keno was either brought into this country by the Chinese in the early 1800's or it was developed from the Italian &amp;quot;Lotto&amp;quot; a descendant of the Italian National Lottery. Either way Keno became a fast and furious gambling game in the &amp;quot;dives&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;joints&amp;quot; that abounded in New Orleans around the mid 1800's. It soon made its way west to where money was to be won.&lt;br/&gt;In the Classic Games' published version of Keno, each player choose from 1 to 15 numbers between 1-80. The points are awarded according to the number of hits made in a drawing of 20 numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
