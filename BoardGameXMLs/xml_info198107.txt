							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Play-Doh Monster Smash Game</name>
									
			<description>A space ship full of hungry space monsters are invading your house to steal your food!  Work together as a team to squish and smush the little creatures before they reach the fridge!  The goofy monsters are molded from the colorful Play-Doh and players use a silly sneaker or boot smasher to mash them.  It&amp;egrave;s giggly, squishy fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Monster Smash, players mold as many monsters out of Play-Doh as they wish.  They will place a monster at each of the flying saucer spaces on the board.  Once a piece is moved, they replace it with another monster.  To move pieces, players use a spinner and depending on what color it lands on, they move that colored monster to the next space on the board.  If the player spins a smush or a double smush, they get to smush monsters on the board and remove them from the game.  If players eliminate all of the monsters from the game, they win.  If any three monsters reach the fridge space on the board, you lose!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
