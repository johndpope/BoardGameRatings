							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gobseck Vaultwright, Meister of the Golden Anvil</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything has a cost: power, gold, and especially dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even in the realm of Dream, money is power and even dreams can be put up as collateral. In the decadent shadow of the Coliseum Morpheuon the wagers of bloodsport and the price of glory demand a steady flow of wealth and someone to mind it, and that miser is Gobseck Vaultwright, the black little heart of a corrupt empire. Commanding a titanic living vault that is likely the safest place in the multiverse, Gobseck sits atop a treasure large enough to ransom a thousand kings, giving him the power to grant fortunes, call due life-debts, and crush dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product provides Game Masters with details on a baleful banker found amongst the Faces of the Tarnished Souk, ready for immediate use in any campaign - but especially for use within the Coliseum Morpheuon.  Each entry features ingenious stat-blocks from multiple OGL sources, history, motivation, secrets, and insight into the NPC&amp;rsquo;s most carefully guarded dreams, along with complete game statistics for low, middle, and high levels of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Gobseck Vaultwright, a malodorous moneylender with injurious interest rates.&lt;br/&gt;    CR 20 Male air-infused smoke duergar fighter (unbreakable) 3/magister 16&lt;br/&gt;    CR 13 Male air-infused duergar fighter (unbreakable) 2/magister 11&lt;br/&gt;    CR 6 Male duergar fighter (unbreakable) 1/magister 6&lt;br/&gt;    Air-infused and Smoke creature templates, for truly vaporous villains, plus two additional templates&lt;br/&gt;    Feats for magnificent magistes and stone-faced dwarfs&lt;br/&gt;    New weapon enhancements, armor enhancements, and magical items&lt;br/&gt;    A living vault so tough that your medical bills won't be worth the trouble of cracking it&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
