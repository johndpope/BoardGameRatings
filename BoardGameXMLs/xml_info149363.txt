							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wonderbook: Book of Spells</name>
									
			<description>What if a book could come to life?&lt;br/&gt;Master more than 20 spells and turn your living room into the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts library in Wonderbook: Book of Spells on PlayStation 3. Explore the enchanted Book of Spells which, in the world of Harry Potter, was written over 200 years ago by Miranda Goshawk, to learn all a budding witch or wizard needs to know to cast powerful hexes, charms and spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After following the on-screen instructions to set up your Wonderbook peripheral, PlayStation Eye camera and PlayStation Move motion controller, you're ready to enter Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and begin your training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First things first: choose your wand and the Hogwarts house you wish to join. If you have an account at Pottermore.com &amp;ndash; the unique online experience built around the Harry Potter books &amp;ndash; this information will be automatically uploaded into your game. Swish your wand around a bit to get used to it, then start exploring the Book of Spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Split into five chapters and featuring new, original writing from Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling, Wonderbook: Book of Spells conjures up a world that leaps out at you from its ancient pages. As you're guided through the book, you'll discover the funny stories behind its spells, take cover as mysterious creatures come to life and, most importantly, put the magic you learn into practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
