			<description>From Gamearchive.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The popular story of &amp;quot;Robinson Crusoe&amp;quot; forms the basis for this game for children. In the pack of cards, with which  the game is played are several cards which have exact duplicates, but there is only one card each for Robinson Crusoe, Friday and Rescue Ship. The cards are dealt out one at a time and if the player has two cards that are the same kind, that is 2 Goats, Turtles,  Cannibals etc. the player pairs them up and they are thrown out of the game. Then the start player begins by drawing randomly from the player to his left 1 card. If he pairs a card the pair is removed, Then the next player draws a card. Play continues this way until one player successfully gets the 3 cards CRUSOE,FRIDAY, and RESCUE in his hand whereby winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
