			<description>Arcana Heart 2 is the sequel to Arcana Heart. It was the first game in the series to be developed and published by Examu after the rights of the franchise had been transferred to the company from Yuki Enterprise. It was also the first game for Examu's proprietary eX-BOARD, an arcade board based on Windows XP Embedded that would become the standard platform for the rest of the series and other arcade games published by Examu. The game was unveiled at the AOU2008 Amusement Expo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game featured 6 new fighters, each with their own unique Arcana. New techniques were also included, such as the Arcana Blast, allowing the player to become temporarily invulnerable; Arcana Homing, a feature allowing the player to simultaneously close the distance between them and the opponent while homing in on them; and the Critical Heart, a devastating special attack unique to each character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On October 30, 2008, Examu released a major update to Arcana Heart 2 called Suggoi! Arcana Heart 2. This version further balanced the game and fixed some bugs. It also featured some design changes, such as new character illustrations and a red redesign for Kaya Hirotaka. New additions included an additional stage; three new characters including Nazuna Inuwaka, Akane Inuwaka, and Parace L'Sia; their respective Arcana, Kayatsuhime (Flower), Fenex (Sound), Parace L'sia (Life); new color palettes for each character, available by pressing the Start button on the character select screen; and an additional training mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suggoi! Arcana Heart 2 was further updated to version 2.6 on February 27, 2009.  AQ Interactive handled the PlayStation 2 port of Suggoi! Arcana Heart 2, which was released only in Japan on April 9, 2009. It was planned for a worldwide release but was cancelled due to the sales of the first one. It was only cancelled due to poor performance and slowdown, making the port weaker than the arcade perfect port of the first one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Arcana Heart&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two game websites: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.examu.co.jp/arcanaheart2/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.examu.co.jp/arcanaheart2/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;and &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.examu.co.jp/sugokana2/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.examu.co.jp/sugokana2/&lt;/a&gt;.
