							<name  sortindex="1">Professeure Caboche La faune de l&#039;Amérique du Nord</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Professor Noggin&#039;s Wildlife of North America</name>
									
			<description>Another of the Professor Noggin series of children's trivia games.  The mechanics are fairly trivial:  one attempts to collect question cards by answering trivia questions: in this case, perhaps surprisingly, questions about North American plants and animals.  Each card has six questions by default, three each graded Hard and Easy.  (The suggestion is that parents should choose Hard questions and children Easy when playing together.)  The player rolls a d3 to select the question randomly.  If answered correctly, the card is retained by the answerer; if incorrectly, the card is returned to the bottom of the pile.  Occasionally, a card contains a special &amp;quot;claim a card from another player&amp;quot; action instead of a question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
