			<description>From the &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.GamingReport.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.GamingReport.com&lt;/a&gt; review:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Cyber-Sea by Delmer Esau is a new version of an independent board game for two to four players. Like the original game, The Fish Tank, each player of this game controls a team of soldiers including a ronin, a hacker, and three foot soldiers on a mission to rescue a genetic super fish. Well, rescue may be a little overly noble. Steal the genetic super-fish is a more accurate description of the game mission. Naturally, in the world of undersea warfare, the competition is fierce so killing as many of the enemy is a possibly close second game objective. The teams fight each other, while having to overcome locked hatchways, flooded chambers, and automatic guns. The game is available from RPGNow.com in electronic PDF format. To play, all the components have to be printed out with subsequent cutting, folding, and possibly even gluing required.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the product website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Infiltrate a Pacifica research facility with your hired Ronin and their mercenary team. Hack the installation computer net with your Fader. Lay down the firepower with the Gun-suit heavy combat unit. Kick ass. Take names. Then put the game away till you do it again the next day...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is available from &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.blackpowdergames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.blackpowdergames.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is out of print.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
