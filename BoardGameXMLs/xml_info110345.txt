							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">21st Century Gold Rush</name>
									
			<description>It's 'Gold Rush' time again, here in the 21st Century! With the price of gold skyrocketing higher every day, it&amp;rsquo;s time you got a piece of the action. Round up a few hombre's to compete against and start digging for gold. Get your hands on a few mines and while your at it, jump a few claims from your competitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an all out rush to see who can wrangle up one million dollars in gold nuggets first and get them safely to the bank. But watch out! When your dealing with gold, there is always some outlaw lurking around to steal it from you. It&amp;rsquo;s going to take more than a little luck to finish first in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling the dice and moving around the board in hopes of staking claims in one of the five mines available. Once a player obtains a share in a mine he may dig in it, once he lands or passes the &amp;lsquo;mine for gold&amp;rsquo; space. When a player mines for gold he draws one of the &amp;lsquo;golden nugget&amp;rsquo; cards and records the amount of gold found, on a score sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, the price of gold will fluctuate when players land on the &amp;lsquo;gold rises&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;gold drops&amp;rsquo; spaces, causing his gold to be worth more or less throughout the game. He must try to get this gold to the bank while the price of gold is still high, in order to receive cash payment for his gold. He may of course, deposit as much or as little of his gold as he wishes, hoping for higher prices later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He must be careful though. There are outlaws waiting to steal all un deposited gold from you. Throughout the game, players can jump claims of other players, thus stealing away their shares of mines, preventing them from gaining more gold. The player who manages to get one million cash on hand first will win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
