							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Russo-Georgian War of 2008</name>
									
			<description>The Russo-Georgian War of 2008 is a DTP simulation game covering the military action during that conflict from August 8 2008 through August 12, 2008.  This involved full-on combat between the Republic of Georgia and the Russian Federation plus two breakaway regions of Georgia; Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The fighting began in the Ossetia (the primary Georgian target) and quickly spread to all of Georgia and Abkhazia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first glance this seems like a fight between David and Goliath - the vast Russian military against a state with only about 20,000 active duty personnel in it's military and only 7 combat jets - but closer examination reveals it was a somewhat stiffer competition with several points of interest.  It was with this thought that this game was inspired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is relatively straight forward to learn and play and the system, while adapted to the conflict, very familiar to most wargamers.  Learning and playing the game can be done fairly quickly.  The game is play-balanced due to a selection of real-world scenarios, including the historical situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Desk Top Published (DTP)game - gluing and cutting of counters is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCALE - Game Turns represent 12 hours, units typically represent battallions of 500 - 1000 men plus some smaller and larger, units and hexes on the map are approximately 12 kilometers across.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
