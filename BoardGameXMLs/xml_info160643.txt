							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Asterisk</name>
									
			<description>Asterisk is an abstract connection game in which players aim to create several connections at once. It is a descendant of the Game of Y.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has three goals: to connect the three sides of the board with pieces of his or her own color (dark or light), shape (hexagonal or circular), and marking (asterisked or empty). But none of the pieces will serve all three of a player's goals, so every piece played potentially benefits the opponent. There are a limited number of pieces of each type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player to make two or more of his or her connections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
