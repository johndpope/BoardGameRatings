							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aftermath! Technology! (Second edition)</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;Aftermath! Technology! provides background information for setting up and running Aftermath! campaigns with a variety of backgrounds. The original game is set up to allow for various causes of the collapse and this book looks at several that go beyond the usual nuclear war scenario. What if the Earth had been invaded by aliens using higher technology? What if space travel were truly possible? The non-human races and technology are discussed in the following sections:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Non-Human races and their character generation with skills and equipment&lt;br/&gt;     Cybernetics, including descriptions and Barter Point Values&lt;br/&gt;     Space Travel with the possible use of Hyperspace, ship design, and new skills&lt;br/&gt;     High-Tech equipment from gear to weapons to vehicles&lt;br/&gt;     Alien Creatures&lt;br/&gt;     Netrunning with both equipment and architecture of the Net&lt;br/&gt;     Robots and Wardroids&lt;br/&gt;     Tech Levels for skills, arms and armor, and all weapons and equipment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aftermath! Technology! will allow campaigns set in a post-holocaust world of higher technology. The high-tech may be the result of the civilization-ending catastrophy happening well into the future or the result of contact or invasion by non-human creatures/aliens who have taken over the Earth or simply done enough damage to the basic infrastructure of society as to bring about the collapse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
