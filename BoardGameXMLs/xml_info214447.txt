			<description>After the Disaster: Triage is a solitaire game where you determine who will survive the aftermath of a terrible earthquake. As the disaster coordinator, manage your staff in admitting and healing patients, siphoning diesel for the generator, and keeping the hospital intact during aftershocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn begins with handling new issues for the hospital: Survivors who want help. Aftershocks that damage the hospital. A diesel source that could be scavenged. And more. After managing the situation, you'll balance patient survival with keeping the hospital running during the crisis using your remaining action points. Each turn ends with the generator consuming diesel and survivors left outside worsening or taking matters into their own hands. The game ends after the immediate crisis has passed and all patients have been healed or have passed on&amp;hellip;or the hospital collapses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
