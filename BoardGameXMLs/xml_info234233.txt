			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 40 x 40 inch, full color battlemap of an Ancient Island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with Square, Hex and No Overlay and the Virtual Tabletop Map (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;There was once a great war wizard and artificer called Narevalhast. His mighty golems were huge collosi that turned the tide of battle for whoever would pay him the most. When he gathered enough resources, he made himself an army of them and tried to overthrow all of the kingdoms and empires he had once fought for and against all over the continent. He failed and retreated to his island lair. But his enemies followed him even there. He made his last stand with the two largest golems ever seen, made from the island&amp;rsquo;s stone. The death toll was horrific. The legends say that the golems were only toppled after men with gigantic picks climbed the crushed piles of dead men to reach weak points in the knees and ankles of the golems. Narevalhast himself died in a fiery blaze that consumed most of his wizard&amp;rsquo;s tower.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Librarian Cormakhen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golem Island Ruins features a circular island surrounded by shallows and shoals at night. There is an island with a tower built on top of it in the northwest connected to the main island with a wooden ramp, a pier for docking in the southwest, and a bridge to a very small island in the southeast with a single old tree. The center of the island has curious statues of large feet and calves, all that remains of once larger collosi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golem Island Ruins is intended for use in fantasy games. It may also be of use as an anachronistic location in modern or pulp games as an archaeological site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cormakhen&amp;rsquo;s Curiosity: A librarian goes on and on about a war wizard named Narevalhast and finally gets to the point. He asks the adventurers to find Narevalhast&amp;rsquo;s island and chronicle its remains. He&amp;rsquo;ll even pay for a boat ride for them to get into the area where the island is supposed to be located. He also gives them a map of the continent and surrounding oceans with the island map area circled and a blank scroll to draw a map of the island for him. When they reach the island, the ship docks at the southwest pier and they can go explore the island&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
