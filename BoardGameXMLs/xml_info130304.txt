			<description>Dux Britanniarum is a table top miniatures wargame by the Too Fat Lardies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dux Britanniarum is a set of rules for wargaming and campaigning in the Age of Arthur. Covering the period 450AD to 600AD the rule book combine all you need to fight tabletop games and to run a virtually paper-free campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are designed to be played with relatively small forces. A Saxon starter Army is just 38 figures, a British starter army is only 44 figures, both of which can be purchased from our web site in 28mm although the rules play just as well with larger or smaller figures. Forces are grouped into six figures for most warriors and four figures for skirmish and missile troops or cavalry. The tabletop rules are D6 based and simple to use, with the single page playsheet on the rear cover of the rules covering 99% of situations. Activation is determined by a speedy card driven system where all units get to act in any single turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included with the rules is an A3 pull out map of Britian in around 450AD which provides the background setting to the Dux Britanniarum campaign. Your characters start their campaign as a Saxon Lord or a Romano-British Tribune and will attempt to gain fortune and reputation on the battlefield as you fight to defend or conquer a Romano-British kingdom. Included with the rules are four detailed maps which together cover moderd Britain, Wales and lowland Scotland along with an historical background to each kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A character generation system will add colour to your campaign as your Nobles assume their own personalities. The terrain and scenario generator allows games to be set up quickly and to result in an almost infinite variety of games to keep you challenged and enjoying the action. The tabletop rules provide for a fast play system with a fun and exciting narrative as your Nobles lead their men into battle. The unique three phase battle system and force morale mechanism allows you to fight your battles with a minimum of preparation and tie those results into the campaign system for a really exciting and fun gaming experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
