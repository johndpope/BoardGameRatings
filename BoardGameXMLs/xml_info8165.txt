							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Himalaya Blackjack</name>
									
			<description>Gear-up for blackjack - Himalayan style.  Components include 6 reference cards, 15 camp cards, and a deck of 58 playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are shuffled and stacked. One card is revealed to begin the discard pile. Players alternate taking turns by drawing the top card from the draw pile or drawing the top card from the discard pile. The goal is to get exactly 1000 in Meter cards. Having reached the goal, a player gets a Camp card. Some cards are Shortcuts which award a Camp card for having only 800 meters. There are hazard cards which hinder the unlucky player who draws one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first person to get four Camp cards and collect exactly 1000 meters more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
