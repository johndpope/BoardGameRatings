			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based upon a novel (by the same author) and attempts to re-create the tone and setting of the novel, though the rules could easily be adapted to any setting.  Magic in the system is elemental and all effects are tied to one of seven types of element: fire, water, earth, air, wood, metal, and spirit.  Each element has a specific area in which it works best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have typical demographic data determined with narrative tags.  Characters also have a flaw--either wrath, envy, gluttony, sloth, lust, greed, or pride.  Characters select an element.  Characters have seven Attributes (Agility, Strength, Endurance, Intelligence, Belief, Manipulation, and Technology) among which the player distributes a total of 280 points from a pool.  Characters may also have Skills which have another pool of 280 points distributed among them.  Skills may improve with use.  The game lists several sample Skills but it is up to the player to select whatever Skills their character should have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action resolution involves a d100 roll; &amp;quot;rolling under&amp;quot; a Skill or Attribute indicates success.  The Game Master may modify the role (generally up to +/- 30) based on difficulty.  Magic is handled under a separate system and depends upon the character's Level with the Element upon which the magic is based.  Levels run 1-6 for characters, with 3 being typical.  Under normal circumstances, a Level 1 magic use has a 50% chance to succeed, with each subsequent level boosting the chance by 10%.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
