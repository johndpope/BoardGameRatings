							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bugbears of the Frozen Tears</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mangled cliff tops of the White Cliffs shelter a terrible menace for when the night air fills with the sound of invidious croaking, the Frozen Tears bugbears are on the hunt. Sadists, these bugbears stalk the passes on their bloated ice toad steeds seeking those foolish enough to venture out after dark. Chasing their prey, the Frozen Tears seek to prolong their quarry&amp;rsquo;s fear as long as possible. At the climax of their hunt, they strike taking their victim&amp;rsquo;s head as a trophy, the moment of fear forever frozen in ice by vile magic. It is these horrific expressions that earn the bugbears their standing in the tribe and the favour of their horrendous and profane witch-mother.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bugbears of the Frozen Tears presents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Four new alternate race and class features&lt;br/&gt;    Four new feats&lt;br/&gt;    Four new spells&lt;br/&gt;    Three new magic items used by powerful tribal members&lt;br/&gt;    One new weapon: the double-headed throwing kukri&lt;br/&gt;    One new demonic lord: Vhen Nhar&lt;br/&gt;    One new monster: the Vhen Nhar spawn&lt;br/&gt;    Ten stat blocks (ranging in CR from 5-15)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
