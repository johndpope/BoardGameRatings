			<description>The Throne is a fun and easy card game where players strive to be the new King of the Seven Kingdoms.&lt;br/&gt;Each turn players draw and play cards that represent the places and the characters in the saga. Each has a value, and some have an effect that brings an advantage to the player who plays it. The game ends when the court of a player reaches a certain number of cards. Who accumulates the most points wins and becomes King until it dies in a hunt for wild boar or poisoned by a cup of wine during her marriage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ENJOY!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
