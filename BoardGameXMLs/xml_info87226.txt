			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tired of suffering the whims of polyhedral dice? 54 - Fantasy is a fantasy RPG that uses a hand of cards instead of dice to determine the outcome of your adventures. The game draws on many familiar and classic fantasy races, professions and magic, while remaining open and simple enough to design your own content quickly and easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;54 - Fantasy doesn't bog you down in rules. By presenting an open framework, it allows both players and game masters to concentrate on the game's story and action without becoming bogged down into tactical game play or become buried under a pile of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you get is a doorway to your imagination; enough material to keep you entertained for days and months ahead, with an easy-to-learn and use system that you can expand on in any way you choose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 185 page rulebook contains the complete player and game master's rules, as well as a printable character sheet. It also contains a section of premade monsters and a sample adventure to get you started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
