							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cycling Manager</name>
									
			<description>Become Team Manager of a professional cycling team and discover the thrills and disappointments of this key actor of cycling races. Manage the real teams and stars over the course of a single race or over a season. This game is aimed at all cycling and gaming fans, be them hardcore fans or just occasional watchers and gamers looking for new gaming sensations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will have the opportunity to lead your team to the highest peaks (such as the mythic Alpe d&amp;rsquo;Huez climb) as well as to the top of the worldwide rankings. A team of 15 to 40 cyclists to manage, a race calendar to organize, strategies to define, real-time races with all its events: attacks, counter-attacks, manage the punch, speed and fatigue of each cyclist. You can interact in real-time during the race, choose your riders actions and adapt your strategy to what your opponents are doing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will also experience the ups and downs of a cycling manager. Your racers will have bad times, maybe your best rider will fall hard and have to quit during a major race, requiring that you change your strategy and goals on the fly. But the thrills will also be there as you&amp;rsquo;ll see your top rider arrive in triumph, with arms raised, at the top of the highest European peaks and winning the most prestigious races&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.cyanide-studio.com/games/cycling/2001/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.cyanide-studio.com/games/cycling/2001/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
