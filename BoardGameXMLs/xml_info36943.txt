			<description>The game is really simple.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a plastic &amp;quot;fry-pan&amp;quot; and there is a central &amp;quot;stove&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;The fry-pans are shaped as mazed and the stove has holes with points on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players drop 1-3 balls on their fry-pans and by balancing the fry-pan aim to drop the balls on the higher value holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
