							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beloved of Set</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some centuries ago a Poet and a Priestess fell in love. Which is almost never a good thing in real life, though it makes for fantastic drama. Anyway, to make an old story short, they were about to elope when they were discovered. The Poet was enslaved by the powerful High Priest, Set's Beloved and the Priestess was stood up at their meeting place. She waited for three days and three nights before finally, having become quite stupidly distraught, throwing herself into the nearby well. Now, on moonless nights, the Priestess's ghost can be found waiting by the well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
