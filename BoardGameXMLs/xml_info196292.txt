			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game promotes storytelling over mechanics, though a variety of options make it a robust tabletop system.  It is presented as a generic, universal system that is flexible enough to accommodate most genres of play.  Characters select a Kind (incorporating some elements of Race and some of Class, from more traditional games) and generate Attributes from a points pool.  Characters also have several derived values and Traits.  The document includes a two-page print-and-play character sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game version is available for free download form the publisher's site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
