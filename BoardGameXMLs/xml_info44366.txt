			<description>This is an action/dexterity game where players attempt to out draw the outlaw.  The game features a large approximately 36 inch tall outlaw with a built in timer that covers most of his chest.  The timer features four quadrants numbered 0, 1, 2, 3.  Players use the dart launching &amp;quot;six shooter&amp;quot; to stop the arm on the timer in the lowest scoring quadrant they can, if at all.  Of course if the timer makes it all the way around the outlaw wins!  Points are scored in rounds similar to golf, where the lowest score (fastest times) win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
