			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supersell is a game in which each player buys cars from the bank and sell them again at a profit to an independent buyer (not one of the players) who move around the board according to throws of the dice. The fun lies in anticipating where the buyer will stop and being there at the right time with your salesmen and cars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to accumulate &amp;pound;15000 in cash is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
