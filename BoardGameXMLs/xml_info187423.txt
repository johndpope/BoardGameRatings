			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Face the horrors of the Forgotten Graveyard!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The crumbling necropolis has always been a dangerous place, crawling with undead and occasionally attracting the most unsavory characters. Word has reached the commander of the Border Patrol, though, that their may be some new evil afoot within the haunted depths of the Forgotten Graveyard. Can your characters survive long enough to find out what it is?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Universal Adventures The Forgotten Graveyard is a new Adventure Module. Set north of the town of Ravenor along the western edge of Greyshroud Ridge, you can combine the adventure with Expedition to Erathor and the expansion pack, Greyshroud Ridge, to create an overland journey. The Adventure Module includes a new Adventure Record, 9 Adventure cards, 9 Encounter cards, 9 Event cards, 9 Search cards, 18 Treasure cards, 9 Dark Chasm cards, 9 Winged Statue cards, 9 Blackstone Tomb cards and 9 Infernex cards. In addition, The Forgotten Graveyard can be used as the surface area for additional adventures set beneath the necropolis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gather your heroes and enter the depths of the Forgotten Graveyard, if you dare. Suitable for use with any fantasy role playing game, The Forgotten Graveyard can be played solo or with a group, with or without a GM. The adventure is highly re-playable and compatible with other Universal Adventures cards. In addition, you can combine the cards with other cards from the series, or cards from other Universal Adventures products, to create your own adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adventure Module is a new, simple way to play fantasy adventures. The organization and presentation of the adventures allows for quick setup, quick play and gives you the ability to focus on the action and &amp;ldquo;story&amp;rdquo; while leaving you the option to include tactical action and combat if you desire. Enter a new and exciting world of adventure, full of wonder and surprises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
