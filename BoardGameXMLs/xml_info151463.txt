							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">UNSanctioned: The Dream Corrupted</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's 2003. But not the 2003 you remember. The bright shining dream of the world has been sold out in exchange for alleged security and global unity. The government of the United States has used its &amp;quot;big stick&amp;quot; in diplomacy for so long that they all but own the planet. Of course, they don't admit it. But its been patently obvious for years who controls the UN and why... In this same world, beings with amazing powers began to appear in the late 1940s. Since then they've become a part of our everyday lives. But the UN exerts controls on those beings. If you have metahuman abilities, you must be sanctioned by the UN to use them. If not, you are...UNSANCTIONED! The world is not what it could be. Players take the role of unsanctioned metahumans in a world dominated by the UN. Can they stand idly by while the Peacekeepers, led by the powerful Peacemaker, continue their campaign of oppression? Or will they stand up and be counted alongside the Unsanctioned Rebels, led by the Hero of the People, as they fight for truth, justice, and the right to determine your own destiny? You must decide! Complete game in one book, includes the Paradigm Shift system, lots of sample characters (good &amp;amp; evil) and a mini-campaign. More than 160 pages!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
