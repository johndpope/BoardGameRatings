							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Hungry Undead</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mysteries of a thousand years lie hidden in the caverns of Sleeping Bear Rock... A lone pinnacle of rock stands high above the deserted hills. Within the haunted tower lies the ages-old crypt of the Sharjani Lords, once known as the Drinkers of Blood. Untold treasures and horrors await the intrepid adventurers that dare enter the halls of the ancient tomb. The portal lies open; can the characters defeat the dark lords within their ancient sepulchre before they rise again to drown the Young Kingdoms in rivers of blood?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed for use with five to seven characters of 7th through 9th level, though it can easily be adapted for use with any mid-level to high-level adventuring group. Information on the Sharjani Lords, new types of undead and the modern incarnation of the Drinkers of Blood are included with this adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hungry Undead Kalamar Quest adventure and supplement is designed to provide both a challenging adventure and useful supplementary campaign material. The material within is set in the popular Kingdoms of Kalamar fantasy campaign setting but can easily be used with any fantasy role-playing game setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game adventure and supplement is suitable for use with any fantasy role-playing system, including but not limited to Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, Rolemaster and HackMaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
