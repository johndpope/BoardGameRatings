			<description>A strategy game which aims to be an abstraction of contemporary society in the same way that Chess is an abstraction of feudalism. Each player has ten pieces: a man, woman, and child (people); a wheel, column and bullet (tools); a shield; and three pragmas. People and pragmas cannot attack people, and the child cannot attack tools. Shields cannot be attacked at all except from behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to score points by attacking the opponent's people and pragmas, or by occupying special spots on the board known as &amp;quot;origons&amp;quot;. The game ends immediately if one player occupies all four origons, or if one player has lost two of their three people. Otherwise the game continues until a predetermined score is reached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
