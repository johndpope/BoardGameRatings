			<description>In Demontowers the players are warlords in a fantasy land whose identities are secret. They try to conquer some of the so called demontowers to win the game, and at the same time try to guess which lords the other players are to gain certain advantages over them. You can also reveal your lord to start a revolution in which a certain race defects to your side, so that winning is easier, but you have all the other players against you at this time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original Game version is only suited for 2-4 players. A 5- or 6-player-game is possible with an expansion, which comes with additional character-cards and all the other necessary stuff except for the missing dice-sets for the additional players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
