			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Cold Roads of Nordia, the northern continent on the world-plane of Nia. This supplement provides information on the Ra&amp;rsquo;althuuk goblin nation, the largest Chaos organization in the Arrowflight world. It details their beliefs and lifestyle, delves into the lives of those who border their territory, and touches on the isolated nation of Tolak, a land under siege from within.
