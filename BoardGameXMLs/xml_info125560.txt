							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kangaroos &amp; Koalas: The Aussie game of ups and downs</name>
									
			<description>There are 4 games and a double-sided playing board. The main game, Kangaroos and Koalas, is a Snakes and Ladders type of roll and move game, where the aim of the game is to reward positive character traits displayed by the kangaroos and to penalise negative character traits displayed by the koalas by moving playing pieces to higher or lower squares. For example, landing on 'Caution' moves a player up to Safety' and landing on 'Selfish' moves a player back to 'Lonely'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second game, 'Where's Kolo?' is a search and find game, involving luck as well as colour, number and picture recognition. Players race around the board, trying to find Kolo Koala underneath special gumnut tokens. Finding a &amp;quot;Here's Kolo&amp;quot; token allows a player to collect a piece of a jigsaw puzzle. The first to complete their puzzle is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for two other games, using the same components, are included in the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: 1 double-sided game board, 1 die, 6 playing pieces, tokens, 4 jigsaws&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
