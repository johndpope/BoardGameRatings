			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 40 x 40 inch, Black and White Blueprint of a Beach House.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Hex, Square and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s hit the beach everyone!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beach House is our first blueprint style map. This is a hand-drawn, black and white map. The product includes the floor plan of a large ground floor and a smaller first floor. Each individual room in the house is labeled and includes hand-drawn objects signifying all of the furnishings of the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beach House is intended for use in modern games. It could also easily be used in near future science fiction games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beach House makes an excellent floor plan for a vacation spot or summerhouse for a rich character. With plenty of couches and a guest bedroom, their friends can also crash there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a superhero game, it would make a lot of sense for a residence for the rich superhero&amp;rsquo;s secret identity. The gym and sauna allows the hero to train and work out and a garage with fast cars to get to crime scenes. Perhaps there is even a secret lair/basement level underneath the beach house. Our Hideout map would make an excellent secret basement level, perhaps underneath the garage for this purpose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alter Ego&amp;rsquo;s End: Somehow a super villain has found out the super hero&amp;rsquo;s secret identity. With him residing at his summer beach house, the super villain marshals all his henchmen and underlings to go and attack the super hero. Whether the super villain himself joins in depends on the super villain&amp;rsquo;s strength. A mastermind would sit back and watch and a brute would join the fray for example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The super hero may have been surprised, but by chance he was looking out the sunrise or sunset terrace and sees the army headed towards his beach house. Does he escape to fight another day by running to the garage and quickly starting one of his cars for a thrilling chase? Brazenly open the front door and dare them to fight him in the doorway?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
