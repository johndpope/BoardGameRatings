			<description>Space is still a dangerous placed for even the most seasoned starship pilot, full of asteroids, multicolored floating blocks, and space mines. It's still even more dangerous when your accelerator is stuck to the floor and your brakes are out. Can you survive long enough to get that elusive high score or are you still destined to add a new crater to the face of an unsuspecting asteroid?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Features You Will Love*:&lt;br/&gt; 5 game modes (forward and reverse too)!&lt;br/&gt; 10 all new waves (iOS)!&lt;br/&gt; Even better super retro graphic emulation!&lt;br/&gt; Asteroids twice as big as your head!&lt;br/&gt; Maniacal laughter that still mocks your death!&lt;br/&gt; More space bees than ever before!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The definition of love is left to the full discretion of Fun Infused Games. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
