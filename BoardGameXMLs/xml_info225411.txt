			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the owner of the Lady Rita, a creaky diesel riverboat based in Manaus. Your present trip is a supply run to the Haswell Expedition. You also have a package for Haswell himself, which you intend to hand-deliver because he hasn&amp;rsquo;t paid you for the last run of supplies yet. He owes you money that you badly need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Whom We Trust was originally written for the Call of Cthulhu tournament at Convulsion &amp;rsquo;96. Since then it has been played a number of times and suffered a variety of edits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Whom We Trust was also used as the RPGA tournament scenario at GenconUK 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
