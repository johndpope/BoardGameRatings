							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Raid: Pirate&#039;s Plunder</name>
									
			<description>Take control of a 17th century pirate and roam the seven seas in search of booty.  Compete against your fellow pirates to hunt and take down merchant ships of varying value in order to increase your overall wealth.  The pirate with the most booty after all merchant ships have been captured becomes the most infamous pirate and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is made up of hex tiles and can be set randomly or as agreed upon by all players.  The majority of the hexes are open seas, but watch out for obstacles! Sea serpents, giant squid, super volcanoes, ship wrecks, and sand bars all stand in the way of you and your reward.  Navigate through the obstacles by moving in only one direction each turn.  Land on a hex on which a merchant ship lies to capture your booty.  To secure your prize permanently, take the merchant ship to Black Bart's Lagoon.  Be careful to avoid other pirates, as they can steal the ship before you get to Black Bart's Lagoon.  The lagoon, along with the tavern, fortress, and port, are all special hex tiles that serve different purposes in the game.  As you roam the seas, watch out for the navy!  If the naval ship lands on the same hex as you, you are sent back to your home port.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a ship is brought to Black Bart's Lagoon and secured, you can either hold on to your booty or invest it in special equipment that could potentially help you commandeer additional ships.  In the end, the player with the most cash in hand, not including special equipment, is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
