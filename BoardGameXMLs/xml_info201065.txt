			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Dragonlands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or the island of the evil Doctor Hybrid. Or the bandit bestiary of the Crime Zoo. Or the Spirit Forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The point is, sometimes heroes end up in some super-strange places, and a GM may find himself with a sudden need for some super-weird stat blocks. No GM has time to write up every possible Demonic Guard of the Tyrant Sorcerer, band of giants from the Nine Realms of Valgard, or aberrant minion of Professor Atlantis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now with the Super Powered Bestiary, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to! We have stat blocks and descriptions of more than 200 monsters, plus numerous alternate versions, and four brand-new villains designed to make use of many of the creatures in this book. We include dozens of monsters, animals, angels, aberrations, dragons, undead, and giant bugs compatible with the 3rd Ed M&amp;amp;M rules. Obviously of great use to anyone running a fantasy-themed game with this ruleset, the Super Power Bestiary also provides options for more traditional supers and masked adventurer games! Whenever a GM wants the heroes have to face the angelic agents of the Eternal Judgement, or the alien rope-monsters crash landing in a saucer, or any encounter with creatures far from human, all the stats the GM needs for the encounter can easily be pulled from the Super Powered Bestiary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
