			<description>&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insidious is an Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure for 3-6 characters of levels 1-3. The first print run had a size of 250 copies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure shows the AD&amp;amp;D 1st Edition logo, but is not an officially licensed AD&amp;amp;D product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The once peaceful town of Sheridan Springs is in dire trouble. Several townsfolk are missing. Strange creatures have been seen moving in the woods around town. At night, sounds that chill the soul can be heard coming from the town cemetery and the ruins north of town. Some even say that the dead are restless and walk again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town sheriff has sent an urgent request for aid. Will your young and inexperienced group of adventurers heed the call? Fame and reward await those that can identify and defeat the evil menacing the town of Sheridan Springs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TSR1 - Insidious is a stand-alone adventure. It was written using rules for Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, but by changing a few statistics it can be used with any fantasy role-playing system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A DM's Dream come true!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember when you had to spend hours flipping through rulebooks, referencing charts and tables, just to get an adventure module ready for play? Then, after the adventure is over, comes more reading and math to figure out each creatures Experience Points. No More! We have done all that and more for you. We call it &amp;quot;Ready-To-Roll&amp;quot;. Now with minimal preparation time you can be ready to lead a party of foolhardy adventurers to glory or doom. We have even included eight pregenerated characters. Get Gaming!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
