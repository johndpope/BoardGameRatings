			<description>This is a very basic yacht-racing game by All-Fair. The four tracks of 45 spaces include two bonus spaces and two hazard spaces. Moves are determined by a 1-6 spinner. First player to reach the finish line by exact spin wins. The board includes the rules and art of sailing ships, buoys, lighthouses and gulls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a second spin-and-move game called Circus pasted to the inside of the box lid. This also has four tracks leading from the start to the Big Top Entrance. Each track has 36 spaces including two bonus spaces and two hazards. The board decoration includes  the rules and art of a marching clown, trained seal and lion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
