			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This free ebook is written for and by GMs like you who are designing tournament deathtrap dungeons for any fantasy adventure RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each entry in this ebook spotlights one of the 22 cards in the legendary Deck of Many Things, with each card representing one of the fundamental types of challenges crusaders might face in a lethal tournament delve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ebook is intended to be an inspirational tool and quick reference guide you can flip through as you're plotting your dungeon's encounters. This ebook can be read over the course&lt;br/&gt;of your lunch hour, and you don't need a physical Deck of Many Things to use the advice presented. However, a printable Deck of Many Things has been provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT IS A DEATHTRAP DUNGEON?&lt;br/&gt;A deathtrap dungeon is an adventure that focuses exclusively on the players&amp;rsquo; struggle against lethal challenges laid down by the dungeon&amp;rsquo;s designer. Deathtrap dungeons embrace a boardor&lt;br/&gt;video game-like experience where the PCs are the players&amp;rsquo; disposable game pieces with which they fight monsters, dodge traps, and solve puzzles in the game world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT IS A TOURNAMENT DUNGEON?&lt;br/&gt;A tournament dungeon is a deathtrap dungeon adventure run competitively at a convention like GenCon or PAX. Each group of competitors plays through the dungeon, trying to earn as&lt;br/&gt;many points as possible for their team before the time limit elapses. At the end of the tournament, the teams with the highest scores go home with prizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
