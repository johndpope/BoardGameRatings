							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mega Campaign: Lost Victories</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to the Vastness of Russia June 22, 1941 Germany lanches the greatest invasion in history by attacking the Soviet Union. Army Group South will be in charge of the invasion into southern part of the Soviet Union. Fight the war in the vast expanse of the Ukraine as Adolf Hitler launches his Wehrmacht on a quest for metals, oil, grain and coal. All of the major battles in the Ukraine are included. Your kampfgruppe will participate in the initial crossing of the frontier at the San River and from there the rest depends on your skills as the kampfgruppe commander. You will feel the fear of facing the famous T-34 tank for the first time and the tension of the closing of the great pocket at Kiev. You will also take part in the largest tank battle ever fought at Dubno where 5000 machines dueled over a 4 day period. You may also be called on to rescue a surrounded artillery battery at Uman or to follow in the path of the British Light Brigade at Balaclava. You will face the struggle of keeping your kampfgruppe advancing in the fall rains the mud and stopping Soviet breakout attempts from the Kiev and Uman pockets. Brent Richards Lost Victories 1941 Mega Campaign will put you on the front lines as part of Army Group South as no other game has. In Lost Victories 1941 you will find dozens of pictures, backgrounds, historical documents and insights into the 1941 campaign, plus numerous maps to help find out where you are. As you win (or lose) battles, a map will display them for you. For exceeding valor you may receive special awards. Even the Iron Cross itself. What is a Mega Campaign you ask? Mega-Campaigns are specially designed and programmed campaign systems for Matrix Games Steel Panthers: World at War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
