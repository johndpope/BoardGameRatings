							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rabbidgerbal&#039;s Biplane Dogfight Game</name>
									
			<description>A miniatures air combat game based around the author's rudimentary homemade biplane miniatures which use a plastic soda bottle-cap as a base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is measured in inches, with the distance moved based on the roll of one to four six sided dice. The basic planes move 2d6 inches each turn. The number of dice or distance rolled will be modified if the aircraft dives, turns, or performs special maneuvers (stall, climb, barrel roll, or loop).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is resolved by the attacker rolling machine gun dice and the defender rolling maneuverability dice. For the basic planes, each player rolls 3d6, with a hit being scored if the attacker rolls a higher total. A plane is shot down after taking six hits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced rules cover gun jams, sun position, rear gunners, custom planes, pilot skill levels, and damage effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variant rules suggestions are included for Star Wars dogfights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
