			<description>From Publishers Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Men are endlessly mystified about the contents of a woman's handbag, their wardrobe and what they read in their magazines... equally, women don't understand a man's need for gadgets, power tools and their obsession with sport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The His and Hers board game is a celebration of our differences as seen through everyday THINGS. Divide your friends into single sex teams, and have some FUN celebrating what makes women women and men men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His and Hers is definitely not a &amp;quot;rude and crude&amp;quot; game, but please note that a few of the questions do have adult content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic Gameplay Synopsis:&lt;br/&gt;The two teams split by gender, each take turns asking questions from the cards, which have different types of questions and categories of a generally trivia style. (each team has a designated &amp;quot;Question Master&amp;quot;) Each question also has a color code associated with it. Should the question asked be answered correctly, the answering team's playing piece is moved on the board to the next space that corresponds to that particular question color code. Should they answer incorrectly, the opposing team gets a chance to steal the question and possible board movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;- Playing Board&lt;br/&gt;- 400 Question Cards (200 Pink and 200 Blue)&lt;br/&gt;- 2 Playing pieces (Pink and Blue)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
