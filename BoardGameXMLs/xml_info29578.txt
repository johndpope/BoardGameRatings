			<description>WYSIWYG (pronounced WIZ-ee-wig) is an acronym used in many computer applications that stands for &amp;quot;What you see is what you get&amp;quot;. Since in this two player card game, the players get to see what cards they are playing for before they play to a trick, it's an appropriate title. WYSIWYG borrows some elements from a couple of old games called German Whist and Honeymoon Bridge, while adding in some new ideas of its own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WYSIWYG is a trick taking card game for two players. After each player is dealt 13 cards, a hand proceeds in four separate phases. First, each player evaluates their hand and announces the total. Then, a bidding session takes place to establish the hand's trump suit and objective. Next, the players play to tricks, with the winner of each trick replacing their card with their choice of one of two exposed cards and the loser receiving the other card. Each trick is worth one mark. This continues until the deck is depleted. Finally, the players play out the remainder of their cards to tricks, each of which is worth two marks. If the player who set the trump suit has earned marks at least equal to a goal based upon the two hand evaluations and his bid, he wins the hand. Play continues until one of the players scores 50 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(description by Larry Levy)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
