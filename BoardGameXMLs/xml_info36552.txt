Players then randomly choose a criminal to track. Opposing players then are provided the clue envelopes for their opponent's criminal. Players then place their pin on the map where their criminal is wanted. Highest roll of the dice goes first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;The Play&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then attempt to track their criminal first by reading the biographical card, and judging what location the next clue to his whereabouts may be obtained. Dice are then rolled to determine the distance the player can move, the full amount of two dice for air travel, the large number of the two for express train, or the smaller number of the two dice for automobile. Upon arrival at his destination he will ask the player holding his clue envelope if a clue is found at the location. If no clue is found he must return to the city he started from, or last city where he obtained a clue. Players may also send other players on missions to uncover clues for them. If the player being sent refuses the mission he must pay $100 into the reward pool. If he goes on the mission and uncovers a clue for another player he will receive $50 from that player. If no clue is uncovered, the player sending him on the mission pays $50 to the reward pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final clue will advise of the death or capture of the criminal.The first player to uncover all of the clues for his criminal receives $1000, the second to finish $800, and third $600, and any players after $500, or until the reward pool money is exhausted. The player with the most reward money at the end is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
