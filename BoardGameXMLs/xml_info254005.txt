							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Instructor&#039;s Manual (Non-Public Half) for Ways and Means, 1935: Debating the Social Security Act through Math</name>
									
			<description>A Math-Centered Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ways and Means, 1935 is an in-class role-playing game meant for Quantitative Literacy/Quantitative Reasoning classes. Students debate various social insurance policies (pensions, disability, unemployment, aid to widows &amp;amp; orphans, and health care) in their roles as members of the US House of Representatives. It is meant to occupy two weeks of class time, one for preparation and one for role-playing (with a spacer week or two on some other topics between them), while using many skills and concepts from earlier in the class.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;The material in this half of the instructors' guide is meant to not be posted...in a way that students from anywhere can find it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
