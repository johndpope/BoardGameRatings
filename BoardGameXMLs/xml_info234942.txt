							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Terror at Thistletown</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our fearless adventurers find themselves in the charming halfling village of Thistletown, nestled deep within the forests of Candleshire Fiefdom.  An old friend, Tarsi Vyr, has called for help investigating the disappearance of her father. Dominii Vyr. She's retraced his footsteps and after weeks of searching, the trail went cold in Thistletown. He was last seen at the local inn, getting ready to set out for Candleshire, but he never made it. Rumors of orcs, dire wolves, and worse abound. Will the players solve the mystery, or will they become just another set of victims?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 4th - 6th level character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
