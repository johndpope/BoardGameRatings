			<description>&amp;quot;Chewzacookie&amp;quot; is a game that appeared as a two page magazine insert for McCalls magazine in September, 1964. Players draw punch-out cardboard chits (substituting for a 1-5 die roll), move their tokens around the board, and chow down on Nabisco cookies. The first player who reaches the end space by exact count gets the bank of five cookies -- one of each type shown in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the cookies featured may have undergone name changes and variant expansions, but they all remain in the Nabisco line: Vanilla Wafers, Nabisco Chocolate Chip Cookies, Fig Newtons, Oreos, and Lorna Doones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no explicit rule declaring a winner. Presumably the winner is the player with the most cookies in hand (or consumed), but one might also assume that Nabisco wanted all the players to feel like winners for getting to eat their cookies. (Of course, the ultimate loser is the person who had to furnish all the cookies for the game!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
