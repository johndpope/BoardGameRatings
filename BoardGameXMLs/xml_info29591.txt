			<description>Extrapolated from &amp;quot;Play the Game&amp;quot; by Brian Love. This is a 2 to 4 player game that is won by throwing low numbers on the dice instead of high numbers. The vortex of the game is a continuation of spaces on a board that slowly progresses from the outside edge to the center. Once you have reached the center spot your piece is out of the game,  so the object is to be the last player with an active piece on the board. If you land on a space with another player you change places with that player. When getting close to the center of the board landing on  a circle of your color carries you into the vortex and your piece is lost. If you land on a space of your color called a refuge space your piece is sheltered there until you roll a 6. If you land a someone else's refuge place you lose a turn unless you are displaced by the correct owner of that space, in which case you are sent to the vortex. The winner is the last player left with a piece on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
