							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Donald Duck&#039;s Speedboat</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Donald Duck's Speedboat is an Atari 2600 game were you play as Donald racing across multiple screens to the finish.  The game is completely high score based.  The faster you drive your speedboat the faster your score increases.  Since this was marketed to kids you cannont die but only stop when running into obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was planned for release in America and Europe when originally developed but was cancelled due the trouble the video game industry was facing at the time.  It ended up only being published and released in Brazil by Polyvox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
