							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Old Sloculm Road</name>
									
			<description>Designer's Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the forth micro-adventure in the series.  This one takes the party just south on a now extinct kingdom.  Old Sloculm road is barely an imprint on the countryside, but the party will find the bridge in good repair.  While the centuries have consumed the nearly everything of the Northman, the bridge's caretaker remains.  And for a single shiny he'll allow you to use his bridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old Sloculm Road is a play on the troll under the bridge.  This troll is named Samuel, he lives in the toll house, likes to play chess and in my head, sounds a lot like Hugh Grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a fun encounter that can attract the party an unusual follower.  Samuel is a fierce creature, but would rather talk about the amazing red bird he saw that morning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Micro Location published on Tim Shorts's Patreon page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
