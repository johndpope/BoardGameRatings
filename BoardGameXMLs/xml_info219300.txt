							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heredium Menschen Göttern gleich</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Menschen G&amp;ouml;ttern gleich&amp;quot; is the first adventure band for the Heredium roleplay game. Designed for four to six players and starting characters, it is also easy to customise for experienced players.&lt;br/&gt;Ikari, a new drug that floods the streets of Hirohito City, has not only a high degree of dependency but can also transform people into wild animals that can no longer distinguish between good and evil. Liang, the leader of one of the most powerful families in Hirohito City, has made it his mission to extend his life and the new drug has a vital part in his endeavour, but which one? In &amp;quot;Menschen G&amp;ouml;ttern gleich&amp;quot; the characters are entangled in a vortex of intrigue, hatred, and violence, which not only makes them wander through the dangerous streets of the dome town but also leads to a murderous hunt through the burning steppe of Asia. Under the dawning sun of a world marked by the moonfall and mutations, the fate of the characters will be decided, and perhaps the power structure in Hirohito City, the heart of Temora, will change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
