							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mean Streets of Chicago</name>
									
			<description>The Mean Streets of Chicago is a card &amp;amp; dice driven solitaire game that takes place in Chicago during prohibition. Inspired by other Print &amp;amp; Play games on here, I have finally gotten this version tweaked where it is a challenge to play and gain the highest rankings but not impossible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn consists of four phases: Upkeep, Assignment, Actions &amp;amp; Events. You assign dice (the number of which is based on your reputation in the game) to actions each turn. One of which is take over a new location where you bring speakeasy's under your control. When all your actions have been completed you draw an event card and after it is resolved you go back to upkeep and repeat. The game will last 22 turns which is dictated by the Event Deck so no having to keep track of what turn you are on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are formatted to fit Fantasy Flight US Mini Sleeves (yellow).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
