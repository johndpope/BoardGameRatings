			<description>In Kaedama, you and a partner are new restaurant owners looking to spread the universal joy of ramen. You must manage customers, assemble bowls of ramen, and make enough money to someday buy the restaurant of your dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this 2 player co-operative game, one player is in charge of the 'Back of House' responsible for prepping and cooking food as well as washing dishes and plating. The other player controls the 'Front of House' by seating customers, upselling drinks &amp;amp; appetizers, and entertaining the guests. Each round, players will roll action dice to determine what actions they can take. However, in order to take an action, it must be paired with a limited pool of speed dice. You'll need to communicate and strategize on how best to use manage your time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be quick about it! No one likes a cold bowl of soup!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
