			<description>Pop'n Music (ポップンミュージック), most commonly shortened to Pop'n, PM or PNM, is a music video game in Konami's Bemani series. The game is notable for its bright colors, upbeat songs, and cute character graphics. Although Pop'n Music was originally intended to be played by couples on dates, it has greatly escalated in difficulty since early iterations, and has since then attracted many players of Beatmania and other Bemani games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pop'n Music 10 was the first home console version to be considered by fans to be '3rd generation.' These versions are a step up from the previous PS2 games with their more advanced interfaces and introduction of arcade accurate hi-speed mods ranging from 2 - 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pop'n music&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arcade Version also contains all the music from Pop'n Music 1-9. This version featured a magic theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
