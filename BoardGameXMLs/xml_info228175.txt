							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nightbreed Skirmish</name>
									
			<description>A 2-player tactical skirmish game with a Nightbreed Theme.  Humans (Naturals) are attacking Midian (a Necropolis, the home of the Nightbreed) in force.  One player is the Nightbreed.  The other player is the Humans (Naturals).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An 8 x 8 grid is used to depict the surface and upper layers of Midian.  Underground is a series of tunnels, chambers, and caverns.  The surface resembles a graveyard but with additional statues, fountains, walls, and tomb like structures that are actually dwellings and gates to the subterranean areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrain types are marked on the map according to players&amp;rsquo; preference. Some terrain types will be referenced by cards but terrain types comprise:  Clear (Paths, Roads), Graves, Fountain, Wall (and Gates), Trees, Tomb and Statue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a unique &amp;ldquo;army&amp;rdquo; list comprising 16 units of differing strengths (hit points), with differing characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a unique deck of cards of four different types (Attack, Defence, Move, Special)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up the decks are shuffled separately and units are placed in the back three rows of the player&amp;rsquo;s side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Naturals go first with players taking turns.  Each turn has 3 Phases: &lt;br/&gt;1. Draw Phase&lt;br/&gt;-  Draw 3 cards and place them in your hand. &lt;br/&gt;2. Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;-  Play cards (no limit). &lt;br/&gt;-  Play a Move card to move a unit the indicated (range) number of spaces. &lt;br/&gt;-  Use an Attack card to attack a unit at the indicated distance (range) from the attacking unit. &lt;br/&gt;-  Your opponent may use a Defence card to negate an Attack card.  &lt;br/&gt;-  An attack card that is not negated causes the target to lose 1 Hit. Use tokens to keep track of Damage (lost hits) sustained by units.  Any Unit reduced to zero Hits is killed. &lt;br/&gt;3. End Phase&lt;br/&gt;Max hand size is 7 cards.  Discard excess cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first side to lose 10 or more units will break and flee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
