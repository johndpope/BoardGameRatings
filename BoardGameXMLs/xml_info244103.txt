			<description>白と黒で (&amp;quot;En Blanc et Noir&amp;quot;) is a pattern matching card game with a deck of black or white cards, each with a pattern on the face. On their turn players take two actions, either drawing a card, playing a card face down onto the &amp;quot;map&amp;quot;, or playing a card in front of them face up that has a pattern matching the map for points.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends at the end of the turn that the last card is drawn. Players add up the cards played in front of them, minus the cards left in their hands, plus a bonus for certain cards matching the color found the most in the map, and the highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
