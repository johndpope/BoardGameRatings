			<description>Cosmic Supremacy is a FREE tick/turn-based massively multiplayer space strategy game with a 3D 'Galaxy View' interface. You share a galaxy with hundreds of players each with their own alien civilization. Some of them might turn out to be your enemies, others could be your allies. You need to explore the galaxy around you, discover new solar systems, colonise new planets, and expand your empire. You can design every ship in your fleet, and research new advanced technologies so that you can build faster and stronger ships that will give you the edge in epic battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
