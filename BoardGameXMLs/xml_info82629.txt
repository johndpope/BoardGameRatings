			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Pitstop, the player steered a F1 race car. There were six existing tracks to choose from:&lt;br/&gt; Monaco,&lt;br/&gt; Albi,&lt;br/&gt; Le Mans,&lt;br/&gt; Jarama, &lt;br/&gt; Kyalami and&lt;br/&gt; St.Jovite &lt;br/&gt;The view was 3rd person, camera hanging a short distance behind the car, and in a corner was an overview of the entire track, with a moving dot marking the position of the player's car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fuel ran out, and the entire tyre changed color indicating the wear. Racing slowly eroded the tyres. Pushing other cars of thetrack was possible, but eroded the tyres in an alarming way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a lap, the player could opt to drive his car into the pit. Then the screen changed into a pit view, and the player had to operate his pitcrew: one guy fuelling the car and a few others to change tyres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game allowed 4 players, but only one after the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
