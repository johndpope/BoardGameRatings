							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Trail to Napawekka Lake</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trail of Terror&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For years, the trail to Napawekka Lake has been a well kept secret. Snaking off into the dense, lonely expanse of the Canadian wilderness, it holds a powerful allure to those in search of adventure. Some take the trail to experience the wonders and beauty of nature. Some take it for exercise. Others take it to escape the busy hectic pace of the modern world. But this time, no matter why they take it, the people who do will wish like the dickens they hadn't. For the trail also holds a secret - a dark and sinister secret that has slept for years in the gloom and shadows of the ancient trees. Now, driven by an insatiable hunger, it stirs at last, twisting man and nature to its evil desires and growing stronger by the hour...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's Inside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trail to Napwekka Lake is a complete adventure Script for Horror Rules, the Simply Horrible RPG, a horror comedy game of ridiculous proportions. This supplement is packed with everything you need to play, including Bad Guys, Cast, backstory, artwork, Plot Pushers and enough Sequel Suggestions and Plot Twists to turn it into five adventures instead of one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
