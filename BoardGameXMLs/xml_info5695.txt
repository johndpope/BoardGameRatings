			<description>Described as &amp;quot;The funny Patents Game&amp;quot;... the game that keeps you guessing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a 224 page book which has patent drawings of close to 100 crazy and unusual items.  Your job is to identify the device, figure out what it does, and decide how it is supposed to work. Points are awarded for identifying the item.  Bonus points are awarded if the year the patent was granted can be guessed (within 7 years).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to 21 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most notable for the clever machine for die rolling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
