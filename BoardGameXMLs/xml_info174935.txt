							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Giant Slaying Spells</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ultimate Proof of Brains Over Brawns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Giants are fearsome foes that are never to be underestimated. Their great size makes even the dumbest and simplest among them, such as the lowly hill giants, into a serious threat, but the more powerful and cunning giants are much more dangerous still. Many adventurers make the mistake of attempting to fight these giants head-on, matching their might against those of these towering monstrosities. While admirable and heroic, this is also incredibly dangerous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains a selection of eleven spells from the spellbook of Tyram Tin-Whistle, an accomplished halfling mage and famous slayer of giants. These tried and true spells were specially formulated for dealing with giants, and will give any enterprising giant slayers a powerful edge. Included are spells designed to defend against these titans&amp;rsquo; favored weapons, and those that use their size against them. Further, readers will find a brief essay by Tyram Tin-Whistle himself, providing some useful pointers on how to go about combating these terrible titans. Even if you are blessed enough to live in a land free of giants, many of the spells in this tome are just as good when turned against other oversized creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
