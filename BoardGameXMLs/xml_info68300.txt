			<description>Game Master's Survival Pack - Volume 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ground plans for All Game Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every game master and self-made adventurer knows the problem: developing a great building.  Sometimes you need a castle or a mansion as a setting for your game, but have o time to create an elaborate building.  You grab something of your role-playing collection and skim the book for a floor plan your players don't already know and that fits, or you try to avoid the problem with some scribbled lines and a lot of phrases to describe the house.  As long term game masters, we have often been in this situation, and now we want to help you as well.  That is the reason why this booklet was created, a collection of complex floor plans for all sorts of occasions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure ideas with a fantasy setting use names, creatures and places of the fantasy world of Glorantha (with permission of Greg Stafford), well known as the default setting of the role playing games &amp;quot;RuneQuest&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;HeroQuest&amp;quot;.  Even so, the adventure ideas should be easily adaptable for most other fantasy settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find:&lt;br/&gt;Ten floor plans for all occasions.  Seven complex buildings, plus three inns in extra large size ready to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each building comes with:&lt;br/&gt;- a sketch of the building to show your players&lt;br/&gt;- two sets of complete floor plans:&lt;br/&gt;one for the players, the other for the GM&lt;br/&gt;- an adventure idea in/around this building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitable for ALL game systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
