							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Treasure Chase</name>
									
			<description>The game's designer emailed me a description of the game as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;rsquo;s a game of pirates, adventure, skill and skulduggery. In essence it&amp;rsquo;s a race to find the X square and discover the location of the hidden treasure. Along the way you have to collect eight various items to aid you in your expedition, but also look out for all the things which can trip you up and tunnels that can aid you in your search.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treasure chase is a whole lot of fun with just a little element of strategy thrown in and is designed for the whole family to play almost anywhere &amp;ndash; as there is no board. You just need a flat surface and up to 4 willing pirates!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next year we intend to release the garden size version - perfect for the out door and the beach.&amp;quot; This was emailed today 19 Nov 08 and so &amp;quot;next year&amp;quot; would mean 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
