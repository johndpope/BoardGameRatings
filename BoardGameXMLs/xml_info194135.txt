							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Amazons vs Valkyries: The Valkyrie</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Daughters of Aries and the Daughters of Odin&amp;hellip; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Mythic World of Chaos and War&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this file:  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Shield Maiden prestige class featuring the battle song special ability. &lt;br/&gt;    The Valkyrie advanced class featuring the greater battle song and fatal destiny abilities.  &lt;br/&gt;    Spell List for the Shield Maiden&lt;br/&gt;    The Valkyrie's Special Mount (Pegasus) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The history, culture, and social structure of the Valkyrie order is briefly outlined in this supplement along with details on a typical Valkyrie's role as a member of an adventuring group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These warrior women are tough, armored fighters with divine spells and the power to bend fate. They reside on the remote island of Thule, but they frequently venture abroad to assist Odin's favored kings in battle and to sort out the dead in preparation for Ragnarok.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To become a Valkyrie and gain a pegasus as a bonded mount, a character must first become a shield maiden and serve in the Valkyrie army as a sergeant, lieutenant, commander, or special operative. She must also carry the Saeming, Skjold, or Volsung bloodline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shield maidens and Valkyries have an alignment restriction and a code of conduct which they must follow. Being the daughters of Odin and dedicated to following his objectives, they are usually lawful and often good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick up this supplement today and discover a whole new world of hyper-violence and debauchery; a high-magic, mythological world of Romans and Persians, Egyptians and Greeks where two legendary warrior cults are locked in an epic, endless clash of total war!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
