			<description>Educational card game published by the British Diabetic Association. It is an attempt to make people think about what they eat, especially for them to know the calorie count of their meals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In it's basic form, players can just ask each other about a card, for instance: &amp;quot; Find me another card with the same calorie count as X&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;But two more interactive games are possible. In 'Shop Shut' (for which you need two copies of the game) each player gets a hand of cards. One player is nominated as the Caller. Everyone plays their cards face up in front of them. The Caller draws a card and if a player has the same card, he shouts &amp;quot;Sold&amp;quot; and turns the card over. This continues until one player turns over his last card and then shouts &amp;quot;Shop Shut&amp;quot;. That player scores nothing but the other players score their cards still 'open' by totalling the Carbohydrates on the card (or the Calorie count if decided before the game begins). After a pre-agrred time limit expires, the player with the lowest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 'Happy Food Families, it plays exactly the same as a Happy Families/Quartet/Authors game. A set of four cards must all be the same food value as indicated on the card. The player who has the most sets when the cards run out, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
