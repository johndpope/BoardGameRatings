			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first to complete one's personalized crossword grid.  Players move around the grid-shaped board by throwing the dice and correctly answering crossword-type clues.  Players can move around the board in any direction.  Along the outer [edge] of the board are 8 green squares.  It is by landing on these squares that the player has the opportunity to answer a clue and fill in his/her own personal grid.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A handicapping system is presented to make the game more challenging depending on each player's level of expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
