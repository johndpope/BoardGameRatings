			<description>A creative word and writing game inspired by Exquisite Corpse,  and somewhat similar to Eat Poop You Cat, but with creative writing as the underpinnings instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player writes a story fragment of some agreed-to size. They can either agree to a specific theme, voice, or tense, or they can have no such agreement at all. Then one player, known as the moderator, tells each player who to send his story fragment to. Each player will send his fragment to two different players, one with the subject &amp;quot;first&amp;quot; and the other with the subject &amp;quot;last&amp;quot;. After a player receives a &amp;quot;first&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;last&amp;quot; from other players, he must write a transition that connects the two story fragments together. The completed work is sent back to the moderator with the subject &amp;quot;transition&amp;quot;, and the moderator puts together the complete story, linking fragment to transition to fragment to transition, and so on. The result is a story that loops, and is usually quite disconnected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
