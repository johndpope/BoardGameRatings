							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bear Season</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This game requires around four to six players. Together, you will play the part of a bear in its natural habitat, each of you taking on a different aspect of the animal. Each player selects a part of the bear to embody, no two choosing the same. One player may portray the teeth of the bear, another the claws; one may choose to speak for the bear&amp;rsquo;s nose and sense of smell, and someone else may take the part of the bear&amp;rsquo;s eyes, and tell what it sees. Someone may choose to be the bear&amp;rsquo;s hide and fur, or its stomach, its hunger, driving it towards food and prey, or the bear&amp;rsquo;s heart, its courage and instincts, or its fear and wariness towards mankind.&lt;br/&gt;Oh yes, there is also a hunter out there somewhere. Perhaps he hunts the bear, or maybe he is after some other game, and has merely wandered into the bear&amp;rsquo;s territory. Will they cross paths, and if they do, will one pose a threat to the other, or will they find a way to pass each other without a confrontation?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;The players tell the story of a bear in a season, from the perspective of its various aspects, made more dangerous by the presence of a hunter nearby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
