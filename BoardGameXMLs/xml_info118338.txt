			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SoulCalibur III: Arcade Edition was specifically designed by Namco for the arcades.  There are some differences with home versions of the game.  One of the game mode options is the Legends mode where you play as one of the characters and fight eight battles, earning points to upgrade your character.  At the end of that mode, you are ranked according to what level your character reached.  Unlike in many arcade games, in that particular mode, you advance regardless of whether you win or lose, which is a very unique feature.  The other modes of play are the standard arcade mode and the mode where you try to locate special weapons, a defining feature of games in the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike almost every other arcade game known to man, the arcade is actually a modified port of the PlayStation 2 version, which was released nearly six months prior to its arcade counterpart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
