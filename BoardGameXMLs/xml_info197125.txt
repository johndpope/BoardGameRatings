			<description>While being endorsed by Mike Piazza, Strike Zone represents all of the MLB players in the 1997&amp;ndash;98 season including those in the National League and American League. The game offers standard baseball game play with all 30 official stadiums, a choice of leagues to play for, but also offers the player the option to design their own team and league, from the logo, and uniforms all the way up to player abilities and appearance. The player can play a single game, season of 15, 81, or 162 games,[1] the World Series game, All-Star Game, or compete in a batting challenge known as the Home Run Derby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Piazza%27s_Strike_Zone Mike Piazza's Strike Zone]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
