							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Campaign Shiloh</name>
									
			<description>It is 1862. The Eastern theater of the American Civil War is deadlocked. But a mobile campaign is being fought in the West. Union General Ulysses S. Grant is fighting his way down the Mississippi River, capturing Forts Henry and Donelson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Confederate General Johnston launches a surprise attack against Grant's encampment at Pittsburgh Landing--otherwise known as Shiloh Church. &amp;quot;Shiloh&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;peaceful.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In one of the hardest fought battles of the Civil War, the Confederates roll up the leading Union regiments, only to be stopped cold when Grant takes the field and launches a vigorous counterattack. With the Union now secure on the Mississippi, the way is open for Grant to split the Confederacy in two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Had Johnston won at Shiloh, the course of the Civil War might have been different. Now is your chance to take command on this decisive battlefield.&lt;br/&gt; The heart of Shiloh is the campaign system.  At each stage of a campaign, players choose from 2-4 operational decisions that will result in a tactical battle to be played out on an expansive map, providing room for maneuver. The campaign is non-linear, with both offensive and defensive operational options available to each side. Though every scenario may also be played as a stand-alone, the bulk of the scenarios are integrated into the operational/tactical campaigns, providing a high degree of replay value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Publisher's Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
