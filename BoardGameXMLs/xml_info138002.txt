			<description>Card game published as a promotion for UNESCO. The tile means 'The Unesco Rainbow'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards feature the letters U N E S C or O. There are eight of each letter and, in the main, they have different coloured backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player, in turn, may lay a card on the table, that can legally go next to another card. There are none at the start so a U must be placed. After that, you may lay an N next to the U. You can place the N alongside the U or beneath it. The next player may now play a legal letter next to any card on the table. Thus, the word UNESCO will be spelt many times perhaps, horizentally or vertically. Think of it as a UNESCO crossword. If you cannot play a card, you draw one from the stock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to use all their cards wins the round. The other players total the value of cards left in their hands and take a score for them. Colour matches can matter because this makes a more penal score. After an agreed number of rounds, the player with the lowest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
