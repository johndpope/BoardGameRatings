			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on the iconic treant. These paragons of nature may be fairly obvious homages to The Lord of the Rings&amp;rsquo;s ents, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make them any less of a staple of fantasy media, and tree-beings of all sorts are a fun and resonant part of fantasy. The first treant in this book, the jungle treant (CR 10), is more than just an ill-mannered treant from a more tropical clime: its long vines animate and lash out to trip or entangle foes, and its body serves as a host to several swarms of angry wasps. Even more terrifying, however, is the bonfire treant (CR 14), an evil, twisted treant that burns with a constant and hellish supernatural fire. Everything this creature touches bursts into flames, and such flames are all but impossible to extinguish as long as the creature still lives. The last treant in the book is the old growth treant (CR 16), a massive, towering treant from ancient times that can release a hail of deadly pine needles, and which daring adventurers can climb upon in order to better fight it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
