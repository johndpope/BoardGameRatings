							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">WWF Attitude</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;WWF Attitude is a professional wrestling video game released by Acclaim Entertainment in 1999 for the PlayStation and Nintendo 64. A slightly enhanced port of the game was later released on the Dreamcast. Along with a handheld version for the Game Boy Colour named after the slogan of WWF's marketing campaign at that time, the game's tagline is &amp;quot;Get it!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is the sequel to Acclaim's WWF War Zone and is also the last WWF game to be published by Acclaim. Acclaim followed Attitude with two sequels based on Extreme Championship Wrestling: ECW Hardcore Revolution and ECW Anarchy Rulz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The console versions feature a dedication to Owen Hart, who died shortly before the game's release, and was posthumously included in the roster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;WWF_Attitude,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
