			<description>Title translated into English: &amp;quot;Star Quiz&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;What do you really know about the most famous stars? Are the allegations true or false?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may use your special knowledge about your favorite artists,&lt;br/&gt;discover hidden aspects of the stars, or maybe you simply get fooled? In this game, you learn about the stars' amazing achievements and interesting lives.&lt;br/&gt;The game is a different kind of quiz where the players simultanously guess if the allegations are true or false. The new twist is that you get two alligations each time you have to answer. You have six points cards that determine how far you can move. Do you dare to bet your best card on your choice? Here you have to think quickly and tactically!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is in Norwegian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
