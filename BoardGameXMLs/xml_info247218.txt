			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the year 1984, a rogue asteroid slammed into the moon, spraying the earth with alien spores and moon dust. The earth&amp;rsquo;s magnetic poles shifted, continents and oceans changed, and chaos reigned for a thousand years. Some civilizations fell into a magical sleep. Others were overgrown by alien jungles. Ancient technologies and alien magics struggled for supremacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, to this broken land have come the evil Skele-Mat and his champion chimaera* Tia-Tor, determined to enslave the world. Opposing them are the heroic He-darr the Barbellian, carrying the legendary Sunday Sword, and his companions the Aerial Princess and Uckla the Mook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Skele-Mat has many servants, and He-darr can&amp;rsquo;t be everywhere. So the mysterious Chamber Master has summoned you and your friends from an ancient amusement park to come join the fray!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chambers and Chimaeras*TM is a setting of tongue-in-cheek adventure in a world of 80&amp;rsquo;s Saturday morning fantasy cartoons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[*] Yes, we know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For use with the D6xD6 RPG created by Origins award winning designer Lester Smith, which features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Five-minute character creation.&lt;br/&gt;    Quick-and-easy tactical combat rules. &lt;br/&gt;    Endless setting possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
