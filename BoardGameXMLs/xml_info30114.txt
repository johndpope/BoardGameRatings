							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Kanji Game</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:  Kanji symbols are an ancient Chinese method of writing that was introduced to Japan almost 2,000 years ago.  Kanji symbols are visual representations of words, word fragments or entire ideas.  While there are as many as 50,000 Kanji in existence, Japanese people use only about 2,000 today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2 to 4 players ages 5 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE OBJECT:  To be the player to collect the most points by the end of the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY:  The Kanji game has three levels of play.  Set up the double-sided playing board according to the level of play you choose.  Divide the 176 cards into four card groups:  GO, 1-2-3, Kanji and Dot.  Give the arrow a spin and let the race begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A card is drawn and players must think and react quickly as they learn how to speak, read and visualize Kanji symbols.  The first player to find the card's exact match on the playing board (matching color and symbol) and to place his or her pawn on the match wins the card.  Did you draw a Kanji Samurai card?  Now you must draw the Kanji symbol, the final step in putting it all together!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever has the most points at the end of the round wins that game!  Sounds easy?  Think again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are you learning?  Not only are players learning the elements of a foreign language, they are also building the skills necessary to improve mathematics, memory, concentration and visual relationships while actively being motivated to think, respond and learn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
