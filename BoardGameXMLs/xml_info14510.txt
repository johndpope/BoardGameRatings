							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hungry Fox</name>
									
			<description>Players are foxes stealing eggs from a nest. The winner is the first to get enough eggs to make breakfast. Simultaneous card play dictates the foxes' movements and the availability eggs, both of which are constantly changing. It's a game of chicken and second-guessing your opponents, because if two or more foxes go to grab an egg at the same time, neither gets it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
