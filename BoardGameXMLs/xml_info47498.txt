			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 35-page Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds supplement, written by Steve Kenson and Michael Hammes, details thirty new PL 10 archetypes for use in any campaign - as either ready-made player characters or, with a little work by the gamemaster, sinister villains.
