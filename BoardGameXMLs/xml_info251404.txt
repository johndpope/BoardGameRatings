			<description>Lunar 5000 a future based evolution of the Indy 500 races. Players start by constructing a race ship consisting of one engine and a variety of parts. Generally the engines give a big boost to speed and the parts have abilities that do a variety of other things like manipulating dice, hindering other pilots, and much more. With over 26 Engines and 60 parts there are lots of combinations to try out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second part of the game is the race itself. Once the pilots have completed building they will take off. The race is driven by players rolling 2 types of dice, engine dice which are numbered 1-6 to determine a ships speed and the pilot die which corresponds to one of the 6 pilot colors giving the rolled pilots ship a bonus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High tensions will rise in this head to head all out race to the finish line. When the dice hit the table will you be in the winners circle?&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
