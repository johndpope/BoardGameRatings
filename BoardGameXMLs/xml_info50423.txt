							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Warrior&#039;s Code</name>
									
			<description>An adventure for 2 to 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;The book contains 12 pregenerated characters that players may choose to use, these include the Second Doctor and his companions Jamie McCrimmon, Ben Jackson, Polly, Victoria Waterfield and Zoe Herriet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;ARIGATO, DOCTOR WHO&lt;br/&gt;A collision in the Vortex with an unknown timeship...a forced materialization on the rocky seaside cliffs of Feudal Japan...a power play among the samurai warlords who wield absolute power in an ancient and mysterious realm. For the Time Lord and his Companions, these were only the first steps in a dangerous game, where one man's ambition could bring the collapse of human history. Stranded, cut off from help or contact with Gallifrey, the time travelers must band together to free themselves from old Japan, history from a madman's plot, and humanity itself from oblivion in a distant but all-too-real future. To achieve their goals, the adventurers must learn to understand the shifting politics and timeless cultrure of the Land of the Rising Sun. They must come to understand the samurai and their Bushido...The Warrior's Code&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
