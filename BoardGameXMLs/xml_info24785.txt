			<description>An early game from the designer of Hey, That's My Fish!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on the intersections of a 9&amp;times;9 grid, each player receives 34 pieces in their color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player's turn consists of either&lt;br/&gt;1) Moving 1 piece to a neighboring empty point (optional), followed by placing a new piece on any empty point. (required)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;or&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Taking pieces by jumping over horizontal or vertical lines of their opponent's pieces. If this is possible, this must be done instead of moving/placing pieces via option 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lines with 2 pieces cannot be jumped over, but any other amount can be. The jumping piece must continue jumping until no more jumps are possible. After each jump, the opponent's pieces are captured and removed from the board. If you capture the same number of pieces that your opponent just captured from you on the preceding turn, the pieces are returned to the opponent and not placed in your captured pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player cannot make any legal move. Each player gets one point for each captured opponent's piece, plus one point for each opponent's piece on the outside border of the board. Most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
