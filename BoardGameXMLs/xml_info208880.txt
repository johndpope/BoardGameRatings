			<description>Lost Crew - this is a story of survival of the astronauts on the orbital station that is lost in time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a quest messenger, in which the player will communicate with the inhabitants of the space station, helping them to survive in difficult situations, and even science fiction. Each replica of a character the player will have up to four possible answers, the story itself is not linear, the game is tuned to replay the frequent accumulation of certain key knowledge that will eventually open up new possibilities and the story branches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the action takes place in real time, but the player has an infinite time accelerator, with which he can always cut expectation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game the player is waiting for one of the 32 options for the finals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
