							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shark Bait</name>
									
			<description>Players are sharks trying to eat the best-valued people swimming for the shore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, the player may move their shark up to two spaces and then attempt to eat a swimmer.  A player must roll a d6 greater than the swimmer's value modified by ocean square.  Rolling a 1 is always unsuccessful, and a 6 is always successful.  If not eaten, the attacked swimmer will reach the shore. After attempting to eat a swimmer, a player moves one of the remaining swimmers closer to the shore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there are no swimmers remaining in the water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
