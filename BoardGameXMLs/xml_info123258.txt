			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Bring Out Your Gods is an RPG set in the ancient world, spanning&lt;br/&gt;from ancient Greece to Egypt. The empires have been untouched by&lt;br/&gt;gods for centuries, but the gods are coming. Most of these gods were&lt;br/&gt;long forgotten or erased. But during their time, they were all powerful, they&lt;br/&gt;were gods. And oh yes, they have animal heads.&lt;br/&gt;Setting&lt;br/&gt;Bring Out Your Gods takes place in the ancient world, spanning&lt;br/&gt;from ancient Greece, with its city states and Olympian gods, to Egypt with&lt;br/&gt;its pyramids and animal gods, all the way to china and its zodiac of gods.&lt;br/&gt;You may begin wherever you wish, but it&amp;rsquo;s probably a good idea for your&lt;br/&gt;GM to have the game start somewhere where they have a decent&lt;br/&gt;knowledge of the locales and people. That is, if you want to be accurate,&lt;br/&gt;but that&amp;rsquo;s only optional.&lt;br/&gt;Gods&lt;br/&gt;The players are gods. New gods, gods who on day simply awoke&lt;br/&gt;with a new head, the head of a beast. These gods are superhuman in&lt;br/&gt;everyway, but they are not true gods. They do not come born with the&lt;br/&gt;great godly powers that the old gods have. They are only better than a&lt;br/&gt;human in every way, shape, and form.&lt;br/&gt;Governments quickly accepted the existence of these gods, but&lt;br/&gt;there is still a mystery about them. Kings and Pharaohs fear them for their&lt;br/&gt;powers, for their ability to uproot them. The people see them as either&lt;br/&gt;enemies, especially to the gods who simply ravage the country side for&lt;br/&gt;the hell of it, or they see them as saviors, for those who heal the wounded&lt;br/&gt;and feed the hungry.&lt;br/&gt;You can be any of these things: a savior or a devil, a king or a&lt;br/&gt;beggar. But you are surely at least a god.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
