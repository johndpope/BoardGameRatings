							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Glitch Iteration (Revised)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a moving-around game.&lt;br/&gt;Every player portrays iterations of someone named Uri, incorrectly loaded into an artificial world. Not pieces, but incomplete copies. Are you a glitch? Are you a virus? Can you be the real Uri even though you don't feel real?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game seeks to help you explore identity and doubt, and to help you re-contextualize the world around you. It&amp;rsquo;s not an investigation game so much as an introspection game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s for 4-8 players who have a beautiful space to move around in, best with additional foot traffic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the afterword&lt;br/&gt;Glitch Iteration was made for the Golden Cobra Challenge, and won in the category of Cleverest Design. This polished version was made possible by my patrons and will appear in the Golden Cobra collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
