			<description>A supplement for Summerland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A secret slaver, a broken healer, a savage killer, a compulsive artist... just a few of those that might be found within the forest....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A place of the dead, a place with a secret, a place of hope... just a few places to discover beneath the boughs....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fallen Leaves is a supplement for Summerland that details a series of drifters and communities that a narrator can slot into existing games of Summerland or use as a springboard for their own imagination. The entries are inter-linked, allowing the narrator to weave many separate elements together forming a net-work of people and places, key to creating compelling stories beneath the Sea of Leaves. A wealth of adventure hooks are also provided, along with guidelines for creating your own post-Event communities, making Fallen Leaves an invaluable resource for narrators of Summerland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
