			<description>A Canadian-made horse racing game, endorsed by champion jockey Sandy Hawley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game summary;&lt;br/&gt;The players each start the game with the same amount of game money with which they buy horses and bet on them in 6 races.  The horse cards are dealt to the players and each player decides to buy one or more of those dealt. Horses not purchased are returned to the bank and are offered again after the first race.  The odds paid to the winning bet are determined by dealing the &amp;quot;odds&amp;quot; cards to the players' horses.  Each player may bet up to $1000 to win on horses that the player owns.  A race consists of 4 or 5 quarters.  There are 5 identical decks of &amp;quot;race cards&amp;quot; that have on their face one of the ten available horses.  For each of the quarters a &amp;quot;Race Card&amp;quot; deck is shuffled and then laid out in a row on the game board, the horse pictured on the last card is in the lead of that quarter.  The leading horse earns a bonus for the player.  The horse pictured on the last card of the last deck is the race winner.  The winning horse earns the bet times the odds for the player.  After 6 races, the horses are sold back to the bank for the original purchase price and the richest player is the game winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The high stakes horse racing game.  Fun for the whole family!&lt;br/&gt;Post Time allows a maximum of 10 horses to run in every race.&lt;br/&gt;Experience the thrill of owning a racehorse, entering it in a race, and collecting the prize money.&lt;br/&gt;You have a six race series in which to accumulate assets, through buying horses and betting them to win!  And, of course, your stable of winning horses can net you BIG purse money.&lt;br/&gt;You don't need horseshoes to win!&lt;br/&gt;A basic knowledge of horse racing is all you need to play and enjoy POST TIME.
