			<description>This game is a simulation of an exercise held at a military training ground involving tanks and helicopters. There are three levels. In the first level only tanks participate. In the second level are added combat helicopters. In the third level participate transport helicopters and Surface to Surface Missiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main characteristic is that the game board is covered with a net of equilateral triangles. Vertices of these triangles are points at which the players hold position and move figurines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have a task to destroy enemy headquarters or to use transport helicopters which carry commandos who can capture enemy headquarters and in that way make a quick victory. Other way of determining the winner is by counting points. Every hit, destroyed tank and shot down helicopter counts as one point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
