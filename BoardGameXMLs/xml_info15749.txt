							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Little Mermaid Under the Sea Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a children's matching game based on the Disney film. On your turn, you try to match a card from your hand with the top card on the discard pile. Matches are made by the character picture on the card, or by the color in the card's corner. If you cannot make a match, you must draw a card. Ariel cards are wild. Playing an Ursula card forces all your opponents to draw another card. The first player to run out of cards in his or her hand wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
