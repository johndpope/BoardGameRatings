							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Magic Rings II</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For whatever reason, magic rings have become even more popular with players as of late (hmm). Don't let them down. Give them a new ring every game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic Rings I features 50 new magic rings for use with D20 fantasy settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sample:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dead Ringer Ring&lt;br/&gt;This ring consists of two interlocking bands. In order to use it the bands can be split apart to form two rings. If one ring is placed upon the finger of a corpse and the other upon the finger of a living being, the living being will appear exactly as the corpse did in real life. This ring affects the physical appearance only and does not modify the wearer's clothes, abilities, speech, mannerism, memories, etc. The wearer must be of a race similar to the size and build of the deceased otherwise the ring will not function. This illusion will last for one hour after which the two rings must be touched to one another in order to renew the disguise. This illusion vanishes the moment either of the rings are removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
