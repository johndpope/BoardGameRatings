			<description>&amp;quot;Who are we? Where are We from? Explore the origins of humanity in this set collection game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aurora is a card game where players are creating star systems and trying reach sentience. Other victory conditions include maxing out resources (water, oxygen, carbon) and supporting life in multiple star systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn players create, or expand, star systems, collect resources, and try to stall the expansion of other players' systems. Each turn you can play 1 negative action on another player and 2 actions on themselves. After cards have been played and resolved, resources are collected and unused cards are passed to the player on the left. Everyone then draws back up to 8 cards and a new round begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aurora was a submission to The Game Crafter's Learning Games content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
