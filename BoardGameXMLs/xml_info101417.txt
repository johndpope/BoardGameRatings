			<description>In Poker Carr&amp;eacute;, players add cards to a grid and try to create sequences of at least four numbers (e.g., 1-2-3-4), sets of at least three cards of the same suit, and sets of at least three cards of the same value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why is this difficult? The deck consists of 49 cards &amp;ndash; seven suits of seven cards numbered 1-7 &amp;ndash; and each player starts with a hand of four cards, while nine cards are randomly laid out in a 3x3 grid. On a turn, a player adds a card to the grid adjacent to at least one card already on the table, with the restriction that at least one of the adjacent cards must have a value exactly one higher or one lower than the card being played. That player then draws a replacement card. Once all the cards have been played, tally the points; the player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
