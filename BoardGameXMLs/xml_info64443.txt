			<description>From the publisher...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As many as care to may play. First play is determined by each player shooting one blue ball at the target holes, and the one scoring highest plays first, etc. In case of a tie, those tied will shoot again. Each player in turn places each of the nine balls, one at a time, at the point of the yellow triangle shown on the shooting surface and propels it towards the target holes with the point of the cue, as in regular pool. All balls must remain wherever they come to rest until a player has shot the nine balls, after which the score is counted, the balls removed, and the next player starts. The object of the game is to shoot the various colored balls into the target holes that will score the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring values:&lt;br/&gt;Blue ball in blue hole = 20&lt;br/&gt;Red ball in red hole = 15&lt;br/&gt;Yellow ball in yellow hole = 10&lt;br/&gt;Any ball in hole of different color = 5&lt;br/&gt;Any ball in black hole = -5&lt;br/&gt;The first player to score 200 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
