			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this article you will find ways of introducing magic users from such distant lands as Araby and Cathay, for I have given elementalism a world-wide feel in its development. Also there are links with the Elves, the first race to be taught the art of magic by the Old Ones, so the reader will also be able to present Woodelves in a better light until an official sourcebook is released in the future. There is also a re-introduction on the use of Elemental creatures in the new setting and background, something that I felt had to be addressed to better reflect the growing number of Nature Spirits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
