			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fan-created mission for Orpheus.&lt;br/&gt; From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MISSION TYPE: Retrieval.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TARGET NAME: Wilhelm Yeager.  A.K.A. Bill Helmeczi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, that nation's foreign intelligence service, Mossad, has been diligent in tracking down and either capturing or exterminating former members of the Nazi regime who were involved in the Shoah - the Holocaust. For the past five decades they have been extremely successful in this task, and at the beginning of the twenty-first century there are scarcely a handful of these aging war criminals still alive throughout the world. Mossad's task in tracking down aging Nazi war criminals is nearing an end... and none too soon, given the current crises in the Middle East that demand more immediate attention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is, however, at least one loose end. In 1964 Mossad first came across a strange anomaly... Dr. Wilhelm Yeager, a medical 'researcher' at the Dakow concentration camp, was located living in Florence, Italy under an assumed name. What startled the Israeli intelligence agents was that Wilhelm Yeager did not appear to have aged a single day since he was last photographed in Munich in 1945.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effort in 1964 failed to apprehend Yeager, as did two other covert attempts since then, one in Istanbul in 1977 and one in Montreal in 1990. On both occasions Mossad agents reported that Yeager did not appear to have aged in any way. His wiliness in escaping repeated capture attempts by one of the world's most effective intelligence services has also proven that age has robbed him of none of his wits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mossad has lost three agents in the pursuit of Yeager since 1965, and for most of the past decade lost track of his whereabouts. A chance sighting, however, led to an investigation that has placed him living right here in this city under the assumed name of Bill Helmeczi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
