							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gem Cards Set Two</name>
									
			<description>From the cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treasure! Everybody likes getting it, but randomly rolling dice on tables to tell a player that their character found a 25 gp garnet lacks panache and deflates the excitement faster than you can say percentile. But what if you could hand them the gem they just found?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gem Cards were created for use with any RPG, in any setting. Gem Cards Set Two contains 96 different gems that you can print out to give to your players. Each Gem Card includes an image of a unique gemstone, a full description, and a base value. Your players can now hoard them, trade them, or pass them around without having to constantly refer to scribbles on a character sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fans of the Gemerator will instantly recognize the format of the description provided for each gem and, for fans of the Mineral Magic Series, we have also included a notation on the Gem Cards for gems that can be harnessed into a mineral magic item. In addition, rules have been provided for those GMs who would prefer to randomly roll for a gemstone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
