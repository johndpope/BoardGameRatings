			<description>From the game package:&lt;br/&gt;How will you do in the line of fire?&lt;br/&gt;Seek and destroy your opponent's ships in this all-out, no holds barred dice duel.  Secretly set up your tokens on your battlefield and brace yourself as your opponent attacks.  Was it a hit or miss?  Fire back and see if you can be the first player to sink all of your opponent's ships, and win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Erik Arneson's website:&lt;br/&gt;Players first play tokens (numbered 3 to 11) on each of their five ships, making sure to put them in order from lowest to highest -- although duplicate numbers are allowed. To attack, each player rolls three dice and chooses two. They place those two dice next to a token, and if the total equals the value of the token, a hit is scored. Rolls of 2 and 12 are always hits. Unfortunately, this clever Battleship-based dice game is not very easy to find. Your best bet is to look in drug stores and grocery stores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
