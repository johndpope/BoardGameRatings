The treasures that was robbed together, he melted in one, broke it to 3 parts and burried them separately. The pirates started to search the parts...Will they find them? Take part in this treasure hunt and find all the 3 parts to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the board game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you are controlling one of the 4 pirates who is searching for the treasure.&lt;br/&gt;You start with 9 markers and 3 mission cards. The game board has got a 7 * 10 matrix. Every row and coloumn has got a colored skull symbol (4 player colours and a black one) These skulls are important:&lt;br/&gt;1. The player needs to go one of the cross point of his/her colour. In the board there is only 2 spots like that.&lt;br/&gt;In this spot he/she may check one of the 3 treasure cards that was received at the start of the game..&lt;br/&gt;2. The black skulls cross points. In there you have to draw a card. These could be:&lt;br/&gt;a, Key card --&amp;gt; needed for the treasure (3 for the 3 pieces of the treasure)&lt;br/&gt;b, A steeringwheel--&amp;gt; you will be on turn again&lt;br/&gt;c, A storm--&amp;gt;you will miss 1 turn&lt;br/&gt;d, A skull--&amp;gt;gather 4 and your game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you know where the part of the treasure is hidden, you need to go there and place 4 marker in the crosspoints that surronded the location. You can not place a marer if someone else has got there a marker.
