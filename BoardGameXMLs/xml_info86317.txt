							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chronicles of Zombie Town</name>
									
			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fun zombie-themed murder mystery party for ages 15 and up, 8-16+ guests. Non-gender specific - play co-ed, all female or all male! Expandable to over 40 guests with the main game by adding additional guests to play with the 3 expandable characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MYSTERY SYNOPSIS:&lt;br/&gt;Three weeks ago, the cheery town of Sunnyville was hit hard with a devastating plague that turned the living into horrifying undead zombies. Once the H5N1 zombie virus spread and the zombie population dominated the living within Sunnyville, the zombies staged a revolt and took over the government. The Center for Disease Control, hearing of this epidemic centered in Sunnyville, quarantined the town and the U.S. Government threatened to 'wipe out' the population of zombies to prevent further spreading of this viral nightmare. But the citizens of the newly-formed Zombie Town weren't the stereotypical aggressive zombies portrayed in movies, television and comic books. The citizens of Zombie Town were simply dead and decomposing but still the same as before - upstanding citizens! But with one gruesome exception: the virus gave them an intense craving for living human flesh! Because a mandatory vaccine against the H5N1 zombie virus was given to the human population outside of Zombie Town and the epidemic ceased to exist, human rights activists caught wind of the situation in Sunnyville (aka: Zombie Town) and formed the Save a Zombie Alliance. Millions banded together across the country and persuaded the United States government to sign an unprecedented peace treaty with the zombies. Ashes, the self acclaimed Emperor of Zombie Town, represented the zombies and outlined the truce with the U.S. President. The major clause in the treaty was that zombies would not cross the borders of Zombie Town unless on an approved journey by the U.S. President and they would never hunt living humans for food outside of their borders. Because there were extensive warning signs posted for miles surrounding Zombie Town's borders, there was an addendum in favor of the zombies that if a living human ended up inside the borders of Zombie Town, they were 'fair game' to be hunted, captured and on a zombie's dinner table. Ashes set forth the laws of Zombie Town and the treaty was to be signed by both Ashes and the U.S. President within 24 hours. The citizens were happy to be at peace with the United States Government. Thankfully, they discovered they could sustain themselves by eating pumpkins but pumpkins didn&amp;rsquo;t quite satisfy their appetite for living human flesh. Suppressing their cravings led to increasing irritability and with frustrations escalating in Zombie Town, Ashes knew s/he had to pump up the morale of the citizens. Leary of an impending civil unrest, s/he scheduled the Undead Festival which was a massive town-wide celebration with delicious pumpkin-inspired food, rockin' music and fun zombie games. And this is where the story begins...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
