			<description>ATTN: Cpt [DATA WITHHELD]  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Captain,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At 0747Z, a foreign object that had entered the Earth`s atmosphere within U.S. airspace airburst in a multi-megaton event over [DATA WITHHELD]. The blast area is Code Black.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hostile non-terrestrial combatants have emerged from the debris plume and have engaged national defense elements. These elements are being depleted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Lawmaker has been assigned to the task force Mud Eagle 1 (ME1). ME1 is to prepare for  an immediate combat operation outside of the Pentagon&amp;rsquo;s defense perimeter. You will depart for this operation at current readiness status.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ME1`s mission is to hold it&amp;rsquo;s position against any attack while evacuations occur. You will not be relieved from this mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ME1 is weapons free from the moment you recieve this communication, Cpt. [DATA WITHHELD]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do not tune in to any civilian communications for any reason.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Katherine L. Weinberg,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chairman, National Security Council&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mud Eagle One is a cooperative score attack strategy game for 1-2 players. Each player is the captain of a Lawmaker; a warship-esque super-heavy land vehicle. Their objective is to hold at all costs against hostile attackers, inflicting as much damage as possible against enemy contacts until being destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will draw personnel, vehicle, gear and munitions cards that will comprise their forces to be leveraged for their mission. These forces will require a constant stream of logistics support to remain operational, and managing those logistics will be the key to achieving a positive score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play time is about 2 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
