							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vandorian Phlanx</name>
									
			<description>Can be played as a board game between 2 individuals (1 army each).  The rules are simple.  You can move as far around a ring, or in a straight line as you want without jumping over other pieces.  Eliminate your enemy pieces by catching them in a crossfire (phlanx) either left to right on a ring, or front to back on a rail.  You win when your enemy has 1 or 0 pieces left.  You cannot phlanx across the center, but you can move straight across it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;League Play&lt;br/&gt;The game is much more fun though if you can get more people together, and join boards (movement along rails allows you to continue your movement to an adjoining hive).  This city play also brings into play the Crystal Transporters (which sit at the center of hives the city designer selects).  Should your piece enter one of the transporters, it comes out the other (color coordinated) crystal in any of the 8 directions you choose.  In this version, up to 3 players play in teams (6 armies total, 3 on 3).  During its turn a team moves 1 piece from each of its 3 armies.  League play earns points posted on web page, as well as merits, badges and pins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
