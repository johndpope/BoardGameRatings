			<description>In Just Waffle, you want to grab the treat that awaits on the table precisely fifteen steps away from the door. Walk too far, though, and the shop owner punishes you for intruding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of each of the eight rounds, each player has a hand of three cards and one of the treats is placed next to the deck as a reward. On a turn you play a card from your hand, then draw a replacement card. If you play a number, you add that number to any total previously announced as all players are walking to the table together; if you play a card with an effect, you carry out the effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you make the total equal fifteen, you grab the treat and the round ends. If you go higher than fifteen, then the total stays the same and you receive a penalty marker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever has the highest score after eight rounds wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
