			<description>Players are trying to build a letter grid: either they succeed each round, and win at the end, or they fail, and lose immediately. Players set the timer then draw letters. Within the time limit, they endeavor to place the letters they drew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game requires a electronic timer, which is not included; it is recommended that each round be allowed one minute each, but it can be changed to reflect players' skill levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must work together to use consonants as they are drawn, within the time limit. Players can plan ahead so that they will be ready for certain letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is ideal for environments where players are extremely unmatched; instead of one player having to cheat to lose, all players work together and the timer can be adjusted to reflect the skill of the group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
