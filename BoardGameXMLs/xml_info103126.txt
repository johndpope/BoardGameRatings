			<description>The First Templar is an action-adventure video game developed by Haemimont Games and published by Kalypso Media for the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. It was released on both platforms on May 6, 2011 in Europe and on May 17, 2011 in North America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The First Templar follows the story of two characters - French Templar Celian d'Arestide, and his companion, Marie d'Ibelin, a noble lady who has been proclaimed a heretic by the Dominican Inquisition. Taking control over these two unlikely allies, the player must uncover the mysteries behind the Templar Order, play a role in a grand conspiracy, and discover the secret of the Holy Grail. The First Templar features both single player and co-op modes. When playing solo, the player can switch between the two characters, leaving the control of the second hero to the game&amp;rsquo;s AI. At any moment a second player can join in and take control of the AI controlled hero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The First Templar&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
