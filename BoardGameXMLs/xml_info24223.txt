			<description>The board is the outer 5 concentric rings of a 14x14 square grid, with the middle 4x4 area out of play. The rings are partially separated by walls. Each player has 10 pieces, 2 each that can move 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete to be the first to score 11 points by completing widdershin circuits of the board and/or capturing opposing pieces. Pieces may turn corners and pass through gaps in the walls between rings to take shorter paths, and may pass over linear groups of connected pieces (considering the whole group as one space in the movement), but may not move backwards more than a quarter of the distance around the board from their starting points and may not occupy the same space more than once during the same move. Opposing pieces that are not part of a linked group may be captured by displacement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;United Kingdom of Great Britain Patent GB9520980.5, applied 13 October 1995, granted 7 July 1999.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
