			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum Heroes is a collection of heroes and villains for use with the G-Core Deluxe roleplaying game from Dilly Green Bean Games. Each book will feature one or more supers that players can use as characters or game referees can use as NPCs and opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the spirit of the season Wild Hunt Games has created statistics for the classic Saturday matinee monsters of old. We treasure our memories of these great old films , and like the major comic book publishers, we would like to offer them up in homage for your roleplaying adventures. We hope that these creatures will generate as much excitement at your game table as they did when we first watched these movies as kids back before CGI was the only way to render monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They can be introduced in any way you see fit; we aren&amp;rsquo;t here to judge. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll decide that some villain has reality altering abilities that allow him to create the terrors of his childhood, or perhaps there is a parallel dimension in which all of our movie creations exist for real. No matter how you use them, they are bound to thrill your players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Look for more exciting products in our Quantum Heroes line and make them part of your super-powered world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
