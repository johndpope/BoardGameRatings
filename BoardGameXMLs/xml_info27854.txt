			<description>Habet, hoc habet! is a game of gladiatorial combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls a gladiator and has attack and defense cards. Each turn each player chooses simultaneously which attack and defense card to play. Cards are played face down and revealed when all cards have been chosen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effect of the attack depends on the defense the other player has chosen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wounds are represented by reducing hand size - this simulates the fact that the wounded gladiators have reduced possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All cards are in Latin. The game was developed by a teacher to use in his class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game appeared in Battlegames #3 as a free insert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
