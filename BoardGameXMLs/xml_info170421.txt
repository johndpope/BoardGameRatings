			<description>There are two ways to play this fun matching game &amp;ndash; Face Up Match Up for the youngest players and Memory Match Up for kids 3+. In Face Up Match Up place all cards face up on a table or smooth surface. Have an adult request a match. For instance, &amp;ldquo;can you find the &amp;ldquo;7s?&amp;rdquo; Children can take turns or compete to see who finds the most matches. Or have the child pick up twelve cards in numeric order. For a more challenging game, turn the cards face down and play a memory matching game. Try to make matches by turning over two cards on each turn. If the cards match, take the cards. If they do not match turn them back over in the same place in the game. A challenging puzzle keeps the fun going for years to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why families love this item:&lt;br/&gt;Make learning numbers fun with a girl&amp;rsquo;s favorite theme &amp;ndash; princesses! Colorful dancing princesses adorn each card. Each card includes the numeral, the number word, and a physical representation of the number in symbol. The compact box makes this a terrific take-along item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
