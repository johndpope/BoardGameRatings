			<description>Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health problem during childhood and adolescence. The recommended treatment approach for anxiety is overwhelmingly Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT). Bridge Over Worried Waters is essentially a CBT program in a box that incorporates all of these techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start the game, players place a Worried Waters raging river sheet in front of them. Then they choose a Problem card that describes an anxiety-producing situation. Players then decide on an appropriate Solution card to use as a positive strategy to address the anxiety in the situation. Solution cards include: Self-Talk Cards challenge self-defeating thoughts by replacing negative thoughts with positive,optimistic thoughts. Relaxation Cards calm down by using deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, and meditation. Coping Cards distract by diverting attention away from anxious feelings to fun or effortful activities. When the problem has been successfully solved with one of the Solution cards, the player then tosses the Situation card into the Worried Waters, and the Solution card is used to create the foundation or top of a bridge. The object of the game is to build a bridge that carries the player across the Worried Waters to the safety of the other bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are both competitive and cooperative versions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
