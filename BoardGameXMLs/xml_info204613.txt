			<description>Invasion Evasion is a party game that pits friends against each other to prevent or cause a hostile alien takeover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The invasion has begun! Flying saucers are abducting innocent people off the streets and returning them corrupted and changed. It has become impossible to tell apart harmless civilians from vile alien scum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep inside of an underground bunker is a team of humans trying desperately to stop the attacks. They have developed a cure to the alien parasite to transform humans back to normal, but are unable to mass produce it. As they try to gather the supplies necessary to save the planet, it becomes clear that some among them cannot be trusted&amp;hellip; and have more nefarious plans in mind.&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives a secret role and either works with the Humans to mass produce a cure or joins the Aliens&lt;br/&gt;in the construction of a Doomsday Device. The fate of the world hangs in the balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has two features: Status and Role.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Status - whether you are a Human or Alien. This is the team that you are playing for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role - many of which have special powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once Roles and Status Cards are given out players take turns, moving clockwise, and on each turn they start by drawing an Adventure Card from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Cards can drastically change the course of the game. Amongst the many possibilities, players can be abducted and become aliens, thrown into a state of suspended animation, or even probed which renders them silent. Ultimately the Humans are searching the deck to claim Humanity Cards while the Aliens are looking for Doomsday Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many Adventure Cards state that they are Immediate Action and must be played right away, for better or worse. Any card that is not immediate can be played at any point, even on another&amp;rsquo;s turn. If you save a card for later keep it facedown and secret. Some cards will change your own status of being a Human or Alien, and if this change happens keep it hidden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a Humanity or Doomsday Card is drawn it is shown instantly and the player that drew it must decide who gets to hold onto it. They may select him/herself. The owner of the card can freely give it to another player at any point, and they can also lose their card in a variety of ways. Players can hold either type of card, Humanity or Doomsday, regardless of their own status. This allows players to hold cards hostage from the other team. There are two copies of each card within the deck, but only one of each type is needed to win.&lt;br/&gt; Human Victory: Have one Human player hold all three types of Humanity Cards - Alien Specimen, Chemical Stockroom, and Medical Laboratory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alien Victory: Have one Alien player hold all three types of Doomsday Cards - Black Hole Bomb, Perpetual Motion Drive, and Quantum Reactor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As each Humanity and Doomsday card is found it becomes more and more important that they are placed in safe hands, but in Invasion Evasion the teams can constantly change. Who do you trust?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
