							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ogre Battle</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's hard to tell exactly when the problems started. It wasn't until the livestock started disappearing that the town began to suspect something was wrong. Even then, it took some time before evidence of the ogre was brought before the council. By then the complaints had mounted and the people were afraid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually the ogre was tracked back to its lair deep in the limestone caverns to the east. Evidence of dragged deer, cattle, and even human bodies led a group of hunters to the mouth of the cave. They didn't dare go in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fighting an ogre isn't like hunting game. Their massive size, surprising speed, and overwhelming strength pose a great threat to even the most decorated warriors. That's why the council has found its most experienced fighters and has given them access to the best arms and equipment in town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's your job to protect everyone from this threat. This isn't a job for wealth or glory. It's to protect our homes, businesses, and families. There's no telling when a creature of that size will start running out of food and begin preying on the people instead. If you don't stand up to it, it could be your mother or your child that disappears next! It's us against that monster, and the fight is to the death!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document provides limited character creation rules as well as the combat rules for the system.  It has been published in three minor revisions, each making corrections to the previous version.  Confusingly, the Version 1.2 document erroneously retained the &amp;quot;v1.1&amp;quot; notation on the title page.  The document includes an area map and character sheets as print-and-play components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
