			<description>ALL-IN-THE-CARDS-FOOTBALL is a 15 to 20 minute playing card game that has all the exciting, unbelievable plays that occur in real football, such as: Up to &amp;quot;4&amp;quot; fumbles in one play. Return Interceptions or fumbles from &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;-109&amp;quot; yards for a touchdown. Block a kick, return it, and fumble it back over to the kicking team! It is great that all this excitement can be found in a game that can be played almost  anywhere , by yourself or with a friend. Since it only takes a short time to play, you can get a few friends together and play a whole season, and you don't even have to play it during football season! How to play?  The cards are shuffled by the offensive player after each change of possession. Then the deck of cards is cut by the defensive player. At this point, the offensive player begins by turning every third card to determine the outcome of each play. Strategy:  The offensive player must decide on when to punt, kick a field goal, go for a first down or call a time out when needed. Everyone wins with this game, because the end result is ALL-IN-THE-CARDS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
