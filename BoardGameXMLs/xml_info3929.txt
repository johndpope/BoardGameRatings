			<description>Each player has eleven pieces on a 7X7 grid. There are two types of pieces (Sparks and Orbs), only one of which (Sparks) can capture or be captured. The game is won by capturing all of your opponents' Sparks or preventing your opponent from moving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The power or value of a Spark is determined by the number of Orbs it is aligned with; a Spark can only capture another with equal or lesser power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similarly, the mobility of an Orb is determined by the number of Sparks it is aligned with; An Orb can move as many spaces as the number of Sparks it is aligned with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
