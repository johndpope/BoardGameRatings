			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This small book contains the same information about the skills as the core rule book, but also has several tables with modifications for many skills - to help beginners understand how to determine the difficulty of different tasks, and also to enable experienced players to easily and quickly have access to some more advanced lists of modifications for the skills. The purpose of this book is to enable myth masters and players alike to fast and easily be able to look up on the skill modifications and skills in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
