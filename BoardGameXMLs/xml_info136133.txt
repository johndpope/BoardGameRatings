							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kingdom Death: Monster â€“ Messenger of Humanity Promo Miniature</name>
									
			<description>This Messenger might be the First Twilight Knight to desert the Order. Without a partner Archivist to maintain them, his unique relics and physiology modifications turn to complete chaos. He might chain his sword into its sheath and shred his special hood. Perhaps he strikes out into the nightmare world, once again a mere man, in search of his memories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Messenger of Humanity is a promotional miniature that will only be available through the Kingdom Death: Monster kickstarter and future Kingdom Death special events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Messenger of Humanity was supposed to include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    One plastic Messenger of Humanity&lt;br/&gt;    One-shot Challenge Scenario&lt;br/&gt;    Prosthetic Stone Arm Promo Gear Card&lt;br/&gt;    One Settlement Event Card&lt;br/&gt;    One Hunt Event Card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Messenger of Humanity was shipped in Wave 1 of Kickstarter fulfillment, but the game content mentioned in the campaign was not included. Game creator Adam Poots mentioned that the content would be printed and released on their website eventually. For now, it is available in PDF format on the Kingdom Death website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
