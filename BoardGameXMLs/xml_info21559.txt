			<description>How do you win a game if you have more control over your opponents&amp;rsquo; pieces than your own? Figure out the answer in Snowblind, a quasi-strategic Icehouse game for 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: To maximize your score and minimize your opponents&amp;rsquo; scores by putting pieces in taller and smaller stacks, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Need:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Four Icehouse stashes of different colors.&lt;br/&gt;    * An opaque bag (or other opaque container).&lt;br/&gt;    * A 4&amp;times;3 grid. A Volcano board or chess board with some squares blocked off works just fine.&lt;br/&gt;    * Some paper and a pencil for tallying scores at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, take a piece out of the bag and put it on the board. When you put a piece on the board, it must point upward. Pieces are played by these rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Any piece may be placed in a vacant space.&lt;br/&gt;    * A smaller piece may be 'engulfed' by a larger piece if the smaller piece is resting directly on the board.&lt;br/&gt;    * A piece of smaller or equal size may be placed on another piece of equal or greater size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have placed a piece, play passes to the left. The game ends when all pieces have been played. After this, all the stacks are scored. Stacks have a value equal to the point value of the pieces in the stack, multiplied by the number of pieces in the stack. Points are tallied separately by color. A piece that is 'engulfed' is scored by the color that&amp;rsquo;s engulfing it, not by the 'owner' of the engulfed piece. Engulfed pieces do not count for being in a stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest total at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several variants to the rules are also available on the website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/174/snowblind&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/174/snowblind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
