			<description>This is a self-published expansion to Richard Berg's Confederate Rails.  In addition to further loads and contracts, players are now forced to deal with the interference of Confederate Generals Braxton Bragg and Joe Johnston as they lead the South into defeat.  To complicate matters further, there is now interference from Richmond as well as a Navy that believes that it has greater need of your scarce resources than your railroads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Confederate Rails available again from Richard Berg by inexpensive email print and play, the designer has once again made this available as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
