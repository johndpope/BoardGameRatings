			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;This version of the Deck of Many Things was crowdfunded on kickstarter.com in October/ November 2013 and published in summer 2014. Apart from the traditional 22 cards, it contains optional extra cards (Strength, Sword, Wizard, Wolf, and the kickstarter-exclusive The Beginning).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Summary&lt;br/&gt;The Deck of Many Things is a legendary artifact in tabletop roleplaying games such as Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder.  It was introduced to D&amp;amp;D in 1975, in the Greyhawk rules supplement to the original game (the very first D&amp;amp;D supplement ever released).  It has continued to appear in RPG publications ever since, its run of almost four decades making it one of the most legendary items in the  RPG world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Deck of Many Things is usually found in a box or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse.  The character with a deck of many things who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. If the Idiot or Jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw additional cards.  Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the Jester or Fool, which are discarded when drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A classic Deck of Many Things contains 22 cards, but the Analog Games LLC Deck of Many Things includes four new cards as a result of stretch goals requested and unlocked by our Kickstarter backers.  Traditionalists may, of course, choose to leave these cards out of their Deck when using it in play.  Our deck is also composed of entirely original artwork, both front and back.
