			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What evil lurks in the graveyard that is causing the bodies of dead to reanimate? Who is responsible for the evil, the dirty grave keeper in his small hovel or the pious holy-men in their country church? Has an innocent child become lost in the catacombs beneath the mausoleum, or have filthy grave-robbers moved in with an eye on plunder? With D20 Cartographer, the story is in your hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Fantasy Maps&amp;quot; are full-featured encounter maps designed to fit any traditional fantasy world.
