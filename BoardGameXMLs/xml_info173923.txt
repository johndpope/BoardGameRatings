			<description>Beginning Sounds 3-in-a-Row Game is a bingo-type game designed to teach the recognition of beginning letter sounds. Players have 3-by-3 cards marked with pictures. Like Bingo, in order to win, a player must complete a row of three across, down or diagonally.  Unlike Bingo, each player takes turns spinning a spinner marked with five letters. They must then find a picture that starts with the letter spun. Only the player spinning may mark his or her card.  The game comes with four separate sets of cards to cover the entire alphabet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
