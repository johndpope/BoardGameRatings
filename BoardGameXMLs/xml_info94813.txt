			<description>Martian Chess is proudly a digital recreation of a classic board game of the same name by Andrew Looney at Looney Labs. We took a unique board game and tried to breathe some life into it, in the new digital age. We think this turned out to be a quick, fun game for the mobile platform, and we hope you&amp;rsquo;ll agree!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Martian Chess is a chess-like strategy game, but unlike chess only the pieces on your side of the board are yours and you score points for taking your opponents' pieces, there is no &amp;ldquo;checkmate&amp;rdquo;. The game ends when one player has no pieces on his side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2 player board resembles a chess board cut in half while the four player game is a standard 8&amp;times;8 chess board. Each player has their own 4&amp;times;4 part of the field, signified by their colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can practice against 4 varying computer difficulties or grab a friend to play against you on your iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad. If you have an iPad, get three of your friends and try out the 4 player mode (iPad only)! If you&amp;rsquo;re on the go, use the Network Game mode and play an opponent from somewhere else in the world via wifi or 3g/edge. While in a game, you can communicate with them with our in-app chat client.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
