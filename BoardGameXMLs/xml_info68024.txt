							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Five Star Final</name>
									
			<description>This newspaper-themed board game was based on 1931 movie &amp;quot;Five Star Final&amp;quot;. The game includes a large (30&amp;quot; x 17&amp;quot;) and heavy board, five player tokens, 40 Service Tokens, a deck of yellow Assignment Cards, and a deck of white News Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take Assignment Cards from the Editor that show events underway around the board. They then choose how to travel there: by foot, bus, elevated, taxi or subway. By foot is slowest but reaches everywhere; subway is fastest but can mean an additional walk to many locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To complete an assignment, reporters first must arrive on the spot by exact roll of either two dice or one of the two. If they fail to land on the space two turns in a row, they have missed the story and must head back to the office. However, if they stroll back, they get a chance to draw an Assignment card on any other Assignment location on which they land, getting partial or full credit for that story instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players who do land on their Assignment locations must then try to draw a News Card that matches their assignments, drawing twice a turn until they do. When they do draw the right match, they normally get one Service Token, but none if sent to Rewrite, and two if labelled Front Page. Then they head back to get another assignment. First player to get five Service Tokens wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
