							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Das Revolutionsspiel von 1791</name>
									
			<description>Das Revolutionsspiel von 1791 is a thematic implementation of the 16th century Game of Goose.  The game board is illustrated with scenes of the French Revolution in the late 18th century: the pictures from the starting point to the end point follow the course of the event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns to roll the dice and move their tokens according to the total of the dice.  Landing on certain spaces could mean advancing the token further up the path, losing turns, or going back to the starting point.  If a token lands on a chicken space, it gets to double its move (and double it again if it still lands on a chicken space).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player's token lands exactly on the end point, making him or her the winner.  If the movement would overshoot the end point, the token has to backtrack the excess amount.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
