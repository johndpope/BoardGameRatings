			<description>BACKGROUND: THE UNION ABLAZE is semi-historical game of the American Civil War (1861-1865) in the East, also, referred to as the Peninsula. The Game begins shortly after the Confederate States of America (CSA) fired on the Union Fort Sumter. The Confederates are now building up their forces and gathering their Naval Squadrons to kick the Union out of the Southern States. The Union must build their Army and Naval Forces and capture Richmond and Petersburg along with enough key Confederate Settlements before the Confederates capture a number of key Union Settlements to force the Confederates to capitulate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: As the Commander of the Union Naval and Land Forces, you must gather your forces and naval squadrons to capture the Key Victory Point (VP) Confederate Settlements of Richmond and Petersburg (total of 9 VP), along with a number of other Key Confederate Settlements who&amp;rsquo;s VP Values total 26 or more (for a grand total of 35 VP or more) before the Treaty of Appomattox Event Card is Drawn. If the Confederates control a number of Union Settlements worth 20VP or more, the Confederates win. Also, if the &amp;ldquo;Treaty of Appomattox&amp;rdquo; Card has been played and the Union does not control Richmond, Petersburg and an additional 26VP worth of Confederate Settlements, the Confederates win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURES: THE UNION ABLAZE features many colorful game counters, player aids and campaign cards. Units include Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, Gatling Guns, Zouave Infantry, and Sharpshooters. There are, also, many Naval Vessels of the period including Ironclads, Screw-Sloops, Steam Cruisers and Torpedo Boats (including the Hunley). Game includes rules for Army and Naval Heroes that can help turn the tide of Battle with their leadership and fighting abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles are resolved in a fast and fun manner resolved on colorful Battle Mats for both land and naval combat, providing the Player with a flavor of the period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UNION ABLAZE can be found at the following URL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.berserkergames.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.berserkergames.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
