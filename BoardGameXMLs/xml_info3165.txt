			<description>Players are dealt 7 cards and must discard to clear their hand first. Cards left in your hand score against you. You can dump a card onto the discard pile if it has the same color, or number/symbol as the last. As well as the cards numbered 1-8, there are action cards that affect the next player. These may cause you to draw cards, reverse play, elect a colour and so on. But if you have a matching action card, you may play it immediately in reply as a discard, and your card then affects the next player. The action cards cost -10 to -20, the number cards cost their value.&lt;br/&gt;Vague rules in German, English, French, Italian, Spanish and Dutch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
