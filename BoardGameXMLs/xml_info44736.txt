							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Other Suns: Alderson Yards Shipbook</name>
									
			<description>From the publishers site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALDERSON . . . EMINENTLY RESPECTED . . . EVEN BY OUR COMPETITION&lt;br/&gt; There is something very special about an Alderson Yards built ship.&lt;br/&gt; Is it the utilitarian style and comfort of our ships?&lt;br/&gt; Is it the meticulous engineering and design?&lt;br/&gt; Or perhaps it's the reasonable price and the numerous types of vessels we build. That something special goes beyond what you can see or test for. It is a feeling of trust and well being. You know Alderson has a reputation to defend and Alderson Yards will not allow any mistakes to tarnish our image. None.&lt;br/&gt; This catalog contains over 15 of our most popular and useful ships for personal or commercial usage. The information is usable with the Other Sun's gaming system. So enjoy. And remember, Alderson Yards wants your shipbuilding to be fun and rewarding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
