			<description>Space Commander is a wargame of spaceship FLEETS actions. It's rules are simple enough to be understood by anyone, but give a good depth of strategy and involve different races with different skills and ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game wants to depict BIG fleet battles, with all the clich&amp;egrave; of sci-fi: big capital ships, carriers, flight of fighters and starbombers, elite pilots, heroes, missiles, torpedoes, black holes, big spinal cannons, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;All this while keeping a profound strategy and some sensation of realism and real choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RULES:&lt;br/&gt;A game usually consists of 2 factions/fleets, each controlled by one or two &amp;quot;Commanders&amp;quot;. Every Commander has his own set of &amp;quot;order cards&amp;quot;, and his own Flagship: all the other ships of the fleet are &amp;quot;shared&amp;quot; and can be called in combat by all commanders of his own faction.&lt;br/&gt;Before the battle starts, every commander chooses and assigns special equipment/technologies to his faction ships: these represent a fundamental difference in gameplay of every faction, giving special skills to their ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every ship in the game is depicted by a &amp;quot;Ship card&amp;quot;, wich keeps the skills and data of that type of ships: there can be several ships of the same type in battle, and they need only ONE card for all of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn, a Commander play an &amp;quot;Order card&amp;quot; to order one &amp;quot;ship-card&amp;quot;: all the ships belonging to that class (example, all the Fireshield destroyers) could then move and fire. If the order comes from a flagship, she can order 2 different ship-cards (including his own), if there is at least one ship of that card near.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ordered cards get rotated a bit to show it has been activated and cannot be ordered again the next turn (so if there are 2 commanders and one requests for the carrier to act, you cannot order it the next turn but could only &amp;quot;reset&amp;quot; it to active status).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Order cards could also used to activate special abilities on ships (and special equipments) and also have a secondary &amp;quot;effect&amp;quot; and could be discarded to get that effect.&lt;br/&gt;In this way, there are always crucial decisions during the game, like: will I discard a card now to get that missile barrage on my enemy and support the other commander attack, or I will keep it to have more options the next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game almost never falls in a &amp;quot;cannot order anything&amp;quot; scenario, and a commander can expect to order the units he needs most of the time. But if he spens a great deal of cards to support his attacks, his decision could be limited in the next turns, while he builds back his &amp;quot;hand&amp;quot; of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The firing is very simple, based on normal six sided dices rolls. Very rarely one roll is fundamental, since u can always maneuver and use skills to get the best rolling options for your attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has several scenarios already, and more races and scenarios are being developed/tested while we WAIT FOR AN EDITOR (the game is not yet published, just my homemade copy for now and some playtesting copies around).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
