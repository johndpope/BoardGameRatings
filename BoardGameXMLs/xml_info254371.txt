							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A PET Lizzard</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LIZZARD is an eye-hand coordination game played against a three minute timer.  The player tries to snatch a fly from the air with its tongue.  Key 7 on the PET keyboard operates the tongue, which must come up exactly behind the fly for a successful capture.  This is an excellent game to introduce small children to computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A PET Lizzard was programmed by Peter Ripin and Krishna Narayan and published as BASIC type-in source code in Creative Computing, Vol 7, No 3, March 1981.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
