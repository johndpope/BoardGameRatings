			<description>The GreenFrogRedFox Game is not available for purchase. To play for free, simply go to &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.greenfrogredfox.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.greenfrogredfox.com&lt;/a&gt; and follow instructions on the &amp;quot;GAME&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;RULES&amp;quot; link in the top navigation bar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an education roll-and-move game. Each turn, a player (or team) rolls the dice, and moves their pawn the indicated number of spaces. After moving, they will usually have to answer a question, which depends on the space they have landed on. If answered correctly, they score points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time they pass go, the player collects an animal card. These cards are also worth points. However, when a player lands on an Animal Spot, (StrangerBear, BobCat, BuzzFly, AllieGator) they are stuck on that spot until they can discard a matching card. In the meantime, they may draw one new card or trade with another player for a matching card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after all players have answered ten questions correctly. This is tracked by coloring in a drawing. Now, the points from the questions and held animal cards are added up. The player with the most points wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
