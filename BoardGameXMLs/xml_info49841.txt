			<description>Blurb from the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WOLVES AT THE DOOR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vampire loads of the Long Night claim supremacy over medieval Europe - and yet they keep to their castles and cathedrals, worriedly watching the forests between. For great wolves hunt the wild places and pace the roads, and howls of anger echo across the moors. By day they walk as humans - and when the moon rises, their hunt begins. They are the werewolves of the Dark Ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RAGE ACROSS THE LONG NIGHT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Werewolf: The Dark Ages is a supplement allowing Werewolf: The Apocalypse (2nd Edition) players to explore the medieval World of Darkness from the Garou's point of view. This book contains just about anything you could want for adapting werewolves to the Dark Ages setting, from information on the ribes of the time to guidelines for crossing over with Vampire: The Dark Ages. Whether you want to try a completely different spin on medieval horror fantasy, recreate the deeds of your modern-day Garou's ancestors, or even give the Lupins in your Vampire: The Dark Ages game some real teeth, this is the book for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Werewolf: The Dark Ages includes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Dark Medieval setting from the Garou's viewpoint, including details on the Umbra and a close look at the British Isles.&lt;br/&gt;     Full character creation guidelines for medieval werewolves, including tons of new Gifts and fetishes.&lt;br/&gt;     Crossover guidelines for bringing Vampire: The Dark Ages character into your Werewolf games, lists of medieval equipment, and more&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
