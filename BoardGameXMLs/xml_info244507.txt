							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Collection of Fantasy Menus</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tried, bruised and longing for a stiff drink, the party finally makes their way to an inn. Their first question: &amp;quot;What's on the menu?&amp;quot; Now you can be ready to not only answer that question but answer it with style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this publication you will find 20 menus, ready to be printed out and put into the hands of your players. The first 12 are designed for use in inns and larger taverns and are organized by social/economic standing. The next four deal with smaller ale houses, taverns, and breweries. The final four, then, deal with two bakeries and two specialty shops. Each of the initial 12 menus has two versions, one in a more archaic style meant to mimic the historical cookbooks that were used as inspiration for this project and one in a more familiar, modern, style. Each menu is also presented with and without aged paper backgrounds giving you the freedom to print them straight onto basic white paper or a cardstock of your choosing. For simplicity these different styles are split into four different files (archaic with backgrounds, archaic without, modern with backgrounds and modern without) and included in your purchase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
