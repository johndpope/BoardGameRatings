							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">X-plorers Advanced Combat</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full advanced Combat rules by the creator of X-plorers RPG!  These rules are a direct reprint from the now out of print Galactic Troubleshooters magazine #1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The rules presented in the X-plorers core rule book are kept purposely simple.  It is the author&amp;rsquo;s opinion that they give you everything you need to run quick and descriptive combats and get back to the story part of the mission.  An experienced referee should have no problem using his good judgment and the context of those rules to deal with situations that aren&amp;rsquo;t specifically covered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still, there are going to be some who aren&amp;rsquo;t satisfied with the guidelines as written.  There are also going to be some referees who feel that they need more strict structure and consistent modifiers for situations that will come up time and time again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are presented here are totally optional rules classified as &amp;ldquo;Advanced Combat&amp;rdquo;.  It builds off of the core X-plorers combat system, but simply predefines things a referee would usually decide himself (mostly modifiers), and provides some options for people who want more detailed combats.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
