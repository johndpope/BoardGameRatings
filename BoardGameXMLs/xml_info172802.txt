							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Caustic Earth</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Earth has long been burned. What's left is what's been left for 50 years now. You are either touched or tainted. There is nothing in between. All that matters is survival, and that is a day by day adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Caustic Earth is a minimalist, rules lite role playing game of an Earth reborn from chaos. It's meant to be played as a one-off or pick-up night of gaming. You will take the role of one of the Touched or one of the Tainted. It uses the D4Core system as a structure. The rules are simple enough and fast enough that they should be easy to pick up and a game session started with 15-20 minutes preparation time by a Game Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
