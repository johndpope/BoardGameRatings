			<description>From the Introduction:&amp;quot;The Energy Crisis Game is an instructive introduction to the complexities of energy management. Get involved in the challenge of planning our nation's energy reserves&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game Equipment consists of the following: a mounted Gameboard; a tri-folded Rules sheet; 1-(6)-sided DIE; 60-Ration Cards; 1-Coupon Disbursement Packet; 6-Various COLOR Ration Coupon Cards; 20-Barter Certificates; &amp;amp; $2,140 in various denominations ($10s,$50s,&amp;amp;$100s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OBJECT of the Game is to Collect(through buying, selling, bartering, or auctioning), one of EACH of the SAME Color Ration Coupons which are portrayed upon their COLOR Ration Coupon Card. There are various spaces on the gameboard which indicate when a Player can: Collect an amount of Money; Sell, Buy, or Choose a Ration Coupon for some amount of money, BARTER with some other eligible Player, Collect another BARTER Certificate, and on the Supply &amp;amp; Demand spaces-an AUCTION will take place with the Player landing there acting as Auctioneer. There are 2 LARGE Sections of the gameboard designated the &amp;quot;Energy Market Place&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Coupon Disbursement Center&amp;quot; with a &amp;quot;canceled Ration Coupons&amp;quot; place for when there are less than (6)-Players participating. On each of the COLOR Ration Coupons Cards, there are (3)Sections denoting INDUSTRY, CONSUMER, &amp;amp; GOVERNMENT requirements.      &lt;br/&gt; To Start the Game, each Player chooses a Color Pawn and a COLOR Ration Coupon Card, which DOES NOT have to BE of the SAME Color as their PAWN, and then picks one of the (4) corners of the BOARD to begin from. The Players are NOT allowed to perform any action depicted in the CORNER space they begin IN.  &lt;br/&gt; Before starting the Game, MIX &amp;amp; place ALL 60 Ration Coupons within the Packet. Then PICK someone to be the Treasurer and then 3 Ration Coupons are picked from the Packet and placed FACE-UP in the Energy Market Section of the gameboard. The Players are EACH given $200 and starting with the Treasurer(banker), randomly pick (5) Ration Coupons from the Packet, placing ANY identically corresponding ones on his OWN Ration Coupon Card. This is performed until EACH Player is left with (5) Ration Coupons in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then the DIE is rolled by EACH Player with the HIGHEST Rolling Player going first, RE-Rolling the DIE and MOVING in a clockwise direction from where they Started, &amp;amp; then performing any Action as dictated by the space they've landed on. This is performed on every TURN so the ORDER in which Players MOVE and CONDUCT any ACTIONS can be different each TURN. When a Player Lands on the Supply &amp;amp; Demand space, they MUST then Auction ALL (3)Ration Coupons one at a time, in the &amp;quot;Energy Market Place&amp;quot; and can even participate in the Auction, then the next Player can take their Turn. Once the Auctions are completed, then the &amp;quot;Energy Market Place&amp;quot; is replenished with (3)MORE Ration Coupons picked randomly from the Packet. When a Player lands on a Barter space, he is considered to be the &amp;quot;Head Broker&amp;quot; for any Barter offers. Bartering can only be conducted between the &amp;quot;Head Broker&amp;quot; and another Player as long as THAT Player has a Barter Certificate and once concluded, then a Barter Certificate is given up by the BARTERING Player but NOT the &amp;quot;Head Broker&amp;quot;, and placed back with the &amp;quot;Bank&amp;quot;. The &amp;quot;Head Broker&amp;quot; can listen to ALL eligible offers and even REFUSE them if they are insufficient to his desires. There are further detailed RULES for Auctioning and Bartering contained in the rather concise RULES sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
