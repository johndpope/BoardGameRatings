							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deep Carbon Observatory</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep Carbon Observatory is an adventure for Dungeons and Dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure takes players from a town devastated by an unexpected flood, through a drowned land where nature is turned upside down and desperate families cling to the roofs of their ruined homes, hiding from the monstrous products of a disordered world, through the strange tomb of an ancient race, to a profundal zone, hidden for millennia and now exposed, and finally to the Observatory itself, an eerie abandoned treasure palace, where they will encounter a pale and unexpected terror which will seek to claim their lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is suitable for a lucky mid-range party, a stupid high-level party or an exceedingly clever low level party. It is difficult, with a meaningful possibility of character death. Should you find them, and defeat their guardians, the treasures of an ancient culture will be yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the final point of the Observatory is a glimpse of another world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep Carbon Observatory is about 90 pages long, 20,000 words with four maps and extensive artwork by Scrap Princess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stats are minimal and given for LOTFP but should be easily transferable into any simple D&amp;amp;D system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
