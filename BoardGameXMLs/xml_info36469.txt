			<description>&amp;quot;Players control Pirate ships in search of plunder &amp;amp; adventure. Victory: The first player to accumulate 100 Gold is the winner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move their ships around a circular ring of 48 spaces. The starting space is Port Royal, a safe zone. The other spaces consist of areas at sea or merchant ships. Merchant ships can be plundered for goods, which are exchanged for gold in port. Certain spaces cause turns to be lost, others call for a card draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players face warships, weather, and other hardships. Players can also battle one another when they land on the same space, which can lead to a boarding action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
