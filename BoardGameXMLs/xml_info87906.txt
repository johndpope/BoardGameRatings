							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Console Legends</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Console Legends is a GMless game of story-telling. Players control the characters and story as a whole, without &amp;quot;owning&amp;quot; any particular element. The rules exist to make the game flow more smoothly, and to give it the feel of console RPGs.&lt;br/&gt;The core of the game is the Visions system, in which each player writes down a number of things they want others to describe as the game progresses. When you describe someone else's Vision, you receive Boss Dice to use at the end of an Act (the only place that dice are used). As the group plays together more, they become more familiar with each other's ideas of the game, and are able to bring each others' Visions into play more easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
