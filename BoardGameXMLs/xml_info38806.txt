			<description>&amp;middot;    For President 2008 The 2008 elections are a turning point in American history. The era of President George W. Bush will soon be over. Will Barack Obama bring &amp;ldquo;Change we can believe in&amp;rdquo;? Or will John McCain bring &amp;ldquo;Change we need&amp;rdquo;? Both similar sounding slogans stand for completely different concepts deciding which turn America&amp;rsquo;s policy will take in the future. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;    The Democrats and Republicans are divided by a deep gap of controversial political concepts. The economy, the war in Iraq, America&amp;rsquo;s dependence on oil imports, alternative energy concepts, and other major events which shaped the actual campaign are represented in a card driven game system. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;    In For President 2008 you take the role of Team Obama or Team McCain.
