							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Xenomorphs: The Fall of Somerset Landing</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dare to enter a gritty setting of sci-fi survival horror! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In these pages you will find a survival horror setting for your science-fiction WOIN games detailing known space, careers, equipment, monsters, and more; plus a detailed terraforming colony on a small, weatherbeaten moon some 40 light years from Earth, and a terrifying adventure which charts the events just prior to the colony&amp;rsquo;s loss of contact with the Chen Zua Corporation, the company behind the terraforming technology that oversees the United Planets Terraforming Contracts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terror and monsters await in the depth of space!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So welcome to Somerset Landing and hold on tight&amp;hellip; as all hell is about to break loose!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A full-colour 60-page softback setting book which introduces the universe of Xenomorphs,including a 15-page adventure called The Fall of Somerset Landing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the late 22nd century. Humanity has travelled some 50 light years from Earth, but has not yet encountered any intelligent alien civilizations. Colonies &amp;mdash; usually financed by the massive Chen Zua Corporation&amp;mdash;litter known space, mining, terraforming, and researching, as humanity slowly pushes its frontiers forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back on Earth, much of the wasted space &amp;mdash; Antarctica, the great deserts &amp;mdash; has been terraformed and the planet is crowded; resources are running low, a situation which is driving the push out into the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is divided into three sections:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The setting. The first 24 pages of the book describes the overall setting, its main features, player races (Human Norms, Belters, Jovians, Clones, and Synthetics) and careers, and a brief overview of the section of the galaxy that humanity has explored. You can use this section to run your own adventures and campaigns in this setting.&lt;br/&gt;    The colony. The next 8 pages of the book describes a sample colony, Somerset Landing, some 12 parsecs from Earth. You can run adventures of your own on Somerset Landing, or you can use the adventure in the third part of this book.&lt;br/&gt;    The adventure. In the third 15-page section of this book, you&amp;rsquo;ll find an adventure called The Fall of Somerset Landing, a dark horror adventure in which alien xenomorphs invade the colony...&lt;br/&gt;    Pregenerated characters. Plus a 10-page appendix containing a selection of pregenerated characters. Because in Xenomorphs, you might not make it out alive...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xenomorphs is a gritty, dark, survival horror setting. Known space is largely dominated by a self-serving corporation, and the setting primarily features blue-collar workers or marines. The game should feel claustrophobic; colonies are dark, cold, and hammered with rain. Death is around every corner, whether by an engineering accident or by something else...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
