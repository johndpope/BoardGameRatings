			<description>Using a map based on actual places, this game relies on a card-drawing mechanic for players to determine their end-game strategy.  The object is to build terminals and gates at airports, purchase a fleet of various aircraft, and hopefully, overcome pirates and mother nature to fly your routes and collect fares.  The player who manages to keep his fleet intact and successfully fly his routes will have the advantage...until a hurricane hits his home base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
