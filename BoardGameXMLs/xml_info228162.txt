			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a fan of good old-fashioned Marvel Mayhem, have we got a treat for you. Contained in this book are the stats for hundreds of Marvel and DC characters for use in the classic Marvel Super Heroes Role-Playing Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The material in this mighty tome was originally compiled by Gabitch, based on materials from the web. Gabitch&amp;rsquo;s book compiled many rule changes and errata from other sources, which I have subsequently done away with. Simplicity being the rule, it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessary to reprint every Dragon magazine article and every house rule that&amp;rsquo;s been posted on the web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All I have done is condensed the prior work into something easy to use for the Judge or Player who already has the requisite rulebooks. Hopefully, I was successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This item includes illustrations that probably are copyright infringing.  Too, it includes extensive material derived from various copyrighted sources integrated with user-generated contest.  Generally, these materials are not properly attributed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
