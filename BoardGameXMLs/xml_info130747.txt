			<description>Balancing game. To set up for play, you must assemble a palm tree and place the monkey on the point of the top of the tree. He will balance there very precariously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His limbs are so arranged that you can slide one of your plastic bananas on to a couple of limbs. Every success scores you a point. If succesful, you get to balance another and so on until you make him fall or you drop a banana or you get all 16 bananas on which would score you bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play three rounds and the one who has accumaleted the most points, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
