			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are secrets that they don't teach in school. Bookmarks in history books that point to pages that don't exist. The world that has been sold to us is not authentic. The sterile white rooms that test observable reality exist to protect us from the things that we might find out if we look for ourselves. Science would have you believe that everything that is has only existed for a finite period of time. Humans are only 200,000 years old. We'll celebrate our world's five billionth birthday in about half a billion years. The books will tell you that we were hunter-gatherers first. We emerged from evolution only recently. We're just a blink in the eye of the universe, hurling through space on a lonely rock. Alone in the universe with nothing on the other side of reality.&lt;br/&gt;Lies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We, and the world we live on, is far older than they tell us. There is another world that existed before. Before we evolved. Before the dinosaurs. Before the great ice ages. Before Jesus. Before Babel. Before Pangea. Before everything we know and everything that science teaches us there was a time of technology and magic. Of heroes and gods who walked among us. Of divine creatures barely removed from the birth of our world. This was a time before our eyes were blinded. Before our ears failed to hear the songs of the incarna. Before our souls withered away from the disconnection to the truth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the story we have forgotten. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the Warsong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delve into the fantastic, futuristic world of Lemuria in Warsong, the Sengoku Punk role-playing game. This quick start includes everything you need to play including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Setting Information&lt;br/&gt;    Character Creation&lt;br/&gt;    System Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
