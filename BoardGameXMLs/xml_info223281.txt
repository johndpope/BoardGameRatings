			<description>Author's statement:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My hope with RemiNES was that you could make almost anything with it. Or at least, anything that might have showed up in an old SNES or Sega Genesis game. Dark magicians, armored turtles, whip-weilding vampire hunters... heck, I might have even snuck in some things from later generation consoles. I had a choice between leaving all the powers flavorless, or giving them individual flavors but giving you the option of changing that flavor. I went with the latter, just in case somebody doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to do all the work of making stuff up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
