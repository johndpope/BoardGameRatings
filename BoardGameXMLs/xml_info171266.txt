			<description>There's a big chaos among toys in Andy's room. The toys played hide-and-seek and now all of them are lost. Mind the colours symbols and character appearancee and the friends will Surely be found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this short game is to get rid of all the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game cards are dealt evenly to all the players. Three different toys (or other objects) must be placed in the center of the table. Each round players unveil their cards simultaneously and when two or more of them depict the same character (in exactly the same pose) owners of those cards have to touch according toys as fast as possible. Player who touches the toy as the second one (or touches the wrong toy) collects all cards from the table and put them to the bottom of his/her stack. If there's no pair of identical characters, players unveil another cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 9 cards that change the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    3 cards with Mr. Potato Head - character game (looking for certain character in the ssame pose)&lt;br/&gt;    3 cards with Hamm - colour game (looking for a card with backgground in the same colour)&lt;br/&gt;    3 cards with alien - symbol game (looking for a card with the same symbol in the corner)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a special card appears the rules of looking for pairs are immediately changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player who is first to unveil all of his/her cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
