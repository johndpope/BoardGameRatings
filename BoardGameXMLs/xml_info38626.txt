			<description>&amp;ldquo;Charles XII became the King of Sweden in 1697 at the age of fifteen. He inherited a sizable empire and one of the best armies in the world. Sweden's rivals thought they could take advantage of the young King. The Great Northern War (1700 - 1721) was a military struggle between Sweden on one side, and Russia, Denmark, and Saxony-Poland on the other.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;At the Battle of Kliszow Charles XII invaded Poland to try and knock Saxony-Poland out of the war. Although outnumbered the Swedes won an impressive victory, thanks in large part to their outstanding cavalry. The Swedes were unable to follow up their victory, however, and the Saxons would remain a problem for Charles XII for years to come.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The order of battle for each army (Swedish and Saxon) is broken down according to the position of the units on the battlefield: the left wing, right wing, or center. Each wing has a separate commander and each army has an overall commander. According to the rules, the Polish Army is not included in the setup because those forces were routed soon after the fighting began.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
