			<description>Home Sheep Home was created to be released on the launch of newly designed Shaun the Sheep website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Predominantly a puzzle solving game, the aim is to get Shaun, Shirley and Timmy back to the safety of the barn, whilst avoiding the obstacles. There are often a number of different ways of completing each of the 15 levels, which has prompted numerous walk-through guides across the internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within a month of launching Home Sheep Home on the Shaun the Sheep website and seeding it to various gaming portals, the game racked up over 6.5 million plays, with an impressive personal-best of 900,000 plays in one day. It was also featured as a favourite game on the homepages of top gaming portals, Newgrounds and Kongregate, and has now been hosted by over 3,600 other sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Sheep Home has now had over 80 million plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
