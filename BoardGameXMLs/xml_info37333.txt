			<description>Contents: four series of eleven cards, numbered from 1 to 11, 1 board and 3 pawns for keeping track of the scores and of the strongest colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One must compare his hand with the values of those set upon the table. He choose any set of cards face-up which values add to the total of the one he chooses to play,and collect all those cards. If the captured set is of maximum size, it is called a &amp;ldquo;glop&amp;rdquo;, and this is rewarded with more scoring points. The first to raise 30 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
