			<description>Box Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;London, 1969. Charlie Croker has just finished a three year stretch, courtesy of Her Majesty's Prisons, and has an idea: to steal $4,000,000 in gold bullion, right from under the noses of the Mafia and the Turin Police.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is where you come in... as one of his drivers, you'll have to master 14 vehicles, including flashy sports cars and the legendary Mini Cooper, as you screech down sewers, roar over rooftops and tear through the Alps, with the Mob and the law hot on your heels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It'll be the crime of your life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
