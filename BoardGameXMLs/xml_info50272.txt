			<description>The predecessor to GURPS, Man to Man focuses on medieval combat and plays out as a tactical RPG.  The IQ attribute has minimal uses, there are no Disadvantages, and it's only useful for roleplaying in a purely combat situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players design their own fighters, ranging from sword-wielding barbarians to archers and martial artists. The rules let players attack, dodge, parry, block, and maneuver in a realistic fashion using a hex-map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character creation is handled with either a customized point-based system or random attribute rolling. A sophisticated combat and skill system takes into account armor penetration, hit locations, critical hits and misses, several combat-focused scenarios, and all the weapons a medieval warrior could want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;There are 60 numbered pages plus 20 pages of charts, character sheets, maps, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
