			<description>PERFIDIOUS is a two player war game, set on a small map where two factions battle for control of the other&amp;rsquo;s Home Hex.  All the armies in the game have their true strength hidden and battles are won based on the claims of the players (but the players can lie to win).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must use deceit to outwit their opponent and only by hiding your strengths and weaknesses will they succeed. But be careful; your opponent can call your bluffs and in doing so, may unravel your plans completely!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The base rules are simple and easy to learn but the game can be modified by a collection of optional rules to be mixed and matched at the start of the game by the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is also completely free to play and can be printed with any standard printer using 8&amp;frac12;x11 paper.  Some components require cutting so scissors are required for the initial building of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is released under the Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
