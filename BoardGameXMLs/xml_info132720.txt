			<description>Card game with 45 cards that feature many of the Disney characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal out all the cards. Each player places their cards, without looking at them, in a stack in front of themselves. The first player turns over a card and places it in the middle of the table. The next follows, and so on. If a 'Value' card is so placed, the next player must add that number of cards to the central pile. The game continues in this way and if you are out of cards you are also out of the round. The round ends when one player has all the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a Big Bad Wolf card and if this is revealed, the player must give four cards to any other that shouts &amp;quot;Wolf!&amp;quot; first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each round of play, the player winning the round gets 1 point for every other player in the game. First to get 12 points or more, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;List of cards:&lt;br/&gt;Value 3 = Elmar Elephant, Pluto&lt;br/&gt;Value 2 = Three Little Pigs, Dopey Horace Horsecollar&lt;br/&gt;Value 1 = Snow White, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck&lt;br/&gt;No value cards &lt;br/&gt;Ambrose Kitten, Max Hare, Clara Cluck, Goofy&lt;br/&gt;Tilly Tiger, Minnie Mouse, The Twins, Toby Tortoise&lt;br/&gt;Dirty Bill, Clarabelle, Pied Piper, Donna Duck&lt;br/&gt;Country Cousin, 3 Little Wolves&lt;br/&gt;Special Penalty card&lt;br/&gt;Big Bad Wolf&lt;br/&gt;There are two of each card except the only Big Bad Wolf card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
