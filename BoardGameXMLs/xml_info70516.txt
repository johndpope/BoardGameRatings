			<description>from publisher website&lt;br/&gt;Matchplay is the challenging new golf theme card game from PlayMore Games!  Matchplay was inspired by a centuries old Scottish golf competition that paired players in a challenge match where each hole contested was worth up to one point. In keeping with the time honored Scottish tradition Matchplay is designed to recreate that competitive format by offering non-stop strategic decision making opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played as a traditional tabletop card game or as an online game. The online option allows players to choose from three different opponent options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MatchPlay is simply about winning more holes than your opponent. Players compete for the lowest score on each hole. If a player records a lower hole-score than their opponent they receive a one point advantage. If both players record the same score, they tie the hole and neither player receives a point. Players use any scorecard for an 18-Holes match, contest 3- Holes per deal, and try to outpoint their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
