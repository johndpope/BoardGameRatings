			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where were you, the day the Earth died?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An unexplained cataclysm is infecting the world. Millions are dying and rising as flesh-consuming ghouls. Entire cities are roaming graveyards, and even the countryside is overrun with creatures in search of living flesh. Those remaining are banding together for survival, some seeking safety in numbers and others seeking to use their numbers to overpower and dominate the weak. It's a war for survival. A . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; . . . War of the Dead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War of the Dead brings the zombie apocalypse to the award winning Savage Worlds role-playing game. Broken down into 4 chapters of 13 adventures each, Chapter One begins aboard the maiden voyage of the Pinnacle cruise ship as the group first encounters the Living Dead. Unfortunately for the characters, having 3,000 people in such a confined space enables the Living Dead to spread quickly, and before they know it-they're forced into a battle of pure survival against a cruise ship overrun with zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can they survive long enough to get back to land?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are: character creation tips and guidelines; gamemasters information on the Living Dead, their abilities and behavior; guidelines for running a War of the Dead campaign&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
