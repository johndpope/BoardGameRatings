							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ghoulash: The Last Game on Earth Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The classic, 1982 pen and paper game has been reimagined as an all new, action-packed card game adventure. Set in a world overrun by Ghouls, Ghoulash: The Last Game on Earth tasks players with defeating the green, deadly monsters and restoring order to the world. Playing as one of the intrepid Ghoul Hunters, you will use your abilities, think on your feet, and destroy the Ghouls before they hurt more innocent bystanders!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns exploring the world of Ghoulash by flipping over Encounter Cards. As players go deeper into the world, they will face many challenges, from Ghouls to holes and debris, as well as run into innocent Bystanders that slow them down but offer rewards to Ghoul Hunters who help them. Along the way, players will use Value Cards, Action Cards, Rescue Cards and Specialty Cards to defeat Ghouls and earn victory points. First person to 10 points wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
