			<description>&amp;quot;Can YOU gain freedom for the oppressed minorities? Or as the Russians can you preserve the last multinational colonial empire in the world? Play this game and find out!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this game is the struggle of five minorities (Armenians, Balts, Belorussians, Moslems and Ukrainians) to establish republics independent of the central Soviet government (which, in practice, was actually that of the Russian majority). They do this by declaring secession (consistently misspelled &amp;quot;succession&amp;quot; in the rules) and defending its breakaway move. Combat is conducted by matching cards and either &amp;quot;battle&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;guerrilla&amp;quot; tactics, which leads to gain or loss of support points. Play is varied by events (e.g. Sino-Soviet War), foreign support (from America, China, Iran or Western Europe), and betrayals. The Soviet players wins by playing all five reform cards (e.g. &amp;quot;release political prisoners&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;purge hard-liners&amp;quot;)and having no independent republics. The Minorities win by having at least three independent republics in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
