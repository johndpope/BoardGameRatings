			<description>Komm mit durch Deutschland! is a trivia game for children focusing on German cities and other places of interest. Players draw cards with towns, popular sights or landmarks from a number of cards placed next to the board. The place on the card should be very close to a neutral figure on the game board which is a map of Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After that, the cards are turned and you can see where the places really are and the players put their figures on that place on the board. The player who has his figure closest to the neutral figure can answer a question to get closer to this figure. If he can't answer the question, the second player can answer the question and so on. After that, the closest players score points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes two maps of Germany: a more detailed map with cities and rivers on it, and another one without it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
