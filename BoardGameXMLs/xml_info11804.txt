			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planetaire is a game of planetary war.  From the surface, through the atmosphere, and into outer space, two players battle using fighters, mother ships, killer satellites and beam tanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planetaire is an abstract strategy game played on a board of four concentric circular tracks (orbits). A player takes one action on a turn; an action can be moving a piece, attacking with a piece, or loading or unloading fighters (which can be carried by motherships).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The different pieces move and attack differently. Fighters move two spaces a turn and can only attack adjacent pieces. Motherships can move one space or jump into hyperspace from the outer orbit (allowing them to re-enter any space in the outer orbit on a later turn), and they have beam weapons which can attack pieces two or three spaces away. Beam tanks and killer satellites also have beam weapons; beam tanks can only move around the inner orbit and satellites can only jump into hyperspace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to remove all opposing pieces from the inner orbit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
