							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Indiana Jones and the Legion of Death</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you and Indiana Jones survive the land of THE LEGION OF DEATH?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Millionaire Waldo Shyster-Haven has asked Indiana Jones to lean an expedition into the South American jungles to locate his lost collection of priceless Incan artifacts. Three search parties have already disappeared and the locals blame the infamous Legion of Death. Indy's old friend, archaeologist Sir Reginald Brooksbank, is among the missing, so Indy agrees to take on this desperate mission-and you go along for the adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the very start, when your tiny plane sputters to a halt, you are in terrible danger. Depending on the decisions you make, you and Indy could find yourselves in a steamy snake-infested rain forest, on a treacherous expedition down the Amazon River, deep inside an ancient well, or face to face with the terrifying Legion of Death. Every exciting and frightening choice is up to you as you FIND YOUR FATE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
