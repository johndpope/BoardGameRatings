			<description>An old Hungarian chess variant. The title means Who is the winning army leader? The pieces (stickered checkers) depict 6 kind of modern (at that time) military units. They move a little bit differently from the pieces in chess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players get a a 10x10 grid with terrain (basically some squares are obstacles for some pieces). They secretly deploy their armies, put the boards next to each other and then alternate turns moving one of their units, and optionally capturing a unit of the opponent. The goal is to capture either the leader or all the other units of the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a partnership variant where some of the units in your army are controlled by your partner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
