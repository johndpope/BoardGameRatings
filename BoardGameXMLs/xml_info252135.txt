			<description>The King of Hell has passed away and players in Hell village competes to score highest evil point to become the Demon King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to the previous game &amp;quot;Demon Worker&amp;quot; released by the same author, Hell village added few more elements and mechanics on the game such as dice rolling, manipulation of dice result, village building and resources income etc. The cards for worker placement are transformed into a main board with a score board. Also, the artwork is remade with more detailed design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is comprised of 7 rounds. In each round, players have to roll 3 dice to decide the player order and then take turns to place their dice one by one to any available function on the main board. The dice result also decides the number of resources that could be taken from the supply. A player can always kick out the other player dice on the main board if his die is smaller than others and all spaces on that function are occupied. Each round has an event card that requires player to pay certain resources at round end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some worker placement areas allow for cards to be played for ongoing effects or cards may be played into a city structure (ala tile-placement) for more bonuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also provides variations that the functions on the mainboard would be evolved during the middle to late game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
