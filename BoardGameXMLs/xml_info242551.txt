							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Science Ninjas: Valence Plus</name>
									
			<description>Valence Plus is a fun card game that uses simple math, colors, and cartoon ninjas to teach kids (8+) chemistry! Players combine more than 12 different elements to interact with each other and win the game! Valence Plus expands on the elements and chemical reactions players can make from the original Valence game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw Element cards from the deck in order to form Molecules. Each Element has a different Valence number that describes how many electrons it has to give (positive) or how many electrons it needs (negative) to have a full valence shell. If the Valence numbers add up to zero, they form a Molecule!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Molecule is worth a certain point value. If your molecules add up to 16 points then you win the game! But beware&amp;hellip; several molecules are vulnerable to attack from your opponents! Acids attack Bases (4 points) and turn them into Salt and Water (1 point each). Deadly Carbonyls (which have the special power of removing oxygen from the board) are vulnerable to attack by Water. Players interact with each other using real chemical reactions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
