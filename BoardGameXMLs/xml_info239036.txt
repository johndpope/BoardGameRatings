							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Modern Ruins 7</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 48 x 30 inch Battlemap of a Modern Ruin, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;There ain&amp;rsquo;t much left here. Be on guard though, enemy stragglers could still be around. All we need to do is find ourselves an intact bridge to get to the front lines. Intel says the bridge east of here is still standing. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope they are right this time boys. Move out!&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Lieutenant Commander Monteth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern Ruins 7 is a single level exterior map of a bombarded city block.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern Ruins 7 can be utilized in modern, post-apocalyptic, horror, or military games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the Ruins:  The player characters&amp;rsquo; battalion has been ordered to go through a ruined city in the hopes of finding a bridge to reach the front lines. The city has been devastated by carpet and fire bombing. The battalion expected little to no resistance. Instead they find themselves almost immediately under attack by an enemy sniper in the last building standing in the center of the city. The city is almost completely rubble at this point and finding effective cover is difficult to counter the sniper&amp;rsquo;s line of sight. The only cover available is barely standing walls and corners of buildings along with wilted trees. Trying to close in on the enemy sniper brings some more surprises; the sandbag barriers are manned by enemy soldiers with machine guns that wait for the battalion to approach the center of the city. As the battalion approaches they lift up their MGs on tripods and mow down soldiers. Cheval de frises have been set up along the roads to slow wheeled armored scout cars, cavalry, and infantry (but unlikely to do too much against tracked vehicles unless a metal spear hits just right and disables a track). It&amp;rsquo;s a trap set up by desperate men who desire revenge for what has happened to their city and are willing to sacrifice their lives to extract a price from the advancing enemy. Can the player characters survive the trap and find the bridge to cross over to get to the front lines?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
