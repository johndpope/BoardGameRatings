			<description>It's time once again for the Harvest Festival in the Kingdom of Hybras Isle. As the citizens of the Kingdom prepare for the annual celebration, it's up to you, the players, together to pay respects to the Ancestors' Tree, where the Luck of the people can be stored for the coming year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players decide when the game ends before beginning: First to X Coins (victory points that are also a resource in the game); Play X Rounds and whoever has the most Coins wins; Play until all Coins are taken from the Bank and the one with the most wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player draws a hand of three villagers at the start of each round. On their turns, players play a card, add their villager's luck value to the communal score, follow the effect of their card, then draws 1 card from the deck and passes to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But be careful - even luck has its limits, and you can't gather too much at a time without breaking the old tree. You can't play a card if it would raise the score over 99, and if you can't play any cards at all, you're out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player left standing wins their prize for the round, the deck is shuffled back up, and the fun begins anew!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
