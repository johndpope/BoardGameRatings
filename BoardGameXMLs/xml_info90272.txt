			<description>Euronimoes is a euro-style print-and-play game for 2-4 players requiring only the rules (which include a playing mat), one or two sets of double-six dominoes, and a handful of poker chips.  It takes about 10 minutes per player to play, and it takes less than a minute to &amp;quot;build.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How does it differ from your ordinary, garden-variety game of dominoes? Players of Euronimoes are trying to play their dominoes in their own personal area in such a way as to minimize their point count at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pips in any column must form one or more sequential runs &amp;ndash; at the end of the game, the value of a run is equal to its smallest number. A run of 6-5-4-3, for example, is worth 3; a run of 4-3-2-1-0 is worth 0. And again, players don&amp;rsquo;t want points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a bit more to it than that, of course, since players also have to buy the dominoes they play, but that&amp;rsquo;s it in a nutshell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a simple game, but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot going on. Players of Euronimoes will quickly find that it takes plenty of planning, quite a lot of strategy, and at least a little luck to come out on top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyone who enjoys puzzle games should definitely give it a try.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
