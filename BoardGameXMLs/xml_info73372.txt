			<description>From the Newsletter's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the second Wasteland Games update. It has proven to be a bit more irregular than we anticipated (we were all abducted last June - or something). It is now back with a vengeance and we may even get another one out this year (yeah, right). In this update, you will find extra bits and pieces to help you use STOCS lite for your own fantasy/medieval games, most of which first appeared in Future Roleplayer magazine. Of course, if you want a magic system you'll have to rip off somebody else's or come up with one of your own. My own personal favourite is to give magic to the NPC's only and have them do whatever you want. That should help keep magic an unknown, mysterious and barely logical entity (and saves you having to worry about internal consistency). Maybe for the next update, we'll give the basis for a magic system. Coming out in the early Summer ('96), we have another two background/sourcebooks for STOCS lite. The first is El Paso, a Wild West sourcebook with lots of pretty essential gun totin', fast gamblin', bronco-bustin', train-robbin' information. We also have Heretics, a Modern Horror sourcebook that plunges the players into the depths of insanity. Topics under consideration for future updates are: Careers in STOCS lite, Vehicles (poop- poop) and a Point Blank conversion for El Paso. We also intend to bring out a set of quick- reference cards for STOCS lite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
