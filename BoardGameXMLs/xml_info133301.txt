			<description>The Exile's Tragedy is &amp;quot;a Game of Roles and Plays&amp;quot; submitted to the Game Chef contest 2011. It is a short game, written entirely in iambic pentameters, about a conflict between a duke and his daughter, into which the player characters are drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players, gather round this table vast:&lt;br/&gt;upon these shores where danger lives with slaughter: thy heroes wracked, they haven find at last&lt;br/&gt;where Duke Orsino rules, despite his daughter.&lt;br/&gt;Amanda, now in conflict with her sire,&lt;br/&gt;doth seek support and &amp;rsquo;gainst him threatens ill.&lt;br/&gt;She seeks a champion, she would now conspire&lt;br/&gt;to seize her father&amp;rsquo;s crown against his will.&lt;br/&gt;What will the heroes do? Which part uphold?&lt;br/&gt;Though nobles all, the actions they will choose&lt;br/&gt;may greatness find, or leave their bodies cold&lt;br/&gt;and dead before the tale is done. Some lose.&lt;br/&gt;So, gentles, pray: the fates that ye take here&lt;br/&gt;shall rival those from William Shakespeare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
