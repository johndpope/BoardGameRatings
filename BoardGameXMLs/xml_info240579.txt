			<description>StoryWorld is a card game whose main objective is to tell a story among all the players using their imagination and creativity. It's a game without language dependence for all ages that guarantees really fun moments. Ideal for children, fun for adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not a competitive game, rather it is a collaborative game that seeks to strengthen teamwork and moments of coexistence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is composed of cards, which only contain drawings that must be interpreted by the players when telling their part of the story. Each player decides what to say during his turn following the course of the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
