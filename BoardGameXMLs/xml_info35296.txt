			<description>&amp;quot;A new concept of logic and strategy game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of five shallow metal dishes that sit on a cruciform plastic holder.  Each dish is a different primary color, and there are five marbles that match the dish colors.  The last component is a deck of cards that show the five dishes as colored circles.  Each card has a different combination of the five marbles (smaller colored circles) distributed among the dishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
