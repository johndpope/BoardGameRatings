							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tar Pits</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The road from the mine has always been a treacherous one. The scholars say that the sticky black tar that bubbles from the ground is linked to the black firestone that the miners delve for, but that's never concerned Old Gret. His mind is set on watching his footing as he crosses another rickety bridge. He doesn't want to end up like those behemoths beneath him, their bleached bones still stuck in the tar. He's so preoccupied, he doesn't notice some of the bones begin to move...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Need a quick map for an encounter?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A printable battlemap compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A 30 x 30 map depicting a rough road, interrupted by a set of large bubbling tar pits. Rickety wooden bridges cross the tar pits, with evidence of earlier bridges that collapsed into the sticky bitumen. The bleached bones of large animals are stuck in the tar - stark reminders of the dangers of crossing the Tar Pits. Near one of the bridges is a wrecked wagon - the contents of mined ore and stone spilling out, and spattered with worringly-fresh blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
