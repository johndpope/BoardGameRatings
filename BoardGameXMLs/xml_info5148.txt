							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Triani</name>
									
			<description>The object of Triani is to draw and capture cards that enable a player to outscore opponents in &amp;quot;booking&amp;quot; his section of the playing board. 1 &amp;quot;book&amp;quot; consists of three cards of any suit; the sum being the same as the point value above a card outline on the board. A player may double his score by forming a &amp;quot;book&amp;quot; of three cards of his suit. Quick climaxes with unpredictable outcome till the last, as players strive to obtain the high value &amp;quot;TRIANI BONUS SCORE&amp;quot; (Joker and two Aces in their suit).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Triani is played with a special board, but normal decks of cards, the exact number determined by the number of people playing (1-2 decks plus Jokers).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
