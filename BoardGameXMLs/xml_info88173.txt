			<description>Taking place many years in the future in colonized space, military scientists have disposed of countless, defective military droids on an un-colonized terrestrial planet called Ryxx. The droids eventually become sentient and, by way of revenge, start an attack against mankind, using a station to continually create more war machines. It is the player's mission to undergo Project X and eliminate the droid forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a classical scrolling shooter fashion, players control a spacecraft of their choosing battling with hundreds of alien ships. Various power-ups, numerous in the first level but increasingly rare afterwards, permit an exponential increase of the spacecraft's seven different weapons (Guns, Buildup, Side shots, Homing missiles, Plasma, Magma, Laserbeam).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is composed of five levels. Many players never completed the second one (which had a very difficult ending), and most of the rest never went past level three. When Team17 realized this, they released Project-X SE, a special edition with the difficulty toned down. It was released as a budget game. A hack for the original game to enable the player to skip levels by holding down the fire button and pressing the escape key was also distributed on the coverdisks of several Amiga magazines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Project-X&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
