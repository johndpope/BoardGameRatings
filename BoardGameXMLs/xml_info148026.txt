							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Gallows</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 3d gallows are a freebie created by Grey Matter Games in partnership with DramaScape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes a five page 3d gallows for use as an expansion with our Courtyards Ruins module. Each individual page has instructions on how many pages to print and how to cut, fold, and glue the paper together to build the individual building blocks that when glued together will form the 3d gallows. These 3d gallows can be laid out on top of our Courtyard Ruins 2d gallows, making that area stand out as the centerpiece of the map and the scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These 3d gallows are also useful as a stand-alone product. They could be used in nearly any medieval fantasy or western setting as the main stage of an execution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether the group needs to stop the execution of an innocent person or guard the execution site so that a criminal finally gets his just reward, the 3d gallows make a standout addition to an execution scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note this is a simple 3d object, meant for beginners, and is not exactly the same as the illustration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
