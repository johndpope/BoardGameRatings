			<description>Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant places you at the center of one of the most exciting periods in Traveller history. It is the dawn of the Third Age of the Imperium. The dark times of the empire are behind us, and the future is ripe with the promise of rapid expansion, untold adventures, and even danger, on the wild frontiers of the galaxy. But rewards come only to those who are bold enough to seize that once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant is a chance to carve out your own piece of the cosmos. You have been tasked by the Emperor to move into a new sector of the galaxy: Use your newly-acquired Imperial Warrant to Explore, to Expand and to Exploit this new area for the glory of the Imperium&amp;hellip; and for your own fame and glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
