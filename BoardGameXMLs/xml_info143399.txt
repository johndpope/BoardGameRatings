							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gauntlet of Death</name>
									
			<description>In-Game Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You now face the deadliest test known to man. The gauntlet is filled with invisible traps, avoidable by those who know where not to tread, and those who are just lucky!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use the arrow keys to move your man about. White lines are walls, D's are doorways and P's are potions. Some potions heal, some allow you to see traps and others poison you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't drink your potions immediately. Trap detection only lasts briefly and healing doesn't work when you are not hurt. T's are treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Press 'I' to get an inventory and report of your injuries. Press 'U' to tell the computer you want to use a potion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
