							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tide of Valor: The Normandy Campaign</name>
									
			<description>Hit the beaches of France in the first phase of the Allied assault on Fortress Europe. As either Bradley or Montgomery you  match wits with Rommel, The Desert Fox, and the best the Werhmacht has to offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning the battle of the beaches is just the first step. Whoever gains the upper hand in this fight  will set the stage for the next sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The British mission is straight forward, capture the city of Caen, a strategic center surrounded by flat rolling fields; perfect tank country for their burgeoning armored might. But the Germans wrote the book on armored warfare. With some of the best SS Panzer divisions moving into Normandy the Germans will have the Panthers and Tigers necessary to crush the Tommies and drive them back into the Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American objective is the farming town of St. Lo, but to reach it they must overcome a different set of nightmares. Miles of the harshest defensive terrain in Europe stands before the GI's. Bocage, hellish constructs of impenetrable earth and rock provide the perfect cover for Panzer Grenadiers lying in ambush.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tide of battle will surge and ebb but only one side can claim victory in Normandy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
