							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Out of ConTXT</name>
									
			<description>Much like games like CAH and Apples to Apples, each round starts with a suggestion card. But in Out of ConTXT players will find their answers within their phones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the category the answers might be found in their texts, photos, or song playlist. For example a &amp;quot;Text Search&amp;quot; category might have &amp;quot;Something you never want to hear from your Grandma.&amp;quot;. Players would then go through their text messages to find an answer they think fits (in a funny way). Once everyone has chosen their answer, they are read out loud and the group decides on a winner. That person gets the card and a new round starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An example of a photo usage would be the &amp;quot;Photo Bomb&amp;quot; category where you might get the suggestion of &amp;quot;Bad Action Movie Poster&amp;quot;. Here you find a photo that fits. &amp;quot;Soundtrack of your Life&amp;quot; has you pick out song that fit a suggestion like, &amp;quot;Not the song you want to hear at in the operating room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played with any number of people and since each person has their own (very personal) deck, and that deck changes every day, you'll never have to hear the same &amp;quot;card&amp;quot; over and over again. A great way to get conversations going at a party. Especially since everyone is looking at their phones anyway!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
