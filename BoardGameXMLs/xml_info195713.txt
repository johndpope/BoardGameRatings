							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Poly Bridge</name>
									
			<description>A fresh take on the traditional bridge-building genre of physics-based videogames, Poly Bridge aims to deliver a fun and challenging experience to its players, being grounded in a strong foundation of the bridge-builder while also pushing the genre in new directions, adding elements of playfulness and community that have come to characterize the title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unleash your engineering creativity with an engaging and fresh bridge-building simulator with all the bells &amp;amp; whistles and a strong community focus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Accurate Physics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lots of effort was put in the physics part of the game and the result is an accurate and consistent simulation, which also gives players access to loads of different building blocks, including hydraulic pistons to create shape-changing and moving bridges, suspension bridges, cable, steel, iron, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    60+ Levels&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy hours of bridge-building fun with loads of levels to solve, ranging from simple light car bridges to multi-deck draw-bridges and jumps, just to name a few! Levels get increasingly challenging from the engineering aspect and restrictions are also imposed on the resources you can use to build your bridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Sandbox&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What would an awesome bridge-builder game be without an equally awesome Sandbox? Go wild and create the most complex bridge the world has ever seen, and if you're feeling like it publish your design to the Steam Workshop as a puzzle level for everyone to try and solve!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Download More Levels&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every user submitted level will be available for download free of charge of course, while also allowing the community to interact with each other, challenge friends and send replays. We'll also be featuring the most original and fun bridge designs that players submit, making it easier for you to find the ones that are worth the challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
