			<description>Kavelspel is a four player game. Each player has 9 tiles of the same colour. At the beginning of the game the tiles are placed on squares of corresponding colour: f.i. blue tiles on blue squares. Each group of 9 squares (in the corners) is rimmed by a line in one of the four colours, blue, green, red or yellow.&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to move the tiles to the corner rimmed by the colour corresponding with the colour of the players tiles.&lt;br/&gt;In each move the players may move one of their tiles a number of squares (1 or more) in a horizontal or vertical direction.&lt;br/&gt;From the moment a player has reached the target square with one of his tiles, he is allowed to remove one of the tiles of the opponents from his target area, thus making room for his own tiles.&lt;br/&gt;When a target area is filled with eight of the required tiles of the same colour, there is one square unoccupied. The only one that may fill that square at this stage of the game is the player that needs to complete the number of nine tiles in the target area. That would be his final move. However he is only allowed to move that final piece one square per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
