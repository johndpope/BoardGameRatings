			<description>Early in the morning, two men in black suits came to the precinct. They promptly asked, &amp;quot;Where is Victor&amp;rsquo;'s office?&amp;quot; After receiving information, they came to the door and entered without even knocking. After an hour, they quietly left the office and precinct. From this moment I knew that this is some serious business. At the meeting in the board room, everything became clear. These sad gentlemen gave Commissioner information about the warehouse, which is being used as a dead drop location for gang of smugglers. The warehouse is full of crates, so each detective has been tasked to check packets with different cargo. The time is running out &amp;mdash; get out and catch the smugglers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commissioner Victor: Case of Elusive Smugglers is a logic game for 2-4 players who try to group crates with the same cargo, ultimately stopping the shipment of illicit goods. Players take turns in clockwise order. During their turn, a player chooses one of visible move tiles, then they resolve this tile so at least one of their crates move. Move tiles come in two types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Direction tile: The player moves the entire row (left/right tiles) or column (up/down tiles) in the direction shown on the tile. The structures &amp;quot;wrap around&amp;quot;, so moving down places the crates on the bottom row at the top.&lt;br/&gt;     Rotation tiles: The player rotates four tiles in the direction shown on the tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who groups their crates first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
