			<description>User Summary w/ Quoted Material&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Over a thousand years ago a man defeated the gods and ended their bloody rule of Raska. Since the gods fled, an unknown peace has settled over the continent where summers last years and winters last Lifetimes. But like the summers that seem to last forever only to give way to a cruel sudden winter, war looms on the horizon of the land that has enjoyed peace. In the South, three children children plot to ascend to the throne of Adzar and take the place of their dead father. To the west in the People's Republic of Ralar, the military rulers turn their eyes towards their neighbors and bide their time. In the Demon Forest, separating Shou-Ken from the rest of the land, orcs gather in unparalleled numbers. Treasure hunters swarm into the Great Unexplored, a region of ancient ruins and buried technology. In the Bumpart jungle, where even the gods dared not step, something that has slept since before the god's rule stirs. From outside the the land come dire warnings, hordes of barbarians invading from the south and rumors of the gods living in exile waiting for a time to strike. And in the middle of the land lies Atlas, protected from the other kingdoms by weapons from before the time of the gods and preparing for the on-coming winter. A continent of possibilities. A land where ancient machines clash with new magic. A land of winged sky runners and cunning cat-men. A land of sorcery, intrigue and the blade. A land ruled by those who dare to master them. All this awaits in Fantastic Lands, a fresh fantasy come to life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This core book for the Fantastic Lands RPG contains everything needed for a fantasy campaign.
