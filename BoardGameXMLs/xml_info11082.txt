			<description>Here is a description of the game from Spielbox:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game tries to simulate the development of farms and canals, irrigation and agriculture in the realm of the Sultanate of Oman. The game demands foresight from the players, as well as a balanced approach to land and water. The farmer family which, after the set number of game rounds have ended, has most successfully worked their land is the winner. The clever mechanic that determines how much water each family gets is the same as the actual rules about irrigation in use today. Before the winner is determined, players have to overcome sand storms, landslides and locust plagues. The game will appear in cardboard form around the middle of 2004. A wooden version, limited and numbered, with glass and semiprecious stone components, will also be made available for the discriminating gamer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
