			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game select a race, then distribute a point pool into Attributes (Mind, Tech, Body, and Spirit).  A variety of derived values are calculated.  Skills are then selected and a separate point pool is distributed into them.  Skills are tied back to an Attribute for performance bonuses.  Character creation ends with selecting personal equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game generally try to prevent other people (victims) from being possessed by spirit powers.  Possessed people can assume the forms of sex-morphing monsters and then engage in indiscriminate rape of others.  The game features heavy &amp;quot;erotic&amp;quot; (e.g., rape) themes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This strange game is distributed as a ZIP archive containing a variety of ASCII text files, organized somewhat topically.  Accessing the entire game is difficult and requires using several files simultaneously (organization is poor).  Written in Japanese, an English translation also exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
