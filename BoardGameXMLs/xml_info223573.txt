			<description>The Galaxy is a nice, but dangerous place. Just recently you couldn&amp;rsquo;t make a step without running into those fanatic superheroes. As soon as you launch a tiny secret project, hordes of fighters in party-colored tights come out from nowhere and dismantle it into small screws. How unfair!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now everything is different. Former &amp;lsquo;guardians of the mankind&amp;rsquo; have quarreled into pieces, squabbled, and perished into thin air. Good riddance! The horizon is clear, so my time has come! The time of a genius, merciless, and, of course, unbelievably vile Supervillain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actually, at that point &amp;ndash; just a Villain yet. Because there are stupid, spineless, and cowardly other Villains who also seek world domination. It&amp;rsquo;s time to put an end to this. This morning I have finally realized that. This Galaxy shall be mine!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supervillain. This Galaxy Is Mine! is an intense card strategy of galactic domination inspired by all sci-fi worlds put together and fueled with frenzied humor. Each player becomes a Villain. You have to overcome other Villains and conquer the Galaxy! To achieve this, you use two universal card decks. Each card may be used in multiple ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first deck is the Domination deck. You may launch a Domination card as an Asteroid to another Villain. The Asteroid would disrupt his/her plans and possibly kill his/her Minions. Next, if you charge your Asteroid (using Minion Ops), it can blow up just everything!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or you may take a Domination card as a Project to build. Any Project has a minor ability. Upon completion, the Project transforms into a Secret Facility and its major ability comes into effect, providing you with new tactical opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second deck is the Minion deck. You command millions of millions of loyal Minions. They are not too smart &amp;mdash; but devoted and diligent! You can use a Minion card in two ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, you may put a Minion card on your Project as a Minion Mob to build it. Or you can discard it as Minion Ops to perform a special operation. For instance, you may shoot down or charge an Asteroid, destroy a Mob or a Project, increase the building capabilities of your Mobs, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secret Facilities bring you Domination points. A Villain who has acquired 5 Domination points immediately becomes the Supervillain and is proclaimed the Emperor of the Galaxy. And wins the game as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card in the game is unique and may be used in multiple ways, thus, allowing for infinite combinations. Supervillain. This Galaxy Is Mine! combines a deep strategic gameplay with a humorous theme. The game is suitable for 2 to 4 Villains (up to 6 with two copies of the game). May be played in teams as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
