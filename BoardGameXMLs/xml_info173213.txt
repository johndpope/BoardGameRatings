			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Forest Argent game set in a strange world; it is not a world in and of itself, more a strange series of shifting paths and glades that open sometimes to connect to true worlds rather than the Forest Argent's strange &amp;quot;between place&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;Worlds with strange peoples, not always human, some have magic, some have strange deviations from science leaving them with high jackets and muskets but alchemy nearly miraculous in its many uses.&lt;br/&gt;The game allows you to play one of these people, to explore strange lands and take part in the politics and conflicts of those worlds.&lt;br/&gt;The game is largely designed to be one where people are specialists and working as a team for mutual survival despite conflicting social mores or long-term goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are in the business of running a game all about exploration, about people going to new worlds and having to deal with things well beyond their ken.&lt;br/&gt;We have tried to write the rules so that though there is movement characters can choose how quickly they progress and what career paths they wish to take.&lt;br/&gt;It also allows (in fact we strongly promote) characters to make their own equipment, explore new avenues of investigation and invention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Referees are always the final arbitrators of the rules but we always welcome feedback, which we will either take on board or give an explanation as to why not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most important part of this is to Have Fun; if it isn't then you need to let us know and we will do our best to accommodate you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
