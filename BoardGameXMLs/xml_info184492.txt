			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;d6 RPG presents the core rules for the d6 game engine.  Characters start with a personality, a history, and a purpose, all defined by the player.  Characters also have eight statistics, or &amp;quot;Stats&amp;quot;, namely:  Agility, Knowledge, Perception, Body, Size, Health, Mind, Initiative, and Movement.  These Stats are assigned one of three types--affective attributes, that modify a die roll; reactive attributes, that fluctuate during play; and fixed attributes, that are used alone.  Die rolls usually are modified by an affective attribute and the result will modify a reactive attribute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All attributes are generated using a random process.  Affective attributes (Agility, Knowledge, Perception, and Body) range from -6 to 9.  Reactive attributes (Health and Mind) range from 17-21.  Movement ranges from 1-9.  Initiative ranges from -3 to 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core mechanic involves rolling 2d6, adding the relavent Affective attribute, and comparing the result to a Success Level, meeting or exceeding the level indicates success.  Combat takes place in rounds, uses initiative, and allows characters to move and attack.  Attacking is difficult (missing is frequent) and can result in fumbles or critical hits.  Armor absorbs damage after a hit.  Damage is applied to the appropriate Reactive attribute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules conclude with basic GM hints and processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
