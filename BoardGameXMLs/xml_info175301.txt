			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your people long since learned that the world is cruel and harsh. Every day of your life, you have seen this reflected in their behaviour, a breed of cruelty that - in a fair light - is sometimes the greatest fairness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the regions your people claim as their own, all are equal: survivors, scroungers, grasping for whatever advantage to survive the seasons. And among them arise the thrivers, the innovators, the self-reliant, the tough and the clever, the strong and the cunning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't subscribe to the false modesty that comfort allows others. You have grasped your destiny from a world that tried to keep you down and glory in your power. The fires of industry and the sweat of your brow has taken you far.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So shout at the sky! Dare it to strike you down! Nothing can stop you, for you are an Orc!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Orc is a new class for use with Dungeon World, perfect for players who like their Dungeon World with an old-school feel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
