							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Partisan Passenger Version</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a full-color, 48 inch by 30 inch, floor plan of a Passenger Spaceship, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Zip File includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Here is the drop point. Remember that the pirates hit us and we were forced to split from the passenger side to escape.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Captain of The Partisan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Partisan (Passenger Version) is a single floor interior map of a spaceship that can split in half to function as two separate vessels with a northern crew side and a southern passenger side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Partisan (Passenger Version) is intended for use in near or far-future science fiction settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tithe of the Tenth Cargo: The Partisan makes frequent dangerous journeys through a quadrant riddled with pirates. They have a tremendous success rate, bordering on 84% including their initial failure rate in their first year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the first year, The Partisan made a deal with pirates in the quadrant, The Red Drudge, known for scavenging the scrap of starships stained with blood when their targets failed to surrender. The Partisan would get protection to and from destinations in the quadrant, but every tenth passenger cargo would be given to the pirates without a fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Law enforcement is spread thin throughout the quadrant. However, information from an escaped slave that survived the last tithe has surfaced. The testimony points to The Partisan being in league with the pirates in some way. The group is sent to tail The Partisan and check to see if the story of the witness is true either as a mercenary contract mission or as part of the organization patrolling that lawless frontier of space called The Constabulary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the group witnesses the drop, they have to decide how to react with pirate ships moving to grab the passenger side of The Partisan and the crew side of The Partisan slipping away from the drop point. Which side of The Partisan does the group go after?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
