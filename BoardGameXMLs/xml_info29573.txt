			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The bees have left the Honey Tree and are busy at work. Winnie-the-Pooh has climbed up the Tree and is filling himself with the honey that the busy bees have stored in their hive. His friends must save him by rushing to the Honey Tree to help him down before the bees return.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move along a modular cardboard path which is assembled prior to gameplay, towards a plastic three dimensional tree where Winnie The Pooh is stuck up a ladder. The path consists of colored squares; these colors correspond to cards which are drawn from a stack to determine the movement of each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player reaches the tree they must drop a marble down a hole located in the top of the plastic structure; this may or may nor trigger the mechanism which causes Winnie to slide down the ladder, ending the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
