							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Coastal Patrol</name>
									
			<description>Found in Too Fat Lardie's Summer 2011 Special magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a set of rules that attempts to simulate the actions fought by coastal patrol craft from the English Channel to the Pacific Ocean. Most of the actions involved small craft armed with automatic weapons and torpedoes attacking other patrolling coastal forces as well as supply convoys and small war ships. Most of the actions took place under the cover of darkness since stealth and surprise were vital to the survival of these small craft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a game for large capital ships or huge fleets. The game is designed to allow each player to assume the command of a handful of small boats in order to refight the type of actions that were typical of the coastal action fought throughout the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ideally these rules are used with 1/600th or 1/1200th scale models. Any Naval game will come with a whole host of data for the ships and vessels involved, and this set is no different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To keep this piece to a manageable size the publisher has deposited all such data in the Files section of the TooFatLardies Yahoo Group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
