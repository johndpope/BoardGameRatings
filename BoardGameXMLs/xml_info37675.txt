			<description>Fitzelfood is game that teaches children to match good foods with good exercise, and at the same time teaches about common foods from Germany, Sweden, France, and Italy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to be the first to collect the nine peices of the puzzle for the country you represent (one of the four above). In order to get the pieces, you must be able to react quickly to find matches of good foods with good exercises. There are two decks of cards, and during the &amp;quot;Squeaker Round&amp;quot; one card from each is placed face up. If the two cards are a match, meaning both good for their respective decks, the first player to hit the Squeaker gets to see if they guessed correctly. The cards are placed next to each other, and depending on how the gray bands on the cards match, the cards are either both good, one is good and one is bad, or both are bad. If both are good, the player gets to draw two puzzle pieces from a bag. Other actions let players exchange pieces, and the first to collect all none of their pieces wins. Through the game, children learn about which foods are healthy and which are not, and which activities lead to a healthy lifestyle versus those that don't.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
