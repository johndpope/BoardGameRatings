			<description>&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Galactic Pinball is a video game for the Virtual Boy. It was a basic pinball game featuring several different boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galactic Pinball features four boards, each with distinguishing elements and targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colony: One of the distinguishing features of the Colony board is a mini-game where the user shoots down various meteors from a three dimensional perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UFO: In UFO, the board initially starts with a large UFO at the top of the board, which will fly away to reveal triggers that open two holes. Knocking the ball into these holes accesses such bonuses as center posts and kickbacks. If the player gets the Jackpot after 100,000,000 points the game will lock-up with the music still playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alien: In Alien, after getting the ball into the Alien's Lair, the alien will appear, and can be hit to gain points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cosmic: Cosmic is a classic pinball board that has a third flipper and a ramp that accesses a special area with several bumpers. It also has a rotating sphere that the player can enter for bonus points. Samus Aran, protagonist of Nintendo's Metroid series, makes a cameo.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Galactic_Pinball,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
