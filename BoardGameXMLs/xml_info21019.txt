			<description>A smart DVD trivia game for music fans.  Very creative ways of presenting the questions.  Great to play with a bunch of friends.  There's a game called Battle of the Bands which pits the two teams against each other head to head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the questions were new, nothing repeated unlike some other DVD games, and it was really easy to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
