			<description>&amp;quot;Sum Fun&amp;quot; uses 10 colored and number dice which are rolled and arranged in a particular manner according to the rules. Based on the roll the dice are arranged into runs, a series greater then 3 consecutive numbers(that is 3,4,5,6) or sets, all numbers which are the same(that is 4,4,4). One of the 10 dice is the KEY cube which is held seperate and effects scoring the roll, loss of a turn or taking an additional turn. Based on the arrangement of the numbered sets and runs and the color matching of the KEY cube scores are tallied. Play progresses around the table allowing each player equal opportunity. First to 250 wins. A variation to the primary rules allows for play to 1000 or as player decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
