							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nymphology: Blue Magic</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is truly the book we could never print. Ever. It is just too full of naughtiness and innuendo to appear on the shelves of your local retail store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As such, this instalment of the Encyclopaedia Arcane, Nymphology, is only available from RPGNow.com, where you must be old enough to possess a credit card in order to purchase it. If you are easily offended by humour of a sexual nature, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. It will offend. We promise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Grim Jim (Slayer's Guide to Rules Lawyers and Female Gamers), Nymphology is a humorous look at the most secret arcane talent of all - that of Blue Magic, or Sex Magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the yards, lavatories and dormitories of the various colleges of magic young students swap tales and cobbled together spells developed by other students of magic over the years. Some famous names in the field of magic have a history that is only told in notes passed in class and some of their early work is . . . enlightening to say the least, shedding light on their particular obsessions. Some drop out entirely to pursue this aspect of magic with complete devotion and clarity of purpose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Covered within are original uses for existing spells in the field of Nymphology (including a few surprises for grease and enlarge spells...), new erotic spells, travels to the Elemental Plane of Lust, prestige classes you will never see anywhere else (the Agony Mage, Mystic Pimp, Seduction Mage and, of course, the Peeping Scryer), magic items, creatures of lust and a whole range of special tricks you can try when mastering this mighty magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything contained within this tome has a practical use in all fantasy-based d20 System games. But then, Grim is known to play some pretty strange games...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
