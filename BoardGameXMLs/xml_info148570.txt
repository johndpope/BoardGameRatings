			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Okay, kittens, listen up. It&amp;rsquo;s time you know the score. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As usual, the humans have it all backwards. They think their reality is the be-all and end-all. They even believe that they are in charge. They can&amp;rsquo;t see the great storm of the multiverse surrounding their tiny, fragile bubble of a world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s a nice world. Cozy, with milk in it. And we like the people. They&amp;rsquo;re just so adorable, the way they pet us and open cans and try to understand. They have no idea what horrible threats exist outside this little pocket. They have no idea  what&amp;rsquo;s really going on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And we aim to keep it that way.&lt;br/&gt;CALL OF CATTHULHU&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WELCOME to the real world -- that is, the world in which human civilization was secretly made for the comfort of cats, in which dark Powers like Mutt&amp;rsquo;thra the Monster Dog, Hastpurr of Catcosa, and Great Catthulhu himself vie for control of reality, in which only brave and clever felines have the wit and wherewithal to oppose grim and mystic cabals, and in which two-footed people live in blissful ignorance of all of these facts. Misguided cults of humans and other animals propitiate the Powers of Chaos. They seek to end civilization, driving humanity into slavery and madness and interrupting the all-important schedule of feeding, petting, and changing the litter box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Call of Catthulhu, the players take the roles of a variety of ordinary-seeming cats fighting conspiracies of cosmic chaos. One or more participants play the part of heroic cats, and one person acts as the Cat Herder, arranging secret challenges and rewards and guiding the others through the process of making an adventure. Rules are light and emphasize player cleverness and quick wits. There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of darkness and chaos, but the feline heroes are up to the challenge... usually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Call of Catthulhu. Good hunting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
