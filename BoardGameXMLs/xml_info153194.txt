							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beluga Cup</name>
									
			<description>You are a beluga whale competing in the annual &amp;quot;Belugas are Best&amp;quot; exotic fish eating competition. Your goal as a competitor is to eat the most fish of the different varieties. At the end of the competition points will be awarded to whoever can regurgitate the most fish of each type. Down with Narwhals!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beluga Cup is a Decktet game inspired by Balloon Cup and game play is quite similar. Players are attempting to capture &amp;quot;fish&amp;quot; in each of 6 different colors (associated with Decktet suits). These cubes are placed into each of the 4 regions throughout the game and the player who has the highest sum of cards when a region is full will gain the chips. If you have bad cards do not fear! You may play them onto either side of a region thus undercutting your opponent's own play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game each different suit will be scored separately. The player who holds a majority in each will gain points equal to the number of cubes that their opponent has in that same suit. Thus the goal is to have the smallest majority possible in as many suits as possible in order to maximize the points gained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
