							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Nancy</name>
									
			<description>The Game of Nancy is a betting, trick taking, and partially co-operative card game played with a seventy-eight card tarot deck. The game is frequently played by people of the video game universe of Dishonored (published by Bethesda Softworks). The official rules are included with the Dishonored Tarot Deck which was included as a pre-order bonus of the video game in some regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is mostly co-operative in so much as it is a turn-based game in which players change teams from round to round based on which player bets they can win the most tricks with the card they have been dealt. The winner of the betting round, or the Taker, then plays against the other players to win as many elected tricks before the round's end. At the conclusion of a round, the Taker's ability to completed win the required tricks is scored and the inverse of the Taker's score is given to each of the remaining players. The player left of the previous round's Taker deals a new round and bidding begins once again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game of Nancy has no set winning end score and thus, duration is unknown. The rules state that a target score should be set, and agreed upon, prior to game commencement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
