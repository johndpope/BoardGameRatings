			<description>SLUGBUG! is a fast-paced, easy to learn family game for 2-4 players that mimics the classic road trip game.  Players take turns playing &amp;ldquo;driver&amp;rdquo; cards which determine how fast to go and how many potential slugbugs they see along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The driver cards will direct players to flip various cards off the Slugbug deck.  Players will keep an eye out for Volkswagen Beetles as the cards are flipped.  When they see one, they slap it and shout &amp;quot;SLUGBUG!&amp;quot; to collect the card.  If they identify wrongly they have to discard a slugbug card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the final destination card is played, the player with the most Slugbug cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
