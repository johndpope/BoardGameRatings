			<description>In Franz-Benno Delonge's White House, two players fight for the U.S. Presidency.  But being elected isn't as easy as it seems, as the other candidate will want to put a negative spin on your campaign at every turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of cards representing States or groups of States are set up from left-to-right on the table.  The final one, of course, is Florida.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player holds an identical set of action cards in their hand. These action cards are further divided by colour, indicating the type of action the player will attempt.  Possible actions range from complimenting your opponent all the way down to &amp;quot;dirty tricks&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a bluff/counter-bluff game. One card colour counteracts another colour, but is crushed by the third colour. Given that each player begins the game with the exact same cards, a battle of wits and nerves is sure to follow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the first preliminary visit to each state, the aspiring candidate must decide which States to pursue and which to leave for their opponent.  Sometimes it will prove to be good strategy to play a weaker card and save the real muscle for other States!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After two trips around the country, the electoral votes are counted.  Being American politics, only the slimmest of margins is necessary for victory in any given state. The candidate with the highest number of electoral college votes is the winner, and the next President of the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How will you play your cards?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
