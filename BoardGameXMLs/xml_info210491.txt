							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Hobo Handbook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drifters. Hobos. Vagabonds. They are the part of society that people try to ignore and with enough distraction, casually forget. In the world of Contagion this truth is exacerbated by ancient beings, supernatural races and creatures from Hell. Trash filled back alleys that are the embodiments of urban decay have become secret battlefields. Abandoned industrial parks and the chain link fences that once served as security are now arenas of death. The world is awash in horror and the vagabonds have been left with little more than driftwood amidst all the human wreckage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the Apocalypse looming, the one thing that the dregs and destitute have on most everyone else is the will to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is meant to help the drifter, hobo and vagabond. It will help in dealing with the streets as they are and what to do after the sun goes down. Also included are tips on basic homeless survival, over 10 New Feats for Character creation / Development, lists of equipment for the magic and mundane, New weapons and armor as well as a host of allies to turn when in need. Everything you need except a cup of coffee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
