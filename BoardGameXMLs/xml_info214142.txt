			<description>Warrior Kings: Battles is a real-time strategy computer game developed by Black Cactus and published by Empire Interactive in Europe and co published with Strategy First in North America. It is a sequel to the 2002 game Warrior Kings and was released March 21, 2003 in Europe and September 30, 2003 in North America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story is set 100 years after the first Warrior Kings where the Empire of Orbis has fragmented into states of feuding warlords. Like its predecessor, gameplay focuses on the RTS elements of resource and base management and unit combat but also the alignment system where all players start in similar positions and develop into their own unique faction of choice, the prime being under the strict religious knighthood of the Imperial, occultism and demon worship of the Pagan or the logic and scientific innovations of the Renaissance, all supporting both historical and fantasy based unit design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Large scale battle at base walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warrior Kings: Battle is a real-time strategy game meaning much of its gameplay is focused on gathering resources and training and management of units for combat against opposing players. There are three types of resources to harvest; food, materials and gold but are not available until they are dropped off at a village and then transported via cart to the main base or warehouse. The later two are gathered from the surrounding environments like forests and mines while food is grown and harvested from built farms with speed of growth depending on how fertile the land beneath it is.[2] A proportion of the food delivered by farmers is removed when they deliver to a village or drop off point representing your fighting units' consumption of food. The proportion removed is reliant on how many farms you have working compared to number of food consuming units. While villages and other resource-based buildings can be built anywhere other than within the base's walls, most military and economy based structures can only be built there, with each added building expanding the walls. There is also a mana bar present on some special units (this is notably absent from all renaissance units) with the ability to use magic. Additionally, some special structures such as the empire cathedral and pagan temple have mana bars that can be refilled through prayer or sacrifice of units depending on the alignment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are seven broad classes that units may be classified by, these are: Light (mostly ranged), Heavy (melee), Cavalry, Siege, reconnaissance (scouts), demonic, and special. Though some units might be classed as &amp;quot;demonic&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;special&amp;quot;, they all count as another type of unit as well. For example, a &amp;quot;gibbering hoard&amp;quot; is a daemon, but also counts as light infantry. All of these unit types are effective and vulnerable to the other classes such as demonic being weak to special and heavy cavalry being weak against heavy infantry head-on. These handicaps require use of terrain, unit formation, positioning, and modus of attack to be considered for units to overcome their inherent weakness'. Units are built at a base level but can be trained for better effectiveness both in battle through the use of attack dummies. Unlike most real time strategy games ranged units have a set amount of ammunition at their disposal that must be replenished by supply carts or certain buildings lest their rate of fire suffer. There are also naval units like attack ships and trade cogs built at a port by water yet can only be built and used in multiplayer games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with the Campaign Mode, there are two modes for online multiplayer and offline single player. The first a basic Skirmish Mode where players fight in a standard game with set number of players and a chosen map and generals along with minor gameplay settings. The other is Valhalla Mode where instead of constructing bases and training armies, players pre-select a full army without any economic aspect of play with the goal being to captured strategic flags scattered throughout each map, requiring players to capture these to earn points with the highest point earner as the victor when the set amount of time finishes. Flags can be captured and recaptured multiple times along with respawning units as an option&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrior_Kings%3A_Battles Warrior Kings: Battles]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
