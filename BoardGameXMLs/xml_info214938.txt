			<description>ListMania is a version of a familiar parlor game in which players take turns adding to a list of items in alphabetical order.  It can be played cooperatively or competitively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General game play is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;Pick the top card from the deck, read the category, and start listing! Cards will be one of three types - list in alphabetical order starting with a specific letter, pick a partner and try to name as many as the card requests, or list as many as you can by yourself in a limited amount of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no winning or losing in the cooperative game. In the competitive game, if someone fails to answer correctly or think of a response, the last player who did answer correctly keeps the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever has the most cards at the end of the game wins, however, the rules don't actually say when the game ends so players should decide that among themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
