			<description>This game, which translates as &amp;quot;Who Does it How?&amp;quot;, is the very evil twin to the Zoch game Who Lives Where. Like its child-game brother, this game includes very nicely carved small houses with animals laser cut from their bases. The trick in this game, however, is that instead of friendly crocodiles, pigs, and others trying to find the right home, this game is all about pigs in a variety of &amp;quot;romantic&amp;quot; positions. Some will make you blush, others are down-right X-rated. The Zoch team at Essen chuckle at this game and say that is a favorite gift for wedding showers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
