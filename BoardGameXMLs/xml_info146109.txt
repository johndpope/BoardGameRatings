			<description>In the Galaxy far, far away&amp;hellip; Join Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Padm&amp;eacute; Amidala on the planet Geonosis, where they have to fight against ferocious monsters on the arena. Will they survive until remaining jedi knights arrive? Will Count Dooku be victorius this time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to defeat your opponents until the droids enter the arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;Players decide which side of force thay want to play.&lt;br/&gt;They Choose their pawns and appropriate decks of cards. Both sides have 3 characters that can be freely distributed according to the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;One player can play multiple characters, but they can not fight against each other. &lt;br/&gt;The dark side of the Force begins. &lt;br/&gt;Each player in his turn has the right to perform an action with only one character.&lt;br/&gt;In player&amp;rsquo;s turn, players can perform two actions: movement and attack. They can also use a special action.&lt;br/&gt;Every turn players draw two cards from the character deck and select one to be used.&lt;br/&gt;The movement and attack points are indicated on the cards along with special actions.&lt;br/&gt;Special actions allow to fortify attack, heal or move away. &lt;br/&gt;Damage is marked on special lenticular indicators.&lt;br/&gt;Whoever elimates the other side of the force wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
