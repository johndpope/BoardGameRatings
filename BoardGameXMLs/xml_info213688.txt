							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crystal Temple</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 48 x 30 inch, full color battlemap of a Fantasy Temple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions, the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT) .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes my Crystalytes! The heat of the volcano is being channeled into the crystal! Soon we will have enough energy to perform the ritual.&amp;mdash;Crystal Cult Leader&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crystal Temple includes the exterior dirt path with rock outcroppings and sparse vegetation that leads to the temple entrance and the interior of the crystal temple which features a long hallway of pillars that leads to a large crystal on a dais and benches in side areas to the north and south to view the crystal dais during worship and rituals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crystal Temple is intended for use in fantasy or horror games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cult of Crystalytes: A cult has formed around the worship of a crystal. The cult leader calls his flock crystal acolytes or Crystalytes and urges them to bring more and more people to worship the crystal. With enough people, he promises they will witness a miracle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the cult grows, more and more local youth come up missing. Their parents search for adventurers to find their lost sons and daughters, pooling their resources together as payment for the return of their children. The adventurers can figure out the location of the crystal temple in many ways. They could witness a kidnapping and follow them to the temple, track the spoors of the kidnappers and those taken, pose as local villagers to provoke a kidnapping to become kidnapped to arrive at the crystal temple, defeat Crystalyte kidnappers, interrogate them on the crystal&amp;rsquo;s location and steal their robes to infiltrate the cult, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once they get to the crystal temple, they find the Crystalytes both sitting on benches and standing watching their cult leader on a dais. He seems to be drawing heat through strange mirrors behind the dais that are being collected by the crystal on the dais. As the crystal nears full, the long dormant volcano begins to erupt. The windows and mirrors behind the dais shatter and then lava starts flowing into the crystal temple! The adventurers need to save as many Crystalytes as they can to get back to their families or they may choose to slay the cult leader. The slow lava flowing into the room seems to be drawn towards the crystal before the crystal is engulfed. Once engulfed, the lava gushes out suddenly and starts spreading throughout the temple while flowing much faster than before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
