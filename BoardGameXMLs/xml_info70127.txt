			<description>&amp;quot;Chocobo's Dungeon 2, originally released in Japan as Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon 2​ (チョコボの不思議なダンジョン2, Chokobo no Fushigina Danjon 2, lit. &amp;quot;Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon 2&amp;quot;) is the 1998 PlayStation sequel to 1997's Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon. Unlike its predecessor, the game, titled Chocobo's Dungeon 2, was released in North America in late 1999. In Chocobo's Dungeon 2, the player controls a chocobo named Chocobo. The game is part of the Fushigi no Dungeon series. The game was planned to be released for Bandai's WonderSwan Color handheld in 1999, but it was apparently cancelled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, the mazes for the dungeons are randomly-generated, though certain portions have specific patterns, such as the mazes and rooms in Cid's tower. This means that each time the player enters the same dungeon, the path through the maze will be different, although the same items and monsters will be encountered. If played slowly, there are some small gaps near the edges of these mazes and in certain corners if approached correctly Chocobo can pass through them and skip to a later part of the level.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Chocobo_(series),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
