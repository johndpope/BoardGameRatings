			<description>A Sexual Game of Who done it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an adult, how often do you actually have to piece together the details of a murder? In this revamped version of the classic game Clue, instead of solving a mysterious murder, players must piece together the details of the previous night's drunken activities. Did you screw Miss Scarlett with a condom on in the utility closet? Perhaps, after he called you a failure, you hit Professor Plum with a desk lamp in the library. Maybe you pleasured Miss Peacock with your finger in her ass. Have fun with your friends trying to sort out the twisted details because, chances are, you'll really have to solve these kinds of mysteries soon, you big party animal, you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
