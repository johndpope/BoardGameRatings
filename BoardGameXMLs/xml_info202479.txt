			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rhode is a drawless connection game for two players: Black and White. It's played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square board. The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Definitions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A weak pair is a set of two like-colored, diagonally adjacent stones such that there is no like-colored stone orthogonally adjacent to both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A crosscut is a 2x2 set of stones consisting of two diagonally adjacent black stones and two diagonally adjacent white stones. A stone can be part of several crosscuts at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black plays first, then turns alternate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start your turn, if there are any friendly weak pairs on the board, you must place a stone of your color on an empty point that is orthogonally adjacent to the two stones in one of those pairs. If there are no such pairs, you must place a stone of your color on any empty point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a placement, all friendly stones, except the one just placed, that are part of any crosscuts are removed from the board, after which the turn ends. There will be no crosscuts remaining on the board at this point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won by the player who completes a chain of orthogonally adjacent stones of their color touching the two opposite board edges of their color. Draws are not possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pie rule&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means that White will have the option, on their first turn only, to change sides instead of making a regular move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
