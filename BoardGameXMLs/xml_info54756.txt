			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains all the rules needed to play Chivalry &amp;amp; Sorcery(TM) 3rd Edition.  Here are just a few samples of what Chivalry &amp;amp; Sorcery 3rd Edition has to offer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A character creation system for both point based and randomly generated characters, or a mixture of the two, in about half-an-hour.  Optional rules allow for special abilities, flaws, determining your character's Astrological sign and much more.&lt;br/&gt;     16 Character Vocations.&lt;br/&gt;     Our new Skillscape(TM) system, which allows any character to develop just about any skill.&lt;br/&gt;     250+ Skills.&lt;br/&gt;     Our new Crit Die(TM) system, which allows for quick and realistic results.  All that's needed are three 10-sided dice!&lt;br/&gt;     Seven Mage vocations, a ton of spells, rules for creating magical devices, over 175 magical materials, and rules governing the creation of a Mage's focus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Again these are just a few samples of what Chivalry &amp;amp; Sorcery 3rd Edition has to offer.  The rules are simple to use, yet realistic, and can be learned in about an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For ages 14 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
