							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Phaze Spiders from the 5th Dimension</name>
									
			<description>(User Summary compiled from back cover and introduction):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement introduces a new team of gladiators: the Spiders. Phaze Spiders bring a new dimension (pun intended!) to the Injurius Games universe. They employ an intense and flexible battle plan, using ranged and melee attacks equally well. Squads of five Spiders take the field against all comers: Humans, Mecks, Orx, and even their own kind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You control a &amp;quot;clutch&amp;quot; of up to six different types of Spiders. Before each match, you choose which ones will participate, either all the same, all different, or any combination thereof. Each clutch is led by the big &amp;quot;Tlisky,&amp;quot; a formidable fighter, born to command. The other Spiders, called Vorpeeds, participate as needed: Venters are the rank-and-file Spiders, able to spit highly-corrosive acid at a distance; Shockers generate massive electric currents that can take you out with one hit; Bullnoses are the party-crashers, melee specialists that can also make short-ranged plasma attacks; Jammers have evolved a very advanced ranged weapon that ignores most forms of armor; The &amp;quot;Tlisk&amp;quot; is a failed Tlisky, unable to lead and not as tough, but faster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spiders are not under any form of Corporate control. They enter the arena looking for two things: freedom, and puppets to control. Freedom they can't have, but puppets - the arena supplies five per enemy team....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spider player's goal is the same as with any race: to bring their Clutch up to 50 Battle Honors and win the tournament. Spiders have their own upgrade table, critical hit chart, and Power-Ups, and may spend their Battle Honors to purchase upgrades like any other gladiator team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need a copy of Injurius Games to play Phaze Spiders from the 5th Dimension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
