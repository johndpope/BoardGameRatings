			<description>While the vipers lay in the shade and wait for their prey, the lions roam and hunt for theirs. Generalfeldmarschall Rommel himself started calling the tank-hunter Grenadiers of the Neue Deutsches Afrikakorps the 'African Lions'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the history of the Axis presence in Northern Africa, these men have fought isolated, without any support from tanks, walkers or artillery, more often than any other Axis unit. With only an automatic weapon and a trusty Panzerfaust, they have repeatedly defended desperate positions against all the might of the Allied army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More men coming from the &amp;lsquo;African Lions&amp;rsquo; have been awarded the Iron Cross (often posthumously) than from any other formation in the Afrikakorps. Brave and fierce, they surely deserve their nickname.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many &amp;ldquo;African Lions&amp;rdquo; are veterans of the first Deutsches Afrikakorps. They have already been through the worst this war can offer, and many have chosen to join these specialist tank-hunters squads, were you need nerves of steel. Attacking an armoured vehicle at close range is not for the faint of heart, and veterans are more comfortable alongside others equally prepared to tackle the job, leaving younger recruits in the Grenadier Battle Squads, providing covering fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
