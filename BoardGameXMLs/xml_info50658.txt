			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good day, ladies and gentlemen. You are, I think, the - ahem - 'All American Heroes'? Jolly Good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Now, You've all had to come over to Britain for some reason. Chasing someone? A puzzle? You needed a holiday? Well, whatever the reason, we're sure you'll like it here. However, there are a few things you'll need to know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The fact is, we do things a bit differently here. We drive on the left, so do be careful with that car of yours. And our police aren't usually armed. In fact, guns are a bit of a rarity. Perhaps we can make some arrangements for your equipment, but don't expect us to appreciate it if you go waving your bally artillery around in public!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Not that we don't have problems of our own; you can expect some supervillains, of course, especially M.A.C.E. We have heroes, too, such as the New Knights of the Round Table - Her Majesty's Government needed something - and freelancers, of course. What you'd expect, really, given that we had King Arthur and Robin Hood centuries before Columbus was playing with toy boats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, maybe you should read a bit before you rush in. Fortunately, we have just what you need... It's time to leave the New York skyscrapers, the Mojave Desert, even the depths of space, and come to a country where the traditions go back centuries and you'll think you speak the language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is Modern Britain, the... Kingdom of Champions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by native Britons, edited by Americans, this supplement contains all that a GM needs to start running adventures in the United Kingdom!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
