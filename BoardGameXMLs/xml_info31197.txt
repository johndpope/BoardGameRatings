			<description>Players start with $1,000,000 to buy Condominiums at exorbitant prices.  Players attempt to buy the properties offering the highest return on their investment, and to own an entire block in order to double their rental income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may gamble at the racetrack.  They receive money each time they pass the employment office.  They pay a fine or collect a bonus each time they pass the management office or the boardroom.  They hit the jackpot when they land in the Country Club.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game involves luck and management of finances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in Scarborough, Ontario, Canada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also available in French.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
