			<description>Party/trivia game themed on the comedy show &amp;quot;RTL Samstag Nacht&amp;quot;, which ran from 1993-1998 on German TV network RTL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;- 1 oval-shaped game board&lt;br/&gt;- 7 tokens&lt;br/&gt;- 1 die&lt;br/&gt;- 110 cards (30 question cards, 30 dialogue cards, 30 action cards, 20 advertisement cards)&lt;br/&gt;- chips with points printed on the back&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game &amp;amp; gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;Collecting the most points by earning chips. Chips are earned by landing on an advertisement space and drawing an advertisement card that lets you earn a chip. The other cards contain questions (question cards), tasks that have to be done with a partner (dialogue cards), and tasks that have to be done alone (action cards). On the back, the cards contain instructions for moving the pawns. Movement of the pawns via these instructions, the roll of a colour die and the result of moving a spinner decides which cards are used. Only advertisement cards earn you points.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all advertisement chips have been distributed and the player with the highest point value wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Warning: On German review site &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/keirat/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/keirat/&lt;/a&gt; this game has been called the &amp;quot;worst game I know at present&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;unplayable by the instructions included&amp;quot;.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
