			<description>From back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure in the world of Greyhawk!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powerful forces are set in motion as your party searches for the legendary Blades of Corusk. Take them on the perilous journey from Rookroost to the Lair of the Shadow Dragon in the frozen northlands. Will they survive the ramifications of events that they initiated? Those who hold the magical blades will not easily give them up. Plucking them from the grasp of a jealous dragon or stealing them from the center of the subterranean City of the Orc Horde will strain your adventures to their limits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to be played alone or with the adventure WGS2, A Howl from the North, Five Shall Be One is suitable for four to eight players who are 7th to 10th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the five Blades of Corusk are united, the great northern god will lead the barbarians to the South.  When unwitting characters locate the most elusive blade, their greed drives them into the plot, where they meet a wizard who has another blade.  Together they quest for the remaining blades in the cold northern nations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
