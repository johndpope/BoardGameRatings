							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Player&#039;s Guide (4th Edition)</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 4th Edition Player's Guide was very similar to the 3rd Edition Player's Guide, varying only in minor updates and the addition of the Rogue Class.  The 4th Edition of the game included the revised Player's Guide, the newly-released Planetary Engineer's Guide, and a Character Generator for MS Windows (EXE).  Otherwise, the 4th Edition utilized existing 3rd Edition products without modification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book was released in RTF and DOC format; both are identical except in very minor formatting.  The DOC version was released as a self-extracting archive (EXE).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
