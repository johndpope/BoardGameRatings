			<description>Game description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A solitaire dungeon crawling and deck-building game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your land is under attack by monsters, lead by the Dark Lord and his four Knights. They hide in the shadows of the Cursed Fortress, not so far from your village. Several attempts have been made to stop this&lt;br/&gt;evil, but none of the brave adventurers ever returned...&lt;br/&gt;It is now your turn to attempt the impossible. Go forth and slay the Dark Lord!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a standard deck of 52 cards + 1 Joker to represent the dungeon, friends and foes, hero and actions. As you explore the dungeon, you defeat mosters and collect loot which improves your action deck, until you are ready to fight the Dark Lord and return victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
