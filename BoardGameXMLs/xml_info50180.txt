							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Accursed Tower</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;For four to eight characters of levels 1-3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Icewind Dale, Ten-Towns, Regis the lovable halfling scoundrel, and Drizzt Do'Urden, drow ranger. These names are legendary in the annals of the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting, made famous in the best-selling novels by author R.A. Salvatore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, Salvatore and his original gaming group, the Seven Swords, return to the Savage Frontier in this exciting 32-page adventure. The PCs begin in the port city of Luskan, where they're hired on by a caravaning merchant to perform guard duty for the long, dangerous journey over the Spine of the World Mountains. If the heroes do well, they reach the small town of Targos, where they hear rumors of a dead mage's lost tower out on the tundra. In order to find it, the PCs must overcome numerous obstacles but may find allies in the peoples of the Ten-Towns region, including a barbarian prince, a sly halflig, and a unique ranger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not all is as it seems, though, nor can all smiling faces be trusted. Can the PCs seperate the truth from the lies, locate the Accursed Tower, determine all its secrets, and survive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This low-level, stand-alone adventure fits into any existing FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign. It's also easily adapted to any other AD&amp;amp;D game campaign world.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
