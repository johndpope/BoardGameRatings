			<description>Publisher Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Banko is a game similar to Blackjack in principal; however, the game is not conducted in a simple &amp;quot;win/loss&amp;quot; manner. The maximum point is eleven, and the winner wins according to the point difference between the two players. Thus, the game is not over when one player &amp;quot;busts&amp;quot;. It is for the other player to maximize his gains by increasing his count toward 11, without going over. Suitable for Level I or II 4K systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In-Game Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is similar to Black Jack. You draw numbers stopping before the total point value exceeds 11. If you go over 11, then your hand will be zero'd. If you draw 5 times without going over 11, then you'll receive bonus points equal to the value of your hand at the time you end your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The score starts at 30 points. If it goes to 60, you win. Below zero, you lose. At the end of each turn, the point difference between the two hands will be added or subtracted from the score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formerly called Double or Nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
