							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beat the Buzzer: Olympic Basketball</name>
									
			<description>This is a statistical replay game, ideal for solitaire players, featuring all the Olympic basketball tournaments, both men and women, from 1952 onward. A conspicous amount of sheer data!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is very basic: all teams are rated for attack and defense and comparing the teams involved in each match, you roll a couple of 6-sided dice for each team to get how many points each one scored during a match. Sounds easy? It is. But there are also a few modifiers, that may dramatically alter the result of the game, with surprising effect (like a possible underdog win over the favourite of the tournament).&lt;br/&gt;Easy to set up and very fast to complete an entire tournament (an hour or so for most of the tournaments).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
