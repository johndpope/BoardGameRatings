							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Marine Adventures: Labyrinth of the Necrons</name>
									
			<description>The Necron Overlord has arisen, and he seeks to take over the galaxy! Standing between this tyrannical maniac and his ultimate prize are five Space Marine heroes - mighty battle-brothers who have sworn to halt his evil plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Marine Adventures is a fast-paced cooperative game for 1-4 players, pitting a squad of brave Space Marine warriors against the menace of the alien Overlord and his robotic footsoldiers in the dark and dangerous labyrinth of the Necrons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three levels to complete, each offering a different challenge. In order to win a game you must successfully fulfill the mission objective for a level. Advance rules and challenge cards allow you to tailor the difficulty of each level, and all three levels can be combined into a single campaign - the true test of a Space Marine hero!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
