			<description>The game box contains only the game board and 1 bone die (according to the instructions, counters were not supplied as the players were expected to provide their &amp;quot;Aeroplanes&amp;quot; with lead, paper figures or counters). Printed in Bavaria by the British games manufacturer &amp;quot;Spears&amp;quot; before WWI, it's one of the many clones of the older &amp;quot;The Game of Goose&amp;quot;. The mechanic is fair simple, with the players alternating rolling the die and advancing their counters, ending by chance on some bonus or malus spaces and resolving the special effects before passing the turn to the next player. The game ends as the winning player reaches the winning post (50).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
