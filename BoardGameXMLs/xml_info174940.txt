			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Setting for any game system and a mini-RPG, with stats for -U- the Game of Stories!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago there were dragons that roamed the earth. Then, in a single day and night, they were gone. All that was left of the dragons were their scales. Years later, some ingenious humans discovered the dragon scales and unlocked their power, thus making them the first of what is called the Dragon'skin. Slowly but surely, over the ages, more humans have been introduced to the scales of the dragons and turned into something more than human that walk among us. Near-immortal, powerful beings that live in the shadows of mankind directing it to their whims, much like their ancestors. They are the Dragon'skin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this book, you'll find a complete Setting about the world of Dragon'skin and a customized copy of -U- Essentials which gives you everything (except 3 six-sided die) to begin playing in this strange parallel of our own world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
