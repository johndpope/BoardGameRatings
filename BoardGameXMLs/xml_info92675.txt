			<description>This Game is the french Bonide dice game adapted into a card game. You play with decks of cards. Each deck represents a die, and each card within the deck represents a side of the die. Thus a six sided die is represented by a six cards deck with the same back.&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, decks and tokens are distributed. Your goal is to get rid of all your tokens.&lt;br/&gt;It's a risk-taking game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you choose a deck on your turn, you get rid of tokens, depending on the color of the deck. You can then draw a number or an effect on the game. If you draw a number, it has to be lower than the last number played, or you take all of the pot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
