			<description>Front Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brawls from the dawn of time until the age of black powder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside the rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Swordplay&amp;quot; is a set of rules. Written to provide a universal set of skirmish rules, from the dawn of man up to the beginnin of black powder weapons. It covers the sword and sharp pointy stick type of warfare best.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the book are provided some historical period details to get you started. It is planned to provide details for other periods at a later date.&lt;br/&gt;The rules are written to provide a more &amp;quot;Hollywood&amp;quot; type of game rather than historical accuracy. So if you were brought up on a diet of swashbuckling heroes, and dastardly villains these are the rules for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exhaustive individual character skirmish rules including horses. Includes scenarios for Maldon 991 C.E. (Viking vs Saxon), Ambush Wars of the Roses 1461 C.E. and Bar Room Brawl France 1627 C.E.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
