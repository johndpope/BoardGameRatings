			<description>Pack Wars is a simultaneous action selection card game played over 5 rounds. Each round is selecting and performing two actions. At the end of the 2nd action the Hirelings pack out an item. The winner is the Hireling that has the lightest backpack. Since the pay to be a Hireling is terrible, why would you choose to carry anything heavy? Leave the heavy items for the Hirelings that don't know any better!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two type of cards; Items and Actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Item cards are placed in a 3x5 grid know as the &amp;quot;Loading Dock&amp;quot; (the rest of them create an item draw deck). Each item has a weight value. You do NOT want to get stuck carrying the heavy stuff (it could hurt your back!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 5 action cards. Select two cards to play this round. Simultaneously reveal the first card. The card with the lowest value is resolved first. Do this again for the second card and after the cards are resolved you pack out the item in the Loading Dock closest to your Hireling (if you didn't pack one out from your action). At the end of the round, draw two new action cards and refill the loading dock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most Action cards switch items around on the loading dock, but some can make you pack items out earlier. A few actions such as &amp;quot;Prancebald Brought a Mule.&amp;quot; , allow you to discard the items instead of packing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
