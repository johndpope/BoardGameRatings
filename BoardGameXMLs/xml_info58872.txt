							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gladiator</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The gladiator is the highly trained master of arena combat, capable of dispatching foes in the most spectacular manner imaginable. His highly specialised training in such forms of combat as net-fighting, blind-fighting and exotic weapons allows him to demonstrate the most unusual fighting techniques in the world to an eager audience. As important as winning his fight, he must win the crowd, the vast seething mob of the imperial cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second book of the Power Class series from Mongoose Publishing. Designed to be seamlessly slotted into any fantasy-based d20 system game, each of these mini-supplements introduce an entirely new core character class, adding a whole new dimension to campaigns. Players will find full details on how to use the new character class, greatly increasing the wealth of options they are presented with by the core rulebooks while Games Masters may revel in the wide variety of new classes they have at their disposal for non-player characters in their campaigns. Each Power Class can provide hours of gaming enjoyment at an all new low cost.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
