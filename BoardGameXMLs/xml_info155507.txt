							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Decahedron (Issue 2 - Feb 2014)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decahedron is a magazine designed to support the BareBones Fantasy RPG.  It contains articles written by gamers like you. Originally, this was intended to be a paid-for publication containing material DwD Studios produced, along with some fan-generated content in a profit-sharing model. However, due to the popularity of the game and the ever-growing community, we wanted to continue our roots of community development like we have done with our other fan-based products and sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This magazine is something we can all develop together and be proud of. Designed to be small, lite, but full of fun content, we hope you enjoy this issue, as we plan on many more to come. As long as gamers are contributing content they&amp;rsquo;ll have a place within the pages of Decahedron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within issue you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A great cover by Peter Szabo Gabor of Eastern Raider Games.&lt;br/&gt;     A spotlight on Andrew Collas, an active member of the forums at dwdstudios.com.&lt;br/&gt;     The Gaming Table: we all love d100 tables, and this one article gives you no less than three tables to use when scoring a critical hit or failure on your foes.  Caution - some of these are deadly!&lt;br/&gt;     Character Backgrounds: a series of tables you can roll on to learn some nifty things about your character... you get the normal stuff like age, height, weight, hair and eye color.  But you also get neat tables like &amp;quot;reason for adventuring,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Where you grew up&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;childhood conditions.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;     Home Brew: Every GM has his own way of doing things.  Since our game is supposed to be heavily GM-centric, where a strong GM role is required, we thought it might be a good idea for some of you to share your home brew rules with other GMs.  In this article, Karlen Kendrick shares a method he uses to help give the players a feeling of ownership over the setting by use of &amp;quot;truth cards.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;     Hamlet of Gnaw Bone: A pretty detailed little village in the Reinaris Barony, built by rebels and outlaws.  It's a great place to launch a party of adventurers!  Complete with a few plot hooks to get you started.&lt;br/&gt;     Trading Post: GMs have a lot of work to do when maintaining the fun adventurers their players must embark on.  Why should they do ALL the work?  Contained in this article are items of usefulness, from the mundane to the magical, ready to be put to good use in your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;     Caer Urdak: Three days due east of Stavengaard, in an area of the sea that is supposed to be landless, there is an island.  Shrouded in mist, and not much bigger than Lor Warren, Caer Urdak is home to the enigmatic Dragon-kin.  Bred by the ancient grand dragons, it is their sworn duty to guard the secret resting place of their creators.&lt;br/&gt;     A sweet map of a village, complete with surrounding farmlands and even what appears to be a forest settlement of elves?  Make of it what you will - as always the back cover of this issue has a free map for you to use however you want.  You GMs need all the help you can get!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
