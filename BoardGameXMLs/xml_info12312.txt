			<description>The Gamemaster (called Umpire in the rules) asks each player a question. The first question is worth one dollar. Each correct answer after the first question is worth double. The top prize is sixty-four dollars. A wrong answer ends the first part of the game for a player and forces that player to surrender all winnings to the &amp;quot;Jack Pot Fund.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all players have had a chance to play, each player will have to answer one final question asked of the entire group. All who respond correctly split the &amp;quot;Jack Pot Fund.&amp;quot; The player with the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which question to be asked is determined by the gameboard which is a giant spinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on a popular radio show which was adapted for television and renamed &amp;quot;The $64,000 Question.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
