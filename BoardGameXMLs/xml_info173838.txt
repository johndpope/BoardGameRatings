			<description>Five basic Dora the Explorer Games, to teach color and number recognition, sequencing, patterning and game play skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included games are &amp;quot;The Race to Abuela's House&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Vines &amp;amp; Logs&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Catch the Stars!&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Nutty Forest Maze&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Beach day!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Short description per game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Race to Abuela's House: players spin the spinner to race to Abuela's house, but if they land on an obstacle, they need the spinner to land on the corresponding tool before moving on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vines &amp;amp; Logs: shortened version of chutes (logs) and ladders (vines).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catch the Stars!: the game board shows a pattern with six different colours. Players spin the spinner (that shows colours now) to spin the required colours for their next step, in a race to the other side of the board, where te stars await.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nutty Forest Maze: players spin the spinner to race to Tico's treehouse. They have to choose the right way through the maxe, and can loose turns (when encountering Swiper the fox) or getting extra moves (when encountering stars).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beach Day!: players spin the spinner and move to the first next square showing the same picture as the picture shown by the spinner to race to the beach (candy land variation).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
