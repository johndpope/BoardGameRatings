							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vornheim: The Complete City Kit</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...but I'm not here to bore you with that. This book is not about Vornheim, it&amp;rsquo;s about running Vornheim- or any other city- in a fantastic Medieval setting. And about running it with a minimum of hassle- so you and your players can get to the good stuff- That&amp;rsquo;s why we called it a &amp;lsquo;Kit&amp;rsquo;... you can use it to build your own city, even in the middle of a game. Give somebody a floorplan and they&amp;rsquo;ll GM for a day- show them how to make 30 floorplans in 30 seconds and they&amp;rsquo;ll GM forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That said, anyone hoping they bought a book containing The Real Vornheim That The D&amp;amp;D With Pornstars Girls Play In has got it. These are our rules and tables and monsters and places. I wouldn't want to spend all this time writing a book I could't use...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; from the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We asked Zak S., the game master of I Hit With My Axe, to make a little book full of the notes he had when running city adventures-and everything he wished he had.  He gave us not only a sourcebook detailing key rules, tables, monsters and places in Vornheim- the city at the center of the Axe campaign - but also a treasure chest of resources for running adventures in any city.&lt;br/&gt;Need to know how to get from here to there even if neither here nor there are listed on a map? Even if there is no map? Need a random encounter? Need instant stats for that random encounter? Need to know why there was a random encounter?  This book was designed to help you make a city happen now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to details on Vornheim, adventure locations, and player commentary from the I Hit It With My Axe girls, every single surface below this jacket &amp;ndash; including the back of the jacket, the book covers underneath, and the inside covers &amp;ndash; has been crammed full of tools to help you build and run a city in a First, Second, Third, or Fourth Edition game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
