			<description>subtitle:&lt;br/&gt;A Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons game using the One-Roll Engine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the colophon:&lt;br/&gt;To utilise the material contained herein, you must own a copy of Reign and the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Player's Handbook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Foreward[sic]:&lt;br/&gt;The material you now have in your possession is what I call a &amp;ldquo;patch&amp;rdquo; for REIGN: by following the guidelines herein, you should be able to play Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons using the excellent One-Roll Engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from The ORE Reivisited:&lt;br/&gt;The REIGN &amp;lsquo;flavour&amp;rsquo; of the One-Roll Engine has been altered to reflect the heroic fantasy setting of Dungeons and Dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from Skills Re-visited:&lt;br/&gt;The skills in Reign are very specific to that setting: Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons has little need for a Plead skill. Conversely, there are a lot more skills in D &amp;amp; D than the former game which are somewhat irrelevant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from Spell Conversion Notes:&lt;br/&gt;Spells in Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons are radically different to those found in REIGN. As it is the D &amp;amp; D flavour we&amp;rsquo;re trying to capture in this conversion, we need to make some adjustments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user note:&lt;br/&gt;A spell conversion guide is provided to translate the spell effects from the D&amp;amp;D stats into ORE stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the conversions rule require the use of the Reign core rulebook and the D&amp;amp;D 3.5 Players handbook, the rules in this book are not compatible with either of those games, except as used together with the modifications contained in this conversion guide.  The Reign rules are altered to conform to the tropes of D&amp;amp;D, and the D&amp;amp;D material is altered to use the modified One-Roll Engine mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
