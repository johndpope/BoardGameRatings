							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Cult on the Couch</name>
									
			<description>From the scenario&lt;br/&gt;This Delta Green Night at the Opera is meant to introduce a potential DG friendly, Dr. Manheim Cornwall, a clinical psychiatrist MD who is one of the United States' foremost experts on cults, human persuasion &amp;amp; influence, and the neurological basis of faith. He has had a long career of corporate consulting and university funded research, and isregularly published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, and other respected academic publications. Unfortunately for him, he tends toengage in headline-grabbing experiments. It is his latest research project that leads him into some Delta Green related territory, and gives A-Cell and the PCs leverage over him that could be usefully exploited in future Operas, should they survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
