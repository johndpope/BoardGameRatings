			<description>In this cooperative game, players begin by selecting hero cards from among four different colors (representing the elements earth, wind, fire, and water) to form a party. Each player then receives a hand of cards drawn from a central deck, which also represents the players' hit points. The players face a series of monster cards drawn from an enemy deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes begin at level one, but they earn tokens during the game that may be spent to level up their attack abilities. Each hero may only attack when the player has played a card matching its color. The card that is played must match either the color or the number of the card that was previously played, though multiple cards may be played under special circumstances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster attacks force players to discard from the central deck, decreasing the available hit points. Leveling up the heroes helps players to reclaim these discarded hit points, essentially &amp;quot;healing&amp;quot; the group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After facing a series of monsters, the players confront a powerful boss monster in a final battle. The players all win or lose together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
