			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jesuits proposed to defend Catholicism not by assuming a defensive posture, but by vigorously advancing the cause of the Church. They recognized that ideas were more powerful than armies; and they were dismayed by the appeal of Protestantism amongst educated persons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intended as a print-and-play component, similar to a traditional character sheet.  Not all participants receive this handout, and it is not introduced at the start of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
