			<description>The Return of Ishtar (イシターの復活, Ishitā no Fukkatsu?) is an action role-playing arcade game, released by Namco in 1986. It runs on Namco System 86 hardware and is the sequel to The Tower of Druaga, which was released three years earlier. It is the second game in the Babylonian Castle Saga series. It was ported to the MSX, FM7 and included in the Namco Museum Vol. 4 for PlayStation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Return of Ishtar is an adventure game for two players. One person controls the maiden Ki who fights with magic and the other person controls Gilgamesh, the sword-wielding prince. Players are given a password to allow them to continue from where they left off. This sequel starts off directly after Gilgamesh has saved Ki from Druaga, and is focused on their escape from the tower and its inhabitants who are after Gilgamesh and Ki to avenge their former master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Return of Ishtar&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
