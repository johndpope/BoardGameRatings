			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is similar to Tetris: tetrominos fall from the top and must be rotated and positioned; they stop falling shortly after landing on the bottom or on existing blocks, and a new block, which is displayed in advance to help the player plan, starts to fall from the top; the game is over when a block stops falling before fully entering the playing area. In contrast to Tetris the aim is not to form complete horizontal lines but words, which can read left-to-right or top-to-bottom. Moreover, the behaviour of the remaining blocks after a word is scored is different to Tetris: any block which has become disconnected from the blocks resting on the bottom of the playing area falls again until it lands on the bottom or on existing blocks. At this point a fresh check for words is made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
