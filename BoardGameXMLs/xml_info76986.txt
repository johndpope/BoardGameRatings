			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Android Two was the successful follow up to Android, a basic maze game with shoot em up. Android had a flat view of your robot running between rooms. With Android Two, the developer Costa Panayi switched to an isometric 3D view that worked very well. In particular, Panayi used the Bright code, which gave two shades of one colour. This made the White colour appear grey next to the 'bright' white, and this created the strong effect of light and shadow. This very simple technique gave the illusion of solid walls and gave the game an innovative and unique look and feel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, your move Android around, avoiding robots and hunting worms, having to shoot their heads three times. A game of skill and timing, it was very popular and cemented Panayi's reputation in the Spectrum fan base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
