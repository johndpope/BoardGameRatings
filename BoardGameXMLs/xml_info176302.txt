			<description>The game is played rather like Lotto but has the variation of Bongo Cards. When these are revealed they add a feature to the game. For example, a player who was very far behind, could now be the the frontrunner at once and the former leader drops back to 2nd place. There are 10 different Bongo Cards and once used they go out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over a pre-set number of rounds. The one with the most matches after that time has won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
