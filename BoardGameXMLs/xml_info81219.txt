			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Complete Carriers at War is a compilation of three previous titles that covered the air/naval war in the South Pacific during World War II: Carriers at War, Carriers at War Construction Kit and Carriers at War II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction from the game manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Complete Carriers at War is the final instalment in our series of games covering the great air-naval battles of the Second World War.  It brings together all the Pacific and Southeast Asia scenarios from Carriers at War I and II, as well as the numerous additional scenarios published in our Run 5 magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, we have included the Construction Kit, revised to include a handy - and much demanded - utility for importing data on Ship Classes and Plane Types.  Using the construction kit, you can create new variants for existing scenarios; indeed, you can create original scenarios!  Ship listings for Germany, Italy, France and Russia are also included.  A complete set of unpacked graphic files (.lbm format) are included in a separate library to assist would-be scenario creators.  And finally, we have added a swag of new, exciting scenarios - historical and hypothetical - from the European Theatre of Operations.  You get your chance to sink the Bismark!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Complete Carriers at War upgrades, expands and replaces all previous titles in the series in one conveniently presented CD-ROM package.  It is a terrific value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
