							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Farm Cards</name>
									
			<description>Farm Cards is a fast-paced game where players assume the roles of farmers, try to harvest the most balanced crops they can, and earn the most money at the Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market. Each player is in direct competition with the others and tries to sabotage the others&amp;rsquo; fields by dumping garbage on their land! Don&amp;rsquo;t expect a fellow farmer to be kind, his only goal is to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a print and play game. There are 108 custom cards depicting plots of land with seeds and values; and seeds with values. The game may also be played with 2 standard 52 card decks + 4 jokers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns working with the &amp;quot;junked-up land&amp;quot; passed to them by their competitors and attempt to achieve the highest score through two mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;1- A standard point mechanic through plot and seed values (card face-value).&lt;br/&gt;2- A second scale representing pH balance that can either be positive, negative, or balanced (0). This is achieved through the use of card suits (vegetables, fruits, and grains with the custom cards - 8 in total; Spades, Hearts, Clubs, and Diamonds with standard American playing cards - 4 in total).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is currently undergoing playtesting and review.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
