			<description>The object of the game is to become the wealthiest player by the buying and licensing of franchises. Genuine franchise companies are used in the game, such as Shakey's Pizza, Robo Car Wash, Wiener King, Lawn Doctor, Natural Cosmetics, and several others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with $110,000. Players roll dice and move their pawns around the board, and may purchase the franchise system depicted on the space they land on, if it is currently unowned. If another player lands on the same space, he must become a franchisee, and pays the system owner a royalty fee whenever he again lands on that space. Only two franchises of any type may be sold, so anyone else landing on that space becomes a customer and must pay a fee based on the number of franchises owned. Players may freely buy and trade franchises between themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player cannot pay the required fee(s), he is declared bankrupt and is out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
