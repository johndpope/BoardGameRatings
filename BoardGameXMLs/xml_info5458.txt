			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eurohit is an enjoyable and challenging card game for 3-6 players aged 10 years and upwards.  The rules are easy to understand and allow play to be friendly or cunningly crafty, depending on your style of play and the group of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to score 500 points (or over) by visiting as many European Cities as possible whilst keeping one step ahead of the Hit Man.  However, as the Hit Man, you can score points off the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will soon master the rules, and some, but not maybe all, of the possible stategies, but if you do, there are optional rules to alter the play to make it an easier or harder, shorter or longer game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a homebrew quality about it (comparable to Cheapass Games products, but in a nice carton).  Noteable for being acquired by The Avalon Hill Game Co and being reissued as the much maligned Assassin, featuring better components but adds some rather odd tweaks and revisions to the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
