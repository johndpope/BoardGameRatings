			<description>From the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you like sharks? Do sharks like you? Find out in this entertaining and absorbing family nature game !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SharkPit is packed with fascinating facts about the real lives of sharks.  Did you know that many kinds of sharks don't really have to keep swimming all their lives at all, but can rest happily on the ocean floor, pumping water through their gills? Or that the average shark replaces about six thousand teeth every year?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first shark to reach either of the coral reefs and then swim back to the island in the middle of the board.  The first back to the island wins the game.  It's as simple as that!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But on the way you might be hunted by sports fishermen, or you might eat an old drum by mistake, or you might have to hide in a mangrove swamp to escape a bigger, meatier shark!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The more you play SharkPit, the more you will find out about sharks; their habits, lives, adventures and struggles.  By the end, you'll know just what it's like to be a shark!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
