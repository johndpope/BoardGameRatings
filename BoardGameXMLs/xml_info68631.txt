			<description>From box:&lt;br/&gt;King Harold, had just returned to England from the Crusades, not time to declare his succession who dies suddenly.&lt;br/&gt;Her 4 children are the heirs virtual, but only one can become the true king.&lt;br/&gt;Each player will have to impersonate at beginning of the game the King is not entitled, to one of four colors, in defiance of all the others to become the authentic depositary of the Crown.&lt;br/&gt;The achievement will not be easy! &lt;br/&gt;The game features 2 decks for a total of 90 cards.&lt;br/&gt;Initially will distribute 8 cards of Army to each contestant and then they draw from the deck of event cards a card which constitute the performance of the real game.&lt;br/&gt;Happen so bloody battles in which you can conquer Castles, Keys or Crowns, or see your Army decimated.&lt;br/&gt;The game should be played in three round. Every round ends in two ways: one player obtains a &amp;quot;Full Victory&amp;quot; (Crown, Castle, Key of his colour and the Royal Seal) or all the Event cards have been turned up without a Full Victory.&lt;br/&gt;In every case every player goes to mark on a paper his or her score.&lt;br/&gt;It will also depend on luck but remember that amid the storms of events is not only the fate that you should count, but especially about your strategy skills, how to field Armies and your skill in negotiation.&lt;br/&gt;There will then be unexpected as considerable pestilence, tax liability and Magicians are able to perform any spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
