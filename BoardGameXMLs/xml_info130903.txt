			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Is &amp;quot;Dinky Dragons&amp;quot;?&lt;br/&gt;It is a simple roleplaying game with a minimum number of rules, best used with comedy fantasy settings. It is a classic &amp;quot;beer and pretzels&amp;quot; system, perfect for groups of two to eight players, ages 12 and over. Is it as good as Dinky Dungeons? No way! Unfortunately, that wonderful RPG has been out of print for years and copies of it are extremely rare. Even if you were lucky enough to find it for sale, you'd spend a few hundred dollars just to buy the core system. Dinky Dragons will have to do until Doc makes his triumphant return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
