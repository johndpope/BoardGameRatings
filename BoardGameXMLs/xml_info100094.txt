			<description>A quick, humorous card game of words and imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Word is a game in which players create their own fictional, made-up words (using the cards in their hand) to fit the theme of the round. The players&amp;rsquo; cards contain word fragments that are used in many real English words today. Each round, a new theme sentence is revealed and the players must complete the sentence with a phrase that includes their new made-up word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key skill in the game is for a player to create an entertaining word from their cards which allows them to complete the theme sentence with flair and imagination, in order to impress the judge and win the round. Points are also awarded to second and third place depending upon the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The normal goal of the game is to have been awarded more points than the opposing players after one full round in which all players have had the opportunity to judge once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
