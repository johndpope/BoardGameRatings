			<description>Poisoner's Dilemma is a quick micro-game containing only four cards. The cards come in a custom printed sleeve that holds the whole game. &lt;br/&gt;The game is inspired by the scene in &amp;quot;The Princess Bride&amp;quot; where Vizzini and Westley face off in a Battle of Wits.&lt;br/&gt;Westley serves two goblets of wine for the two to drink. But one goblet is tainted with poison! Which one??? &lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;It ends when you decide and we drink &lt;br/&gt;and find out who is right and who is dead.&amp;rdquo; -Westley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of three cards: two wine cards and one poison card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entire Rules of Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each person starts with 3 life. &lt;br/&gt;The first person to zero life is dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose one person to be the Dealer and the other to be the Player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round Description:&lt;br/&gt;1. The Dealer chooses one card to remove from &lt;br/&gt;the game for the round.&lt;br/&gt;2. The Dealer serves one face-down card to the Player &lt;br/&gt;and one to themselves.&lt;br/&gt;3. The Player chooses whether to drink the from card in front of themselves or from the card in front of the Dealer. &lt;br/&gt;The Dealer drinks from the other card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a. If the poison card is in the game, whoever drinks it loses 1 life.&lt;br/&gt;b. If the poison card is not in the game and the Player chooses their own card, no one loses a life.&lt;br/&gt;c. If the poison card is not in the game and the Player chooses the card in front of the Dealer, it is a grave insult to the Dealer&amp;rsquo;s integrity, and the Dealer punches the Player. The Player loses a life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Switch the role of Player and Dealer for the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
