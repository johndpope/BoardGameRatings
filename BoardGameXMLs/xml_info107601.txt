			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The political boardgame, Spread the Wealth Around, exists to train you bitter clingers to practice the art of class warfare, dodge death panels, cheat on your taxes and do your small part to increase our national debt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose membership in one of four organizations: Public Service, ObamaCare, Big Labor or Wall Street. From your perch atop the ruling class, you&amp;rsquo;ll bankrupt other players, drag them before show trials, carve them up in unnecessary surgery or just get one of your big labor goons to wack &amp;lsquo;em in Rocko Roulette.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than accumulate wealth in Spread the Wealth Around, you&amp;rsquo;ll rack up mountains of debt just like Obama&amp;rsquo;s America. Scam dead people and collect their Social Security in Public Office. Unplug granny and play the lawsuit lottery in ObamaCare. Gamble and go burnin&amp;rsquo; and lootin&amp;rsquo; with Big Labor. Cut in line for your Wall Street bailout it&amp;rsquo;s all for the children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spread the Wealth Around is the perfect gift to cure that troglodyte Republican friend or conservative relation. No need for sensitivity training or coaching on tax and spend Obamanomics. Put away those teacher&amp;rsquo;s union pamphlets and Mao&amp;rsquo;s little red book. Play the political game that&amp;rsquo;s making the world safe for socialism!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
