			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With war a constant fact of life for the last five years, the Federated Suns and Lyran Alliance have pushed massive resources into deploying new units as quickly as possible. Additionally, they have continued to refit classic 'Mech designs to better cope with the current devastating firepower found on the modern battlefield. The other Houses and Clans have encountered their own conflicts and have also fielded their own new units of destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Classic BattleTech Record Sheets: 3067 provides filled-out record sheets for the vehicles and BattleMechs described in Classic BattleTech Technical Readout: 3067. Additionally, more than 100 filled-out record sheets are included for variants and configurations for numerous standard 'Mech designs presented in Technical Readouts: 3050 and 3055.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the heftier sets of Record Sheets released as a part of the BattleTech range, this set includes Record Sheets for the Classic BattleTech Technical Readout: 3067, BattleTech Technical Readout: 3050 and BattleTech Technical Readout: 3055. This created a certain amount of overlap with other record sheet sets, such as the FASA-produced BattleTech Record Sheets Volume Six: 3055 'Mechs and BattleTech Record Sheets: 3055 &amp; 3058.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
