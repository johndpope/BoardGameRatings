							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythender in Golarion</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Golarion Corrupted by Myth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the world of Paizo&amp;rsquo;s Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, the myriad of gods are locked in eternal contest over their own realms and influence over mortals. Some are benevolent and emotional, some are harsh but still caring, some revel in corruption and strife, some in pure destruction, and that is to say nothing of those who are wholly alien in mind-set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Mythender Roleplaying Game, the gods clash with each other to be sure, but they all draw power from the worship of mortals.As agents or manifestations of the Mythic World itself, these gods and their monstrous servitors keep mortalkind in fear and awe so that the Mythic World itself may thrive. All gods&amp;mdash;even the &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; ones&amp;mdash;must be Ended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So hey, let&amp;rsquo;s smash those two ideas together: use Mythender to play mortals infused with Mythic Power who dare to End the gods of Golarion, only to risk becoming gods themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disclaimer: This is a fan work utilizing Paizo&amp;rsquo;s Community License, not to be implied as official from Paizo because Paizo employees made this.
