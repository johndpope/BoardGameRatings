							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">My Supernatural Romance</name>
									
			<description>Author Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long story short: somehow, she went out with him and maybe even married him anyway, and now he's trying to find a role-playing game they can play together. And My Supernatural Romance could be it!&lt;br/&gt;My #1 design goal with this game was to make a game I could play with my non-gamer wife, inspired by Emily Care Boss's Breaking the Ice and Ron Edwards's S/Lay w/Me. We wanted the romance from Breaking the Ice, the adventure and conflict and oracles from S/Lay w/Me, and we wanted the subject matter to be something we both were into. I'm not into contemporary romances; she's not into pulp fantasy - but add vampires to your romance and it's something we both can enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;So this is a game that is mainly intended to create stories in the vein of Twilight and True Blood and The Little Mermaid &amp;ndash; the protagonists fall in love with something that's outside their own species, and trouble ensues, but if you want you can easily take the mermaids, vampires, or ghosts out and tell a more standard romance novel story &amp;ndash; not so much the &amp;ldquo;bodice ripper&amp;rdquo; sort of romance, but the romance of the formula: girl meets boy; boy is kind of an asshole; they dance around each other for a while; turns out the boy had a reason for being an asshole and they get together. Pride and Prejudice made the mold and thousands of stories have been fabricated therein.&lt;br/&gt;You may think &amp;quot;I hate romance, this isn't for me&amp;quot;, but wait - almost every movie has a love subplot, even if it's not the main plot, and some movies, like Wall-E and Spider-Man 2, the love story is the main plot and saving the world is actually the sub-plot! Even Fight Club: meeting Marla Singer is what drives the book and the movie, is what turns Edward Norton to Brad Pitt. So there - maybe you like romance more than you think. And yet love is very under-represented in games - even story games and RPGs - and for good reason. For one thing, love stories and ensemble casts don't go together - for a love story to work in a game, you probably only want 2 players. So &amp;ndash; if it's a game you're playing with just your significant other &amp;ndash; game on!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published as a wiki page - so no actual page #s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
