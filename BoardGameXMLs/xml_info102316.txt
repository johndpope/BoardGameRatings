			<description>The player controls Craig Dylan as he accompanies Armando &amp;quot;Rock&amp;quot; Depedra, and Sabrina Sayrus to the Bermuda Triangle searching for Sabrina's father, James Sayrus. They are sucked into a temporal vortex and crash land on a mysterious island. Dylan becomes separated from them and must trek across the island, past a beached cargo ship and volcano, before finding a fort maintained by the lost Dr. Sayrus, Sabrina's father who she organized the trip to find, and Rock, who was dropped on the island years before Dylan and is now past his prime. Dr. Sayrus tells Dylan of an impending disaster and tells him to find a Temporal Vortex Engine that will allow them to return to their own time, located in a German submarine in a cave. Dylan finds the TVE and tries to return to camp, running into Sabrina again, who is being chased by a Spinosaurus she calls &amp;quot;Spike.&amp;quot; They manage to escape and return to the fort, only to learn that the uranium battery that powers the TVE no longer works. Dylan recovers another battery from a drone that apparently arrived on the island via a temporal vortex from the future and returns to camp again, but Spike apparently followed him and tries to kill them. Dylan fights off Spike while Dr. Sayrus fixes the TVE and allows Dylan and Sabrina to escape just as Spike breaks in while he and Rock stay behind to hold him off. Dylan and Sabrina emerge on a sandy beach and wonder what to do just before another portal opens up, and Dr. Sayrus and Rock emerge on the repaired submarine one year after Dylan and Sabrina returned, with an apparently dead Spike tied to the hull. As the game ends, Spike's eye opens up, leaving whether or not a sequel will be made up in the air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat encounters include arena style fights, fortification sieges, survival modes and boss battles. Adrenaline bursts give you an edge - this gameplay feature allows the player to visualize and then target an opponent&amp;rsquo;s weak point such as the heart, lungs, brain, ribcage, and backbone in slow motion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Jurassic: The Hunted&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
