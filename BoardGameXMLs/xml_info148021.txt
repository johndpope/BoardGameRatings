							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sheriff&#039;s Office</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sheriff's Office is a 16 x 20 inch, full color floorplan of a Old West Sheriff's Office, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The zip file includes the VTT file for use online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a one-floor old west sheriff&amp;rsquo;s office. There are two hitching posts in the south for tethering horses. Usually the sheriff&amp;rsquo;s and deputies&amp;rsquo; horses are hitched here when they are at the office. Wooden steps lead up to a front porch. Sometimes the sheriff will be sitting on the front porch in a single chair, shotgun in hand, usually a sure sign that trouble is afoot.&lt;br/&gt;The sheriff&amp;rsquo;s office offers a lot of opportunities for old west adventure. It just depends on which side of the law the Player Characters are on. For bounty hunters, the sheriff&amp;rsquo;s office is a place to go find wanted posters and put together a posse to go find a bandit worth a reward and turn him in after capture. They might also have to guard him during the night before a hanging at high noon. They might also have a witness who needs protection from criminals who want him dead before a judge makes it town and can hear what he has to say. In either circumstance, the Player Characters need to fend off the sheriff&amp;rsquo;s office with the help of the sheriff and deputies from break out attempts by their prisoners or allied criminals or break in and assassination attempts of their witness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Player Characters are criminals, you can run a reverse scenario. They have been caught by the sheriff and need to figure out a way to get free or have their criminal buddies break them out of prison. Or maybe the Player Characters let themselves get caught, so they could break out of the holding cells and take out a witness in the middle of the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other possible adventures include a dead sheriff and deputies and the Player Characters are suddenly deputized to become the lawmen. An even better twist is if the Player Characters are formally criminals who have been pardoned but only on the condition of accepting these jobs. The Mayor is banking on their bad reputation to keep his town safe. But instead it leads to the town being targeted by their major enemies and even their old allies who think they&amp;rsquo;ve gone soft and turned traitor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
