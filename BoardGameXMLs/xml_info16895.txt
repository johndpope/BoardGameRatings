			<description>From the game description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Storytelling often revolves around the past. But there's another type of storytelling that we call FutureStories. Imagine playing a game where you talk about your hopes and dreams for the future. What do you want to be doing five years from now? What will the world look like in 100 years? [...]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;FutureStories is easy to play and fun for all ages. There are no right or wrong answers. This game is based on your imagination, not intelligence, knowledge of trivia, or chance. And... it can be played anywhere.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
