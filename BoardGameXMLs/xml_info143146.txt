			<description>Suit Up is the game of friendly competition. A group of friends compete with each other to discover who is the best of them. To do so, they participate in a popularity contest over the next day. They will move around the city, gather influence with different social circles, and use that influence to invite their new friends to their home to prove their greatness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Suit Up, you will guide a person of your choosing along a new adventure. You could be the Athlete who has influence with the sports fans in the city and can move around faster than everyone else; or the Executive who knows how to garner favors and has many business acquaintances. Or you could choose one of the other archetypes, each double-sided, to give you a wide and diverse variety of options. Plan your moves carefully as the city is ever-changing and you'll need to gain influence with different social circles to gain the influence you need. Things will take a dramatic turn as morning changes to evening and the new friends you made will become more valuable than ever. You'll compete over a pool of available friends, so you'll need to carefully choose which people will be your new friends and when to make them. Your new friends, in turn, could help you gather more influence and with that crucial end-game score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Suit Up is to have the highest Score at the end of 16 rounds (each the equivalent of an hour of the day). There are several things that add to your Score, namely:&lt;br/&gt;1) Friends you made (individually)&lt;br/&gt;2) Having a representative of all four areas of influence (Muscles, Brains, Suits and Cash)&lt;br/&gt;3) Having the most Friends of an area of influence (amount varies according to setup)&lt;br/&gt;4) Remaining Influence (at a low conversion-rate).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
