							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Buck Rogers Game: Adventures in the 25th Century</name>
									
			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join Captain Buck Rogers and Colonel Wilma Deering, commander of the Intercept Squadron, as they blast off from Earth to battle marauding space pirates. Take over the Draconian flagship, the pirates' base, and halt the invasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based off the early 80s TV show of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to daVinci editrice (online): &amp;quot;you just have to follow the instructions on two disks (one to determine the movements of the ships, and the other one for the actions to make when two ships are in the same point). The object of the game is to be the first player (there can be 2-4 of them) to board the Draconian ship with both his ships, that have to be moved from one side to the other of the board.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
