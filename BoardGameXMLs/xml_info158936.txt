							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Veil of Truth: Human Nature</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was in the late years of the 21st Century, while Humanity was immersed in a new Cold War, that we stumbled upon them. We were not alone. Worse: we had been under supervision by aliens for centuries, considered too primitive to handle the truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And we soon proved them right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth plunged into chaos. Nations shattered, religions split, revolts consumed the world. Thousands died and the face of the planet changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But humans are adaptable. We survived and we forced ourselves into Galactic Society. We were the Galaxy&amp;rsquo;s underdeveloped species, the inferior race, the second-rate citizen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They'll have to learn to live with us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Veil of Truth: Human Nature is a sourcebook about Humankind and Sol System for the Veil of Truth campaign setting for Pathfinder Roleplaying Game! Inside you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Humankind's timeline&lt;br/&gt;     Information on every one of Sol's planets and their status in the mid-22nd century&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed information on Earth's main governments and corporate states&lt;br/&gt;     Humanity's exploits outside Sol: the ocean-world of Toliman, mercenary units and alien-worshiping religion&lt;br/&gt;     New equipment&lt;br/&gt;     4 new monsters and 1 automata&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
