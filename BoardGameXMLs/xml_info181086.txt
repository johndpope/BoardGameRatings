			<description>Interstellar armies compete for dominance in unclaimed sectors of a galaxy made accessible by the discovery of warp gates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are Company level rules meant with 15mm in mind. Though they can be used with 28mm with a little adjustment to the ranges and movement distances. Armies consist of several units which are made up of three to six infantry fire teams or vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system includes rules for all kinds of cool sci-fi troop types that include walkers, grav vehicles, and giant fliers that can not only transport large quantities of infantry, but also vehicles as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Universe is meant to be a pretty open and accessible space opera.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 7 forces to choose from that range from the forces of Terra, to mysterious psychic aliens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
