							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">La traversée de la baie du Mont Saint-Michel à D</name>
									
			<description>The players are moving their pilgrims from one side of the bay to the other side. They use the three white dices to move to adjacent spaces (each space has a number form 1 to 6) or to jump over other pilgrims as a group effect. A gray dice cause good (collecting an archangel cube) and bad (quicksands) events to occur. Each turn the tide moves forward and any pilgrim reached by the tide drown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It cannot be stressed too often, you shouldn't attempt to cross the Mont Saint-Michel bay without an experienced guide.&lt;br/&gt;Be warned, if you attempt this on your own, you do so entirely at your own risk. Crossing the bay is certainly no picnic!&lt;br/&gt;You'll need to keep clear of the quicksands, take a biscuit break at the right moment and, above all, keep a careful watch&lt;br/&gt;on the rising tide in order to reach your goal. Luckily for you, archangel Saint-Michel is there to help...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capitalise on the best combinations of the dice, making good use of the biscuit pieces and archangel cubes to move forward as quickly as&lt;br/&gt;possible. The winner is the first player to reach the Mont Saint-Michel with their two pilgrims.&lt;br/&gt;If everyone is washed away by the tide, then no one wins, unless someone has taken refuge at Tombelaine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
