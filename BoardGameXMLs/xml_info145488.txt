			<description>Finally, you have reached your senior year at school and are recognizing that this is your time to shine!&amp;nbsp; And what better way to gain recognition then by being elected the class president.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Ohhhh the prestige and honor can all be yours (as well as special treatment) if you can convince the leaders of the different cliques to vote in your favor.&amp;nbsp; However, to them, you are still considered an outsider and you need an 'in' at the low end of the hierarchy before speaking to the likes of the elite of the student population.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Running for Class Prez is harder than you thought.&amp;nbsp; Everyone wants something in return for their vote and when you promise something to one clique, you end up alienating another.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately to make up for this, you are given the OK to participate in different events to campaign.&amp;nbsp; During the events, you can use the favors of your supporters to gain political advantages over your opponent.&amp;nbsp; However, watch out for the class clowns as they will help or hinder you by sending mixed messages. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're going to have to keep your campaign clean as you have the hall monitors keeping watch on you and your opponent and they have no qualms sending your potential voters to the principal&amp;rsquo;s office.&amp;nbsp; Also,&amp;nbsp; your opponent will try to spread rumors and expose scandals.&amp;nbsp; If all else fails, do what you can to gain the favor of the clique leaders because, only then, you will win the elections and become the Class Prez!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first electorate to gain favor from 3 of the 4 clique leaders will win the election.&amp;nbsp; Good luck to both candidates!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Class Prez! is a quick paced 2 player game in which players vie to gain the favor and votes of the student population by making promises to the various cliques as they work their way up to the most influential leaders of the Jocks, Nerds, Preps and Goths. Using set collection of promises (suits) to place the favour tokens on the students, you work your way up from the Wannabe to the 2nd in Command and finally, the Leader of the clique. The first player to have a favour token on 3 of the 4 clique leaders wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
