							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Federation &amp; Empire ISC War</name>
									
			<description>This expansion adds the ISC, the Interstellar Stellar Concordium to the Federation and Empire game system.  Anticipated for 25 years, ISC War adds the complete order of battle for the ISC forces.  New rules include ISC Echelon formations, PPD ships, Tactical Reserves, and ISC Rapid Base Deployment.  Scenarios include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gathering Winds, the ISC consolidate their outer provinces during the first 9 turns of the general war, amid Romulan and Gorn interference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Driving Winds, the ISC launches their pacification of the galaxy at the end of the General War with rapid deployment of their pacification stations.  They must hold the various neutral zone areas between the major powers to protect them from each other.  This scenario is divided into various &amp;quot;cordons&amp;quot; similar to the sectorized scenarios in other products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also scenario notes for using the ISC during the general war, and in a full scale war against the Gorns and Romulans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
