							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fallout: PnP RPG (1.5)</name>
									
			<description>Fallout PnP combines the computer games Fallout, Fallout 2 and Fallout: Tactics into a cohesive, playable rules set for table top RPG gaming.  Players can take on the roles of any of the several humanoid, robotic, and canine 'races' one would expect to encounter in the Fallout universe in a post-apocalyptic America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Fallout is a post-nuclear RPG set sometime after the great nuclear conflict in the year 2077.  99% of humanity and a good deal of other life perished in the nuclear war.  Of course, millions still survived, although some were altered beyond imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is officially version 1.5 of the Fallout: PNP RPG rules. I&amp;rsquo;ve kept all the rules from the game&amp;rsquo;s SPECIAL system&lt;br/&gt;intact, except for gun damage, which I modified - without any change to the resulting numbers - for ease of play on a tabletop. Heavy weapons, artillery pieces, and vehicles I had to completely make up on my own; for my sources, please see the bibliography at the end. I made some tweaks here and there to make the rules a little more &amp;quot;realistic,&amp;quot; like allowing both barrels of a double-barrel shotgun to be fired at once. I included some other weapons for the sake of realism and variety.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most current, complete, version of the rules is Fallout: PNP RPG (2.0).  Previous versions do not reflect entirely new rule sets, but rather a gradual streamlining and inclusion of additional rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
