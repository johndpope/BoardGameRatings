			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dead and FUBAR&amp;rsquo;d&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You thought that life sucked, and in a way you were right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You thought that things couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly get any worse, in that way you were wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At least when you were alive, you didn&amp;rsquo;t have bits of your body falling off, and you didn&amp;rsquo;t have this terrible hunger gnawing at you from the deepest pits of your soul&amp;hellip;and you didn&amp;rsquo;t have the dark whispering voices that seem to drive you toward oblivion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only things keeping you sane are the memories of the past and your desire to complete a few unfinished deeds before you completely fall apart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But things are never that easy&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dead and FUBAR&amp;rsquo;d is a twist on the fast-paced, story-oriented FUBAR game system by Vulpinoid Studios. Those who&amp;rsquo;ve played FUBAR before will have an idea of what to expect, but this game will be a bit more focused, a bit darker and a bit more gruesome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game for lowlifes who are willing to take some risks and go wherever the story might take them. This session requires minimal rules knowledge, and works best with players who are willing to backstab one another, discover a unique story and do what it takes to survive long enough fulfil their unfinished business in the mortal world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new 50 page expansion supplement for FUBAR includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New idea for providing character goals (and unfinished business in the mortal world)&lt;br/&gt;     An innovative new method for unting PCs with one another and with NPCs through relationships that are sketched out at the start of a session and detailed through the course of play.  &lt;br/&gt;     Eight awesome supernatural powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
