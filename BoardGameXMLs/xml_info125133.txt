			<description>This is a Monopoly clone from Late from the Sky, a publisher that specializes in themed Monopoly games. All the deeds, spaces on the board and cards feature campus landmarks and traditions from UCLA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll dice to determine how far they move.  Landing on a space gives the player the option of buying the property.  When a player collects all the properties in one color group, the properties can be improved by building. When players land on a space owned by another player they must pay rent.  Rent is determined by the location of the property and the number of improvements on the space. Some spaces instruct a player to draw a card which can be beneficial or harmful to the player. Players must avoid going bankrupt to stay in the game.  The winner is the last player left in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
