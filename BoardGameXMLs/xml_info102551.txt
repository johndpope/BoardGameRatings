			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game for three players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wielder&lt;br/&gt;Since you picked up the blade, you have known no peace. You&amp;rsquo;re not sure who is your true enemy: your own weapon, or the villain in whose plans you seem to be forever enmeshed. But you&amp;rsquo;re trapped by Fate: you can&amp;rsquo;t cast the blade aside; you need it (or at least its power), and it has chosen you. For now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blade&lt;br/&gt;You have an agenda, but need mortal hands to carry it out for you. You possess vast power to give to your wielder; you can also withdraw it when it suits you. You chose your current wielder and cut away all other bonds on your own edge. But to what end have you manipulated Fate and your wielder?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nemesis&lt;br/&gt;Cruel Fate has thrown that wretch into your path for the last time. You would have long since achieved your goals if not for the magic of the fell blade aiding the meddler. Seizing the blade has become your obsession: you are certain that if you wielded the blade, you could rule the world... or reduce it to ruins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
