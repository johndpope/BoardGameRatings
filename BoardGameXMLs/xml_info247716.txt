							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Die Schlacht bei Leipzig</name>
									
			<description>This 19th-Century game may be the earliest ever based on a specific Napoleonic battle, with the board showing a fairly detailed map of the area around the city. (While undated, it probably pre-dates Parker Bros. 1895 Waterloo.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is for 2 - 7 players, each of whom plays the role of one of the Coalition commanders advancing on Napoleon's central position: Blucher or von Bulow for the Prussians, von Schwartzenberg or von Klenau for the Austrians, Benningsen or Prinz Eugen for the Russians, or Karl Johann Bernadotte of Sweden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a unique track toward Leipzig as well as an illustrated player card with a biography on the front and rules governing each of the red-colored points along that player's track. Each turn, a player throws three D6, and if the result is 9 or higher, advances his piece one space. Each red space has an additional requirement that can lead to penalties or bonuses. Each track also has a battle to be won along the way (with the map noting the defending French commander). Moving past the battle requires a roll of 10 or higher on 2D6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players put 6 marks in the pot to start, and may lose or win money from the pot along the way. The first player to reach Leipzig (space 14) wins whatever pot remains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
