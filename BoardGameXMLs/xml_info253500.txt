			<description>Sunny and Stormy Day is a cooperative game that encourages discussion of feelings through the metaphor of &amp;quot;sunny&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;stormy&amp;quot; experiences. The game has 3 separate activities, a variant on the classic tile matching game, and a draw bag with tokens that ask for the players to discuss a part of their day, and a book that tells the story illustrated on the tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book tells the story of a day in the life Max the Hedgehog. During the day he experiences &amp;quot;sunny&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;stormy&amp;quot; events. The draw bag contains 3 tokens, a sun, a cloud, and a rainbow. They ask the participants to share part of their day that was sunny, stormy, or to share something they are looking forward to. The book and the tokens support the game in teaching about emotions but are not a part of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty sunny and stormy scenes from the book are paired together to create 10 matching sets (for example having fun splashing in puddles and being cold and scared in the rain). The goal of the game is to find all the pairs. The rules state three variants of increasing challenge. Variant 1 is a cooperative matching game in which tiles are placed face up. Variant 2 is a cooperative matching game in which tiles are placed face down. In variant 3, Max's day is almost over and he is remembering the sunny and stormy parts of the day. He must find all pairs before it is night and time for bed. This variant adds 4 nighttime tiles to the cooperative matching game that when revealed require the players to add a puzzle piece to a night puzzle. To win the players must find all matches before the puzzle is completed (6 puzzle pieces). Night tiles are not removed from the board when revealed. There are 4 tiles and 6 puzzle pieces so if players remember where the tiles are they will win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
