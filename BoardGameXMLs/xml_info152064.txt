			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your people have seen ages beyond mortal reckoning. Shadows of evil have passed over the world time and again, and with each passing age your people grew fewer and feebler until, finally, they retreated from the world. In your wake arose the proud dwarves, arrogant humans, stout halflings and so many others. Most of your kind dismisses their potential, content to sink slowly into obscurity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you see them for what they truly are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pushed into walking amongst them for reasons of your own, you have seen the myriad tragedies and impossible heights to which these successor races aspire. They are capable of dismal lows and staggering peaks, packed into lifetimes so short as to beggar the imagination. Your people may be in decline, but you walk the world with your head held high, glad to spend your race's final days in the company of those who strive beyond their limits, never giving up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps this is the end. Perhaps your people's time has come again. But if you are to leave this world, you will not go with a whisper but with a bang!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Elf is a new class for use with Dungeon World, perfect for players who like their Dungeon World with an old-school feel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
