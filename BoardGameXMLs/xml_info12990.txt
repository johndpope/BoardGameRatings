			<description>WW2 coastal warfare rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Second World War there was a trend away from engagements between conventional battle fleets. No where was this trend more evident than in the field of Coastal Warfare. Each night the stillness of the ocean dark would be shattered by the roar of engines as in every theater Patrol Boats began their deadly game of cat and mouse with their enemy counterparts and Merchant Shipping. This set of rules allows the wargamer to recreate the small scale coastal actions which brought back the swash&amp;mdash;buckling era to the seas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In common with all MOD Games Naval Warfare rules, the percentage dice system is used throughout Fast Attack. The dice &amp;mdash; one red (10's) and one white or black (Units) are always thrown in pairs (e.g. an 8 on the red dice and a 2 on the white or black dice represents a throw of 82%). All figures in the tables are basic percentage chance of hits or detection, after this has been amended by the tactical factors which may apply, the final score is arrived at. A throw of this percentage or less is sufficient.&lt;br/&gt;Figure Scale    1 model    =    1 vessel&lt;br/&gt;Time Scale    1 move    =    10 seconds&lt;br/&gt;Ground Scale    1 cm    =    20 yards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
