							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Town Center: Lower Manhattan / Paris La Cité – St. Louis</name>
									
			<description>Town Center: Lower Manhattan / Paris La Cit&amp;eacute; &amp;ndash; St. Louis is comprised of 4 double-sided player boards, with the Lower Manhattan expansion map (previously published separately as part of Town Center: Expansion n&amp;deg;2) on one side, and the Paris La Cit&amp;eacute; &amp;ndash;  St. Louis expansion map (previously published separately as part of Town Center: Expansion n&amp;deg;1) on the other. There is also an A5-sized rulesheet/cover that explains the special rules of each map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lower Manhattan map simulates the construction of the densest part of New York City, and the limited space is a challenge for even the most experienced players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paris La Cit&amp;eacute; &amp;ndash; St. Louis with its bridges and islands on the river Seine is another challenging map, where players have to carefully consider the connections between the various areas, especially in the construction phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
