			<description>Theme:&lt;br/&gt;It's 2111 and aliens have come to earth--to dominate!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play:&lt;br/&gt;On a grid, wage war with your army. There are four factions, but cooperation between them: Gaia (red) and Coeurl (green) versus Empire (yellow) and Alien (blue). Figures are stacked onto chips that reflect their level of power and life. The chips can also be spent to execute special moves--found under the figure bases. The round is basically split into 4 phases, and battles are resolved with a combination of movement (including flight), special moves, and dice rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Packaging:&lt;br/&gt;As of April 2011, four factions have been released in encounter boxes, the red/green Keruberosu Reckless Plan, and the yellow/blue Kuresento (Crescent) Ambition Platoon. Each preconstructed starter includes a team-up of two factions (4 figs), a battle mat, a rulebook, 4 castle coins, 5 gaia coins, 5 kail coins and one battle die. One encouter box has only enough material for 1 player--and the castle coins are required to play. Also available are randomized booster boxes--from which capsule vending machines are also stocked. Larger figures must be assembled, and all boosters come with an additional battle coin. All figures are pre-painted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Series 2 was released June of 2011.&lt;br/&gt;Series 3 was released August of 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
