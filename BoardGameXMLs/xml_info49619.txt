							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rise of the Dead</name>
									
			<description>From the Chaosium website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a convention scenario with highly detailed characters and handouts intended for a theatrical style presentation in a single long session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arrival&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six days ago the hammer fell. The red comet did not strike the planet, but it was a near miss. Fragments smashed into the earth bringing tidal waves, storms, and fallout. This was a rage of elemental destruction that devastated most of the planet. Millions, perhaps even billions, have died.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main mass of the comet seems to have entered regular orbit. A red eye rises at night and glares balefully through an occasional rent in the near perpetual cloud cover: a hellish new moon added to the sky. Communications are out. Who knows what is happening out there?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems like you will be on your own for some time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
