			<description>In Alle V&amp;ouml;gel sind schon da! players want to help all of the birds get to the party taking place at the birdhouse, but they need to ensure that the birds who show up have at least one present with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up, players lay out the bird house tile, then surround it with the double-sided bird cards, with the bird side of each card being face up. Shuffle the peephole cards, then set them as a deck to the side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player sees the color of a bird or a gift peeking through the peephole on the topmost card, then chooses one of the bird cards and turns it over, announcing what's on the other side. If this matches the peephole card, then the player reverses the bird card and the next player takes a turn; if not, that bird card is removed from the game, then the player reveals one bird card after another until finding a match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If all the peephole cards have been removed and at least one bird card is still on the table, then the players win and the birds get to go enjoy themselves at the party. If not, then the birds get to peck the players on the head in frustration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
