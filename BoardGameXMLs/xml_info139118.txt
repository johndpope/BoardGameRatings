			<description>From the back cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TENRA BANSHO ZERO: TALES OF HEAVEN AND EARTH&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Hour of the Ox, a shinobi clan attacked a village under the protection of your regent.

The magical red soulgems implanted all over his body allow him to gain incredible muscle, speed and clarity in battle.&lt;br/&gt;     Princess Rasen the armour-rider, the thirteen-year-old daughter of the regent. She pilots Red Hare, a 3-meter-tall mecha killing machine fueled by her innocence.&lt;br/&gt;     Sha-Lazt the Broken Cloud, a persecuted Phoenix Order monk of the indigenous spiritual oni race, whose hands are the ultimate tools of both healing and destruction.&lt;br/&gt;     Emerald Light, a geisha of high breeding and talent, who can enter the dreams of others. Her secret: She is actually a kugutsu mannequin, a doll carved from a sacred tree and given life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tenra Bansho Zero is a story-focused role-playing game of epic drama and insane action, set in the world of Tenra: A rich world of high magic and technology, of the ancient side by side with the futuristic.
