			<description>PRO-GRIDIRON is played by two opponents on a rectangular field (board) consisting of sixty-four rectangular, half light color and half dark color.  Each opponent has a team consisting of sixteen pieces.  All the pieces of this game have their own  value and power relative to the HEAD COACH.  With his authority and strategy, the HEAD COACH&amp;rsquo;S  ultimate desire is to beat the opponent&amp;rsquo;s HEAD COACH.   When a piece can force the HEAD COACH to move, this is called a Down.  If he stops the HEAD COACH&amp;rsquo;S movement,  this is a Touchdown.  The first team to get a Touchdown, therefore, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
