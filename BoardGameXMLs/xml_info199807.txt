			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the heroes travel through the Outlands, they come upon a small village, which seems to be in the midst of serious construction. They soon learn that a band of Accursed recently visited the town, and demanded that the refugees who settle it leave. As it turns out, those Accursed dwelt here, long before the Bane War began. Needless to say, they're unhappy about the refugees stealing their homes and land. The Witchmarked heroes must decide which party is in the right, and try to resolve their conflict, lest blood be shed between those who still oppose the Witches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Quiet Life is a 1-Sheet style scenario that focuses on the adventures of a band of Witchmarked heroes in the Accursed game setting. The adventure may be played as a standalone, or it may be used with the Plot Point Campaign included in Accursed. The adventure features brief scene descriptionss, with necessary game mechanics and opportunity for tasks that can be resolved in a variety of ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
