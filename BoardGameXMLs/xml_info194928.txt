			<description>Side-Swap is an abstract strategy game with similarities to Checkers. The pieces start on squares of the opposite color and have to cross the board to their home area on the other side, at which time they can move onto squares of their own color; after they do this they cannot move again. All pieces can be jumped and jumps can be chained. Opposing pieces can only be captured once they have moved onto their color spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played by two players, four players in partnerships, or four players individually. When playing with four the pieces are turned over to show numbers; pieces must end up on the spaces with matching numbers. The four-individuals game has a few extra rules about when pieces of the same color may be captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
