							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Swing Reality Guide</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Swing, is based on the Thelemic principles of WILL and Love. One of the central groups is in fact the OTO. The Magick system is based off of Aleister Crowley's vision of Magick (Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will). The Swing deals with Thelemic principles, as well as, other pagan cultures and as such the Magick system incorporates ideas and principles from other &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; Magickal systems (such as Wicca, Voodoo, Alchemy and more).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Swing is as detailed as possible in all aspects, characters, combat and Magick. By using The Step System, The Swing offers a highly realistic system without adding a lot of number crunching. Character creation is about defining well rounded believable characters. Combat is deadly, scary and dangerous. The Magick system is freeform and encourages the players to use out of game information. There is simple and easy to follow rules for bringing real world information into The Swing for use as player characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic premise is that Reality is like the swing of a pendulum. Sometimes it swings in one direction; sometimes it swings in the opposite direction. Sometimes reality is dragons and faeries, sometimes it lasers and computers. The Swing is about making your game into what you want it to be. The Swing is designed around the thought that a person&amp;rsquo;s WILL can shape reality. A character&amp;rsquo;s WILL can shape the game, the world and all those within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game will not be about how many creatures you can kill, it&amp;rsquo;s about exploring the interaction between the WILL and reality. The goal of all games is the have fun. Now you can anyway you choose to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
