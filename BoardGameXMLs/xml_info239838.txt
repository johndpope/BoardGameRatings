							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Echo Harbour (System Neutral Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the protection of the dragon turtle, Bonesong, Echo Harbour has flourished. The port teems with people: sailors dock their ships at the harbour and load them with supplies and trade goods, merchants haggle with merfolk on the foreshore and men in market stalls, workers toil in the busy shipyards and travellers crowd the taverns, making boasts and bets as they play games to pass the time. Over the bustle and chatter sound the shouts and songs of the orcs as they direct ships and caravans to their proper places. Recently though, Bonesong vanished. Echo Harbour has prospered under her protection, but it remains to be seen if the village has the strength to stand on its own. Only time will tell if their guardian will return or if the villagers must find another way to safeguard their future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
