			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I, Messenger Bernard of Shay, do hereby deliver you to the city of Asylum as its newest citizen. Here you shall abide by the One Rule: you shall reside until such time as you die of natural or malicious causes, vow bondage to any military of the Kingdoms, or obtain your freedom within the Contest. Failure to comply with either outcomes and attempt escape from Asylum will result in your immediate execution without trial.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;As a citizen of Asylum, you hereby understand this island is immune from the Word of the Edict and is therefore not subject to enforcement, other than enforcement of the One Rule, or punishment save for those enacted by the citizens of Asylum. As a citizen of Asylum, you have the right to challenge other citizens for the Contest and only citizens of Asylum. Effectively immediately, you are listed as deceased within your birth home...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
