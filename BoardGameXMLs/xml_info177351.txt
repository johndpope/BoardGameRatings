							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">FLIP MMCG</name>
									
			<description>Straight from minimalist Japan, FLIP MMCG is the ultimate resolution system. Flipping a coin... without the coin. Rock, paper, scissors... without the scissors. FLIP MMCG is a drawless system with immediate results. No table space required, plays completely in your hand. It also is a massive multiplayer card game, that only takes 1 minute. Awesome ice breaker at conventions, classrooms, parties, game nights, road trips, and picnics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FLIP MMCG is a quick and simple competitive game for 2 or more players, by Charles Ward. The goal of the game is to gain as many FLIP cards as possible or be the last player in the game. Ignoring turn order, 2 players face off against each other. One player holds out a card, the other flips it over. The person on the blue side of the card wins, and takes a card from the loser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
