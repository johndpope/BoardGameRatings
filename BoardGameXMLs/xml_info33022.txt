			<description>From Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players navigate the campgrounds by rolling dice and directing their plastic motorboat pieces. Identification squares prompt players to collect camp supply cards, collect money from the bank, select a &amp;ldquo;Bear Claw&amp;rdquo; or to pay for a misfortunate roll of the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first player to collect and present camp supplies from A to Z and make it to the finish square. A skilled and somewhat lucky player may collect the necessary camp supplies in one campground alone and head for the finish on &amp;ldquo;Home Stretch Road.&amp;rdquo; Too many mishaps and you may be forced to return to the campground you started in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
