							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Experimental Technical Readout: The Clans</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the Cutting Edge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fires of the Jihad have savaged the collective military-industrial complexes of the Inner Sphere, touching even the occupation zones claimed by the heirs of Kerensky. Almost simultaneously, chaos has erupted at home, a conflagration that has ultimately cut the invaders off from their distant homelands. Severed from their roots, and stranded among the hordes of &amp;ldquo;barbarian&amp;rdquo; Houses, the Clans must push their technological capabilities to their limit and evolve&amp;mdash;or perish with the weak as war rages on across the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental Technical Readout: Clans samples a number of new designs being produced by the various Clan powers who now call the Inner Sphere home. Infusing a new wave of advanced Clan technology into the older models at their disposal, most of the designs featured in this book incorporate a mix of modern technologies and design standards the likes of which the Inner Sphere has yet to face in open battle. Statistics and Record Sheets are included for 13 new experimental BattleMechs, ProtoMechs, vehicles, aerospace fighters, and battle armor are presented in this book, ready for play in advanced BattleTech games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
