			<description>A party game for literate degenerates. Mash up epic quotes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EndQuotes lets you mash up hundreds of unforgettable lines from movies, tv, songs, books, and more! It consists of two decks of cards: one with quotes with their endings missing, and one with those endings. Each round, the active player draws a quote card, then the other players each secretly choose an ending card in their hand to end that quote with and plays it face-down on the table. The active player then reveals these cards and chooses the ending card that, in his opinion, is the best ending for the quote. The winning player gets the quote card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has won a pre-determined number of quote cards, that player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
