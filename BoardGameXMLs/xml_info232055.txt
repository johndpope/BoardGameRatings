			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four years ago, Captain Talis was demoted and exiled from the city of Florin. His behavior as a soldier had grown more and more deplorable and Talis&amp;rsquo; commanders had had enough. Rather than tuck his tail and run, Captain Talis disappeared into the wild and trained a half-dozen or so orcs to fight. For months, they terrorized the countryside, until a group of brave adventurers dispatched Talis and all but two of the orcs &amp;mdash; Gog and Magog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fleeing from the heroes, the pair found respite in an underground warren where monks had buried sacred dead over 400 years ago. Once inside, the orcs uncovered a partially-opened tomb and upon entering, triggered the wrath of an ancient spirit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small town &amp;mdash; Quay &amp;mdash; had grown over the warren since then, and no one living there knew anything about the burial chambers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
