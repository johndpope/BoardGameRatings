			<description>&amp;quot;MY KRIEG IS MORE TOTALER THAN YOUR KRIEG.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seventies wasn't just free sex and scary looking trousers. It meant blowing things up in the name of a better, brave future. Try fighting the power - German style. An exiting, almost historical, card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;R.A.F is a revolutionary card game that takes you back to the explosive German seventies.&lt;br/&gt;Try your skills at running a terrorist group, known in German as a &amp;ldquo;Liga&amp;rdquo;. The success of your Liga is of course measured by how much publicity it gets, because as we all know: nothing has truly happened unless it happens on TV. Therefore, to win R.A.F you must collect the most Media Points. How much riot can you run before the government close you down. Teutonic Style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
