							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Net the Fox</name>
									
			<description>A game of skill and chance for two!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FROM THE GAME BOX:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECT OF THE GAME: For the hunter to capture the fox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PIECES NEEDED TO PLAY : Two different colored pegs and 1 pair of dice.  The Fox makes the first move.  Both he and the Hunter can only move along the lines.  Both Fox and Hunter alternate turns moving only one space at a time.  The Hunter tries to force the Fox into a position where the Hunter's next move would be into the same hole the Fox is in.  When the Hunter reaches this position he rolls the dice.  If he rolls an even number, he has netted the Fox.  If he rolls an odd number the Fox may take two moves and thus gets away.  The game continues until the Hunter again corners the Fox.  At this time the Hunter again rolls the dice.  If an even number is rolled the Hunter wins, but if an odd number is rolled the Fox has eluded the Hunter for the second time, and the Fox is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
