							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fool on the Hill</name>
									
			<description>From the Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fool on the Hill is geared towards being played in a forum, ideally for 2-5 players. There are expanded rules for playing with more than 5 people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a GM-less game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is mostly narrative, with a standard deck of 52 cards to be used as randomizers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is about the Fool on the Hill waiting through the night, until the dawn comes.  One player is the Fool, the rest of the players are the 1000 Voices the Fool hears.  Each round consists of the Fool narrating what the Fool sees or does during that hour, then randomly choosing a new Voice to be the Fool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lasts twelve full rounds, with a final partial round where the dawn is narrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
