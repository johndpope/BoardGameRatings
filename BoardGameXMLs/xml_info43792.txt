			<description>SNAPPY NAPPY by Russ Lockwood: Simple, subtle &amp;amp; ultrafast Napoleonic Rules for 2 to 20 players. Simple, yet subtle, rules for multi-corps actions. Step by step introduction for those new to Napoleonic wargaming. Morale based (no figure removal) for fog of war. 1 vol, 60 pgs. 2009 HOPEWELL, OMM PUBLISHING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SNAPPY NAPPY is designed for running any Napoleonic campaign in one to two days. The author has successfully hosted and executed the 1809 campaign in Germany (1 day), the Invasion of Russia in 1812 (2 days), and the Leipzig campaign in 1813 (2 says) with 8-12 players. Unit size is described as division level, but it is flexible enough to represent regiments for a set piece battle as well. For example, the battle of Raab (1809) could be done as a 2 player division-level game in about 60-90 minutes, or as a 4-6 player regimental game in about 2 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
