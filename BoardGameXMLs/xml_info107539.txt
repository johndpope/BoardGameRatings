			<description>from the Mystic Quests website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three thousand years in the future humans descended on the planet Sarax. Over the next fifty years they created technologically advanced cities that were not just cities but beautiful works of art in themselves. Then the creatures came; Goblins, Orcs, Elves and things far worse. Now after untold horrors, disasters, sacrifices and isolation humanity has reverted back to a medieval state desperately fighting to stay alive...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as adventurers questing to save the world of Sarax from destruction. This game requires one or more players also unlike many other role playing games it requires no gamesmaster or minatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;designer comment&lt;br/&gt;The Mystic Quests Core Rulebook contains everything you need to start playing Mystic Quests, including the adventurer sheet and puzzle grids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
