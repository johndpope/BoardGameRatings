			<description>From the PDF (edited):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The assembled alien races of the Galactic Union have reached a political crisis moment. If no&lt;br/&gt;agreement can be reached in the next Earth hour, an intergalactic war appears inevitable...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a matter of tradition, you, diplomats of the Interstellar Union, will meet on one of the planets&lt;br/&gt;that will be annihilated in the path of devastation. This ensures that you will see the life that will&lt;br/&gt;die if you fail to negotiate a peaceful accord. For this meeting, you have come to a planet called&lt;br/&gt;Earth and you have taken on the guise of the native semi&amp;shy;sentients. You each appear as human&lt;br/&gt;to the local lifeforms and to each other, to avoid panicking the natives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As is traditional, if they fail to broker a peace, then you will be left on Earth when it is destroyed...Can&lt;br/&gt;you use that authority to prevent a galaxy wide war?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game about negotiation between alien races. It can be played as a tabletop game, but&lt;br/&gt;you might get more fun out of making it into a larp or semi&amp;shy;larp. You can get up and act out your&lt;br/&gt;diplomat&amp;rsquo;s actions, but you can also narrate behavior that is difficult to larp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
