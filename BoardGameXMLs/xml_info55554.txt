			<description>[Back cover]&lt;br/&gt;Take another bite!&lt;br/&gt;We're back with the second edition of the Deadlands: Epitaph (tm) and we've got even more twisted treats from the Weird and Wasted West for you this time around!&lt;br/&gt;This issue features a full-color comic that picks up where last issue's fiction, Story's End, left off.  In Hell Hole, you'll get a glimpse of why you never pin your hopes on a Junker!&lt;br/&gt;You'll also find a new fiction piece, A Little Knowledge..., in which Ronan Lynch learns why folks claim it's such a dangerous thing.&lt;br/&gt;We've also got a number of first of soon-to-be regular features, including Varmints!, The Armory, According to Hoyle, and more!  Each contains material suitable for the Weird West, the Wasted West, or both.  Look for more installments of these in future issues.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, no issue of the Epitaph would be complete without at least one adventure to torment your posses with, and this one is no exception!  Jay &amp;quot;Wasteland Warlord&amp;quot; Kyle brings us Biodome 2 - and it's no laughing matter for anyone involved!&lt;br/&gt;So Saddle up your horse or hoverbike and head on in for some of the wildest fun west of the Pecos!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
