			<description>With these cards you can play in many ways:&lt;br/&gt;1. A card is set aside, such as the rear half of the bulldog, shares and plays according to the known rules of &amp;quot;Black Peter&amp;quot;. Matching front and rear halves can be stored. Whoever keeps the head of the bulldog as the last card, gets the name of the animal.&lt;br/&gt;2. Players are dealt with the cards that are placed face up on the table. The player sitting to the left of the dealer may now begin to trade. He asks a player who has an animal half that he wants to own, whether he gives it to him, and which card he wants instead of him. The interviewee is now allowed to trade with another player. If someone does not want to trade anymore, because he can not get anything suitable, his left neighbor can continue. It is exchanged until nobody wants to exchange more. The aim of the game is not to collect the animal halves, but to invent as fantastic as possible new species of animals. At the end it will be decided who has put together the most beautiful animal and which name it should receive.&lt;br/&gt;3. Of course, you can also set up new adventurous species on your own. Bull Medar and Naspferd, Papafant and Warzengei, Antibarsch and Nilguruh, and many others. By the way, 484 different animal combinations are possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
