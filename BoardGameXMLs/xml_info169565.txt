							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Domino Discovery Fractions</name>
									
			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Domino Discovery is an exciting matching game that reinforces basic learning skills and provides hours of fun.  It is an easy and creative way to involve children in learning activities.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Domino Discovery Fractions is an educational take on Dominoes, with the added element of requiring players to recognize and match equivalent fractions as well as fractions expressed as numbers and as pictures.  From a total of 40 dominoes, each player is dealt five and one starting domino is placed on the table.  In turn, each player must find a domino with a fraction that matches one end of a domino already in play, and play their domino against that one.  If they have not matches, they must draw from the draw pile until they can play a domino.  Play ends when one player successfully plays all their dominoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to play successfully, players must use their knowledge of equivalent fractions (such as 1/2 = 2/4) as well as understanding visual representations of fractions (such as knowing that a picture of a circle with one of three pieces colored in is equal to 1/3).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
