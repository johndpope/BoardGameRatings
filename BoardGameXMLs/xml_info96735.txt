			<description>The Darkness II takes place two years later in the life of Jackie Estacado, the wielder of the darkness, who is now the Don of the Franchetti crime family. He has been unable to shake the thoughts of his dead girlfriend Jenny since he contained his supernatural powers and now the Darkness wants out. A sudden, unprovoked attack on Jackie&amp;rsquo;s life heralds the start of a full-scale mob war, which has clearly been orchestrated by some outside force. The attempt reawakens the Darkness, sending Jackie on a trip to hell and back as he discovers the mystery of the attack and motivations of the Darkness itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Darkness 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Darkness II is the sequel to the critically acclaimed 2007 release The Darkness. Inspired by the popular comic book series produced by Top Cow Productions, Inc., The Darkness II is an intense first person shooter that puts you in the role of Jackie Estacado, don of a New York crime family and wielder of an ancient force of chaos known as The Darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's been two years since Jackie used his power to kill the men responsible for his girlfriend's murder. He's been unable to shake the memory of Jenny's death since bottling up The Darkness and now it wants out. A botched attempt on Jackie's life opens the door for The Darkness to reemerge, and sets Jackie on a brutal and personal journey as he unravels the mystery behind the attack and the motives of The Darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
