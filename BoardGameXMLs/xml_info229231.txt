			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Airborne Troops: Countdown to D-Day is a game about an American paratrooper who got separated from his unit in the chaos of the nighttime air drop over France during the D-Day operation. Since things have not been proceeding as expected, you will have to take up tasks designed for a larger body of men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a third-person shooter which requires an extensive use of stealth. Released on the PS2 and the PC, this was designed as a budget title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
