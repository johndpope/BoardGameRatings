			<description>This game is dedicated to the Tour of Flanders, one of the five one-day races known as cycling 'monuments'.&lt;br/&gt;It's a dice game for up to 4 players with a twist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The result of the die throw is read on the decagonal table at the center of the board. For certain throws players must advance not only their rider but another rider as well. There they have to decide if helping a rider ahead (and risking not seeing him again until the finish line) or a rider behind (and putting him back in the fight).&lt;br/&gt;The board is divided in 8 sections, corresponding each to a well known section of the actual race (the short sharp climbs which have made this race famous) and some road crossings which may cause falls.&lt;br/&gt;The player who crosses the finish line first with his rider wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a large (70 x 50 cm) plastic board that is rolled inside a carboard tube.&lt;br/&gt;Apart from the board the tube contains 4 small plastic riders, a D10 die and the rules in 4 languages (Dutch, French, English and German).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
