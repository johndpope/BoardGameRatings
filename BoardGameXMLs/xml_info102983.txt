			<description>User Summary w/ Publisher Information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Produced by BOA Publishing, this unofficial expansion of the Ambush! family of games requires both Ambush! &amp;amp; a map from Ambush! Purple Heart to play. This stand-alone mission is the third installment of a planned 4 part series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toll Bridge is an airborne mission. Your squad has been handpicked for a night drop into a lightly guarded area containing three bridges.&amp;nbsp;You must secure at least one bridge, all three if possible, and hold until dawn when reinforcements supported by tanks will cross. The bridge garrison is small and reported to be staffed by old men and boys. As long as surprise is on your side your men shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have a problem...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may take your Medic (from Follow Me! - Mission #2) along for the ride. You also receive two Engineers to help with any explosives placed to blow the bridges. You'll even get some heavy weapons to aid you along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to Ambush!, this mission requires half map B from the Ambush! Purple Heart module&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mission includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;- 4 new vehicle summary cards&lt;br/&gt;- 21 new soldier cards printed on hard card stock (these must be cut out)&lt;br/&gt;- 10 pages of new paragraphs&lt;br/&gt;- 2 mission cartridges with 3 conditions&lt;br/&gt;- 6 page mission summary with several special rules&lt;br/&gt;- 1 wooden building overlay counter printed on hard card stock to be placed on the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mission is the most complex of the series to date and it was designed so that it could be enjoyably replayed many times. There are several small events that probably won't occur on every playing and some activations create random placements of enemy forces on the map. (In this way no replay of the mission should be exactly the same and your forces won&amp;rsquo;t be able to set up ambushes for the Germans as you replay the scenario.) There are even a number of optional objectives that can be achieved in various ways.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
