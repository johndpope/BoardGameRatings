			<description>from the PDF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the Starflight Role-Playing Game (SFRPG) First Edition Core Rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starflight is an RPG-style adventure game created by the folks at Binary Systems back in the &amp;lsquo;80s. It has developed a large following throughout the years from all types of gamers. In Starflight (SF1), the player takes on the role of the captain of a starship for a corporation known as Interstel, and must save their home planet (called Arth) from a number of catastrophes. In the original game, this involved neutralizing the Crystal Planet, whose destructive effects made stars undergo catastrophic &amp;ldquo;flares&amp;rdquo;. In the sequel game, Starflight 2: Trade Routes of the Cloud Nebula (SF2), the object was to&lt;br/&gt;secure the source of the alternative FTL fuel known as hyneum, giving Arth a chance to repel an imminent invasion by the&lt;br/&gt;Spemin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book you're holding in your hands now is a pencil-and-paper (PNP) role-playing game adaptation of these original&lt;br/&gt;games. These rules have been designed to be as flexible as possible, so that players of SFRPG may be as detailed or as&lt;br/&gt;carefree as they'd like to be while playing the game. They've also been designed such that players may play a game very&lt;br/&gt;similar to the original games, or have a much different type of adventure within the Starflight Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the Starflight Role-Playing Game, you&amp;rsquo;ll need the following equipment:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; At least two ten-sided dice (2d10) for each player. One of these should show multiples of 10 (a d10x10). If one is&lt;br/&gt;not available, the dice should be distinguishable from one another, with one of them designated as the &amp;ldquo;d10x10&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Pencil and paper. Pencil is preferable to pen, as it can be erased more easily.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Some kind of screen for the &amp;ldquo;gamemaster&amp;rdquo; (GM), in order to conceal their rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Access to at least one copy of these rules.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; While not strictly necessary, some GMs may prefer to have a calculator handy in order to help with more&lt;br/&gt;complex calculations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
