							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">HeroQuest: Dungeons of Peril (fan expansion for HeroQuest)</name>
									
			<description>Designer's Note: This is not a professionally published game; it is a series of homemade expansions for Hero quest. I have been selling the games for 2 1/2 years, and have sold well over 600 expansions. So I believe there is justification for presenting them in this forum.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeons of Peril is the collective name for my first four expansions for Hero Quest, a fantasy board game published by Games Workshop in conjunction with Milton Bradley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 4 expansions are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Heroes of the Empire - Play one of 16 new Heroes - Cleric, Warrior-Monk, Mystic, Shapeshifter, Paladin, Halfling Thief, Alchemist, Wood Elf Mage, Vampire Hunter, Rogue, Elf Archer, Weaponmaster, Imperial Ogre, Troll Wizard, Dwarf Ranger, and Shadow Walker. This set includes 16 full-color Hero cards; 24 cards with new spells, equipment, etc. for these Heroes; a reference sheet with new Potions and Items; and a 4-page rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Endless Dungeons - Create a virtually endless number of dungeons with this set. It includes 32 different full-color dungeon tiles, a 10-page rulebook detailing the Special Tiles (with new traps, monsters, etc.), and a double-sided reference sheet. There are 16 standard tiles (4 of each of the following types: Corridor, Small Room, Medium Room, and Large Room), 2 Stairs tiles, and 14 Special Tiles. Use the tiles to create pre-generated dungeons, or create random ones in just a few minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Servants of Darkness - This is a set of full-color 3-D stand-ups to use instead of miniatures. The set includes 128 stand-ups - 19 different Heroes, 8 Mercenaries, and 64 different monsters (there are multiple stand-ups for the mercenaries and some monsters). The stand- ups are (roughly) to scale and vary in size, from the standard human size to the very large Dragon and Rock Giant. Also included is a 14-page rulebook for using ALL of the monsters in Heroquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) Perilous Quests &amp;ndash; This expansion provides instructions on how to create and populate an entire dungeon. The rules walk you through how to create the dungeon and how to fill it with monsters, traps, dungeon features (like a Magic Mirror or strange Mould), and special rooms. This is done using two new types of cards (Encounter and Search). You can create an entire dungeon in just a few minutes. The rules are designed to allow as much flexibility as desired when creating a dungeon. The rules can be used for pre-generated quests, but they also allow you to play without a game master and are ideally suited for SOLO play! Finally, the Dungeon Bash rules allow parties of Heroes to go head-to-head!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perilous Quests includes the following: 20 new Artifact cards, 16 Search cards, 8 Encounter cards, 4 Lich spells, 8 new Chaos spells, 8 Chaos monster cards (4 Sorcerers and 4 Chaos Spawn), 8 Elemental monster cards, and a sheet of dungeon counters (representing various special features).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    HeroQuest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
