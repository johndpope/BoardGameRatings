							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Vagrant: Optional Character Class</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vagrants are not technically thieves although often they do have some thieving abilities that they have picked up living on the streets of large cities.  What they do possess is an unnatural ability to stay alive.  Whether it be thru trickery, gambling, outright stealing, and on occasion murder.  They always manage to make their way in the world.  More often than not Vagrants are neutral or evil aligned.  Rarely will you find a good aligned vagrant who is just down on his luck.  As far as Weapons &amp;amp; Armour go, Vagrants will only have what they manage to scrape together from various sources: looting dead bodies, stealing from smiths.  Vagrants start with little to no GP's as starting wealth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
