							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tiamat&#039;s Wrath: The Sapphire Meteor</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aeldur looks to the dark, ominous clouds above him. He can smell the sulfur in the air, hear the crackle of lightning and feel the ground begin to shake below him. He stares out into the distance, looking over his vast empire. The tall, slender Elven God-King looks down from the top of the tallest tower in all the world, at the sprawling city before him. His thoughts wander to those of his citizens that he has used as slaves to make his empire even greater. The might had consumed him, he turned his back on Her, proclaiming himself as a God.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
