							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Canadian Trivia Family Edition</name>
									
			<description>Simple, well-made trivia game for 'Canadian' families.  No random die-rolling, just answer the trivia questions and progress across the game board on your choice of routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to be the first player to make a round trip on his/her route across Canada. Players who correctly answer questions in categories including General, Geography, History, and Arts for the 'Expert' players, move forward from city to city, across the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Family Edition cards have two sides - one with easier questions and the other with more difficult questions, allowing families of all ages to play together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes 1,440 expert level questions in four categories (geography, history, arts, general) and 1,080 junior level questions in three categories (geography, history, general).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
