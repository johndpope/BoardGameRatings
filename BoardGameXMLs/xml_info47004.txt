							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Craft Fair Game</name>
									
			<description>This roll &amp;amp; move game is another Monopoly clone with some notable differences.  The &amp;quot;color groups&amp;quot; represent different craft fairs held throughout the year and the &amp;quot;properties&amp;quot; are different days of each fair.  Instead of &amp;quot;houses&amp;quot;, player may buy booths to open on different days of the fairs.  Different players may have different booths on the same day space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Booths and mortgages are marked on the board with durable, vinyl, reusable stickers (like Colorforms toys) and the player pawns look like little old craft fair vendors (both male and female).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TWELVE CRAFT FAIRS surround the game board.  CRAFT BOOTHS are in each fair.  Players (VENDORS) shake the dice and move around the board, trying to buy the fairs and booths that each one thinks will help him/her win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colorful VINYL MARKERS are used to show the ownership of the fairs and booths.  Each player has a different color which matches his/her playing piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROFIT or LOSS CARDS contain over 100 DIFFERENT CRAFT ITEMS and designate whether the player &amp;quot;COLLECTS&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;PAYS OUT&amp;quot;, OR &amp;quot;BREAKS EVEN&amp;quot; on the business transactions in the booths.  These cards also bring about INTERACTION AMONG THE PLAYERS which adds to the fun of the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
