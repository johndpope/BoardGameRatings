							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bluff</name>
									
			<description>Card game with a lot of bluffing involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules (as written on the back of the box)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is, by bluffing, to be the first player to dispose of all his cards.&lt;br/&gt;The cards are shuffled and dealt to all the players. The player to the left of the dealer begins by placing one card face down onto the centre of the table and names its picture, for example saying &amp;quot;flower&amp;quot;. The next player puts a card on top of it also saying &amp;quot;flower&amp;quot;, this is when the bluffing comes in. Each player in his turn has to claim to lay the same picture as that which was started with whether he has one or not. Play continues in this way until the call comes back to the player who started the round. He calls again the name of the picture he started with and lays a card. This is the end of that round. The next player starts a new round by placing a card on top of the cards already on the table (if any) and names the same or a different picture.&lt;br/&gt;Any time a player thinks another player is bluffing he may challenge him. If he is in fact bluffing and has not laid the card he said, he has to pick up all the cards on the table and add them to his hand. If he was not bluffing the challenger has to pick up all the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
