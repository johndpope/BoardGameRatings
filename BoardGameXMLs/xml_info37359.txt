							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Blue and the Grey:  Grand Tactical Rules for the American Civil War</name>
									
			<description>As the game title would indicate, these are miniatures rules for fighting large scale American Civil War battles.  One infantry stand is made up of four figures and each figure is 100 men.  The basic element is a brigade, which is typically four-five stands.  The ground scale is 100 yards for 15mm or smaller; for 25-30 mm figures, all distances should be doubled.  The time scale is 1 turn = 20 minutes, which is fairly short for a grand tactical set of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game turn sequence is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Activation (each division or cavalry brigade rolls a die to determine if they can move effectively that turn)&lt;br/&gt;2. First Move Determination&lt;br/&gt;3. Combat Phase One (first mover moves and fires)&lt;br/&gt;4. Morale Phase One (first mover)&lt;br/&gt;5. Combat Phase One (2nd mover moves and fires)&lt;br/&gt;6. Morale Phase Two (2nd mover)&lt;br/&gt;7. March Phase (both sides make march moves)&lt;br/&gt;8. Rally Phase (routing/retreating units may attempt rallies)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes orders of battles (but not maps or scenario rules) for:  First Bull Run, Shiloh, Gettysburg, and Chickamauga.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
