							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Narn Regime Fact Book</name>
									
			<description>From Publishers Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having fought for their freedom twice under Centauri occupation, the Narn are a proud race with a long history. Fiercely loyal to one another and a terror to their enemies, the Narn Regime now expands throughout the galaxy and they are to be considered one of the major races, despite their relative infancy. The Narn Regime Fact Book is the definitive resource for this race, drawing upon every official source for Babylon 5. Players and Games Masters alike will find many new options for Narn characters and scenarios, from a detailed history of the race to equipment, prestige classes and the starships of their mighty fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Narn Regime Fact Book is a 200 page, full colour hardback, marking the commitment Mongoose Publishing has towards supporting the Babylon 5 roleplaying game with an exciting range of products that compliment the original television series. This sourcebook has information that many fans will consider vital to their understanding of the Babylon 5 universe and is readily slotted into any game using the main rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
