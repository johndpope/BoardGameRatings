							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mansion</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 32 x 30 inch Battlemap of the ground floor of a Mansion, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Welcome to the dining room. If this is being read by my butler, Mr. Hofmann, I am dead. All of you have been allocated some of my possessions in my last will and testament. Mr. Hofmann will take you to a private room to discuss each of your shares following dinner and desert. The numerical order and in which room you will consult with my lawyer, Mr. Jaeger, will be revealed in a sealed letter that you will receive after the conclusion of desert. &amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;The Will of Heimbach Reinaart the III&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mansion is a single level exterior and interior map of the ground floor of a mansion with eight main rooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mansion is intended for use in modern games, mystery games, and horror games. The era of the map is 18th century to present. Highest technology on the map is a stove and lamps. Note that for early to mid 18th century this could be gaslight lamps and a gas stove. As the owner of the mansion is rich, these could also be prototypes bought before their mass-production later in the century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reinaart&amp;rsquo;s Will: After a lavish dinner and decadent desert, Mr. Hofmann delivers a wax sealed letter to each heir (which includes NPCs and the group). The letter has a numerical value written on it for the order of the meeting and the room where the meeting with Mr. Jaeger takes place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Hofmann takes the first heir to the first room as per the instructions in the letter. He tells the other heirs that they can choose to remain here or wander about the mansion except in the first room revealed in the letter but must return to the dining room in one hour. They find the second floor stairs blocked off, entrances and exits locked, and windows boarded up seemingly during their meal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After an hour, Mr. Hofmann returns without the first heir and asks the second heir to go with him to the next room revealed in the second letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the rest of the heirs look around the house again, they find the first room locked. If they pick the lock to get inside, they find&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
