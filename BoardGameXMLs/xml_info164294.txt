							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reflekt</name>
									
			<description>The new addictive puzzle game that will keep you playing for hours.&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy its relaxing music and great graphics during dozens of levels, while you challenge your symmetry skills finding reflections as fast as you can.&lt;br/&gt;How does it work? Easy!!&amp;hellip; just move pieces in the upper part so they match their reflection in the lower part. Once you get a match both pieces will be destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;Matching more than one piece in the same move will give you extra points. But wrong moves will penalize you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose between different gaming modes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;★Color Mode: match the color pieces to their reflections &amp;amp; advance through levels. Be alert not to run out of moves or time.&lt;br/&gt;    ★B&amp;amp;W Mode: colorless pieces will make finding reflections more difficult. Time will run out very quickly&amp;hellip; be fast!&lt;br/&gt;    ★Chill Out: no time, no pressure,&amp;hellip; just destroy as many pieces as you want and relax!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.glacialbits.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.glacialbits.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
