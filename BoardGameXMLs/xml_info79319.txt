			<description>&amp;quot;Sink or Swim is a video game that was released in 1993 for the PC under the DOS environment. Developed by Zeppelin Games Limited, it was an action/puzzle game very similar in style to Lemmings. Versions also made their way onto the Amiga and the SNES. The Mega Drive/Genesis version is known as S.S. Lucifer: Man Overboard. The game is notable for being the first demo disk attached to PC Gamer magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play Kevin Codner, our aquatic hero. You hear that the SS Lucifer has suffered some sort of mishap (the exact nature of the incident is not made clear in the game. Somehow the captain is shown pulling the plug from his bath, and a fountain of water shoots up and starts flooding the ship.). Kevin gets into a yellow submarine and begin saving the passengers.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sink or Swim (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
