			<description>Oh dear, Mr. Klecks the artist has stumbled and all of his colors have fallen onto the floor. Who can help him sort the colors correctly onto his palette? The person to find all the colors and then shout out &amp;ldquo;Klecksolino!&amp;rdquo; is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh dear, Mr. Klecks the artist has stumbled and all of his paints have fallen onto the floor. Who can help him sort the colored paints correctly onto the palettes? It&amp;rsquo;s not really all that difficult: first the lighter colors, yellow and orange, then red and of course, blue and green &amp;ndash; look carefully at your palette. Now you&amp;rsquo;ve just got to find the right colors, which are lying around all mixed up, and you are only allowed to turn over one colored tile at a time. Can you remember which tile lies where? Watch very carefully which colors the other players have turned over and then you should be alright. Have you found all of the colors and sorted them correctly onto the palette? Quickly shout out &amp;ldquo;Klecksolino&amp;rdquo; and then you&amp;rsquo;ve won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
