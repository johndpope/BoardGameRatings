							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">In Beds of Clay Wake Worlds Within</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dank temple. Cut into a deep-lying clay deposit, its vast umber vaults are richly sculpted with the imageries of myriad dreamt worlds. But the dreams awake and the effigies take their makers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Condensed to one page for slipping in among other materials, this sandbox-oriented content is intended as an easily absorbed framework for improvisation to be adapted by the user as preferred for a wider setting and specific system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It presents core ideas and key numbers to fall back on, with general approaches that can be applied in other situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The content covers map generation on the fly for an abstracted temple as well as suggestions for aspects of the locality, including sculptors, caverns, scaffolding, mould and the nature of dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sculptures could be detailed using Elaboration: Structure &amp; Surface, while the more isolated spaces might be developed using Narrative: Abandoned Space and the tunnels in particular simplified or extended using one or more the maps in the Location, Landscape &amp;amp; World bundle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
