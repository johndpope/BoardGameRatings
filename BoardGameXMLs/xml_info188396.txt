							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MRPS: Milieu Role Playing System</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MRPS: Milieu Role Playing System is a light-weight and generic, universal role-playing system.  It is adaptable to any genre.  Characters have Attributes (for example, Strength and Dexterity) and Skills.  Skills are divided into Combat and Non-Combat Skills, the only mechanical difference being that Non-Combat Skills are capped at Level +15 proficiency.  A Skill Level of 5 is considered &amp;quot;Qualified&amp;quot; while 8 is considered &amp;quot;Expert&amp;quot;.  When Skills are used the player rolls 1D20 and adds either their Attribute or Skill modifier, whichever is appropriate.  This value must match or exceed a target Difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Difficulty is derived from the task's narrative description of Easy, Routine, Moderate, Difficult, Formidable, or Impossible.  This description is cross-referenced to the campaign style (Realistic, Cinematic, or Heroic) to obtain the Difficulty, which ranged from 5+ to 30+.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
