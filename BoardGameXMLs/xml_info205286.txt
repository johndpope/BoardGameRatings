			<description>This is an unusual spin-and-move game aimed at children between 5 and 9, and suggested for parties. It includes a spinner for each of four players and a set of 30 irregular cardboard shapes (five each of six colors). Instead of a board, players lay out their track ahead of time by placing the shapes like stepping stones across floors or lawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then spin as in a board game and act as the playing pieces themselves, stepping from one to the next. The rules suggest placing bonuses like lollipops for the first person landing on a step, and also say the path can be made easier or more difficult to suit the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
