			<description>This 2-player game with an 1893 copyright has a very unusual board. On each side, a rainbow of half-circles reaches most of the way to the fold in the middle. In between is a ragged checkerboard pattern of white and blue squares, with two large red squares overlapping some of the regular ones at the fold, and five orange squares on each side that connect to the outer arc of circles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting at the center, the arcs are colored brown, black, blue, green, yellow, orange and red, two white lines and three rows of white hollow circles run from the middle to the edges. Within the green, yellow, orange and red bands are additional white circles, with the ones in the outer red band having white lines connecting them to the orange squares on the checkerboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not clear from the board what the rules were, but it was obviously a game of maneuver with circular and radial as well as checkerboard moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
