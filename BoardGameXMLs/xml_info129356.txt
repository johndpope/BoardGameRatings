			<description>Game Manual Excerpts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the exciting world of modern naval warfare. We hope you enjoy Harpoon II and that you too will find yourself spending many hours commanding contemporary naval and air forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern naval warfare is often described as &amp;quot;hours of boredom, interrupted by moments of stark terror.&amp;quot; Use those &amp;quot;hours of boredom&amp;quot; to improve the flow of information or &amp;quot;intelligence&amp;quot; required to make your &amp;quot;Commander&amp;rsquo;s estimate of the situation.&amp;quot; Doing this will better prepare you for when those &amp;quot;moments of stark terror&amp;quot; arrive. And trust us, those moments are going to arrive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;View yourself as a naval officer assuming a new command. Become familiar with your forces. Know your capabilities. Equally important is becoming familiar with the capabilities of the enemy. Harpoon II provides an extensive platform database containing detailed information about the capabilities of every platform (surface vessel, submarine, or aircraft) used in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Harpoon II, as in real life, it is often true that victory goes to the commander that &amp;quot;gets there first with the most.&amp;quot; A successful commander has to also know how and when to use &amp;quot;the most.&amp;quot; Before using your firepower, it is wise that you have the best information about your situation and the situation(s) surrounding you. Those familiar with current events know this may mean the difference between destroying a threatening enemy contact or shooting down an unarmed civilian airliner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is more than just a game. It is a simulation that accurately represents the capabilities and limitations of modern naval and air forces. A painstakingly detailed labor of love went into providing Harpoon II with the most accurate data that can be obtained from open or unclassified sources. You will not find another entertainment product on the market that has the amount of data contained in the Harpoon II database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dedicated efforts of many people went into making this product the most accurate and exciting simulation you can run without security clearance. Harpoon II is not difficult to play. It is, however, a challenge to play Harpoon II well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
