			<description>In ReCURRRing, players try to win cards. The deck consists of 57 cards: one 1, two 2s, etc. up to nine 9s, along with a dozen Rs; with fewer then five players, some of these cards are removed from play. A 1 is the strongest single card, but any pair beats a single with two 2s being the highest pair; Rs are the weakest cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After dealing out the deck, the starting player lays out a single card. The next player can pass (in which case they're out for the remainder of the round) or they can play one or two cards that rank higher than what was played; if they do, they take the previously played card(s) in hand. Each subsequent player can either pass or play a higher set of cards of cards, but a set that includes at most one card more than what was played most recently. Once all players pass, the cards in the center are removed from play, and whoever played most recently leads in the new round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player runs out of cards, the round ends and players score points for the cards they've collected. Players play three rounds, then whoever has the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
