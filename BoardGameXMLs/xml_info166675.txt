Another new feature is The Concept Squad, where players have an access to the game's database and can create a &amp;quot;dream squad&amp;quot;. The concept player's card is grey colored. A number of new legends are also introduced to the game, including Franz Beckenbauer, Roberto Carlos, Peter Schmeichel and Hristo Stoichkov.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Licensing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A full list of the game's leagues, clubs and national teams was published on its official website on 18 September with the description &amp;quot;Experience true football authenticity with FIFA 15 - featuring 35 licensed leagues, over 600 clubs, 16,000+ players and 41 licensed stadiums&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EA Sports had signed a deal with the Premier League as the Official Sports Technology Partner.
