							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mob Tower Promo Pack</name>
									
			<description>Mob Tower Promo Pack was a Kickstarter cross promotion between Tower and Mob Town. The 10-card promo pack has some Tower-inspired cards in Mob Town, and some Mob Town-inspired cards in Tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, for Tower, two black market cards representing the law, where you can team up with undercover cops in the black market to momentarily have a conscience and thwart crooks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And then, in Mob Town, an alternate set of cash cards, a camel law card, and a destination card featuring the wonderfully obscure city that Tower takes place in!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
