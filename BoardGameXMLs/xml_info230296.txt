							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Broken God&#039;s Pain: Labyrinth Lord Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Labyrinth Lord vs The New God.  Another dusty tome dusted off the shelf and rewritten for the Labyrinth Lord enthusiast.  The old description is still true:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Old God has awoken.  He feels the pain of being broken and wants to be free again.  He has cursed the party to find his body and make him whole again.  They must venture into the caves and face foes who will thwart their every move.If the party has the wits and the will they will succeed.  The Old God demands success!Broken God's Pain, a low level OSR adventure brings challenge to your players.  No Orcs or goblins will they face.  Will they let the cult of the new god defeat them?  The old god thinks not!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now it has stats in Labyrinth Lord style, fresh maps, new art, some more text stuff.   It's The Labyrinth Lord Edition! Just as bad and nasty as before but a little prettier. Ha ha heh.  Onward Labyrinth Lordians!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
