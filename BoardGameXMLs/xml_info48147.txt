			<description>A collection of three adventures written to be easily adapted to any fantasy RPG system.  From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jolly Jongleurs by Gary Gygax&lt;br/&gt;The Jolly Jongleurs are a fun-loving band of bards and entertainers who make their home in a clearing off to the side of Grimfens Low Road...or are they?  What darker purpose could they and their brightly painted caravans conceal?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Brimming Stein by Lester Smith&lt;br/&gt;An old friend greets you as you enter the gates to the city and invites you to stay at his new inn - free of charge, of course.  But what have you gotten yourself into?  What could that menacing eye that stares at you in your dreams possibly mean?  Finding out means the difference between life and death not only for you and your friends, but possibly the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baron Mikrut's Tomb by Bryan Winter&lt;br/&gt;Invading hordes gather near the ege of town and you and your companions are called upon to raid the resting place of Baron Mikrut in order to recover his legendary amulet.  A simple enough request until you find out what is protecting the Baron and his family tomb!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
