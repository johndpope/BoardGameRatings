			<description>&amp;quot;F-Zero (エフゼロ) is a futuristic racing video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). The game was released in Japan on November 21, 1990, in North America on August 13, 1991, and in Europe on June 4, 1992. The title was downloadable over the Nintendo Power peripheral in Japan and was also released as a demo onto the Nintendo Super System in 1991. F-Zero is the first game of the F-Zero series and was one of the two launch titles for the SNES in Japan, but was accompanied by additional initial titles in North America and Europe. In late 2006, F-Zero became available for the Virtual Console service on the Wii.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control fast hovering craft and use their speed-boosting abilities to navigate through the courses as quickly as possible. The game takes place in the year 2560, where multi-billionaires with lethargic lifestyles created a new form of entertainment based on the Formula One races called &amp;quot;F-Zero&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;F-Zero is acknowledged by critics to be the game that set a standard for the racing genre and the creation of the futuristic sub-genre. Critics lauded F-Zero for its fast and challenging gameplay, variety of tracks, and extensive use of the graphical mode called &amp;quot;Mode 7&amp;quot;. This graphics-rendering technique was an innovative technological achievement at the time that made racing games more realistic, the first of which was F-Zero. As a result, the title reinvigorated the genre and inspired the future creation of numerous racing games. In retrospective reviews of the game critics agreed that it should have used a multiplayer mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;F-Zero is a futuristic racing game where pilots race inside plasma-powered hovercars in an intergalactic Grand Prix at speeds exceeding 500 km/h. There are four F-Zero characters that have their own selectable vehicle along with its unique performance abilities. The objective of the game is to beat opponents to the finish line while avoiding hazards such as land mines, slip zones and magnets that pull the vehicle off-center in an effort to make the player damage their vehicle or fall completely off the track. Each machine has a power meter, which serves as a measurement of the machine's durability; it decreases when the machine collides with the side of the track or another vehicle. A race in F-Zero consists of five laps around the track. The player must complete each lap in a successively higher place to avoid disqualification from the race. For each lap completed, the player is rewarded with an approximate four-second speed boost called the &amp;quot;Super Jet&amp;quot; and a number of points determined by place. An on-screen display will be shaded green to indicate that a boost can be used, however the player is limited to saving up to three at a time. If a certain amount of points are accumulated, an extra &amp;quot;spare machine&amp;quot; is acquired that gives the player another chance to retry the course. F-Zero includes two modes of play. In the Grand Prix mode, the player chooses a league and races against other vehicles through each track in that league while avoiding disqualification. The Practice mode allows the player to practice seven of the courses from the Grand Prix mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leagues&lt;br/&gt;F-Zero has a total of fifteen tracks divided into three leagues: Knight, Queen, and King. Difficulty is determined by the league selected and difficulty level chosen. The game has three initial difficulty levels: beginner, standard, and expert. The master difficulty level is available for a given league once that league on the expert class is completed. The multiple courses of Death Wind, Port Town, and Red Canyon have a pathway that is not accessible unless the player is on another iteration of those tracks, which then in turn closes the path previously available. Unlike most F-Zero games, there are three iterations of Mute City that shows it in either a day, evening, or night setting. In BS F-Zero 2, Mute City IV continued the theme with an early morning setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story&lt;br/&gt;F-Zero is set in the year 2560, when humanity's multiple encounters with alien life forms had resulted in the expansion of Earth's social framework. This led to commercial, technological and cultural interchanges between planets. The multi-billionaires who earned their wealth through intergalactic trade were mainly satisfied with their lifestyles, although most coveted more entertainment in their lives. This resulted in a new entertainment based on the Formula-1 races to be founded with vehicles that could hover one foot above the track. These Grand Prix races were soon named &amp;quot;F-Zero&amp;quot; after a rise in popularity of the races. The game introduced the first set of F-Zero racers: Captain Falcon, Dr. Stewart, Pico, and Samurai Goroh. IGN claimed Captain Falcon &amp;quot;was thrust into the limelight&amp;quot; in this game since he was the &amp;quot;star character&amp;quot;. An eight-page comic was included in its SNES manual that carried the reader through one of Captain Falcon's bounty missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development and audio&lt;br/&gt;A merger between Nintendo's various internal research and development teams led to the creation of Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development (Nintendo EAD), which was headed by Shigeru Miyamoto. F-Zero was one of the launch titles for the SNES that Nintendo EAD had approximately fifteen months to develop completely. The game was produced by Shigeru Miyamoto and directed and designed by Kazunobu Shimizu. Takaya Imamura, an art director for the game, was surprised to be able to so freely design F-Zero's characters and courses as he wanted since it was his first game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notable in the development of F-Zero was its use of Mode 7 graphics. Mode 7 is a form of texture mapping available on the SNES which allows a raster graphical plane to be rotated and scaled freely, simulating 3D environments without processing any polygons. The Mode 7 rendering applied in F-Zero consists of a single-layer which is scaled and rotated around the vehicle. This pseudo-3D capability of the SNES was designed to be represented by both F-Zero and Pilotwings, with 1UP.com stating these two games &amp;quot;existed almost entirely for the sake of showing them off&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;F-Zero_(video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
