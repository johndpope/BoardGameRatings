			<description>Figure it Out is a twenty questions-type game for 2-6 players based on the Nickelodeon show of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns as the contestant and the remaining players are the &amp;quot;panel&amp;quot;. The contestant picks a card containing a sentence that the panel has to try and guess. With the timer running, a panelist may ask 'yes' or 'no' questions to find the answer. If a yes answer is returned, the panelist continues while, if the answer is no, play passes to the next player. If one of the panelists mentions a word on the card, this word is written on the board. If the panelists determine what is on the card, they win. If not, play proceeds for three rounds of the timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each round if the answer is not guessed, the contestant wins a prize, like a picture of a guitar on a card or a picture of a boom box. After the third round, a game of charades ensues to try and determine the answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 'Secret Slime&amp;quot; is also present where if a panelist performs a certain action (like laugh or touch his/her face), he/she must complete a penalty task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes an entry form to be on the show, but not a time travel machine to allow this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
