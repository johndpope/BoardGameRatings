							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doctor Who: The Keys of Chronos</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The old Time Lords are gone, and many races are competing to take their place as the Lords of Time. In order to forge a new Gallifrey and a new order of the Lords of Time, the Eighth Doctor must scour time and space to recover the six keys of Chronos. This will insure the new Gallifrey protection from its rivals, and bring order to all time and space.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each player is dealt six Mission Cards. The six cards identify the six keys that the player is searching for. The first player to obtain all six keys named on his Mission Cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
