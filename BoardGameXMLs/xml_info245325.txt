							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Athens</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo; &amp;hellip; Let me say that our system of government does not copy the institutions of our neighbors. It is more the case of our being a model to others than of our imitating anyone else. Our constitution is called a democracy because power is in the hands not of a minority but of the whole people&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip; When our work is over, we are in a position to enjoy all kinds of recreation for our spirits. There are various kinds of contests and sacrifices regularly throughout the year; in our own homes we find a beauty and a good taste which delight us every day and which drive away our cares. Then the greatness of our city brings it about that all the good things from all over the world flow in to us, so that to us it seems just as natural to enjoy foreign goods as our own local products&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip; Future ages will wonder at us, as the present age wonders at us now&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; &lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash;  Pericles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 5th century B.C., through the Persian wars, the Delian league was founded under the leadership of Athens&amp;mdash;this alliance was actually the Athenian empire. Athens became the wealthiest and strongest city-state in the world, but she also faced difficult challenges from inside and outside of her. In Athens, players acting in the role of leaders in the heyday of Athens would contribute to its sustainable prosperity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Athens is played over a maximum of 14 rounds. There are 4 phases to complete each round: People Management Phase, Base Phase, Action Phase, and Event Phase. You will expand your base, manage the people and then perform an event in every round: preparing for war by raising armies, holding a festival with trading goods, and so on. You need not only to make an effective plan but also accept a bit of uncertainty. By the grace of goddess Athena, your leadership will make Athens greater!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
