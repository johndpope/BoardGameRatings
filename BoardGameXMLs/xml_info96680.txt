			<description>&amp;quot;A Game of Adventure on the High Seas&amp;quot;. The box is nice, shaped like a treasure chest, and the map comes rolled up with a ribbon round it.&lt;br/&gt;The board is map of the sea between Sail Point Bay and Treasure Bay, superimposed with squares. The game uses dice but in a novel way. Turn order is decided by chance and that order of play continues for the whole game. We will call the first player 'the Leader'. He throws a red die and consults the compass at the top of the board. There are 6 compass points and each points in a different direction. The number rolled dictates the direction of movement, for all players, this round. Then the Leader throws a black die and moves his ship that many spaces in the correct direction. Each player after that does the same, throw the black die and move, but not the red die as that is only thrown at the start of the round. There is a little choice in movement. You can decide to 'tack' and move in the direct opposite direction of the compass throw, but you don't move so far, in fact, you might not move at all.&lt;br/&gt;There are perils to be avoided, like rocks or the dreaded Seaweed Sea where you just float randomly until clear of it.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to sail into Treasure Bay wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
