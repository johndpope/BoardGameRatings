			<description>The beautiful blue sky is getting painted darker each passing moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People killing each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one even knows who started it anymore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one even knows how long they have been fighting against each other, forgetting what they are fighting for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People have made themselves into weapons to snuff others out,&lt;br/&gt;forgetting their dream of flying freely in the sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The war has been lasting forever.&lt;br/&gt;But the end seems to be at hand.&lt;br/&gt;The population has seen a massive decrease,&lt;br/&gt;and the whole planet as the battlefiled is on the verge of destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowing all that, people have become weak and keep warring without getting hurt themselves.&lt;br/&gt;That way, they are merely postponing the inevitable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the war, a girl was born.&lt;br/&gt;Her name was Sora.&lt;br/&gt;She was born with a power for fighting.&lt;br/&gt;She was not happy about it, but the people around her were and they sent her to the battlefield with no thought for her feelings at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last war on the worn-out planet.&lt;br/&gt;Whether it is won or lost, there would be nothing left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sora did not know the meaning of the fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
