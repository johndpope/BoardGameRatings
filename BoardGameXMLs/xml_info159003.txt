			<description>Raid &amp;amp; Trade is a post apocalyptic game of negotiation and resource management for 3-5 players. From the ashes of a devastating third World War, a precious few golden cities emerge offering hope to those who struggle for survival in the wastelands. Players explore the ruins of the modern world completing quests, honing their skills and maneuvering for social status in order to claim a precious spot as a citizen with a Golden City. To enter the golden city you must:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Become an expert: Reach 20 skill points.&lt;br/&gt;    Serve the city: Fulfill three secret quests.&lt;br/&gt;    Become a nobleman: Get the most possible character points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each turn, the players can spend action points to do several actions such as moving through the city, raiding buildings, attacking other players, and more. Each player has a specific skill &amp;mdash; mechanic, trader, electrician, bodyguard and medic &amp;mdash; and has his own unique items to build; those items can be traded off against other items or resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board of the game is modular so that in every game you have a new map to discover. All over the map, the players find different buildings which they can raid. Each time a player raids a building, a raid card of this type of building is taken and read, which leads to specific circumstances taking place. The player will be made to make various decisions including important moral decisions! Upon resolving the various decisions, you will receive character points. The choices you make, for good or for bad, will lead to specific perks and advantages (or disadvantages) during the progress of the game. When raiding a building, you get resources (tools, scraps, mechanics, electronics, etc.). By combining these resources, you can craft items with special abilities. By doing so, you will advance your skill points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player also gets secret quests of the golden city. To fulfill these quests, the players have to spend the resources mentioned on the card. To fulfill a quest will not only lead the players closer to victory but also give them advantages for the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
