			<description>In short rounds players race to capture as many of the image tiles as they can.  Each player has three character markers and a deck of cards with multiple images on each card.  Everyone flips through their deck as quickly as they can looking for the image that exactly matches an image on one of the three tiles in the center of the playing area.  If they find a match, they use their marker to claim it.  If someone else's marker is already there they knock it off.  Players try to claim as many tiles as they can and when the timer runs out whoever has their marker on a tile gets to collect it.  Player with the most tiles at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
