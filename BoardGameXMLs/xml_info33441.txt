							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">WÅ‚adca Podziemi</name>
									
			<description>This fantasy tile placement game has similar mechanics like DeathMaze (1979), or Citadel of Blood (1980). Heroes go into dungeons and fight monsters they spot. But Wladca Podziemi has some differences to titles mentioned above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. All characters are in fellowship. They go together and don't fight against each other. If there is only one player - he leads all characters.&lt;br/&gt;2. Characters fight in formations. First line can use short weapons. Second line must use long range weapons, and cast spells. Last line don't fight this battle, but are safe from monster attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In fact, characters in game - are heroes from Fellowship of the Ring (LoTR), and the labyrinth they explore - is Moria. Even the hardest boss is called Balrog. But this is unofficial LoTR inspiration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
