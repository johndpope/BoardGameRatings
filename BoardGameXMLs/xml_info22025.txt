							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bible Cubes</name>
									
			<description>12 wooden cubes labeled with books of the Bible.&lt;br/&gt;Each of the 66 books of the Bible are represented on 11 of the cubes, while the 12th is labeled with Creation, Ten Commandments, Beatitudes, Church Begins, and two blank sides that represent 'wild cards'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll the cubes and attempt to identify consecutive books.  Two consecutive books score 1 point; three score 2 points; etc.  The first and last books of the Old and New Testament are bonus books that score 2 points regardless of matches, and the events on the 12th cube score 5 points if you can match them to the book in which they occur.  First player to 40 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of other games could be played with these cubes, but these are the rules as stated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
