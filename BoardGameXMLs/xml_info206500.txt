			<description>In the game of Fantasy Stables you're trying to make it in the horse business. Your friends will now be your rivals as you compete to see who will end up on top. The object of the game is to collect the most money in cash, horse value and bonuses. Bonuses are awarded for collecting certain groups of horses. They add another level of strategy to the game. Game play is very easy and no horse knowledge is needed to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone begins the game with money and horses to start the fun right away. The game is over when the auction stack is out of horse cards. All the turns are cooperative but competitive to keep things lively!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect and show horse cards featuring fabulous pictures of real horses in 5 equestrian sports (Dressage, Driving, Western Pleasure, Western Performance, Jumping).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add horses to your stable at public auctions where everyone can bid. Bid as high as you dare &amp;ndash; you know the range but the horse&amp;rsquo;s actual value is kept a secret until the winning bid has been paid!&lt;br/&gt;Everyone can enter the shows and choosing the right horse will give you an advantage but anyone could steal the win if luck is on their side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The junior edition features less horses resulting in a short game as well as some other game rules geared towards a younger audience&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
