			<description>Miss Roberts, a neat and diligent librarian, has two little followers: Harry y Tiffany. The kids are always walking around her, pleading to be allowed to be her assistants.&lt;br/&gt;The woman has to pick the most efficient kid for the job so she resolves to state a simple but instructive challenge; one that makes usual library issues arise.  The one who proves to be the cleverest and luckiest player in the game will get the job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MATERIAL: A 5x5 board will be used, shaped like a bookcase, with five shelves occupied at every time by as many books (pieces). &lt;br/&gt;25 book-shaped pieces will be used (five groups of five with different colours -yellow, red, blue, green and orange-). Each colour will be associated with a subject (maths, arts, history, science and literature).&lt;br/&gt;Two dice will be needed. The first one will have one colour on each side (yellow, red...) plus an hourglass for the sixth side; the second one, three sides with the &amp;lsquo;&amp;rarr;&amp;rsquo; symbol and the other three with the &amp;lsquo;&amp;times;&amp;rsquo; symbol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through alternate dice rolls, and by applying their results, the players will try to fill two shelves with five books each on the same subject (same colour). The first to accomplish this goal wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
