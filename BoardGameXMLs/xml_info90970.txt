			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Campaign Setting for Dreamwalker: Roleplaying in the Land of Dreams and Dreamwalker: Diceless Roleplaying in the Land of Dreams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The organization known as the Clinic was founded by Dr. Gunther R. Endell. Dr. Endell was a colleague of the eminent dream researcher Dr. William Black, developer of the controversial Dreamwalking drug, Black25. In 1977, Dr. Endell was granted authority to manufacture Black25 in small doses and resume the Dreamwalking experiments detailed in the late Dr. Black&amp;rsquo;s, &amp;ldquo;Black Files&amp;rdquo;. Many of Dr. Black&amp;rsquo;s former students and original staff were happy to return to their old work. In addition, people from all over the country who had reported experiences similar to Dreamwalking were assembled, screened and recruited. Some who came later were experienced Mystics, able to instruct Dr. Endell&amp;rsquo;s Dreamwalkers in the ways of the Empyrean, the dangers of the Taenia and how to manipulate mana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morale was high during The Clinic&amp;rsquo;s initial stages as Dr. Endell&amp;rsquo;s experiments closely followed Dr. Black&amp;rsquo;s line of research. However, as time and the capabilities of Clinic analysts progressed, the research began to take a more aggressive turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New procedures were planned and enacted. Taeniid larvae, drones and Queens were now captured and examined within the confines of the Dreamworld before being destroyed. Unsuccessful attempts were then made to transport and control the Taenia with the intent of distributing them into the Dreamworlds of others. Clinic research also turned toward influencing the subconscious mind of the Dreamer. The idea was to see if thoughts could be imprinted on the subconscious mind in such a manner as to make the sleeping person do things after he awoke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These experiments did not go over well with many of the original Analysts and former members of Dr. Black&amp;rsquo;s staff. Their complaints were ignored and many contemplated early retirement. One group of scientists, researchers and Dreamwalkers, led by Dr. Kevin Laerty actually defected from the Clinic and helped to form the organization that would later come to be known as Project Dreamwalker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Clinic continued to perform its experiments with mixed results. There were several minor setbacks and one major one: the encounter with the Broodking (see The Broodking Disaster, pg. 30). Despite these obstacles, Clinic research has continued to break new grounds in the study of dreams and how they relate to the waking world. Chief among these is information gathering via dreams and the subconscious mind which has enabled Dr. Endell to turn the Clinic into a valuable asset to his government and corporate benefactors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the overall instability of today&amp;rsquo;s world, the unpredictability of certain global leaders and the rise of terrorism, the focus of Clinic research has gradually shifted towards the more police and military oriented applications of Dreamwalking. After the events of 9/11, the Clinic has been granted more funding to pursue its research, some of which has been diverted from Project Dreamwalker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
