							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Obelisk of Forgotten Memories</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Obelisk is moderately large outdoor adventure with a small attached dungeon&lt;br/&gt;for a party levels 1-3.&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was occasioned by my players deciding to take a lark into the&lt;br/&gt;wilderness rather than exploring Patrick Wetmore's wonderful megadungeon the&lt;br/&gt;Anomalous Subsurface Environment (ASE). It's my own attempt to create another,&lt;br/&gt;smaller adventure location that seems reasonable within Pat's world. It&lt;br/&gt;contains several elements (guns, ancient technology, God's eye's) that won't&lt;br/&gt;make sense outside of ASE, but I suppose it could be run as a simple graveyard&lt;br/&gt;based cult-smashing expedition in with a little modification. It's also an&lt;br/&gt;attempt at an adventure in the old style of the TSR products I grew up with, or&lt;br/&gt;at least as I remember them played in the hands of murderously inclined pre-&lt;br/&gt;teen boys on lazy Summer afternoons. The encounters within are not scaled to&lt;br/&gt;allow a 1st level party to win in a stand-up heroic fight. There are encounters, and even individual creatures (especially the special random encounters), quite capable of slaughtering a party within a couple rounds, but this is how it should be, as they can be avoided or negotiated with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
