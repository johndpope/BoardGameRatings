			<description>4 brothers own an old merry-go-round (carrossel in Portuguese) and compete to see who sells the most tickets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carrossel is a Family Abstract Strategy Game for up to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;Players play on the side of the board that rotates to meet them. All players simultaneously choose and play one of their cards, numbered from 1 to 11, and one of their tiles that come in 4 shapes of 4 different colors. The tiles are placed on the space indicated by the card with one of their cubes on top. Players are looking to get either 3 in a row of the same color or of the same shape. Whenever they achieve this they flip those tiles facedown and place their cubes on each of them to show that those tickets have been sold. And the end of the game the player with the most sold tickets wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
