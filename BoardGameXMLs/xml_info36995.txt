			<description>An antique baseball game. The wooden board displays a simple baseball diamond with holes at each base where pegs could be inserted to represent the base runners. The board also has holes for tracking the number of balls, strikes, runs and outs in an inning. The scores for each inning are recorded by writing them on the score card. A set of forty-eight playing cards are marked with the results of an at bat, such as &amp;quot;single&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;hit by batted ball&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;wild pitch&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;double play&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;stolen base&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;out on steal&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;out on foul&amp;quot;, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components consist of a cardboard box, instructions, wooden board, score card, and (per the instructions) forty-eight cards. In addition, this particular example of the game is marked on the box cover as the &amp;quot;pocket edition&amp;quot; compliments of Longman &amp;amp; Martinez Paint Makers, New York City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
