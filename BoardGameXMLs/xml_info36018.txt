							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Delta Skirmish</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Board &amp;amp; card game for 2 players. Highly abstracted skirmish level combat. Simulation of a counter-terrorist team operation. One side is the commandos: Delta/SAS/GSG-9/GIGN/etc. The other side is Terrorists holding hostages in a building. Victory: To win the Delta team must kill all the terrorists before taking 4 casualties. The Terrorists win if they kill 4 Delta team members, which allows them time to kill the hostages.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chessboard or any other 8x8 grid. Miniatures or counters are used to represent the commandos and terrorists. The terrorist group is composed of one Leader and seven Followers. The commando force consists of one Team Leader, three Shooters, two Demolitions Experts, and two Snipers. A custom deck of cards is central to the play of the game. The players draw hands of cards from the common deck. Card play determines when units may move, attack, or defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Special Forces have many more cards at their disposal, which reflects their high degree of training &amp;amp; experience.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
