			<description>Or&amp;eth;abelgur is intended for 2-6 participants and suits people of all ages. This game encourages players to listen and thing, be merry and be informed. The game offers contemplation, consideration, word-play and jest, and participants play with the Icelandic language in new ways. The vocabulary in the game covers a great number of Icelandic words, both old and new. The aim of the game is to collect five words in a sack by answering questions from five categories according to certain rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions are on cards, each indicating which category it belongs to. Two questions of different difficulty levels are on each card, making the game a good fit for a family. A word-shark directs the game, and reads our questions and possible answers and awards players with words for their word-sack when they have been earned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
