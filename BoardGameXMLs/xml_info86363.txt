			<description>From company website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Myth &amp;amp; Magic is a fantasy role playing game. Players take on the roles of heroes pit against the mechanations of evil and chaos. The world in which the players engage contains monsters, magic, and legends of high adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself is built from the core of the second edition of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular roleplaying game. It retains the essence of classic fantasy role playing, while it advances the mechanics and provides more options, classes, spells, monsters, etc. Myth &amp;amp; Magic is an obvious extension of that edition to gamers that began in that era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamers from other editions will also find Myth &amp;amp; Magic great fun. Myth &amp;amp; Magic focuses on the story and action of the adventures, but also provides a nice blend of character customization that appeals to new age gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Give it a try. You may find it a perfect blend of classic and modern gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 128-page Starter Kit was made available to members on July 15th and soon thereafter for the general gaming public. It allows players to create characters and adventure through 5th level. The Starter Kit provides everything the game master needs to run adventures, as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From [M&amp;amp;M Player's Starter] Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the alpha release, now called the Classic Starter Kit, we presented a game that was, in many instances, an updated and streamlined version of the 2nd edition of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular roleplaying game. The Classic Starter Kit was not intended to be the final product. It was intended to be the foundation upon which we build new and exciting game mechanics as a community. The rules were open content, so we were able to discuss the rules and revise them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
