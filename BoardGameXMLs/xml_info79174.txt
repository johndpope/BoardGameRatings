							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The French and Indian War</name>
									
			<description>The French and Indian War game is the third title in the Early American Wars series from John Tiller and HPS. It covers the North American theater of the greater conflict known as the Seven Years War raging around the globe. This title picks up with skirmishes occurring in 1754 and goes until 1760 when things were pretty much settled in the New World. There are 183 scenarios included along with one major and four mini campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historical &amp;amp; What If Scenarios Covering:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Albany&lt;br/&gt;Crown Point&lt;br/&gt;Fort Beausejour&lt;br/&gt;Fort Edward&lt;br/&gt;Fort Frontenac&lt;br/&gt;Fort Levis&lt;br/&gt;Fort Necessity&lt;br/&gt;Fort Niagara&lt;br/&gt;Fort Oswego&lt;br/&gt;Fort Stanwix&lt;br/&gt;Fort Ticondaroga (Carillon)&lt;br/&gt;Fort William Henry&lt;br/&gt;Isle-aux-Noix&lt;br/&gt;Jumonville's Glen&lt;br/&gt;Kittanning&lt;br/&gt;La Belle Famille&lt;br/&gt;Lake George&lt;br/&gt;Louisbourg&lt;br/&gt;Montreal&lt;br/&gt;The Monogahela&lt;br/&gt;Quebec&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Campaigns:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two different approaches to campaigning covered in this title. The first are mini-campaigns. The four included are designed to cover various &amp;quot;snap shots&amp;quot; of the war. Each one contains two to three small engagements focused on a particular series of events. For example, Washington's Wilderness Adventure is based on George Washington's first solo military command and his first meeting with the French, and ultimately the beginning of the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other approach is in a large, hypothetical campaign. This one puts you in charge of your entire army for the New World, and you will be given choices as to what course of action you will take for the campaigning season of 1758.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
