			<description>World of Darkness: Berlin - Preview Edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The foundation of live-action roleplaying is a healthy community where players feel welcomed and supported. Safety and trust are vital components of that solid foundation. Players should feel they can immerse themselves in their characters and the setting deeply enough for to allow the stories to touch them, and to invest in the experience safely. Mind&amp;rsquo;s Eye Theatre: Immersion Secrets is a new anthology of essays on this theme, written by members of the World of Darkness LARP community and the By Night Studios development team. It offers methods and techniques for encouraging player immersion and safety at Mind&amp;rsquo;s Eye Theatre LARP events, though these tools and guidelines are applicable to any LARP experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are sharing three of these essays with you here at World of Darkness Berlin as a special preview, to thank you for sharing this convention weekend with us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
