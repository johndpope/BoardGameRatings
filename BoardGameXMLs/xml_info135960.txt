			<description>Players move around the board trying to acquire Aces and Face cards, trying to collect 4 of a kind or 4 from one suit.  To move around the board, you flip up the top card from the deck.  If it is a number, you can move that many spaces either direction on the board.  If it is an ace or face card, you move to the space with that card and collect it into your hand from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has 4 types of spaces.  It either has a specific card that you can collect, or is a duel space, where you pick a player and each of you pick a card off the top of the deck, with the higher card getting to take a card from the one drawing the lower card, or a higher/lower space, where you guess if the next card in the deck will be higher or lower than the last card drawn, or Suit Match, where you draw the next card and if it matches the suit of the space you are on, you can take a card of that suit into your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
