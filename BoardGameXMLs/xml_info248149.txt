			<description>Treasure Temple is a treasure-grabbing, back-stabbing adventure card game for 2-6 players. Players each take on the role of daring explorers from across the globe seeking lost treasures hidden deep within the Treasure Temple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect treasure points by scoring treasure cards into your trove. But beware, other explorers will trick you, trip you up and even steal your well earned loot if you're not prepared! Use adventure cards to create pitfalls for your rivals, send them the wrong way deep into the jungle or have your army of maniacal monkeys steal their treasure for you. The first player to collect 20 treasure points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
