							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warchild</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The perfect warrior, at war with himself&amp;hellip; Warchild!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 11 Renegade, Warchild is an iconic character in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration. He is a Special Forces operative turned freelancer, and has enhanced his formidable skill set with minor metahuman abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warchild's file is designated &amp;ldquo;Orange&amp;rdquo; to indicate the intense training that makes him so dangerous. He sells his skills as a mercenary, but often works outside the law to battle organized crime in his own way. Heroes may find themselves allied with him if they need military expertise, or at odds with him when his personal moral code drives him to break the law. Heroes who have spent time in the Special Forces may have met Warchild before he adopted his new identity, or may find themselves tasked by an old friend from their military days to hunt this &amp;ldquo;traitor&amp;rdquo; down only to discover something bigger is going on. They may also encounter him during an investigation into organized crime in their home city, discovering Warchild following a parallel line. As an ally, he is efficient and fierce. As a foe, he is intensely driven to fight for victory. In all conflicts, he fights like one born for battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
