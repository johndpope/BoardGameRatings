			<description>This game shows a lot of lively climbing stairs, because the goal is to be the first player who brings all his tokens on the top platform. Instead of moving step by step, it is faster when you form columns (towers of more than 1 token), since columns allow jumps of as many stages as they are high. After such a jump, the lowest token of the column remains at his staring place and you can move it downwards under certain circumstances, which is interesting, if the remaining token belongs to an opponent. This game requests a lot of strategy and the smartest player will win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Become the King of the Castle!&lt;br/&gt;It takes clear thinking to reach the summit of this challenging test of skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
