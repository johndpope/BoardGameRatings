			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Scientist is Always Fine!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A spacefarer&amp;rsquo;s life is a difficult one, fraught with danger. She is surrounded by hazardous environments, encounters strange and hostile alien species, and must often make do with outdated, or even glitch, equipment. If one wants to live long adventuring among the stars, it&amp;rsquo;s important to be the best that one can be. The Spacefarer&amp;rsquo;s Digest series contains new player options and content, from character themes and races, to archetypes, feats, spells, and more, allowing every traveler among the stars to reach their maximum potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume features a collection of new character themes, all of which specialize in a particular scientific field. Included are the astronavigator, who can plot faster and more advantageous courses through space than anyone else, the polymeric engineer, who can more efficiently create advanced equipment, the theoretical physicist, whose understanding of how the universe works can be applied in a number of surprising ways, and the toxicologist, a master of all things poisonous or contagious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
