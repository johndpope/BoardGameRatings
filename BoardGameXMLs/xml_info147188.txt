			<description>Let's Play Two! Baseball Game is a free, print and play baseball game released by Hot Stove Games in 2002.  The game is designed to replicate what Henry Waugh's Universal Baseball Association Game may have looked like from the book, &amp;quot;The Universal Baseball Association Inc. J. Henry Waugh Prop.&amp;quot; by Robert Coover.  This allows you to create your own baseball league where players grow old, become all-stars or simply fade away from the league.  From rookie to retirement you follow their careers and act as commissioner and God of their universe just as Henry Waugh did in the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by rolling three six sided dice to simulate a baseball game.  Batters can hit for power, strike out, walk, etc. based on their roll.  The unique thing about this game is if you play a full season the rules have you &amp;quot;re-rate&amp;quot; players based on their seasonal performance to continue play to the next season.  This way, you create a living, breathing baseball universe with your own champions, hall of famers, and heros!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
