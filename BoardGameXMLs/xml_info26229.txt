			<description>Hexchess is a game of chess for 2 to 3 players played with standard chess pieces, but on a 6-sided hexagonal board.  &lt;br/&gt;With two players, pieces are set up in opposing corners; with three in alternating corners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 different end games the players decide on before the game starts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     One King is captured by the winner, the third player earns a draw&lt;br/&gt;     One King is checkmated by one or both opponents.  The defeated pieces to not move, but can be captured.  The two remaining players continue&lt;br/&gt;     Similar to 2, except the defeated pieces cannot be captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces move as similarly to regular chess pieces as possible:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The King moves one space.&lt;br/&gt;     The Queen moves along a row or chain.&lt;br/&gt;     The Bishop moves along a chain.&lt;br/&gt;     The Rook moves along a row.&lt;br/&gt;     The Knight moves two spaces up and one over.&lt;br/&gt;     The Pawn move along a row one space at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A chain is a line of hexagons of the same color.&lt;br/&gt;A row is a line of different colored hexagons sharing a common side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
