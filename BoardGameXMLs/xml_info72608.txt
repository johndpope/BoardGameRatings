			<description>User summary, details from Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original Microvision console had two slots for 9-volt batteries and was built to play cartridges with either Intel 8021 or Texas Instruments TMS1100 processors (the cartridges for the Microvision were made with the processor built into them, the console itself had no CPU). After troubles with shorting and overheating of improperly inserted batteries, and after discontinuing use of the Intel processor, a second version of the Microvision was released which ran on a single battery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
