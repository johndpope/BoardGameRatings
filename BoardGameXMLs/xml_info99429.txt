			<description>56 cards, divided into 5 sets of five cards but each card having two halves, and there are six jokers (called Bunkems in this game). The sets are Ancestors, Household Treasures, Landed Estate, Domestic Pet and Fruit. A number of counters are given to each player before the game begins.&lt;br/&gt;Each player, in their turn, must offer a card for sale to the highest bidder. If a set of two correct halves is owned, the player may claim the trick and lay it on the table.&lt;br/&gt;Household Treasure cards are special. When offered for sale, each player must write down their bid and the seller must write down what he would like to receive. When the bids are revealed, the card goes to the player nearest to the sum demanded by the seller. If the seller demanded less, then he gets what he asked for, not the amount bid by the buyer. If the seller demanded more than ten higher than the highest bid, the high bidder gets the card for just 5 counters.&lt;br/&gt;The six jokers can be matched with another joker even though they are not identical.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all the halves have been matched and the one who has the most wins. If tied, it goes to the player who has the most counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
