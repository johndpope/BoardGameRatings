							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">3.N: Codex Gigas â€“ Nonsi&#039;s Complete 3.5 Revision</name>
									
			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At last my homebrew work is done. All class enhancements and balancing, rule-tweaks, and concepts are now fully &amp;quot;cooked&amp;quot; and updated to their final versions. For me, this is the codex to transform D&amp;amp;D 3.5e into The Dream [Roleplaying Game].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Codex Gigas presents a &amp;quot;Version 3.N&amp;quot; revision to the d20 SRD.  The author has revised, updated, and tweaked virtually the entire SRD.  Some revisions are fairly minor, others are complete replacement systems.  The product included an online solicitation from various players to identify areas of the published SRD that were unsatisfactory.  This served as a major input to the revision.  While the item is quite intriguing, the unfortunate presentation difficult to use.  The product consists of three major ZIP archives:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 3.N - Codex Gigas (Nonsi's complete 3.5 Revision) - Final&lt;br/&gt;- 3.N - Codex Gigas (Nonsi's complete 3.5 Revision) - Spread Out&lt;br/&gt;- Unified Codex Update&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Spread Out&amp;quot; version is presented as a monolithic HTML page with all sections always visible (in the &amp;quot;Final&amp;quot; HTML version, all sections are collapsed and must be manually opened).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Unified Codex Update presents numerous corrections - primarily typographical errors and clarifications.  The archive consists of several HTML components (for replacement of portions of the &amp;quot;Final&amp;quot; version) and several document files with topical expansions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the product is fascinating and presents numerous excellent concepts, it clearly is not intended for beginning players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
