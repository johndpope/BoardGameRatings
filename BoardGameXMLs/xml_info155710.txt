							<name  sortindex="5">The Game of Tri Bang</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tri Bang</name>
									
			<description>Tri Bang is played on a 9x19 grid of squares, of which the outer rows and the long middle row are decorated.  Each player is given 25 colored discs, each his own color, and takes turns placing the discs on any square of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to form three in a row, either beginning or ending on one of the decorated rows, but not with a middle piece of the three on a decorated row.  Players call out &amp;quot;Tri Bang&amp;quot; when completing three in a row, and win the game.  Players can also choose to continue playing, to see who can complete the most Tri Bangs before running out of pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
