			<description>It's time to make money.  Lots of money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As CEO of a rapidly growing company, it's your job to aggressively grow your company by any means necessary.  Perhaps those failing companies around the block might have some extra employees and business opportunities that they don't know what to do with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, and make sure to lay everyone off by the end of Q4.  We need to save money where we can, you know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the QuickFight: A Legacy Game engine, Corporate Raiders is a lunchbreak deckbuilder that can be learned and played in just 30 minutes, and features simultaneous play so and your fellow CEOs can get a game in quickly, before your real boss catches you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
