			<description>Hard to find Spanish cycling game that appeared in the early '90s released by small independent Spanish sports game publisher Azul 4 Juegos. The game consists of a one-day race, but the rules offer the possibility of playing a five stage race (In fact, nothing prevents us from playing three or twenty stages...) Although the game is quite simple, there is some ambition in it. The riders are supposed to climb  the Tourmalet, Lagos de Covadonga and the Mortirolo mountains. The teams are composed of four riders (well, counters colored in green, purple, yellow and red, each color for a team), one of them being the leader. The leader has the privilege of something called turbo, which is not more than throwing two dice instead of one. This can be done four times during the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
