							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Switch Hunt</name>
									
			<description>This game is a kind of treasure hunt played sitting down instead of moving about the house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A box contains 12 similar Picture Cards, 12 Clue &amp;amp; Answer Cards together with the Instruction and Solutions sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The clues in some cases are somewhat cryptic and use is made of a play on words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given a Picture Card and a Clue &amp;amp; Answer Card. The answer to each clue is an object in the picture; its name should be written in the 2nd column and the first letter of the name written in the end column. All these letters when correctly arranged give the answer to 'Find the....'. The blank space at the bottom is usable for this purpose, the dashes indicating letters of one or more words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A SECOND GAME&lt;br/&gt;The pictures can be used for a Memory Game, preferably before the hunt. Give each player a Picture Card and allow them to look at it for say a minute. Then collect the pictures; give each player a sheet of paper and the one who writes down most objects from memory is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
