			<description>SGB-19 Return to Europe (1986) (JPY 6800)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RTE includes two mapsheets, 1008 counters, 5 PAC, a 32 pg rulebook, a 16 pg scenario book and 24 pg &amp;lsquo;history booklet. RTE also has a very dramatic cover, with German jets (that look like USAF 104s) intercepting US &amp;lsquo;Flying Wing&amp;rsquo; bombers and an M48 Patton tank moving towards a dead Panther V while being attacked by German helicopter gunship missiles in Trafalgar Square below Big Ben. Good stuff!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the comments in RS/BC are applicable here. The maps stretch from Casablanca to Afghanistan and a ways into the USSR. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that Iceland was north of England!! The maps for RTE and RS/BC do NOT mate up. They are close, but not match. In the &amp;lsquo;history&amp;rsquo; of RTE, Europe has been conquered by the Germans, and the USA is coming to save the day (again). Europe has been broken up into many minor provinces with Germanic sounding names and spellings, including many of their own combat units. Supply once again rules the day as many of RTE&amp;rsquo;s charts and tables look to deal with the gaining and spending of supply points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I cannot say for sure if RS/BC and RTE use the same game system, but since they are a &amp;lsquo;Trilogy&amp;rsquo;, I would assume they do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SGB-20 Op. Winter Storm (1986) (JPY 5,800) One mapsheet, 504 counters, two identical PACs, one 24-pg rule/scenario booklet (3 scenarios), and one Historical Softbound book entitled &amp;ldquo;Photographic Series of the East Front-Operation Winter Storm&amp;rdquo; (72-pg) (JPY 1,800). The historical softbound appears to have been available separately, but I have three copies of this game and they both came with this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unit scales are infantry divisions, armored brigades/regiments and Soviet Mechanized Corps. Losses are handled by steps with extra Kampfgruppen for the Germans. The map stretches from Rostov-na-Donau to Stalingrad and from Kotelnikovo to north of Millerovo. Each turn is four days and covers Nov. 19th thru Jan. 21st. Supply is tracked by point for individual armies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
