			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; VAPORWARE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is stuck in the development limbo known as Vaporware. Few to no details have been released about about its gameplay, plot, or release date since its announcement many years ago. It may or may not be in active development, but neither has it been cancelled officially.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Half-Life 2: Episode Three is announced as the third and final installment in the series of episodic expansions. It is planned as the last episode in the story arc, but Valve has stated it will not be the end of the entire Half-Life franchise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_%28series%29%23Episode_Three Half-Life (series)]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
