			<description>Players travel across a map of 24 North American cities connected by highways in a race to deliver goods to every city before his/her opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every city has a limited supply of one type of six unique goods, but that same city demands two others-and the two goods change with every delivery.  Players earn money for delivering the requested goods, but the journey isn't without costs, which must be effectively managed to save up for truck upgrades which allow you to transport more goods.  The more cities you visit, the more bonus points you earn at game's end.  There's also an additional bonus for being the first to visit a city.  Six of the cities are in Canada, which presents its own unique challenge as carrying goods across the border requires paying a tariff.  Each city, one by one, is randomly  designated as a bonus city during the game, earning the first delivery driver to reach that city a bonus payout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will manage their deliveries most efficiently and score the victory?  Buckle up and hit the road!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
