			<description>Cops &amp;amp; Robbers is a game about stealing loot from the bank (Deck of cards) While you steal loot you need to get away from the cops. The more loot that you steal the more cops you have chasing you. Use dirty tricks to help you get away from the cops and use other dirty tricks to get other caught and sent to the slammer. Make the fastest car that is going to help you escape but beware your other robbers, if your car is too shiny they may want to steal it themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in turns with players selecting loot and other cards to ensure they have the best chance of getting away and pulling nasty tricks on others, but when a player is trying to get away other players can affect whether the player makes a clean getaway during their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 decks in the game. The Cop deck, which shows how many cops are chasing you. The Loot deck which is basically your score in the game. The Robber deck which is the main deck that helps you get away, stop others getting away and lets you pull dirty tricks on others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
