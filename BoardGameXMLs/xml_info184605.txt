			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Frank Role Playing Game, sometimes referred to as The Knarf Role Playing Game, was distributed from 1995 as a shareware product, attempting to model the computer shareware methodology with a roleplaying game.  Regardless of the tag shareware and the distribution methodology, the game is a standard tabletop roleplaying game.  The game was distributed as a single ASCII text document that was nominally paginated, but this would depend upon printing options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In most respects, it is quite like Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, with various fantasy races, classes, experience points and class levels, and so forth.  It also features a rudimentary skill system.  Combat used several matrices for resolution assistance, varying by the attacker's type and skill.  Also like Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons the rules are presented with a somewhat disorganized approach.  Weapons and armors are presented, along with standard equipment.  The rules also present magic items and monsters, all of which are fairly typical of the genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
