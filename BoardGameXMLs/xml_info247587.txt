			<description>An abstract strategy game on a board with three concentric circles; these include eight evenly spaced holes per circle forming spokes, plus a central hole. Each player has twelve pegs which are placed in the holes at the start of the game, leaving the central hole clear. The pegs begin on opposite sides of the board. To move, a peg is placed in a vacant hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to take all the opponent's pegs. To take a peg, there must be an empty hole on the opposite side of it, so it can be jumped, and multiple jumps can be made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was deisnged for blind and visually impaited players. The pegs are different shapes as well as colours, and the circles are cut into the board. The rules are in English and Braille.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
