			<description>It was good and came back to the dark assembly of the pandemonium!&lt;br/&gt;A player is one of the members of the darkness assembly which a bribe and assassination fly about. It is a boom there to get more grants and power by crossing a faction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is an irregularity type draft card game for exclusive use of two. By the turn, I play a hand in the range of an income. A playing place is somewhere in a row that is three before oneself. If cards gather in either row more than five pieces, I can get a faction as a representative with one card of the cards. A score to get changes which card you make a representation. In addition, incomes increase when a faction is completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must hand the card which you were not able to use up during your turn to an opponent at the time of the turn end. While a hand comes and goes like a baton, among each other, a game goes. It is important how it processes the card which does not want to be played by an opponent.&lt;br/&gt;When the factions of oneself or the opponent gathered more than five, the game is finished by the next turn. It is the victory of the player who got more scores. The score adds up the score by the representative of the faction and the score by the income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
