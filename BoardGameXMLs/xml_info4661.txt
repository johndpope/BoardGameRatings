							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">You Said It</name>
									
			<description>An exciting word game that's fun and educational. Perfect for two players or twenty... ages 12 to adult. Each person or team is in competition to bluff the other into believing the real meanings of extraordinary words, that really exist! Who's telling the truth... who's fibbing? It's a humorous race to gain winning points for you or your team while you increase your vocabulary in the bargain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn to judge personalities as the game intensifies. You'll notice your opposition becomes shifty eyed, with an uncontrolled smile or a silly grin... their foot is busy tapping or they look away. They're bluffing and you know it! If you're right, you've won a point, if you're wrong, you've been bamboozled... and you're ready for another round of You said it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
