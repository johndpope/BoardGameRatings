							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Amoebelli</name>
									
			<description>Amoebelli is played by two, each player having six stones of black or white, on a board made of staggered alternating rows of five or six squares.  (There are five rows of six squares with four rows of five squares sandwiched between them so that each square in the short rows shares a border with two squares in the adjoining long rows.)  Twelve central squares are highlighted, six each in two colors; these are the starting zones for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin by placing their stones in the starting squares, then take turns moving and capturing each other's pieces.  Pieces jump in any of six directions to an open space opposite the jumped piece, and jumps may continue in a string if more jumps are possible.  Jumped pieces are removed and then added again to the board at the end of the turn, in any open square adjacent to the piece that was used to jump them.  If there are no open spaces, the pieces are removed from the game permanently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is lost if a player fails to have one of his own pieces on one of his starting squares at the end of his turn, or if a player finds he has no available moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
