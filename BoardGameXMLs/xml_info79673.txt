							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SAVAS</name>
									
			<description>SAVAS is a dynamic, diplomatic, war-like strategy game. Each stylized deck comes with 17 numbered cards in 4 different colors of elegant artistry. The challenge is to overpower the other players without drawing too much attention to yourself. Manage your defenses and economy as you make and break alliances to come out on top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SAVAS is easy to learn and rich with player interaction. Start with a humble hand of 6 to 10 cards, and, if you keep your wits sharp, you might survive. Hold on tight, because in this game you will need every card your deck can spare to bring down your opponents!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In SAVAS, the goal is to destroy your opponents&amp;rsquo; cards, and be the last man standing. Gather your forces, but choose wisely: only cards of the same color may attack each other. Everything in the game is upgradeable, from how fast you draw cards to how large of an attack force you can muster. Get 3+ people playing, and a whole new realm of diplomacy enters the field, much more dangerous than any card. Average game length is 30 minutes.  1 deck per person. Includes 3 decks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(From the publisher)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
