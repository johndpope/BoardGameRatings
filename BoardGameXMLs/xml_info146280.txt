			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A quirky Japanese indie card game with a dark theme: Players are brain-programmed killer machines, and try to win the game by either become the perfect soldier (the Killer Queen) or get rid of their psychological traumas. Or at least have as few as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck consists of 24 cards numbered 1&amp;ndash;7; players are dealt 3 cards. Each turn starts with that one or several cards are sent to the next player, and then players play one card each. Players who play a card that are not yet in the common pool, place their played card in the common pool. But if there already is a card of that number in the common pool, it's placed in the player's &amp;quot;point&amp;quot; area.&lt;br/&gt;If a player manages to get a total of 12 in his point area, he wins, but the road there is paved with the other players getting into your way, and seven different weird special effects, one of which flips the whole deck face up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
