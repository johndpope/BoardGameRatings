			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tell the greatest story no one ever told...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tantalizing tale; in which a bold group of heroes braves the depths of Fort Morninglord, a long forgotten ruin. Therein, their mettle is tested by cruelty, suffering, and no small-measure of mischief. Will their courage -and their stomachs- hold steady? Will they banish the wicked presence that holds dominion here? Can they end the misery of Fort Morninglord's Mourning Lord?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's find out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mourning Lord is intended for players of 13th-15th level. The players begin by defending an outpost called Omenhale from an army of the undead! Omenhale is situated just outside Ft. Morninglord, a fortress that was sealed up decades ago to seal in the evil that once tainted it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players delve the tainted depths of Fort Morninglord to find the cause of its corruption. This leads them into terrifying peril and certain doom at the hands of the fort's denizens. Specters, Wraiths, Mummies, Revenants, Death Knights, The Mourning Lord himself and more await them inside! Along with plenty of mind-bending, gut wrenching obstacles that are sure to keep these heroes on their toes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
