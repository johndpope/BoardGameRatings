			<description>Sokoban (倉庫番 sōkoban, warehouse keeper) is a type of transport puzzle, in which the player pushes boxes or crates around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations. The puzzle is usually implemented as a video game.&lt;br/&gt;Sokoban was created in 1981 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi, and published in 1982 by Thinking Rabbit, a software house based in Takarazuka, Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1988 Sokoban was published in US by Spectrum HoloByte for the Commodore 64, IBM-PC and Apple II series as Soko-Ban. A 1988 review in Computer Gaming World praised the game for being &amp;quot;pure and simple, very playable and mentally challenging&amp;quot;, citing its addictive qualities. It was also reviewed in 1988 in Dragon #132 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &amp;quot;The Role of Computers&amp;quot; column. The reviewers gave the game 4.5 out of 5 stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sokoban&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
