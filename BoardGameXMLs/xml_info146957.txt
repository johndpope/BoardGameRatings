			<description>Clashing Blades! is a two-player card game representing a fencing match, played with a standard 52-card deck. The heart cards are used to represent damage and the ace-10 of the other suits are used to play. In each round, players start by simultaneously choosing cards, with play passing to the player threatened with damage after that. Spades are used for attack, diamonds for defense, and clubs for parries and ripostes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced rules add uses for the extra heart cards (extra-powerful attacks) and face and joker cards (events).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was originally released as a printed set of rules in a &amp;quot;shareware&amp;quot; version. A second edition with custom cards is forthcoming from Popcorn Press.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
