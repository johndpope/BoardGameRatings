			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An upgrade heavy shooter. Play as a battalion commander who shoots constantly against enemies and frees allies from cages as he goes. Each ally joins your team to increase its size and potency. After each game your rank increases which allows you to keep a larger battalion and gives your main character larger hp. You can also spend money earned in the level to buy upgrades which give you a number of bonuses such as changing your starting weapon, improving starting weapons, giving you allies from the beginning of a level and unlocking new and more powerful allies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
