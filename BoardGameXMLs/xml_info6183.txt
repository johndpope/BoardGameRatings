			<description>The Lord of Darkness has plundered the Kingdom. Now the heroes must enter his castle and recover the treasures, fighting dragons along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player (or duo) has a set of four heroes - king, princess, wizard and warrior. Each hero can retrieve gold and one type of treasure: works of art, jewels, magic potions and weapons, respectively. Treasure is kept in rooms, which the player places on his/her own track. Dragons appear in corridors, which are placed on an opponent's track, and must be fought with an attack card and the roll of a die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are granted for retrieving treasures, killing dragons, capturing the Lord of Darkness and exiting the castle. The game ends when a player places an exit tile or when the deck of cards/tiles is finished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is from Brazil and may not be available elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
