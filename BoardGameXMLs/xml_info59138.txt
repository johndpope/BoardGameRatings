			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Enemy Of My Enemy Is Still My Enemy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New Earth Government. A place of progress and hope. A world carefully crafted by the powers that be to give lives to those it protects. The last hope of humanity in a time when it seems as if our light will be extinguished forever. The Migou. Beings from a nearby world who have always viewed the Earth as their backyard, to be used and abused as they will. Creatures caught unawares by what we have become and intent on destroying us because of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemies bound to the mortal coil, perhaps soon to be consumed by it - and each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Live in the world of the New Earth Government, exploring society from the streets on up. Walk within the worlds of politics, religion, and pop culture. Discover what the growing identity of the Nazzadi is all about. Explore the dark end of the street where vice and crime dwell. Or discover the world of the alien insects from Pluto and even explore it as one of them. Peel back the veil and see the Migou for what they truly are - and maybe even admire them for it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nowhere else will you find a setting like CthulhuTech.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is meant to be used with the CthulhuTech storytelling game and requires the Core Book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
