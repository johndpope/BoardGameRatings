							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kingdom: The Far Reaches</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago in a land of five Kingdoms an amulet, known as the Hand of Mobus, was shattered into five pieces and hidden throughout the Far Reaches. Dark Magic spread throughout the land and the evil wizard Torlok began his reign of terror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the fate of the Five Kingdoms rests upon Lathan, the last of the Argent Kings. To restore freedom he must first recover the broken pieces of the amulet, but his journey is filled with many challenges. Danger and evil forces await as you guide Lathan on his quest of power and magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
