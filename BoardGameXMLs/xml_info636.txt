			<description>A Nomination Whist variant that is played with an odd deck of cards. The deck contains the four regular suits, but each has 2 Kings, 2 Queens and 3 Jacks, 3 '10's and 3 '9's. There are also four jokers, which &lt;br/&gt;count as the highest trump. At the end of each hand, the players score a point for each trick made, with a&lt;br/&gt;bonus of ten if you make exactly as many tricks as you bid. If you bid zero and made no tricks, you score&lt;br/&gt;20 points - which makes zero very valuable. The game ends when any player reaches 77 points at the end&lt;br/&gt;of a hand: the player with the most points wins.  Each hand starts with dealing out the entire deck. Each&lt;br/&gt;player uses one face down card as a bid for the trump suit.  If one suit has more cards than any other,&lt;br/&gt;this suit becomes trumps for the hand. If not, the hand is played as No Trumps. There is a clear trade-off&lt;br/&gt;here between getting the suit you want as trumps and retaining as many cards as possible in the suit.&lt;br/&gt;However, it can also be a useful way of reducing your holding in a particular suit. Or even throwing away &lt;br/&gt;a high card that would otherwise win a trick, if you are going to bid zero tricks.  Once the trump suit has &lt;br/&gt;been determined, each player, starting to the left of dealer, states how many tricks they expect to take.&lt;br/&gt;This gives an interesting advantage to the dealer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
