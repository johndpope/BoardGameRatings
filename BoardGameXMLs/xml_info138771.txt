							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stratford-On-Avon: A Midsummer&#039;s Nightmare</name>
									
			<description> from the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shakespeare is renowned for his works, although some question his authorship, with many different other authors suggested. Regardless of the prediction, however, they&amp;rsquo;re all wrong. The real story is much stranger. The real story, and impetus for the genius of Shakespeare, lies in where he lived, Stratford-On-Avon. Stratford-On-Avon is one of a few places that still had connections with the land of the fey, including places like Denmark and Scotland. The writings of Shakespeare were his attempts at interpreting what he&amp;rsquo;d seen while transversing the fae.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survival horror in the land of the fae, where Ophelia has taken Titania captive and exiled Oberon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
