			<description>Each player gets 4 rockets and a Sputnik. The moves are determined by a color die. The starting spaces are the colored dots on the rockets at the edge of the game board. The Sputnik is the last piece to start. It circles the Earth till the last rocket has arrived on its destination space. The first Player, who gets his rockets on the 4 destination spaces near his starting spaces and lands the Sputnik on earth in the center of the board, wins the game. A rocket, which lands on a space with another rocket on it, capture this rocket and releases it only when it reaches its destination space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was published 1957 (launch of Sputnik 1) or up to a few years later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
