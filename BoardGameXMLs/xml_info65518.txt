			<description>&amp;quot;In 1861 France tried to make Mexico a part of her empire . . The battle best remembered by the French occurred in 1863. A small detachment of the French Foreign Legion (FFL) was sent to escort a supply train. The force was intercepted by a large force of Mexican cavalry and infantry. The FFL retreated to a walled farm near the village of Camerone. They were surrounded, low on ammunition, and outnumbered 50 - 1 . . . The incredible courage of the Legion at Camerone is remembered every April 30 when the FFL celebrates Camerone Day.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Devils Don't Surrender is a miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with up to a dozen students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played with 1/72 scale miniature figures or paper figures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game requires 45 FFL figures and 90 Mexican figures. French units have a single figure on each base and move independently, while the Mexican units have two figures to a base and start grouped in formations of nine bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
