			<description>The Wii Remote, sometimes unofficially nicknamed &amp;quot;Wiimote&amp;quot;, is the primary controller for Nintendo's Wii console. A main feature of the Wii Remote is its motion sensing capability, which allows the user to interact with and manipulate items on screen via gesture recognition and pointing through the use of accelerometer and optical sensor technology. Another feature is its expandability through the use of attachments. The attachment bundled with the Wii console is the Nunchuk, which complements the Wii Remote by providing functions similar to those in gamepad controllers. Some other attachments include the Wii Classic Controller, Wii Zapper, and the Wii Wheel, originally used for Mario Kart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The controller was revealed at the Tokyo Game Show on October 14, 2005, with the name &amp;quot;Wii Remote&amp;quot; announced April 27, 2006. It has since received much attention due to its unique features and the contrast between it and typical gaming controllers. It has also gained significant attention from hackers using it to control non Wii-related devices through Wii homebrew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Wii Remote&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
