							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">What&#039;s Up?</name>
									
			<description>What&amp;rsquo;s up? is a fast paced game in which all the players will have to create and tell a crazy fun story using the elements shown on the game cards (handcuffs, condom, party, etc.). During the game, the different action cards will force you to continue the story using mime, challenge your peers or even introduce yourself into the story. Once the cards have been dealt, one by one you will place a card face up, telling a story that includes the image on the card. The story should be logical but can be as crazy as your imagination allows. Will you be able to end the story?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
