			<description>This game teaches American geography - in particular city names and locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns selecting either red or black and then spinning the Alphabet Top.  The player then announces either the red or black letter as appropriate.  Next, that player inverts the sand timer and places pegs next to cities on the map of the United States that start with the letter spun.  When the sand runs out, their turn is over and play passes to the next player.  The first player to place all 25 of their pegs onto the map correctly wins.  If a peg is placed incorrectly, 2 additional pegs of that player are removed as a penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
