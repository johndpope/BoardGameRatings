			<description>Turning the Tide - The Battle of Bemis Heights (October 7, 1777)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battle of Bemis Heights (October 7, 1777) is a two player simulation of the second Battle of Saratoga in the American Revolutionary War.  Although conflicts between the Americans and the British occurred throughout the day of October 7, this simulation&amp;rsquo;s focus is over the skirmish at Barber&amp;rsquo;s Wheatfield.  For the purposes of this game, a hexagonal grid map is provided and used to regulate movement and combat.  The game map is presented in a standard North-South format.  The map covers an area approximately 1650 yards wide and 900 yards high, and thus each hex is representative of approximately 66 yards.  The game has six turns which represent intervals of ten minutes.  A series of counters are also provided representing particular units for both the British and American forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
