							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroic Abilities</name>
									
			<description>Heroic Abilities is a comprehensive expansion of the default superpowers and mental abilities plugins for the Fuzion system.  As stated in the opening:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;As we all know, Fuzion is a child-system of Hero and Interlock, trying to make the best of both to create an even better system.  In its infancy Fuzion showed signs of growing pains, but it stood fast and grew into a strong system of its own showing much of the beauty of its parent systems.  This power system was written to expand the capabilities of the base Fuzio Super Powers Plug-In as seen in Champions: New Millenium to a more robust level similar to the power rules of the Hero System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Much of the mechanics of Hero ported directly over to Fuzion with little or no change, while others altered dramatically.  The concept of Adders and Limiters as presented in Champions: New Millenium: Alliances has been expanded to include many of the Hero power modifiers.  Overall, Heroic Abilities is an attempt to give Fuzion the robust power creation capabilities of Hero.  But Heroic Abilities did not stop there - months of research in super-heroic gaming led to numerous additions, alterations, and deletions.  Heroic Abilities began to take on a life of its own, with its own internal consistency that is a relative to, but not dependent on Hero System.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
