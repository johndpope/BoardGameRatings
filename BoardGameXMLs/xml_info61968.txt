			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the west of the Stormlands, across the Sapphire Sea, there lay the mystical Shield Islands. Bound together through a mutual pact to ward off not only raiders from the Stormlands, but also against the strange, monstrous invaders from the Far West, the Shield Islands consists of five mortal kingdoms: Arundel, Caeradwyn, Elyslyn, Kelaurie, and Paldarin. However, there&amp;rsquo;s another land that coexists with the Shield Islands, a land known as Alurafae, the mysterious home of the Faean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lsquo;At the Edge of Dreams&amp;rsquo; is the first adventure to utilize the unique environment of the Shield Islands, introducing the characters to an ancient land once ruled by the Faean, but now firmly in the grip of the mortal kingdoms that were established by the House of Alador. The adventure is set up, however, so that GMs can easily introduce characters to this setting, or use the events contained within in their own campaign world. Also included is enough information so that further adventures can be planned within the Shield Islands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lsquo;At the Edge of Dreams&amp;rsquo; is written with four to five characters of 6th through 8th level in mind; however, the adventure can easily be modified for characters of both lower and higher levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
