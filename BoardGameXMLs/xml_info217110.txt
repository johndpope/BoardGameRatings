							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Second Edition Fighter: New Kits</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presented here are seven original kits to expand your selections when building a fighter character in Second Edition AD&amp;amp;D.  Following a general description, the kits are broken down into several components, detailed below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role:  How does this particular character type fit into an adventuring party? What skills or insights does he or she bring to the group? What are their motivations?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weapon Proficiencies:  Each kit is able to employ certain weapons, based upon their training or ideology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weapon Proficiencies: Each kit receives two (2) free nonweapon proficiencies.  These bonus proficiencies are assumed to have been acquired during the character&amp;rsquo;s initial training.  One of these is granted automatically, and the second is always the player&amp;rsquo;s choice, limited to those proficiencies listed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Benefits: Each kit has at least one unique power, talent, or abnormal feat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Hindrances: Each kit is restricted in some way, a natural limitation defined by the character&amp;rsquo;s training or philosophy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
