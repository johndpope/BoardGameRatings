							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bad Beginnings: Alpha</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bad Beginnings is an Untold adventure that is playable by 4 to 6 Untold Characters of Untold Point (UP) values from 40 to 60 (we recommend starting at 45 UP). The purpose of the adventure is to provide an introduction to not only the Untold CBRPGTM as a whole and its unique card-based mechanics, but also to the default campaign setting of Untold, Splintered Serenity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is broken down into three main standalone parts (Alpha, Beta and Gamma) which can be played in conjunction with one another, or with other &amp;quot;sideline&amp;quot; adventures interspersed between the three parts. However, Bad Beginnings is linear, and should be played as such. That is to say, it's okay to play Bad Beginnings - Alpha and then play several additional smaller adventures before moving on to Bad Beginnings - Beta, but it would NOT be possible (without a fair amount of re-work on the part of the GM) to play Bad Beginnings - Beta before playing Bad Beginnings - Alpha.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bad Beginnings - Alpha itself consists of three main sections: answering an unusual call by traveling to a strange location known only as &amp;quot;The Crossroads&amp;quot;; extracting information from a lonely and dejected Klik Crucible in &amp;quot;Gear Grease&amp;quot; and finally a mixed-up and chaotic combat scenario in the final section of the adventure, entitled &amp;quot;Anomaly Extraction&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play this adventure in Untold you will need to have characters either from the Starter Set, or ones you build from your own decks, and the GM will have to have the Bad Beginnings - Alpha deck that supports this adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
