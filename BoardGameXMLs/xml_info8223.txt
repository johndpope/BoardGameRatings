			<description>Cacciatori di viverne is a classic simulation boardgame of air fighting, but with a generic fantasy setting. On a modular map with an hex grid (terrain features have been included for decoration and further modules on ground combat that never appeared) little flying armies fight each other in fierce air battles.&lt;br/&gt;The armies are bought with a point system: flying beasts can be manned by different quantities of soldiers equipped with several kind of weapons. Creatures are of good, neutral and evil alignment: three of the counter sheets include good and neutral creatures, the other three evil and neutral ones (good and evil ones can not be taken together). Each of the 6 sheets includes 140 counters depicting classic and less classic fantasy fliers such as dragons, wyverns, pegasi, flying carpets, elephawks, winged snakes, giant eagles, chimeras and so on.&lt;br/&gt;The rules have two different difficulty levels. The basic system has an initiative check for a variable movement order. Several optional rules are provided for them, while the advanced set of rules has a simultaneous planning of the movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
