			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;Capablanca Chess is a chess variant played on a 10x8 board. The game is named after its inventor, the former world chess champion, Jos&amp;eacute; Ra&amp;uacute;l Capablanca.  Capablanca thought that chess would be played out in a few decades, that games between chess grandmasters would always end in a draw. This danger of &amp;quot;draw death&amp;quot; was a main motivation for him to create a more complex and rich version of chess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the usual set of chess pieces, each player has additionally two new pieces with corresponding pawns:&lt;br/&gt;Chancellor: a chancellor combines the moves of a Rook or a Knight; Archbishop: an archbishop combines moves of a Bishop and a Knight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new pieces have properties that enrich the game. For example, the archbishop can checkmate a bare king by itself (king in a corner, archbishop placed diagonally with one square in between). Capablanca thought that adding these two powerful pieces would reduce the likelihood of a draw and make the game itself more interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play Capablanca Chess online on Jocly website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://www.jocly.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.jocly.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other Sister Chess variants are: &lt;br/&gt;Bird's Chess, Seirawan Chess, Musketeer Chess, Carrera Chess, Gothic Chess, Janus Chess&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.musketeerchess.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.musketeerchess.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
