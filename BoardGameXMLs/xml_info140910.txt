			<description>Now this award winning ancient combat system is taking phalanx form and marching toward gamers with Field of Glory &amp;ndash; Immortal Fire! Immortal Fire covers the armies of the Classical and Hellenistic eras from the development of the hoplite system in Greece in the 7th century BC until the Hellenistic successor kingdoms of the 3rd century BC. Fight battles with a huge variety of armies in conflicts ranging from wars between Greek city-states and against the mighty Achaemenid Persian Empire. Alexander the Great fans will be particularly exhilarated as they take part in the Greek counter-offensive against Persia, or even the wars of Alexander&amp;rsquo;s successors!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a bonus, Immortal Fire includes many armies peripheral to the expansion&amp;rsquo;s main conflict, complimented by over 100 new unit images. The period covered is one of great military variety, with many different troop-types vying for tactical dominance. Each army has its own special character, making this one of the most fascinating periods of military history for a wargamer to explore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Classical Greek, Early Achaemenid Persian, Thracian, Lydian, Late Dynastic Egyptian, Kyrenean Greek, Early Carthaginian, Skythian or Saka, Classical Indian, Late Achaemenid Persian, Syracusan, Alexandrian Macedonian, Early Successor, Early Sarmatian, Galatian, Hellenistic Greek, Graeco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 55 different lists based on the above e.g. there are four different Thracian lists to represent critical changes to their historical army composition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
