			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Series of Fantasy Misadventures&lt;br/&gt;A collection of adventures compatible with basic, 1E and 2E game systems&lt;br/&gt;Recommended for 4-6 player characters of levels 1-10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hello and welcome, adventurers and Game Masters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before you lays a world of adventure! This supplement is comprised of several vignettes in the tales the bards will tell of your heroic victories. Each of these &amp;quot;Old School&amp;quot; adventures may stand alone, or they can be played in a series, as they grow progressively more difficult as you go along. The first adventure is best suited to introductory and low level adventurers, the second is geared toward a mid-level party, the third for a seasoned band, and the last is tuned for a powerful group of player characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    In THE OAKEN SHIELD the party must rescue the inhabitants of an elvish tree home. It is intended for use with a Basic/Labyrinth LordTM party of 4 to 6 players of levels 1 - 3.&lt;br/&gt;    In THE LOST TOMB OF SHEL'KAZAR the party uncovers the secrets of a long dead priest&amp;rsquo;s tomb. It is intended for use with a 1E/OSRICTM party of 4 to 6 players of levels 4 - 6.&lt;br/&gt;    In THE LEAKY BARREL INN the party stops for the night at an inn, only to discover that all is not what it seems! It is intended for use with a 1E/OSRICTM party of 4 to 6 players of levels 7 - 9.&lt;br/&gt;    In THE GILDED ANCHOR the party has been captured, imprisoned, and they&amp;rsquo;re being taken gods knows where! They must fight to gain their freedom, with only their wit and cunning to save themselves! This is a 1E/2E/FG&amp;amp;GTM adventure for a party of 4 to 6 players of levels 8 - 10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The supplement contains full maps and detailed descriptions foe each encounter area. To get play started quickly, six pre-generated characters are provided, with their stats listed at 4 different levels, for use with all of the adventures in this supplement. We also include appendices covering new monsters and new magical items encountered, all created specifically for this supplement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These adventures are written to be generic enough in setting that all of them may be placed anywhere in the GM&amp;rsquo;s campaign world. Any specifics are noted in the adventure, such as &amp;ldquo;The Gilded Anchor&amp;rdquo; requiring a nearby port town at the start of the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
