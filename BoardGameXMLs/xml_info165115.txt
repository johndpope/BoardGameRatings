							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mayfair Games&#039; Limited Edition Promo Expansion Set #10</name>
									
			<description>The Mayfair Games' Limited Edition Promo Expansion Set #10 is composed of two expansions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bedpans &amp; Broomsticks: Crazy Closets&lt;br/&gt;Includes 2 Closet Tiles. During setup, place the two Crazy Closets tiles by the play area. When drawing a new tile, a player can opt to draw a closet tile instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whitewater: Jutting Jetties&lt;br/&gt;Includes 2 River Hex Tiles. You may place either or both of the 3-hex tiles anywhere on your river boards as long as two of the three hexes line up with river hexes underneath. Treat these tile river features as you would any on the standard the board tiles (sic). These tiles do not move during gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is available in Game Trade Magazine issue #175.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
