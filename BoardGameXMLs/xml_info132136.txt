			<description>A set collection game where the object is obtain 3 cards of the same sound in a set.  The player with the most sets wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with 5 cards.  The rest of the cards are placed face down on the table.  If a player has a set of 3, they can place it on the table right away, then draw 3 more cards.  After this is completed, the main game begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, the player asks the others for the sound for which they are hunting.  If they complete a set upon receiving cards, they can ask for another sound and continue until they cannot make a set.  At that point, the player is told to &amp;quot;go hunt&amp;quot; and they draw a card.  If this card completes a set, the player can draw again and continue until they cannot make a set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player runs out of cards, they get 5 new cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most sets wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
