			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many years ago, dwarves from the Dwarfhold of Mithaud, or Mt. Silverload, prepared a site as a tomb for their venerable king. Prior to the king&amp;rsquo;s death, however, the crown prince and his family, while traveling, were brutally slain by a band of wandering Orlandish mercenaries. Groups of elite dwarven warriors were dispatched to capture or kill the murderers, and after several months one such group returned with the leader of the mercenary company as a prisoner. The king&amp;rsquo;s wrath knew no bounds, and he ordered the human imprisoned within the king&amp;rsquo;s own tomb. The mercenary was subsequently interred and a wall of magical force was erected to prevent his escape. Little did the&lt;br/&gt;king know that the crown prince&amp;rsquo;s slayer was a man of such great evil as to be able to call upon the forces of darkness for aid in his struggle to survive being buried alive...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mini-adventure for four or five 11th - 12th level characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
