In a news conference this afternoon, American Eagle, leader of the Freedom Squad, issued a nationwide appeal for assistance in the Squad's investigation of the wave of terrorist attacks on its members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meet the Freedom Squad, as nice a band of superheroes as you'd ever want to meet.

Now they've put out a call for aid in their hour of need.  They want tough, experienced heroes who will help them face their unknown adversaries.  Do you qualify?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join the 3 remaining Freedom Squaders as they unravel the myster of VOICE, meet awesome opponents, and prove once again what it takes to be a real hero!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is intended for veteran CHAMPIONS players.  VOICE OF DOOM includes an action-packed adventure scenario, complete descriptions on the members of a valiant (if somewhat overwhelmed) super group, and as evil an organization of killers as you'll find anywhere!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
