							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Muffin Games</name>
									
			<description>Muffin Games is a fun casual game, with lots of dice rolling and interaction between players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, the players take part in an annual tournament, at the city of Muffintown, created by the fearsome Housewife. The goal is to gather 7 Muffins before other competitors. For this, players need to recruit the most unlikely and exotic characters to help them in a &amp;quot;ferocious&amp;quot; battle, including the Alien, the T-Rex and the Super Human Bomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players share a deck of cards and alternate turns choosing between drawing more cards or playing the ones in their hands. Each turn, players can also activate their characters in play to find muffins or attack characters, using dice to determine the outcome of each action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card represents a character, which has two values: Life and Power. The Life value represents how much damage the character can take before dying, and also how many dies the characters uses when finding muffins or attacking other characters.&lt;br/&gt;The Power value determines how difficult it is to find a muffin or to cause damage to a target. Furthermore, each character has an unique ability that affects the game in many different ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
