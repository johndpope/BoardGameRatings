							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Knightfall</name>
									
			<description>Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through 5 scenarios, the Knight seeks his stolen love, imprisoned by the Devil himself. Showcasing a new spin (literally) on the puzzle RPG genre, you must guide your Knight to each level's exit by drilling away the blocks he stands on, and letting gravity take effect! By rotating the entire game board, you can guide him anywhere you wish; into confrontations with the monsters that dwell in the dungeons, or to greedily grab the treasures that litter the game - be careful not to run out of stamina, though! Collect enough currency, and you can buy potions, spells, armour and other trinkets from a shop staffed by a helpful fairy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 skill levels cater for absolute beginners, right up to the most hardened strategy fan, 2 different game modes provide essential replayability and a host of achievements await the completist!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you save the princess armed with nothing more than a rusting medieval drill and a sense of derring-do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
