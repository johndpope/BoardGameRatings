			<description>The world of Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery always needs new heroes! With this Hero Pack, you now have the possibility to introduce a new, powerful character into your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are times when terrible acts give birth to an implacable nemesis, creating heroes completely devoted to revenge&amp;hellip; Heroes like Morrigan, who saw her parents and friends exterminated by supernatural creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a Demon Huntress, Morrigan is the only survivor to a demonic attack on her hometown and feels a deep hatred of these creatures. She specializes in fighting with her arcane whip, her mind perfectly trained to ignore the terror caused by demons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a Witch Huntress, Morrigan survived the attack of a Death Knight and his undead horde, and learned the ways of a Hunter of the Walking Dead. Her favorite weapon against undead is a crossbow firing blessed quarrels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this Hero Pack, you will find all you need to play Morrigan including two beautiful plastic figures (one of which is the Ghost Soul form version of the Hero).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
