			<description>This was released as a free promo adventure for RPGA sanctioned play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While some of the landscape of the domain of Greyhawk has changed, the squabbling and power struggle of nobles has not. Ancient papers have been found and translated, papers that many would kill to have in their possession. With the knowledge now within their grasp two men rise above the others to retrieve what they believe is rightfully theirs. Today is the day where a choice must be made that will change the fate of many.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A one-round Core Introduction adventure set in Greyhawk City for characters level 1-4 (APL 2 only). This is the second adventure in the series of Living Greyhawk Core Introduction Adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
