			<description>Game covers two battles fought between Polish&amp;ndash;Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Kingdom of Sweden during the Polish&amp;ndash;Swedish War (1600-1611). Both battles were famous because of the use of the Polish heavy cavalry known as Winged Hussars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battle of Kircholm was decided in 20 minutes by the devastating charge of Polish&amp;ndash;Lithuanian cavalry, the Winged Hussars.[3] The battle ended in the decisive victory of the Polish-Lithuanian forces, and is remembered as one of the greatest triumphs of Commonwealth cavalry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the battle of Kokenhausen Polish forces defeated the Swedish relief force and captured the besieging force, relieving the Polish garrison. The battle is notable as one of the greatest victories of the Polish hussars, who defeated their numerically superior Swedish adversaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
