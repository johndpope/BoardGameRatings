			<description>Bocce Dice is an action/dexterity game where players take turns rolling 4 standard six-sided dice towards a target Score Zone located on a rectangular play mat. Each player has their own Score Zone that gives them points, but the player can also attempt to reduce their opponent's points by attempting to knock their opponent's dice from the play mat. At the end of every round, the points are totaled and the player with the most points wins the round. The first player to win 10 rounds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
