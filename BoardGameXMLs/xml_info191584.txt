			<description>Build your fortune as you buy, sell and trade properties from the Kensington neighborhood in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Don't worry  it's classic Monopoly fun! Take a ride on Huntingdon El Stop, buy a neighborhood store, or buy up All of the stores &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s your turn to get rich! You&amp;rsquo;ll take a spin around the board. Roll your dice and move your favorite game piece. Prove your skills as a deal maker. Pass YOUSE, collect $250.00, take a Destiny card or head over to Fate space as you wheel and deal your way to the top. But remember to stay out of The Sweat Box! Bring back those old neighborhood memories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
