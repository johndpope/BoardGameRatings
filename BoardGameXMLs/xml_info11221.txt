			<description>From the publisher, Alien Menace:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Natural Selection is the thrilling prequel to the bestselling Alien Menace game, Sucking Vacuum!  Did you ever wonder how that monkey got on the International Space Station?  What trials did our small hairy friend rise above to secure his place on the doomed station?  It&amp;rsquo;s a great story packed with love, drama, intrigue and monkeys throwing poop.  And unlike George Lucas, the guys at Alien Menace know how to make a prequel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the role of the great apes in exploration expands, more advanced testing is required to develop a higher level of human/simian synergy.  The International Space Station provides just such an opportunity.  Join the eight great apes in their quest to be chosen for this monumental mission!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monkeys are funny...Everybody loves monkeys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
