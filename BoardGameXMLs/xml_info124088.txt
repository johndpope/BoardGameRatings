			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RC de GO! is an RC car racing simulation game. The game has four modes of play: Practice, Quick Race, Championship, and Time Attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main features of the game are the very detailed RC car tuning options in found within the Championship mode and the unique viewpoint and control scheme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a little over sixty different upgrades that a player can purchase for his or her RC car during the Championship mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Races are viewed from the side of the track as if you were the car operator or a spectator at a real RC race. The cars are handled using the left analog stick for moving your car left and right and the right analog stick is used to accelerate and decelerate your car. This adds to the realistic nature of the game by simulating the controls of real-life RC cars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
