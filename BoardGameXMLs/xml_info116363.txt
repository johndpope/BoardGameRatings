							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bratz: Rock Angelz (PC)</name>
									
			<description>The PC game is different from the GameCube/PS2 console game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It follows the story of the DVD movie, Bratz Rock Angelz, through nine objectives. The odd-numbered objectives (Chapter 1, 3, 5, 7, 9) are reflex-like mini-games, where the player has to do the tasks to collect points. Each mini-game has four rounds. When the player takes or misses the part, he'll/she'll gain lower points, at three misses, he/she has to do the round again losing amount of points. With points, the player can unlock fashions for the Bratz girls, except in the final objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The even-numbered objectives (Chapter 2, 4, 6, 8) are puzzle-like adventure games. The player has to play with the certain Bratz character and take things to solve a puzzle (for example give a camera to a colleague). The player can take pictures on those objectives to print them on the &amp;quot;Secrets&amp;quot; menu. Each adventure objective, the player has to design an article, logo, flyer, or poster to complete the part of the objective. The player can even print his/her design. This part can be accessed on the &amp;quot;Secrets&amp;quot; menu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the player has beaten the game, he/she unlocks a card game, called Top Trumps, which is similar to War. The player gets a card each turn with number totals on it. The player has to guess which number on the card is higher than the opponent's card. If he's/she's correct, he/she wins the card. He/she goes on playing until all 28 cards are in one players possession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bratz: Rock Angelz (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
