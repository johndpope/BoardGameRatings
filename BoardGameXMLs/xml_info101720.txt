			<description>In the world of Nysenia, the Humans of Ardania and the Undead of Mordena have been at war for many, many centuries. During their last ferocious battle in the Bras Plains, they used enormous forces against each other. The conflict shattered the land and the impact was so huge that it threatened the existence of the entire world. Magicians from the Hidden Kingdom Lorelight decided to intervene and stop the madness of the raging kings. Their wizard leader - Elnan Wise Wand, teleported himself in the center of the battle. And there, all by himself, he cast a spell with an unseen power - it petrified everything in hundreds of miles. He managed to put an end to the battle but he paid for this with his own life as the spell drew all the energy from his body. All of a sudden, the vast battleground became still and silent. The echoes of the war were not to be heard anymore. Only the speechless statues of thousands of warriors remained there. Both the kings of the Humans and the Undead were awed by the power of the spell. The sudden ending of their armies left them flabbergasted. &lt;br/&gt;The loyal followers of the magician Elnan sent them a message to let them know of the great sacrifice of the wizard leader, and that Lorelight would not tolerate any more this war. The Kings had no other choice but to end the war and sign a peace treaty. However, they had to find another outlet for their boundless hate for each other. This is why they decided to declare the BattleSpell tournament - their presumably legal and civilized way to continue fighting in the small barren territories near the Petrified Battlefield. All Heroes across the world are welcome to join the fighting forces of the Kingdoms and show their strength in the tournament!&lt;br/&gt;Let the battle begin now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
