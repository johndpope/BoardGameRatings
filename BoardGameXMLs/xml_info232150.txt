			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sword &amp;amp; Scoundrel is a role-playing game about characters. The PCs are center-stage, and through their actions they drive the story forward. It's a game about hard choices, where players must declare what is most important to their characters. Through their actions they must decide what they are willing to do and how far they are willing to go to further, uphold, or protect what they believe in. More than anything, it is a game about conflict and consequences, sometimes moral, sometimes social, and often physical. It is a game of passion, violence, and general skullduggery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
