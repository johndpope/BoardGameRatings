			<description>&amp;quot;PUNCH BUGGY NO PUNCH BACKS&amp;quot;.  Ah remember the good old days in the back seat with your siblings, and how red your arm was be the time you got to grandma's house? Now you can relive those fond memories without the pain, in the dice game &amp;quot;Backseat Battles&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Backseat Battles is played with 8 battle dice and 2 revenge dice. During the players turn they roll all 8 battle dice and set aside any hits they have rolled. The player continues to roll and building their score as long as they risk or until they roll no hits and dad pulls the car over losing all their hits. Beware of sibling rivalry, if a revenge is rolled, their opponent gets the chance to fight back and possibly steal their points.&lt;br/&gt; A simple game of lucky with a touch of strategy built in. For ages 6 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
