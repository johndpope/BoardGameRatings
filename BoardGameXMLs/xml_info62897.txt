							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ice Cavern of Isahil</name>
									
			<description>From back of book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the depths of the mountains, a deep crevasse, lined with ice, plunges down into the rock.  At the bottom, blue phosphorescence can be seen, glowing dimly.  Men fear the crevasse, believing that Frost Giants created caverns beneath the mountain, and that this is the entrance.  Others believe that a terrible Ice Dragon lives at the very bottom, turning anyone who ventures into its lair to ice.  Whatever is down there, you are convinced that there must be treasure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mini-solo adventure is suitable for any level character with no greater than 20 personal adds per level number.  Magic-users may enter, but as this is a mini-solo adventure there is no provision given for the use of magic spells so they are not allowed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
