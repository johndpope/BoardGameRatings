							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Magic School Bus Explores Inside The Earth</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based upon an episode of the children's television program of the same name. The plot of the game is as follows: Arnold has lost all the rocks and minerals from his collection, so Ms. Frizzle decides to take the class on a field trip to locations around the Earth (and sometimes inside) to find them. After locating a rock/mineral, the player must find out what rock/mineral it is by performing numerous tests on it. There's also many fun mini-games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
