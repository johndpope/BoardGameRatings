			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loosely based on Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper, Beggar Prince tells the story of a young prince who is bored with life in the palace.  One day, having escaped his guards, he meets a young beggar in the town who looks just like him.  The prince convinces the beggar to switch clothes and thus identies with him, only to find that he cannot return to his life as a prince.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beggar Prince is notable as it is a 2006 English Genesis/Mega Drive release of a game originally released only in China, after eight years of no North American releases for the Genesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
