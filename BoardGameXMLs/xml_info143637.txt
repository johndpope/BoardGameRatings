			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feast on the Living!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunger is a ghoul&amp;rsquo;s constant companion. The desire to consume rotting flesh dominates their thoughts, leading them to strike out at the living to acquire the carrion that they so desire. Unlike other lesser undead, ghouls possess a terrible cunning that they use to plan out their next meal. Monster Focus: Ghouls is here to give the busy GM everything you need to put your players on the menu!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside, you'll find a number of options for player characters facing off against ghouls. Options like the Mind over Muscle feat, which allows a character to fight off paralyzation, or the aromatic sachet, an alchemical item that protects against stench. In addition, there are a wide variety of new rules for the Game Master to use in their game. You can set your table with a ghoul banquet, a hazard that can nauseate anyone that draws too close, or have your group face off against the powerful ghast lord, a new type of spellcasting undead!  Game Masters will also find plenty of new magic items, new ghoul varieties, and adventure hooks inside. In total, this PDF contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 New Feats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 New Alchemical Items&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 New Spells&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 New Magic Items&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 New Hazard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 New Undead Creature&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 New Types of Ghoul&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 Adventure Hooks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
