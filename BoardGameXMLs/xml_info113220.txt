			<description>Game Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fox McCloud is Back in a Re-mastered Nintendo Classic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Fox 64&amp;trade; 3D invites players to take on the role of legendary Fox McCloud as they lead a fearless squadron of fighters in fierce aerial combat to battle the evil forces of Andross and save the galaxy from destruction. The rich 3D visuals provide a remarkable sense of depth, distance and position as players dodge meteors and blast enemy fighters out of the sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-    A complete graphical update brings a Nintendo classic into the era of portable 3D fun. The game makes effective use of the Nintendo 3DS system&amp;rsquo;s dual screens: The top screen features 3D aerial combat, while the bottom screen displays characters and dialogue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-    There are two control methods for the player to experience. The Nintendo 64 Mode offers original controls, while the new Nintendo 3DS Mode uses the motion controls of the built-in Gyro Sensor of the Nintendo 3DS system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-    Trusted wingmen Peppy, Slippy and Falco are along for the ride &amp;ndash; if one of them is chased or captured by an enemy, players must act to protect them in order to keep their team strong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-    Each mission takes players through a different planet of the Lylat system as they blast enemies, collect power-ups and fight powerful bosses on their way to the final battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-    A new multiplayer option lets up to four players engage in fierce aerial combat via a local wireless connection (using four systems and one game card via DS Download Play). The multiplayer mode also includes new power-ups and special weapons. Players can use the Nintendo 3DS system&amp;rsquo;s inner camera to display a live video feed of their faces as they battle, bringing a new level of fun and personalization to the multiplayer experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
