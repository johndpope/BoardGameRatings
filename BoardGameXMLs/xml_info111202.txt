			<description>Last Friday, at a local pub, you met up with some of your best mates. They&amp;rsquo;re like you: artist types, broke, kind of smelly. You tell them of your plan to write a hit sci-fi story and suddenly it catches fire! You rush home to your flat in an inspired haze and start writing that million-dollar story: The one about a bunch of Martians and a time machine. One week later, you return to the pub buzzing with excitement. Just as you are about to fill them in, Susie arrives boasting about her new tale, &amp;ldquo;Doomsday: The Martian Shrink Ray.&amp;rdquo; Moments later, Frank counters with a different story: &amp;ldquo;The Robot Toxin.&amp;rdquo; It would seem that your friends have all got the same idea. Happily, you laugh through the night comparing, modifying and sharing ideas. As Steve pours another round, a friendly wager arises: Who can write the best science fiction story in five weeks time? Looking down at your beer-stained draft, you toss twenty-dollars into the pot. This one&amp;rsquo;s in the bag, your pals don&amp;rsquo;t stand a chance. . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game of draft building. Each turn, players will add and subtract cards from a shared deck. Then, players will draft cards from this deck. After players have chosen a set of cards, they will take turns playing them. In a turn, players can choose to either discard cards (in order to save ink), or to spend ink to play cards (developing plot-lines). The plots players develop will then influence the next weeks workshop, as they help players to add and remove cards from the shared deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
