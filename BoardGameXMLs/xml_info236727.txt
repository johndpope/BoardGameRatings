			<description>A Two-Round Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What was supposed to be a quiet family celebration has turned into a disaster. It seems young Lyle, the son of Trumann and Paren Stoutheart, has decided that he would rather go adventuring than attend a family gathering. You had all gathered at Trumann and Paren's home in Riversmarch for the annual Midsummer's Festival when Lyle didn't show up. No one was too surprised, the boy was always late. He'd gone off with three friends on a camping trip in the forest just north of town. At least that what he said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
