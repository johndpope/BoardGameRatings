							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Outpost (1982)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Outpost is to survive.  You are placed in an immovable outpost, armed with torpedoes, main and secondary energy armaments, and a targeting computer.  Your opponents come in three sizes, labelled SML (small), MDM (medium), and HVY (heavy).  Their objective is to overrun you, or destroy you by knocking out your armaments, computer, or energy supply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outpost was written by Tim Parker and published as type-in source code in Compute! Issue 25, June 1982.  Originally written for the VIC-20, a source listing for Atari 8-bit systems also was published.  Too, changes needed to port the VIC-20 code to Apple II were published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
