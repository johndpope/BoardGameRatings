			<description>Back of Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The post of Managing Director of the third largest conglomerate, the AIV Group is within your grasp. T take on this prestigious position you simply have to produce better results than all the other carefully selected candidates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Construction, Buying, Development, Organisation, Negotiation, Investment, Diversification, Speculation and Take-Overs are just some of the daily tasks you will perform as you increase turnover and expand the group's business activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earthquakes may strike, fires might break out, terrorists may attack your railways and all sorts of factors may cause your share price to drop and make your investors panic. Your aim: SUCCESS. And if you fail? You will have to live through the humiliation of bankruptcy, witness the dismantling of the group or a buyout by a rival Company. The choice is yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
