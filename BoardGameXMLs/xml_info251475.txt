			<description>SPQR module from C3i Magazine #21&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Eleven years have passed since the outbreak of the Second Punic War between Rome and Carthage. Both sides have become exhausted after long years of battling and campaigning across the Mediterranean Theater. From Spain, Hasdrubal Barca marches toward Italy to join his brother Hannibal. Together they seek to bring this long, hard conflict to an end.&lt;br/&gt;Rome is aware of the overall Carthaginian plan and therefore strengthens its legions. If, after so many years of war, Rome has been unable to defeat Hannibal, what will happen when a new member of the &amp;quot;Lion's Brood&amp;quot; reinforces his brother in Italy? The result of the Second Punic War, possibly control of the Western Mediterranean,is at stake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 3-page historical background article.&lt;br/&gt;- A scenario set-up card.&lt;br/&gt;- 2 new leaders counters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
