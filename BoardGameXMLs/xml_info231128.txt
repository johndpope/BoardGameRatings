			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scavengers is a game that passes in a world different from ours, with a mixture of magic, steampunk, and lots of history. I did not mention it, but I love writing, and during this time I designed the system, I wrote a lot of lore that I intend to put together with the game, My native language is not English but Portuguese (I was born in Portugal) and I&amp;rsquo;m translating / Locating all this material for English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was designed thinking in skirmishes combats, small groups of warriors who are fighting each other in pursuit of a larger goal. I have added to this some characteristics that I will present here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     System based on 6-sided dices;&lt;br/&gt;     Live system, constantly expanding and with rules entry and new game supplements&lt;br/&gt;     1/100 scale (15mm can be used as well)&lt;br/&gt;     3D print miniatures available for free&lt;br/&gt;     Movement system using tape measure or hexes grid&lt;br/&gt;     Action cards to increase the aspects of gameplay&lt;br/&gt;     Simple rules that allow the novice player to enter in an easy way in the game and advanced rules system for the more experienced.&lt;br/&gt;     2 initial factions: humans and orcs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is being released with two initial booklets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Core rules, the basic rules of the game that cover the primary aspects of gameplay&lt;br/&gt;     Encyclopedia Belicosa - Official Magazine with supplementary information that will contain: additional rules, game factions, stories and a whole series of information for the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
