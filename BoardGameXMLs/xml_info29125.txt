							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elections The Race to the White House</name>
									
			<description>The object of the game is to have the most electoral votes. The game ends when the players have won all the states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with a random home state and four cards, each of which represents a random number of votes. Each player also has two pawns, one starts on the assigned home state; the other on the &amp;ldquo;Campaign Starts&amp;rdquo; space on the track. In turn, a player rolls two dice and advances one&amp;rsquo;s pawn counterclockwise around the track. The space on which a player lands may award the player vote cards, call for a chance card, allow a TV debate (giving a opportunity to steal an opponent's state) or call for an election. When an election is called for, the player moves one&amp;rsquo;s own pawn to an adjacent state. The players declare how many vote cards each will commit to the election. All the votes are revealed and the player, who committed the most votes without exceeding the state&amp;rsquo;s limit, as printed on the gameboard, is awarded the state and its electoral votes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
