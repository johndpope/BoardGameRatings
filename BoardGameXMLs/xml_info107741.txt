			<description>Grabbelen (Grabble) is a party game based on memory and card recognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the table are 36 cards, and each card has a color (and symbol matching that color) and a number (1 through 6). A player rolls two dice &amp;ndash; one with numbers, the other with colors &amp;ndash; then all players look for the card that matches the color and number rolled. The first player to find the card takes it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the card isn't on the table, the first player to call out the name of the player who has it takes the card from its current owner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to accumulate a set number of cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
