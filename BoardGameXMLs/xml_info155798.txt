							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Miscrits of Sunfall Kingdom</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to the world of Miscria, a mysterious and adventurous land. In it you'll find a world to explore, creatures to discover, and an adventure the likes of which has never graced the pages of Facebook. Miscrits of Sunfall Kingdom is an exciting, rich, expansive game that will capture you from the first few moments and keep you with its enchanting qualities throughout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin in the enchanting Miscrian Forest, and soon find themselves on a search for the mysterious critters known as Miscrits. Discovering and capturing new Miscrits is just the beginning, as players can then train them, watch them grow and evolve, and use them to battle not only more difficult wild creatures but live players in the exclusive Sunfall Stadium Battle Arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
