			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back in the early 1980s, a game company called Fantasy Games Unlimited put out an RPG product called Psi World. The game setting occurred in a near&amp;ndash;future society that had to deal with psionic&amp;ndash;gifted individuals in a largely non&amp;ndash;psionic population. The rules allowed for two possible scenarios: That the psis were a threat to democracy or that the psis were scapegoats of a corrupt government. Over the years, I ran scenarios based in both possibilities. I really thought the themes presented in the game were&lt;br/&gt;very compelling and had a good time playing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Savage Psi World&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A few Player Characters&lt;br/&gt;     A Dangerous Foe&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
