							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Associated Shades of Hades</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Associated Shades of Hades is a social club whose members are, generally speaking, refined and civilized in their behavior; one would expect nothing else from a group that includes such famous figures as George Washington, Confucious, and Sherlock Holmes. But sometimes, tempers flare, witty banter fails, and out come the knives, pistols, and pool cues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ROLF!: The Associated Shades of Hades is a supplement inspired by John Kendrick Bangs' classic tales of Hades (also available from NUELOW Games, in Houseboat on the River Styx). Now Shakespeare and Bacon settle the question of who wrote &amp;quot;Hamlet&amp;quot; with violence of the most savage kind, while Cleopatra beats the stuffing out of Captain Kidd just because she feels like it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featured within are new things to wear and weapons to weild (such as an Egyptian-style bikini and a beer stein), 18 pre-generated characters (including George Washington, Queen Elizabeth I, and Sherlock Holmes), optional combat rules, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
