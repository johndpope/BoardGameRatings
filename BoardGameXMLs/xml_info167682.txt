			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pirates Love Daisies was created in order to showcase what HTML5 webgames would look like.  It is a tower defense game where the goal is to protect daisies from all manner of sea creatures who are determined to ruin the pirate's beloved garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;towers&amp;quot; in this defense game are the pirates themselves.  The player selects different pirates and places them at strategic points around the map to protect the daisies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four different maps that are unlocked during play, and five different types of pirates.  Each enemy the player kills drops a certain amount of gold, which can be used to buy more pirates to place around the map, or to upgrade the pirates that are already there.  The game has three difficulty levels which are unlocked by beating each map on the previous difficulty level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
