			<description>From the publishers blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Curses are like chickens; they always come home to roost&amp;rdquo;, and if these chickens aren&amp;rsquo;t found soon, the Village of Kith will be doomed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the edge of the Four Counties, in a backwater village of lost souls, there is a string of robberies that cannot be explained&amp;hellip;Farmer Phileas Filson has lost his chickens, or rather he swears that they&amp;rsquo;ve been pilfered, along with his prize-winning hen Mabel, and no one in town will lift a finger to help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your adventuring comrades, freshly minted from the forges of fame and fortune, may be his only hope&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Most Fowl is a great way to start that new party of low-level adventurers on the path to riches and rewards! With a broad cast of interesting, unusual and perhaps dangerous rural folk, a countryside filled with sheep, squash, and hallucinogenic flora and of course the mystery of missing poultry, your players and their new characters will have a fun-filled romp through this off-color backwater village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a terrible force trying to impose itself on the Village of Kith&amp;hellip;and it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to discover its source and put an end to the poultry-pinching party, and the havoc that is destined to follow if your players don&amp;rsquo;t solve this ADVENTURE MOST FOWL!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An OSR Module For 4&amp;ndash;6 players level 0&amp;ndash;1&lt;br/&gt;Hand-Drawn maps by DYSON LOGOS!&lt;br/&gt;2 All-New Monsters including the Cockalorum!&lt;br/&gt;Original Artwork by Randy Davis&lt;br/&gt;For use with Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry, but easily converted and compatible with most OSR systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
