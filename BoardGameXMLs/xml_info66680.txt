			<description>Rappakalja Matkapeli is a travel version of Rappakalja. Main idea is to guess correct answer to given question. If player doesn't know the right answer he/she may write anything. After everybody has given their answer papers to &amp;quot;h&amp;auml;my&amp;quot; player and he/she has accepted them all answers are read and voting begins. Player who got most votes gets two points and second one point. So &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; answer is not always. Usually most ridiculous or stupid answer gets all the points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question genres&lt;br/&gt;-What happened in that date&lt;br/&gt;-What does this saying mean (sayings in various languages)&lt;br/&gt;-What is this medical phobia/condition&lt;br/&gt;-Who is this character or where this character appeared&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel version holds less cards and art word have been changed, also a game is little shorter!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
