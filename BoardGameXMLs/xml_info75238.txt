			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiny Toon Adventures: Montana's Movie Madness was the second Tiny Toon Adventures-related game ever released on the Nintendo Game Boy. It was released in 1993 and was developed and published by Konami. It was released in Japan as Tiny Toon Adventures 2: Buster Bunny no Kattobi Daibouken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Montana Max has opened a new theatre in Acme Acres, but the only movies he shows are ones where he's the hero, and Buster Bunny is the villain. It's up to Buster Bunny to go into the films and change the plots. Buster is assisted by the crazy Gogo Dodo, and will encounter him in each movie, where he can get assistance from each of his friends. At the end of each stage, Montana Max appears in a themed costume for each film, and challenges Buster to battle. Of course, other famous foes of Buster's will be there to try and stop him, including Roderick Rat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five stages, with the first four being different films that Montana's showing, and the final stage is being held in the backlots of Montana's movie studio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
