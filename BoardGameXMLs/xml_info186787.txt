			<description>You have a deck of selected cards which you can use to place buildings. Each building will affect it&amp;rsquo;s surroundings in different ways. The aim of the game is to clear city blocks by gathering the required number of points from your residents, giving more room to build. As the city grows, bigger and better new buildings can be added to your deck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you get opportunities to hone and refine your deck, residents will demand more from you. You&amp;rsquo;ll find yourself inadvertently creating zoning puzzles- playing against your own past planning decisions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
