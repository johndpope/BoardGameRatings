							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gran March</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The government of Gran March most closely resembles a feudal monarchy. The ruler, known as the Commandant (His Most Resolute Magnitude, Magnus Vridanian currently holds the title), serves a five-year term and is elected by the nobility (10 Barons, 2 March Wardens, and a group of 100 hereditary nobles known as the Electors). The Knights of the March (now the Knights of the Watch) were responsible for the pacification of the area now known as Gran March, but the Knights are not as closely associated with the government as they once were and the Commandant is no longer always a member.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document served as a concise introduction to the Gran March for players involved in Living Greyhawk convention/tournament play.  It includes character design suggestions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
