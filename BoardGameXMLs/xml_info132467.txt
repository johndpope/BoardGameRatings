			<description>A die rolling and guessing game for toddlers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game:&lt;br/&gt;To be the first to collect the six birds in the colour of one's own player board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup:&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a player board. If you are playing with fewer than 4 players, the remaining boards are put in the middle of the table. Each boards show a house, a fence in the player's colour, sky and meadows. It also has embossed 6 bird silhouettes in which the wooden birds fit.&lt;br/&gt;The birds are put into the bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling the die. If it shows a bag symbol with one or two dots, the active player takes the corresponding number of birds out of the bag (without looking) and places them on the board of that colour. Then the die is passed on to the next player. If the hand symbol is rolled, one, two or three (again determined by the number of dots next to the symbol) birds are taken from the bag and shown to the other players. The active player then puts his/her hands under the table and secretly distributes the birds between his/her two hands and closes them. Both hands, still closed, are presented to the player on the left. He/she picks a hand. If there are birds in that hand, they are placed on the board of the matching colours. If there are birds in the other hand, they are put back into the bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
