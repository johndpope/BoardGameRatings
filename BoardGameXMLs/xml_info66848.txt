			<description>The board game, which is similar to Snakes and Ladders, was developed as part of the World Health Organization evidence-based reproductive health care training package. It is an innovative and creative method, which enables participants to put into action the knowledge gained from a preceding training workshop. It can also be used as a stand-alone learning tool. The game was developed with a rural setting in mind, highlighting some of the logistical and health-related problems encountered in under-resourced countries&lt;br/&gt;In the game the players need answer correctly the questions about Health Care. &lt;br/&gt;The game is a roll and move and each position has a question about the theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.mrc.ac.za/cochrane/boardgame.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.mrc.ac.za/cochrane/boardgame.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
