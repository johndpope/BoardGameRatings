			<description>The game is a simple way to introduce children to the world of route planning, helping them develop their logic and spatial intelligence skills, with 46 challenges.&lt;br/&gt;For each challenge, you need to work out the right route for getting your playing piece to its destination.&lt;br/&gt;Each scene has different coloured paths, interrupted by circular spaces.&lt;br/&gt;Look at the objectives on the game card, then take the number of bars indicated on the card to complete your route.&lt;br/&gt;Look at the different possible routes in the scene, then place the bars in the correct order on the white spaces on the game card.&lt;br/&gt;Move your piece in the same way you have placed the bars on the game card to see if you have plotted your route correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you are more familiar with the game, you can challenge your friends to see who can complete the game card first. &lt;br/&gt;Playing side-by-side, each player takes 3 coloured bars. Take the CITY or PLANET scene of your choice, together with the appropriate playing piece and game cards. Place the scene and the playing piece in the centre of the table and put the game cards in a pile. Pick a game card from the pack, then place it in front of you. The players must try to solve the game card at the same time. To plot your course, place the bars closest to you directly onto the board (instead of on the card). When a player thinks they have found the right solution they must say &amp;ldquo;STOP&amp;rdquo;. If you have placed the bars on the board correctly you keep the card. If not, the other player gets to keep the card. Continue the game by choosing another game card. The winner is the first person to get 3 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
