							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MacArthur&#039;s War</name>
									
			<description>From the Microgame Design Group website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;MacArthur's War is a simulation of the Korean War, simulating the historical campaign as well as allowing for what could have happened if MacArthur had been given the go-ahead to launch his attacks against Communist China. Players assume the roles of Douglas MacArthur, commander in chief of the United Nations forces, or the Chinese general staff. Confronted with the Korean crisis, players can manage the conflict at a limited level or escalate it into a Asian or Global showdown between the superpowers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The 17&amp;quot;x22&amp;quot;map (with 3/4&amp;quot; hexes) spans from Pusan to Harbin. The 216 5/8&amp;quot; counters (die-cut and back-printed) show divisional level forces of the KPA and ROK,the UN and PLA, the US and the USSR.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
