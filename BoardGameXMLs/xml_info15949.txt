			<description>Spellstones combines the strategy of a card-based spellcasting duel with the hand-eye coordination of a real-time action game. The result is a fast-paced puzzle game requiring quick thinking and even quicker fingers! Players manipulate sixteen stone tiles to form the patterns (Runes) needed to cast spells at their opponents. Will your Fireball best your opponent's Heat Shield? It all depends on who can build his Runes the fastest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consists of a rulebook, 32 &amp;quot;stone&amp;quot; tiles (cut from a stone-like flooring material and hand-painted; this game was most definitely a basement production by the designer), and two complete sets of spell cards (DTP quality). Rated for ages 10-adult. Each set supports 2 players, so you can add more sets for multi-player battles. The game comes with 22 spell cards for each player for use in a 2-player game, and 16 more for each player that are designed for multi-player use only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
