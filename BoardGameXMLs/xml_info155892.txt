			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Not more of you lousy interlopers! Seems more and more of you come this way each week. Well, them downstairs 'as 'ad enough of it, see? You lot always cause trouble and make it damned hard for us to do our job. So, bugger off back where you come from or I, Og K'Cab the Mighty, will see you all dead long before you reach MY world. Understand?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come walk between the spheres, take the Lejendary Road from our mundane Earth to the fantastic lands of the Lejendary Earth world. Your journey will not be without peril for the forces of the nether world will attempt to stop you: demonlings, twisted trees, bizarre spirits, malformed giants and snake-headed monsters all stand between you and your goal. Thankfully there are friends to be met too, friends that will award adventurers with the Abilities and equipment needed to survive on this dangerous inter-dimensional path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unique quest allows players to sit down and begin their adventure at once, with no knowledge of the rules and without creating Avatars as the adventure progresses. Lejendary Advanture has never been easier to play. Now you may introduce your friends to role-playing without describing the rules, or anything about how the game is played, beforehand; the players will learn everything they need to know easily, while enjoying a fantastic adventure. With advice and tips for the LM this scenario is ideal for beginners while offering challenges and excitement for even the most experienced players of fantasy role playing games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
