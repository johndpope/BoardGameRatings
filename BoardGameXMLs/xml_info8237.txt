			<description>A minimalist production, the 55-card deck comes with a stack of score sheets and a thin rule booklet in a simple card box. No indication of the author, publisher or date. It says &amp;quot;Patented&amp;quot; but never gives the patent number. The game is (Canadian) bilingual; judging by the quality of the English, I'd say the author and company are French.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards come in several colors and range from 1 to 10 pins, plus Strike, Free and Channel cards. Using two decks allow up to six to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the &amp;quot;300&amp;quot; game (there are four more games), each player gets 10 cards. The discard deck is started with one card from the draw deck. On his turn, a player plays two cards in front of him (forming a bowling &amp;quot;square&amp;quot;), one from his hand, the other from either deck (in any sequence) --this is his score for this square.&lt;br/&gt;The two cards should not total more than 10 (a &amp;quot;spare&amp;quot;); if they do, the second card is a &amp;quot;channel&amp;quot; and placed in the discard deck.&lt;br/&gt;If the first card played is a Strike, the second card is ignored and discarded. If the second card is a Strike, however, it is again treated as a Channel.&lt;br/&gt;A Channel played first becomes a Spare if a Strike or 10 is played second. A Channel played second is a Channel.&lt;br/&gt;The 10 is a Spare if preceded by a Free (which otherwise replaces any other card); a 10 can be discarded when played second. A 10 played first forces the second card to be discarded and scores zero (two Channels).&lt;br/&gt;A square of 6-9 deducts 10 points from one's score.&lt;br/&gt;A perfect game scores 300 points, hence the name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
