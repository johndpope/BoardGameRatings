							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Villainy Codex II: Return of Terror Inc.</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They tried to poison him and dumped him in the ocean in his melted armor. They stole his technology, his wealth and bombed his island fortress until barely an island remained. The world thought him dead, and they were right Professor Muerte is indeed dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the ashes a phoenix will arise the legend says. He is back now and ready to have his vengeance on the traitors and all who have wronged him. Terror Inc. is now reformed stronger and more powerful than ever. Now it is time to extract his pound of flesh. Professor Muerte is dead, now there is only Muerte. The day of reckoning is here;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There shall be blood!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
