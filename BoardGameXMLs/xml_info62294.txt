			<description>Dice-Ball Baseball Board Game 1930's.   &lt;br/&gt;manufactured by the The Educational Toy Company in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada &lt;br/&gt;The game is approx. 20 X 20&amp;quot;. with a green felt type playing surface with the layout of a ball field and spaces&lt;br/&gt;for outs,runs, hits,  etc. The board shows players in old uniforms and hats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a single die which has a pair of smaller dice inside the larger one. That single large die is labeled on 4 sides and also has 2 clear sides that you can see into.  The marked sides show a STRIKE, a BALL, a FOUL Ball and these are in fact the results of the die roll if those sides how up on the roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BUT  If the clear side of this large DIE is rolled you can see inside of the die and what you see are a pair of dice, one colored red, and one colored green. If you can see dice instead of a pitch then what has been rolled on those dice determine the results of the play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also one of the Clear sides also has red dot on it. The results of the dice looking through this side of the clear facing are different than results determined if looking through the clear side without the red dot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results code shows what happens depending on the dice roll and if men are on differing bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information about this game was gathered and approval given from BUTCH7999 and his BASEBALL GAME SITE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
