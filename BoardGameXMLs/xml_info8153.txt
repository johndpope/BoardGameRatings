			<description>A racing game where each player starts with the same hand of cards The game is all about positioning and slipstreaming. When you move, you want to position yourself for a slipstream and also so that other players can't position themselves behind you for the same reason.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third in Grapac Japan's series of games under the label &amp;quot;Aeronaut&amp;quot;. They are meant to be very fast playing (around 15-30 minutes). They all come in a file-type holder, with the inside of the file being the game board, and all of the components attached to the ring-binder in bags and pouches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
