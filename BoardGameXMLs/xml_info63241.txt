			<description>The game board has 4 x 4 &amp;quot;scoring fields&amp;quot;. Around each of these, there are four &amp;quot;playing fields&amp;quot; (with each playing field between two scoring fields counting for both of them), but some the playing fields overlap so there are only 40 playing fields in total. On the scoring fields, there are scoring chips numbered 1-4 (face-down).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active player takes a playing chip and places it on any of the playing fields, then flips over a scoring chip and checks its value. If it is equal to the number of adjacent playing chips, the active player scores (keeps the chip). If the value is higher, it is put back (face-down again). If it is smaller, the chip is removed from the game. Towards the end of the game, there are no more new playing chips, but the old ones can be moved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there are no more scoring chips on the board. The player with most scoring chip points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
