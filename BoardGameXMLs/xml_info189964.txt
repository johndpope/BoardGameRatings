			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes this game system different that the others out there? Primarily, the individual components come together to allow a great degree of flexibility in character design while stemming off some of the confusion that can come from that flexibility. The various components interconnect with each other but without losing their separate definition. For example, Attributes influence Skills, but both still serve different functions on their own and are clearly defined. With well defined components, the game can be clearly tweaked and balanced to the preferences of a game designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
