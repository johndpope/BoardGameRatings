			<description>Publisher's summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demons have beset the realm of Rookvale. Rumours are spreading through the alleyways of each city-province as to where fault lies. Maybe this incursion was planned and bated by patriarchs in neighboring lands. While the origin is unclear, the situation is crystalline: demons roam Rookvale and have started evolving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re one of the bands of misfits, heroes, and dark-art apprentices tasked with fighting back this incursion. But the reigning Demon Lords are nigh invulnerable to mortal weapons. The only way one has a chance at defeating a Demon Lord is to wield the power of a Demon Lieutenant. And in turn, defeating a Demon Lieutenant would require the aid of a Greater Demon. And so begins the circle of weakening, binding, summoning, and controlling. To defeat demons, one must control demons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rookvale is a game of cinematic tactical combat based on the Anima Prime engine. The text is short, suitable for those already versed in the art of roleplaying games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core rules are available in print-on-demand format as well as full &amp;amp; minimal PDF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
