							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Visions of the Aftermath: The Boomtown</name>
									
			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the not-so-distant future, after the Great Apocalypse. Only the strongest and smartest have survived. It has been several months since The Day Time Stopped...several months since The Bomb...several months since you've seen the sun or felt its warmth. You can't last too much longer on the supplies left in your shelter. Soon you must leave your sanctuary. You have no idea what waits outside, other than the radiation. Scientists predicted aberrant weather, continuing natural disasters, overgrown vegetation, barren wastelands, and The Hordes: nomadic survivors devastated by radiation and its sickness. All this--and more--awaits you...outside. You can try to merely survive...or you can attempt to rebuild civilization from the ashes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visions of Aftermath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Realistically simulates the conditions of a post-nuclear world by using thousands of computer-controlled variables to create an infinite number of terrains and scenarios. &lt;br/&gt;     Allows from 1 to 16 players to challenge themselves and each other. &lt;br/&gt;     Imposes no limits. You create the goals, from mere survival to world domination. &lt;br/&gt;     Provides the framework for you to rebuild civilization anew as you seek the knowledge of the past and plan the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visions of Aftermath brings to the art of gaming a program which is impossible to outgrow...or to master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
