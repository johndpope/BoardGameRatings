			<description>Rise of the Triad is a first-person shooter developed by Interceptor Entertainment and published by Apogee Software for Windows in 2013. The game is a remake of the original Rise of the Triad: Dark War published by Apogee in 1995.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay has been touted as a throwback to classic first-person shooters of the 1990s such as the original Rise of the Triad . It features non-linear level design, a high rate of player movespeed, multiple playable characters and an arsenal of over the top explosive weaponry recreated from the original game. The game consists of 20 levels (plus four secret levels) spread across four episodes as well as an online multiplayer component which features Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag game modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Rise of the Triad (2013 video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
