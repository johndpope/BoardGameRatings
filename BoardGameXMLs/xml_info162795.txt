							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hammered: The Shady Rogue Expansion</name>
									
			<description>This is an expansion for the game Hammered where you play as a group of dwarves on a pub-crawl. This expansion adds a shady underground style theme to the game with a new character, a new tavern and a number of event cards that give the core game a sense that there is a seedy underbelly to these quaint taverns!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game-play is the same however the expansion adds some additional rules by giving the new character a perk, the new tavern a house rule and a couple of cards that allow other players to acquire the new perk as well. This particular perk allows players to get gold even when they lose wagers and to pay less for drinks in the new tavern, everyone else has to pay extortionate prices!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
