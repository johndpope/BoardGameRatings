							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Napoleon</name>
									
			<description>Napoleon is a set of miniatures rules covering one of the most popular periods. The rules are quite simple but, as is becoming common, they are backed up with many pages of colour illustrations, modelling tips and relevant history. There are 232 pages in this large volume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Napoleon contains a unique set of entertaining rules that are flexible enough to be used with almost any basing conventions. It also includes many army lists for the most popular Napoleonic armies, plus advanced rules covering such diverse subjects as pontoon bridges, grand battery fire, ground conditions, setting fire to buildings, friendly fire and ambulances!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Napoleon also features articles on painting and collecting Napoleonic models plus many other sections detailing uniforms and historical background. For the miniature painters and collectors, Kevin Dallimore has added his own article on painting Napoleonic models using his unique style. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
