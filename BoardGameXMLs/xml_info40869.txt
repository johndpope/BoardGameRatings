			<description>This is game for the Decktet card game-system, loosely based on Waving Hands by Richard Bartle. Players become wizards casting spells and trying to eliminate all their opponents. Spells need both energy runes and activation runes. Players play cards in front of them, one after the other each turn, forming their spell sequence. When a card with an activation rune is played, they choose which energy runes to use to cast a variety of effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike in Waving Hands, the spell table is very small with just 10 spells which are grouped by the type of activation rune needed: Moons (spells directed at the caster for protection or healing), Wyrms (spells directed at an opponent, usually damaging) and Knots (more complex effects that can be played on both caster or opponents). Also the fact that you have a hand of cards and are limited to those cards for play introduces an element of hand management and randomness not present in Waving Hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules can be read at: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://decktet.wikidot.com/game&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://decktet.wikidot.com/game&lt;/a&gt;:dueling-runes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a pocket mod version of the rules too: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://decktet.wikidot.com/local--files/game&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://decktet.wikidot.com/local--files/game&lt;/a&gt;:dueling-runes/duelinrunespocketmod.pdf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
