			<description>The cat and the mice are placed on the gameboard. The yellow tokens are set aside. The blue token is used in case of a tie. Players can move their mouse by tapping the wheel to the left or right. As the player turns the wheel, the turntable rotates the mouse.&lt;br/&gt;As Claude, the cat, begins to moving around the gameboard, all players at the same time quickly turns their mousemover wheels, trying to keep their mice away from Claude's mouth. If a mouse is caught by Claude's teeth, then that mouse has been catnipped! All play stops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The owner of the mouse takes a yellow token and places the mouse back on its turntable. The game continues untill all of the yellow tokens have been collected. The player with the fewest tokens wins the game and is the Big Cheese!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In case of a tie, the players have a play-off round. The first player caught by Claude's teeth takes the blue token. The other player wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
