			<description>Journey of 1000 Stars is essential arcade zen. Bounce on clouds, collect stars, and don't fall down. Collect your companions as you approach 50 stars, then your journey truly begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the tradition of Flappy Bird there is no difficulty curve to crash into. After 50 stars the game doesn't get any harder, it just stays hard. Scale this cliff then pick your way carefully along its edge toward 1000. Stay calm. Stay attentive. Stay alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daily statistics report your efforts, your triumphs, and your skill, to help you on the long, long journey to 1000*.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1000 Stars is a semi-sequel to Cumulo Nimbers, the 2012 party favourite developed for the Toronto International Film Festival ComicsVsGames event and then exhibited around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The current human record is 99 stars, however testing by artificial intelligence has verified that 1000 stars can be collected reliably by a player of sufficient skill. A score of 15 is pretty good, and anything above 30 is world class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
