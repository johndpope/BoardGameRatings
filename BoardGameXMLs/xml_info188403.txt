			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zaon was professionally developed and was planned for commercial release.  It went through at least seven major playtest revisions between 1997 and 2002 when the &amp;quot;Errata Version 7.0 Rewrite&amp;quot; version was released for playtest.  Shortly thereafter the publisher discontinued development and the game was never commercially released.  The final playtest version is complete and playable, missing only final art.  The cartography is complete and impressive, and development standards are very high.  However, Zaon is a peculiar and atypical role-playing game that uses non-standard terminology and procedures that apparently was intended to support a line of licensed toys and other products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
