							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cupido</name>
									
			<description>The planet Cupido is a peaceful and serene place to live, but its single population leads an intense social life. A young Cupidoian who wants to go out on a date must find nine other Cupidoians of different sexes whom it likes, who all like it, and who all like each other. Cupidoian parents receive government subsidies to help offset their phone bills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out of necessity, Cupidoians have a more hard-boiled view of romance than earthlings do. When they reach adolescence, they decide on exactly what they are willing to settle for in a relationship. They do not accept anything less or hold out for anything more. Most earthlings behave in the opposite manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While one God of Love is generally enough for Earth, Cupido requires several. Each player of the game is an invisible cupid, hovering around a small town that contains 100 single Cupidoians, ten of each sex. The first player who can get ten Cupidoians of different sexes to marry each other is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cupido is a game for two to six players that takes about a half-hour for experienced players to play. The game requires a deck of 100 cards and a &amp;quot;love dart&amp;quot; prop [such as a matchstick or a coin] for each player. Each player will also need a long space on the table to spread out ten cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will have to construct the card deck from images available on this web site. When the deck is completed, look at the cards. Each card represents a Cupidoian. It shows the Cupidoian's name and picture, and three pieces of information about it: it's sex, it's attributes, and it's desire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
