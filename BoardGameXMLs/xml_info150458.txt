							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Call You a Fool: OGL/ Pathfinder Adventures Inspired by Classic Rock</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;What do you need new bands for? Everyone knows rock attained perfection in 1974. It&amp;rsquo;s a scientific fact!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;--Homer Simpson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this book you will find four complete short adventures for the Pathfinder/Open Games License system, including printable, full-color 1&amp;rdquo;-square map tiles. Written for a variety of character levels and play styles, these adventures all draw their inspiration from masterpieces of rock music. Turn the pages to find such quests of renown as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waiting for the Eastern Glow: Adventurers of great renown, the heroes have been summoned in an hour of most desperate struggle. The ruined castle of Evermore has been besieged by the forces of darkness. A force of the undead, led by Lord Night, together with his dark hordes, has arrived outside the gates of the home of Queen Alena. The heroes must fight to withstand the siege . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hybrid Children: The heroes have been captured by some skum (also known as quo-toa) who intend to sacrifice the males among them to an emissary of Dagon when It next emerges from the sea--and then to utilize the females for their repulsive breeding ritual. Also &amp;lsquo;on the menu&amp;rsquo; that same night are a group of orc sea-raiders similarly captured by the skum. Languishing in bamboo cages on the deserted isle which the skum inhabit, the heroes must decide whether to try and make common cause with the orcs in order to escape when they are brought to the sea shore that night to greet--and then feed--Dagon&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Great Messenger&amp;rsquo; . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Call You a Fool: A hero has heard tell of a cache of gold left behind in the wilderness by a witch now long-dead. Unusually for such a tale, this treasure hoard is apparently unguarded and lies not within a labyrinth, castle or tomb but rather is simply buried under a marked stone in the woods just a few days journey away . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
