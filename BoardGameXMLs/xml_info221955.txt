							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wages of War: The Uncooperative Siege Game</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wages of War is a strategy game of medieval siege warfare! Manage resources to produce weapons, and hire soldiers to wield them in battle as you send wave after wave to attack the enemy castle! The player who inflicts the most damage on the castle by the time it is destroyed shall win the game and seize the glory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round, the active player will issue an Order to one of the 5 Encampments surrounding the castle. Each player benefits from the Order based on how many Buildings they have in the Encampment. Use these orders to your advantage in order to muster your army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Train swordsmen, axemen, and bowmen, and send them to attack the castle with the support of siege towers, trebuchets, and cannons!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plan your attack wisely, for when the Attack Order is issued you must not only beat the enemy force, but you must be able to sustain the casualties yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
