			<description>A One-Round Living Greyhawk Duchy of Urnst Regional Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is Springtime in the Duchy. The birds are chirping, the flowers are beginning to blossom, and one of the noble houses of the Duchy has decided to renovate an old monastery that has long been abandoned. They have hired you to make sure it is safe for their preparing team of carpenters, masons and landscapers to work quickly and efficiently. With your help, the idle rich of the Duchy will have a new place to sweat out the toils of their merchanting and soak away the knots of industrious rule, continuing to manage things with the cool, calm demeanor that has made the Duchy the stable, prosperous place it is today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is for characters level 1 through 9, but only if you are brave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
