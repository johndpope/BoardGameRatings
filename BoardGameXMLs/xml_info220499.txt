The surviving Moai conducted bloody wars to get in control of the limited remaining land and the civilization fell into decline. Facing this sad situation, some of the Moai decided to leave their homeland, venturing into space, seeking for new grounds to live.....&lt;br/&gt;In AD 20XX, descendants of these Moai astronauts have returned to our planet to investigate their ancestry. They are convinced of the presence of Rapa Rapa's, sleeping in an ancient Moai temple on the bottom of the ocean. You will become a member of the Moai expedition team. Look into the ruin and complete the map to guide the Rapa Rapas out of the temple. Gather them in one place to take them up into the UFO. However:.., a lot of energy has been consumed to return to Earth.
