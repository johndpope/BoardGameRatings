			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smoothie Kaboom is a kickstarter promotional collaboration between Minion Games and Thunderworks Games, combining the components of Blend Off! and Cosmic Kaboom into a third, hybrid game that plays like a combination of the two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Smoothie Kaboom, players will race their ships around the galaxy to collect fruit from different planets to create smoothies. Players take turns flicking their ships. If they collide with a planet that is currently producing, they can collect the fruit. When they have the right fruit to complete a smoothie order, they return to their base to cash in for points. The game ends when all smoothie orders have been filled. The winner is the one with the most gold stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
