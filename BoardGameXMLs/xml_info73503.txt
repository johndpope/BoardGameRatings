							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Golf: The Game</name>
									
			<description>GOLF: THE GAME plays just like the real game of golf.  You will have drives, putts, and shots from fairways, bunkers, rough, and water.  You can hit shots out-of-bounds, into hazards or water, or score eagles (two under par for the hole) with the best shots of your career.  Scoring is also just like the real game of golf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be asked questions on the rules of golf (coded to the 1984 USGA rule book), golf history, major tournaments, famous players, courses, and general golf knowledge.  Since almost all the questions are true/false or multiple choice, you may find a non-golfer being the winner of GOLF: THE GAME.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTENTS:&lt;br/&gt;contains one two-sided playing board, eighty game booklets (40 Front Nine [green] and 40 Back Nine [blue]), 147 Go For Broke cards, 50 Pro Play cards, score cards, six denominations of play money (500; 1,000; 5,000; 10,000; 25,000; 50,000) , two dice, and four player tees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
