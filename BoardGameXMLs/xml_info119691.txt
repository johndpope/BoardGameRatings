			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Agent&lt;br/&gt;You are alone in foreign territory: your superiors are out of touch, and your contacts compromised. The Femme Fatale is a mystery, but an alluring one. The Officer continues to play along with your &amp;ldquo;gentleman&amp;rsquo;s agreement&amp;rdquo;, but something has to give soon, and you can&amp;rsquo;t complete your Mission without finding out what he knows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Officer&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes you wonder if you&amp;rsquo;re addicted to the chase; that must be why you haven&amp;rsquo;t arrested the Agent yet. You tell the Bureau you need further proof, but it&amp;rsquo;s an open secret while you continue your cat-and-mouse game. The Femme Fatale could be&lt;br/&gt;the Agent&amp;rsquo;s downfall &amp;mdash; if you think you can trust her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Femme Fatale&lt;br/&gt;Double agent, mole, plant... You&amp;rsquo;re not even sure of your own loyalties these days. The Officer is a bumbling fool, but you can use him. The Agent represents an opportunity for you, but for what? To get out for good? To switch sides? To advance yourself? Does it even matter now?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
