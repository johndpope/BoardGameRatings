			<description>The players assemble fishes from cards in different colors. For this, they roll a die. With a result of one or two fish, they take the corresponding number of fish cards. When they roll a worm, they skip a turn. &lt;br/&gt;A completed fish is swimming to a worm pile, trying to eat as many worms as possible. For this, the player keeps flipping over worm cards and can keep all worms in any of the colors of his/her fish. When a worm in the wrong color is flipped open, the fish is discarded and all worms are lost. &lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect 16 worms is the winner (or most worms, when all worm cards are used up)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
