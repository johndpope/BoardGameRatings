			<description>The players start at space 0 and have to travel around the donkey to the spaces 1 to 6. They use donkeytails for playing pieces. Movement is determined by a die. The first player to roll a 6 gets the gray donkeytail and starts the game. The other players get to chose another tail as soon as they roll a 6 too. All players try to get on the same space as the gray tail to excange the tail for their own. Only the player with the gray tail can win the game when he reaches space 6. On the spaces marked with &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; the donkey steps on the tail and the player may not move again, till the first player has reached or passed space 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
