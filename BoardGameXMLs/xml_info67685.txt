							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ghoul&#039;s Mausoleum</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rusty iron gate emits a loud unnerving sound while the fighter forces it open. Inside the mausoleum, a stone sarcophagus lie opened, its lid broken. In the darkness, something is watching you: cold eyes full of unlife seem to stare at you from the shadows...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mausoleum is surrounded by a small graveyard, with many tombs opened and desecrated. Some marble steps lead to a raised area, surrounded by an once beautiful stone railing. A rusty iron gate still protects the inner tomb. Beyond the gate stands the eerie sepulcher. Some small windows dot the walls and old bracers and candelabra lie scattered on the floor. The broken pieces of the sarcophagus&amp;rsquo; lid surround a raised dais at the far end of the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some hints to use the mausoleum:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     It is common knowledge the mausoleum is infested by vicious undeads. A noble, claiming to be an heir of the ancient owners of the mausoleum, hires the PCs for cleaning up the area from the monsters. Actually, the noble is the father of Jonathan, a tomb robber who disappeared in the mausoleum some years ago along with his brother Alfius. The man is tracking his sons but none would help him if the truth is known, so he claims to be a noble searching for its origins. The man&amp;rsquo;s sons were both transformed in ghouls. The man will insist to accompany the PCs and when he discover the doom of his sons he turns against the party, in a blind attempt to &amp;ldquo;save&amp;rdquo; his beloved sons.&lt;br/&gt;     While camping in the wilderness the PCs hear screams in the distance. Investigating, they find a campsite with gruesome remains of human bodies dismembered. A closer search reveals the camp belonged to bandits and that a living prisoner was carried away from some kind of undeads. The minions of a Ghoul Duke ate the bandits and brought with them a female human who was formerly captive in the bandit&amp;rsquo;s camp. The PCs must save the girl before she become food for the Ghoul Duke in the mausoleum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Villain featured in this product is Jhntehnn a Ghoul Duke. A complete background story and a paragraph on his combat tactics fleshes out this unique villain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
