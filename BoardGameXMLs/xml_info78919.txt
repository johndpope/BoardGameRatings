			<description>Five Years Before The Encablossa War&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of half Vampires, led by Valdemar, united the warring Dark Elf factions to establish a single Dark Elf kingdom in the easterly Bersian continent. They called this kingdom Vellond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vellend was the first unified kingdom of Dark Elves in the continent's history, and this marked the first time the Dark Elves had been ruled by another race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Valdemar knew that the dark Elves would revolt unless given a new target for their anger and resentment. Aiming to expand his territory and control the internal disturbance, Valdemar used Vellond to invade Arein and annex Hexter. Arein was an autonomous community of Elves within the Hironeiden territory. The dark Elves' hatred for the Elves made Arein the perfect outlet for their rage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before Vellond's appeasement policy, dozens of Ogre and Orc tribes inhabited Hexter, where they coexisted peacefully. Vellond selected an ambitious yet weak tribe from among the Orcs and began supporting it with military supplies. As expected, the tribe began absorbing other tribes within eastern Hexter, and Hexter was soon engulfed in a war between pro-Vellond and anti-Vellond factions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vellond's plan seemed to be working perfectly. But even Valdemar could not foresee every possibility. A single detail, overlooked by Vellond, not only foiled the plans of that nation, but plunged the entire continent of Bersia into turmoil. And so began the Encablossa War...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Kingdom Under Fire: Heroes , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
