							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tectonia</name>
									
			<description>Tectonia is a boardgame in which the players become a chieftain of an archaic tribe which wage war against the other tribes.&lt;br/&gt;Tectonia is a young world, the tectonic plates are still moving. That means: start your game with an individual formed world of water, grassland and rocky tiles and change the world during the game. For the game setup you get a huge water map on which the grassland and rocky tiles where put on top. By replacing or removing the grassland and rocky tiles you create the boardgame map and change it during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play:  &lt;br/&gt;Players recruit warriors depending on the number of owned areas, tribal territory size and reinforcement cards.&lt;br/&gt;Attack adjaced areas with your warriors. Battles are solved with battle and defense dice. &lt;br/&gt;Establish buildings, which allow you to recruit stronger units, which use stronger battle or defense dice.&lt;br/&gt;Proclaim tribal territories to increase your number of new warriors for the next round.&lt;br/&gt;Terraforming allows you to replace or remove a grassland or rocky tile from the map. Use it as a Weapon to force your opponent to remove from a becoming water area or strenght your defense with rocky tiles at your tribal territory boarder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the game:&lt;br/&gt;Become the &amp;quot;Emperor of Tectonia&amp;quot; by owning victory areas or form alliances and force your opponents to surrender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
