							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Therianthrope</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This isn't a werewolf or were-class that lets you choose from a handful of common animals: it has been specifically designed with flexibility in mind. You start out by choosing a number of features from a list (such as increased damage, size, armor, and various other benefits), and as you level up you can choose to become better at changing your shape (and gain more features), stronger, tougher, sneaking around and ambushing creatures, blending in with a crowd, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This flexibility extends beyond what you can turn into and how your character can grow: there are three general backgrounds to determine how you acquired your powers. You can be cursed, inherit it, or learn it through magic. You even get to choose a move from another class, so you can be, for example, a cleric cursed by her god, a fighter that was afflicted while hunting a werewolf down, or a wizard or witch that discovered the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains three files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first is a letter-sized character sheet that uses our new character sheet layout (so we could fit the twenty-six advanced moves).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other two are digest-sized PDFs, one in color, the other in black and white to make it easier to print at home. They both contain:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The therianthrope class.&lt;br/&gt;    Silvered weapons, new types of armor, and animal armor.&lt;br/&gt;    The cursed therianthrope compendium class.&lt;br/&gt;    Nine moves for if you want to better evoke a kitsune.&lt;br/&gt;    A Director's Cut with questions to ask yourself when rolling up a therianthrope, explanations/clarifications for some of the moves, advice on permitting more multiclassing, nine extra/variant moves that we couldn't fit on the sheet (including one for if your animal form is your normal shape), and rules for companion characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
