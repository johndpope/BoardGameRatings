			<description>Worldcup is a simple game of rolling dice for 2 players with theme football. The game board represents a football-field divided into zones with a black number (in favour of the orange player) and zones with a white number (for the red player). Players have to reach their opponent&amp;rsquo;s goal by throwing 2 dice at once. Starting from the middle they put the ball forward on the opponent&amp;rsquo;s half as many places as they have thrown. A player may continue during the same turn until the ball lands on a zone with a number in the opponent&amp;rsquo;s colour. The ball keeps moving to and from until a goal has been scored (reaching no. 45 exactly). Then the other player starts in the middle again.Some zones are yellow-coloured which represent certain events like free kick, penalty or corner with their respective special actions. The player who scored most goals during playing time of 2x15 minutes wins the game. If both players scored an equal amount of goals it is a draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
