							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ultima Thule: Mythic Scandinavia</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the universe began, there was only a chasm so immense that even the gods would become dizzy looking into it, known as the Ginnugagap. It was here that Yggdrasil &amp;mdash; the World Tree &amp;mdash; would lay down its roots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultima Thule: Mythic Scandinavia is the sourcebook of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, and Greenland. It describes the denizens of these lands, delving into their culture, rulers, customs, calendar, myths, and deities. It talks about their often-violent relationships with Mythic Europe's other nations &amp;mdash; England, Ireland, Scotland, and Russia, to name but a few. Scandinavian mythology is covered extensively, from otherworldly places to gods, creatures, and races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultima Thule is more than a background manual, though. It provides exhaustive rules for Norse character creation. In addition to rules for grogs and companions, new mystic companions are introduced. The vitkir are runemasters who draw their might from chiseled and drawn characters of power. A completely new system of magic is presented that allows these characters to loose the power of the runes. Finnish wind wizards are also presented; they provide a new twist on weather magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any roleplayer with an interest in Mythic Scandinavia should have Ultima Thule!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
