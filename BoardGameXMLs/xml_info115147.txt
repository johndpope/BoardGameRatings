			<description>The ranch house ruckus gets a double dose of fun with this splendid set of games. Spend a day or two at the farm with the title that introduced new animals, upgrades, and even more surprises than the original with Farm Frenzy 2. In Farm Frenzy Pizza Party, making pizza is the name of the game with even more levels, goods, and fun challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A total of 180 frantic levels await you as you care for farm animals. Collect their produce, and send it off to market for a big profit. Use your earnings to upgrade your buildings, transportation, and more! Short on supplies? Send your plane to pick up what you need and be careful of those ravenous bears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
