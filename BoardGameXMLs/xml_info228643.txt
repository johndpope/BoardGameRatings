			<description>In Sup&amp;eacute;rieur: Des Teufels Gebetbuch, designed by author Markus Heitz, who wrote the mystery thriller Des Teufels Gebetbuch (The Devil's Prayer Book), players must adopt their best poker manner to play this bluffing game in which players have a and of only a single card. Each round, they must decide whether to leave, stay, or perhaps even raise the stakes. In the end, whoever has the highest card takes the pot &amp;mdash; as long as they don't draw the card of death, which eliminates them from the round immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
