							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Starship Sneak</name>
									
			<description>User Summary: An entry for the  &amp;quot;Sneaky Sci Fi Game Design Contest&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your starship has been captured, your crew are being systematically executed and soon you will join them. From your cell you can hear the fusion reactors running - the enemy has taken your ship into warp. No doubt they have set course for your homeworld, using the coordinates in the ship's database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your way to be executed, you manage to overwhelm and kill the guards. Is your only chance to save your homeworld destroying this ship before it arrives?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this game is to sneak around your subjugated starship, while avoiding the guards, to collect item cards which will allow you to either retake your starship or destroy it to prevent it remaining in enemy hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
