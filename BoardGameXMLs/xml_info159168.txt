			<description>Each player gets 5 event cards and place them year-side down on the table.&lt;br/&gt;Now the first player takes the top event card from the deck and place it year-side up on the table and start laying the first serie on the table either before or after the drawn card. Other players follow him similar way placing the cards before, after of between the cards on the serie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a player's turn, if he suspects that there is an error on the table, he may accuse the previous players. All cards are turned over one by one and checked the chronology. If everything is OK the current player draw a new event card as a penalty. If something is wrong the last player draw a new card.&lt;br/&gt;The new serie starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who gets rid of their cards first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
