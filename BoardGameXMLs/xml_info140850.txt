			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;rdquo;Abortion is not our &amp;ldquo;golden calf&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;. We do not worship or idolize choice. We&amp;rsquo;re quite well-rounded in our activism&amp;hellip;.The right and access to reproductive options, including abortion, are among the several rights necessary for women to be able to fully participate in society. It is not the only right, but it is a fundamental right for full participation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;-Carolyn Marie Fugit, &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.roederwatch.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.roederwatch.com&lt;/a&gt;. January 16, 2010&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The clinic creation system here allows players to simulate the day to day operations of an embattled abortion clinic in the war-torn future of 2107 CE. It allows characters playing Neo-Witch Midwives and Covenguards a chance at a different kind of heroism: away from the battlefields and black ops of most cyberpunk roleplaying games but no less dangerous, no less necessary and no less courageous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This system abstracts the running of a clinic down to a few die rolls. The abortion clinic is treated as a character in its own right- the clinic has a set of statistics, which influence the results of special skill checks made to operate the clinic and meet the challenges, both moral and military, posed by the 22nd century&amp;rsquo;s viscous and fanatical Lifer Nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frontlines of Choice was originally conceived as an adjunct (or plug-in) system for D20 Modern, and it still works well as such. The gamemaster can use the Frontlines system to generate plot points for a clinic the players have an emotional stake in. Depending on how interested the players seem in the plot hook offered by the weekly event roll, the game master can either roleplay the challenge out using the full D20 Modern rules, or just abstract it down to a few checks. Also, clinic events can be played out in the background- using the Frontlines system, the game master can easily track the ongoing story of one or even dozens of Choicer clinics. This system can generate plot hooks, or it can generate headlines, or crises for the heroes to solve after the fact- after the staff of one of these clinics fails a check, only then do the player characters become involved. The choice is yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, Frontlines of Choice is a completely stand alone quick-play resource management game. Frontlines gives gamers a different way to play out the struggles described in the Otherverse America core rulebook. Faster, more focused on problem solving and community than combat, Frontlines offers a different view of the Abortion War, one that focuses on the physicians caught in the crossfire, not the superheroes flying overhead&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
