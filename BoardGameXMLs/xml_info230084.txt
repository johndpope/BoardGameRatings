			<description>A card game for 2-6 players based on the Syrian Civil War from 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 6 factions, one of which is secretly assigned to each player, and an event deck of 37 card representing nations, organisations and activities which may have a positive or negative effect on one or more of the factions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start six faction cards (one for each faction) are placed face up in the middle of the table and 10 Victory Tokens (VT) placed on each card. Using a duplicate set of faction cards &amp;ndash; one is secretly assigned to each player and remaining faction cards removed from play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then take turns to draw 2 event cards from the top of the deck. One card is played and the other discarded.  Played events will cause some factions to gain VT and others to lose VT.  The played event is also discarded after its effects are taken.  Cards are discarded face down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the event deck has been run through twice. The player with the faction with the highest number of VT at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
