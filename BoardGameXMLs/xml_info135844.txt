			<description>In this game players are dwarves, trying to climb the magic mountain. In order to move, dwarves have to solve various tasks. On their way they gather magic feathers and diamonds. Magic feathers are used to fly over the obstacles dwarves run in.  When the first dwarf reaches the top of the mountain, game ends and the player who gathered most diamonds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This roll and move game teaches young players mathematics. In order to move players have to perform such arithmetic operations as addition, subtraction and division. Also it improves decision making skill. Players have to decide whether to gather diamond and fall into the pit (move backwards) or use magic feather and fly over the pit leaving the diamond where it is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
