			<description>Gunslingirls is set in an alternate future where the best hackers are a group of women whose virtual avatars represent famous personalities of the Wild West. The Gunslingirls are out to settle who's the fastest and most able duelist/code-cracker in the land!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes on a role of a Gunslingirl who is represented by a deck of cards. Each card has 5 Shoot cards, 5 Miss cards, and 20 Hit cards with various numerical values. Players reveal cards and engage in a virtual shoot-out once the first Shoot card is revealed. They then try to stack up as many high-value Hits as they can while using their Miss cards on other players' Hit cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, the Gunslingirl with the lowest Hit count is eliminated and play proceeds until, at long last, a single victor is declared. May the best Gunslingirl win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gunslingirls was designed as a part of BGG's June 24-Hour Design Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
