			<description>Following on from the 1974 edition of The Warlord in it's larger red box format, this version - named simply as Warlord - was the self-published blue box version, again by Mike Hayes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version of the game differed physically from the earlier version with smaller laminated mapboards, the addition of sea-spaces, and the mapboard had 56 cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play was also slightly amended too in some of the rules, it could also now contend with 7 players, and this version introduced H-Bombs as well as the existing A-Bombs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
