			<description>Players answer questions from categories selected by a makeshift one-armed bandit (the topmost card in three piles) similar to the long running television program. Jokers are wild, and two- or three-of-a-kind make for increased payouts ($50 for a single category, $100 for a pair, and $200 for a triple). First to collect $500 wins, and has an opportunity to collect $1,000 more in the bonus game. Most money over several rounds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first three editions were based on the CBS run and had the &amp;quot;Jokers &amp;amp; Devils&amp;quot; bonus round (used for most of the show's first 18 months), where players must make three &amp;quot;spins&amp;quot; of Joker-Joker-Joker and avoid any Devil card; the first spin won $100, the second $300 more and the third $600 more, for a total of $1,000. (The show itself awarded prizes of increasing value for each spin.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fourth edition, titled and based on the 1979-81 children's spin-off Joker, Joker, Joker, used the &amp;quot;Face the Devil&amp;quot; bonus (like the last 12 or so months of the CBS run and the entire 1977-86 revival) which featured &amp;quot;spinning&amp;quot; dollar amounts to reach $1,000 or more before revealing a Devil. (On the show, reaching $1,000 won an additional prize package usually valued between $2,000-$3,000; in the game, the player wins $5,000.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
