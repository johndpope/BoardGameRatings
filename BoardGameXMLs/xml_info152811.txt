							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alaska Oil Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;A Family Game Filled With Fun and Facts.&amp;quot;  Alaska Oil Game was published by Theme Games of Saratoga, California, with copyright in 1978 by M.A. Welsh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alaska Oil Game is a racing game in which 2-4 players compete to move all four of their oil barrels from the oil wells in Prudhoe Bay to their oil tankers in Port Valdez. Movement is based on drawing cards of two types: Oil Moving Cards and Pumping Station Cards. Oil Moving Cards are used to follow a longer, circuitous route, while the Pumping Station Cards use the Trans-Alaska Pipeline system that runs straight down the board for potential shortcuts. Oil Movement Cards can be drawn on any space of the board, while Pumping Station Cards may only be drawn on Pumping Station spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 52 Oil Movement Cards contain 35 movement cards with values ranging from +1 to +10, 11 themed Go Back cards with values from -2 to -9, 3 themed No Move cards, 1 Go Back to Start card and 1 Advance token to Port Valdez card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 52 Pumping Station Cards, each displaying a pumping station numbered 1-12.  Pumping Station 1 is in Prudhoe Bay while Pumping Station 12 is in Port Valdez. When drawn, the player's barrel moves to that pumping station, even if that sends the barrel in the wrong direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to move all 4 barrels to their tanker is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
