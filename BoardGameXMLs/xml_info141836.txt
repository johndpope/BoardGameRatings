For the Rebels, the &amp;bdquo;Residents&amp;ldquo;, deal the biggest damage with what you&amp;rsquo;ve got and fight a guerilla war against the invading forces. Combined the two campaigns will offer you more than 30 thrilling hours of gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;     Single Player Challenge Maps - Test your skills in different combat scenarios and keep track of your progress.&lt;br/&gt;     Live Multiplayer - Battle your friends live on the internet or via hot-seat.&lt;br/&gt;     Asynchronous Multiplayer - Take all the time you need and consider your moves.
