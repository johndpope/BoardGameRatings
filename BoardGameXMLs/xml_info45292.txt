			<description>This is an adventure module for the Middle Earth Role Playing Game (MERP).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Containing three adventures that could be played singly or as a campaign in succession, this was typical of many MERP adventure modules in that it provided a great deal of detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three adventures of this module were designed to be played by different levels of characters, a pattern ICE followed with a majority of their adventure Modules for the MERP system. The first adventure was for low level characters, while the third was for higher level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventures were:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tale of Mong Finn&lt;br/&gt;The Rescue of Alquawen&lt;br/&gt;Cleansing Cameth Brin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to these adventures, the module included detailed information on the local area, including history, flora and fauna, climate, people, politics, places, maps and more.  It also included a chapter on adventuring around Cameth Brin, with plenty of advice and ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
