			<description>A soccer replay/simulation/management game in which dice rolls and charts are used to simulate the management and gameplay results of soccer teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paraphrased from the Owzat site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Squad Ratings, attack and defence are used separately, reflecting the squad strengths of the teams. These are constructed on a goals scored and conceded basis using the final league table to ensure an accurate statistical base. Individual team ratings are used for Injuries and Suspensions, for Injuries reflecting the effect of an injury to a key player of players on the Squad strength of the team, thus ensuring that the teams with smaller and less flexible squads will suffer more severely from injury absentees, for Suspensions penalising those teams that have proved over the season that they are rarely able to field a full strength side because of this reason (e.g. Arsenal, Leeds). Cash is allocated to each club, allowing the rich to enter the transfer market more freely than their less wealthy rivals, provided the right player comes along of course. Transfers in and out, injuries and suspensions are dealt with in a fairly abstract way, as is necessary in a game that is about teams and not individuals. Opportunities will arise to strengthen the Attack/ Defensive Squad Values, players may have to be sold which have the reverse affect, all without names but all having an immediate effect on team strengths and performances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A day's fixtures, whether it be just a couple of mid-week matches or a full Saturday/Sunday programme, are valued as a complete package before any match is resolved. This involves checking for Injuries and Suspensions on a team-by-team basis and then assessing which Goal Card to use for each time by deducting one team's Defence Squad value from the opponent's Attack Squad value and rounding the result down to a figure divisible by ten. When all matches have been valued, a roll of two pairs of coloured dice per match will produce a half time score line, a second roll for each will give the full time result. Book keeping consists of marking up the result on the Results Matrix and up dating both the Cumulative Points and Goals For and Against Charts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
