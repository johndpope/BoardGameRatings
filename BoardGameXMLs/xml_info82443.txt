			<description>Shockman (known in Japan as Kaizou Choujin Schbibinman 2: Arata Naru Teki (改造町人シュビビンマン2 新たなる敵, lit. &amp;quot;Restructuring Super Human Schbibinman 2: A New Transforming Enemy&amp;quot;) is a video game developed by Hudson Soft. The game was originally released on April 27, 1991 for the PC Engine console in Japan (known as the TurboGrafx-16 in the United States), and was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in North America on April 30, 2007 and in Europe on May 4, 2007. Shockman is the only game in the Kaizou Choujin Schbibinman series to be released the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shockman takes about 2 years after Kaizou Choujin Schbibinman. Tasuke, whose name was changed to Arnold in the U.S. release, is no longer a student and works as a cook in a local restaurant. Kyapiko, whose name was changed to Sonya in the U.S. release, remains a student. Since the fall of the Dark Skull, Doc has constantly suspected that another invasion was coming sending Arnold and Sonya on searches for the new invaders although never finding anything. However, one day, after Doc is kidnapped, Arnold and Sonya find out that an alien empire led by Ryo is planning to take over the world. Also, two other villains have appeared with similar powers to Arnold and Sonya. They are dark Schbibinman named Jeeta and Mue. Arnold and Sonya must now rescue Doc, stop Ryo from taking over the world and avoid being killed by Jeeta and Mue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Shockman&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
