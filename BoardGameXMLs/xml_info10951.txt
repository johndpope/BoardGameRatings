			<description>Start Trek: The Motion Picture license published in book form with punch out pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules state that the goal is to circle the ship spaces on the board until you get six &amp;quot;deflector shields.&amp;quot; Then you are supposed to go up the &amp;quot;special corridor&amp;quot; spaces that lead to the bridge. The first player to reach the bridge wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, I see no &amp;quot;special corridor&amp;quot; spaces that lead to the bridge, so this game is broken right from the outset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;_____________________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(NOT &amp;quot;SHOUTING&amp;quot; - USING CAPS TO MAKE THIS COMMENT EASIER TO DIFFERENTIATE FROM THE ONE ABOVE).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE CORRIDOR IS THERE, BUT IS NOT OBVIOUS; IF I'D BEEN WRITING OR EDITING THE INSTRUCTIONS, I'D HAVE DESCRIBED THINGS DIFFERENTLY.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ON THE BOARD/MAP, THERE IS ONLY ONE SPACE WHICH IS NOT OFFSET WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BRIDGE (THE BRIDGE IS THE ENTIRE CENTER SECTION, AROUND WHICH THE SPACES GO). THIS ONE SPACE IS MARKED &amp;quot;BLAST&amp;quot;, AND IS BETWEEN &amp;quot;CREW'S QUARTERS&amp;quot; AND &amp;quot;WEAPONRY ROOM&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUPPOSE YOU ARE ON THE YELLOW &amp;quot;IMPULSE POWER UNIT&amp;quot; SPACE, AND SPIN A &amp;quot;4&amp;quot;: 1) BLAST, 2) WEAPONRY ROOM, 3) BLAST, 4) TURN THE CORNER = LANDS YOU INSIDE THE CIRCLE: THE BRIDGE (WHERE YOU SEE ALL OF THE PICTURED CREW MEMBERS AND THE LETTERING &amp;quot;THE STAR TREK MAKE-A-GAME BOOK&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THIS IS PROBABLY AN EXAMPLE OF LACK OF TESTING. THE PEOPLE WHO CAME UP WITH THIS LUCK-BASED RUDIMENTARY GAME, WERE SO FAMILIAR WITH ITS LAYOUT THAT THEY THOUGHT THE &amp;quot;CORRIDOR&amp;quot; WOULD BE OBVIOUS TO EVERYONE ELSE. IF THEY'D ONLY PRESENTED THIS TO SOMEONE ELSE, THAT SOMEONE WOULD HAVE BEEN AS CONFUSED AS THE REST OF US, PROMPTING IMPROVEMENT TO EITHER THE MARKINGS, THE INSTRUCTIONS, OR BOTH.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IT DOES APPEAR TO BE THAT, ONCE YOU LAND ON THE BRIDGE BY EXACT COUNT, THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL ROLL OF A &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, REQUIRED TO REACH THE CREW.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALL THE BEST!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
