			<description>There is a grid of 6x6 squares. Each square is covered by a tile which contains three trivia questions. A player rolls two dice, determining the coordinates of the tile they land on. Another player reads out the first question, when answered right, the answering player gets 1-4 victory points and the next question is read out. If any of the answers is wrong, it is the next player's turn. Whoever collects 100 points first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
