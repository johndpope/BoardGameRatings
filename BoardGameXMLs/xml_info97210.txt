							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades</name>
									
			<description>Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades was announced on July 15, 2008, at the 2008 E3 conference. Executive Producer David Nathanielsz stated that the short time between releases was to help give DS players the same depth of content as available to the console players of Guitar Hero. Additionally, Vicarious Visions incorporated the ability to share songs between different versions of the game through the wi-fi capabilities of the DS in order to expand the number of potential songs to more than 50.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Guitar Hero: On Tour series&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
