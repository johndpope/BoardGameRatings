			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survivors of the Silver Fleet is a dungeon-crawler style monster-fighting, treasure-grabbing game for 2-4 players. Each player will take on the role of the Captain of a salvage ship in the immediate aftermath of the sinking of the Spanish Silver Fleet off of the coast of Florida in 1715. Race other players to accumulate as much treasure and rescue as many survivors as possible. But, with nearly a thousand drowned sailors laid to rest under the waves, it will be almost impossible to avoid aggressive sea monsters out searching for a waterlogged snack!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need to upgrade your ship to survive. Purchase cannons for attack, defensive porthole upgrades, and additional sails for speed from nearby merchant ships. Then, hope you're prepared for everything you haul up from the depths of the sea. The Captain who has salvaged the most treasure at the end of the game will be rewarded with early retirement, and the admiration of their peers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, Captain. You&amp;rsquo;ll need it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
