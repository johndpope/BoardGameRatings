			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lejendary Adventures RPG Scenario and Bestiary &lt;br/&gt;Not far from the banks of the Black River lies the village of Taen. There, quaint houses of fieldstone and brick lie nestled together on wide unpaved roads, the streets give way to wider fields and farm houses of waddle and daub. There is little of note in the surface, a temple, the blacksmith, the merchants house and all the normal trappings of a bustling and growing community. All appears as it should. A quiet town of contented people living out their lives as best they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there is more here than meets the eye. Bandits stalk the road, and giants have been spotted in the not too distant hills. And the villagers speak of strange, weirdling creatures, half man and half beast.

All this betokens adventure and danger and all the gleaming treasure that the risk of life and limb promises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is an easy to read and follow adventure module that enables you, the Lejend Master, to gather a group of new players together and have all concerned participate in and enjoy the Lejendary Adventure RPG!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Companion Adventure &amp;amp; Expanded Bestiary for the Lejendary Adventure Essentials boxed set.
