							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Our Friends Over There</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Welcome to the BBC broadcast of Our Friends Over There, a documentary series that investigates our neighbors circling distant stars. From the intelligent slimes of Procyon IV to the warlike mineral-beings of our own asteroid belt, we bring their lives into your home. Today we visit the Drozwannek of Argol II. Under the light of Sol their skins would appear a luminous blue, but under the strange rays of Argol they see themselves in numerous shades of green. The Drozwanneks are humanoids, much like us, and by many measures quite handsome! Their culture is an ancient one for they are the remnants of a technologically advanced race collapsed into senescence, living as simple farmers among the ruins of their ancestor&amp;rsquo;s great works. Join us as we spend a day with the Drozwannek and learn about their lives, and a little about ourselves, here on Our Friends Over There.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
