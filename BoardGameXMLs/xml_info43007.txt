			<description>Micronesia is a tile placement, civilization building, area control game with role selection for 3-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are in control of the peoples of Micronesia.  New islands are explored and settled, and new villages are created.  Players choose roles which determine turn order and actions available to them for the duration of the round.  Players earn points for the islands they discover and settle based on the traffic to and from the island and various villages grant the players extra abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
