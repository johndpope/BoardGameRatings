			<description>Two islands somewhere on the Pacific Ocean try to obtain the full power, conquering the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each island has 3 bays and one airport. The first player who conquers one bay and the airport of the enemy and keeps the situation the next movement from the other player is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most interesting: There's no dice, no cards, no luck at all. Each type of piece has a diagram, a kind of stencil, that shows all the alternative movements and if will hit or not. It's just strategy thinking and tactical movements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is beautiful, made of plastic. The pieces are made of a type of rubber that adhere to the board, so you can store the game to play again some other game. And believe me : it's necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pity that this company made 2 games with the same mechanics and pieces and then, disappeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
