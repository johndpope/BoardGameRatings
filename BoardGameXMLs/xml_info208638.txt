							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blitzkrieg in the West: Northern Campaign</name>
									
			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This six-scenario pack revolves around battles of  the German invasion of Fortress Holland and is compatible with MMP's ASL&amp;trade; System and modifiable to be used with other miniature Wargaming systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blitzkrieg in the West - Northern Campaign scenarios can be played separately, or the six scenarios may be linked together to form a campaign game by playing each scenario in order. At the conclusion of each scenario, both sides total up their Victory Points (VP); and at the end of the last scenario these VP are totalled, and the side with most VP wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenarios are designed with replayablility in mind. Each scenario features a base force and variable attachments to that force. Base forces and variable attachments are based on historical availability for that scenario. At the start of each scenario: Base Force + Variable Attachment = Scenario Order of Battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
