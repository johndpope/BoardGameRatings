			<description>REM, &amp;quot;The First Card Game for the Computer Age&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A fun and easy way to learn 17 commonly used computer terms. Players sharpen their memory as they form programs by matching terms from the popular BASIC computer programming language. Competition intensifies as opponents wipe out each others programs and damage each others disks. Definitions, with questions and answers, are provided for those who wish to learn more about the terms. Miniature computer paper is included for keeping score. (The terms are used by Apple, TRS-80, Commodore, and most other fine computers.)&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A copy of this game resides in the Smithsonian Institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
