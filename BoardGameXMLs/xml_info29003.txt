			<description>&amp;quot;Wetten, dass..?&amp;quot; is a very popular television show in German-speaking countries. The main concept of the show are bets: Common people perform some unusual/difficult tasks and the celebrity guests must bet on the outcome of the performance and offer a wager.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a board and 3 different decks of task-cards: Knowledge, Activity, Wildcard. While one player has to fulfill the task, the other players must bet on the outcome. They wager chips and may move forward (to the center) if they are right. &lt;br/&gt;If you reach the center and fulfill the Activity-card, you will win!&lt;br/&gt;The Wildcards are blank cards, all players are allowed to think of new tasks before the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
