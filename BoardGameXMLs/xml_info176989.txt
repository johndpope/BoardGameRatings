							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">For Glory and Honor: A Game of Soldiering during the Napoleonic Wars.</name>
									
			<description>INTRODUCTION&lt;br/&gt;For Glory and Honor is a game for one to four Players. Each Player creates a Player Soldier during the Napoleonic Wars. The Player Soldiers will attempt to gain Merit Points in order to advance in rank throughout various Campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars. Player Soldiers can be assigned to a Cavalry or Infantry Regiment serving in the British or French Armies. This game is especially suited for fans of Bernard Cornwell's Richard Sharpe Series, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Brigadier Gerard Series and Richard Howard's Alain Lausard series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;br/&gt;The Objective of the Game is to have your Soldier be the first to complete his Career during the Napoleonic Wars. Career Progress is tracked by moving your Soldier&amp;rsquo;s Counter along the Game Board&amp;rsquo;s Career Track. The Career Track consists of Garrison Duty and Campaign Duty Assignments. These Assignments will result in a variety of situations and encounters including Skirmishes, Patrols, Battles, Encampment, Headquarters, Siege Assaults and Special Missions in which the Player&amp;rsquo; Soldier must resolve. The outcome of these Encounters and Situations determine whether the Player&amp;rsquo;s Soldier advances along the Career Track. While the Soldiers conduct Challenges, they might gain or lose Merit Points, which are used to improve their Attribute Ratings and Rank. The Player Soldier with the Highest Rank after reaching the Ending Space on the Career Track, is the Winner. If this is tied, then the Soldier with the most Merit Points remaining is the Winner. If this is tied then the Soldiers may conduct a Duel to determine the Winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
