							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombicide Survivor: Claudia</name>
									
			<description>Unloved child of a struggling couple, Claudia was born and raised in a poor hood. A mother that worked three jobs at once and a father that grew a bit too close when Claudia became a teen soon led Claudia to the gangs. Getting in trouble with the po-po and mixing it up with other gangs was a great education in unorthodox combat. The good news is that these skills are pretty handy against zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Claudia is a promotional Survivor that was available to those that pledged extra during the Kickstarter campaign.  She may be available in limited quantities at upcoming conventions.  A zombie version (Zombivor) will be available to backers in 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
