							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Secrets of the Knah&#039;tan</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long divergent from their cousins, the Jeshatan, the Knah&amp;rsquo;tan hate all forms of magic. They strive to destroy it from all existence. They have several methods of doing this, foremost among them is their paramount craftsmanship. However, they also maintain a fervent breeding program which has led to increased intelligence and physical strength over the millennia. Still, these two are not quite enough; for their true deadly power lies with psionics and supremely potent alchemical concoctions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are a firm and merciless race. They prize logic and reason above all other things, but despite this face emotional rages and irrationalities that they refuse to acknowledge. To call a Knah&amp;rsquo;tan an irrational fool is an unforgivable insult that must be met with violence or social shame. Knah&amp;rsquo;tan politics is quite labyrinthine and often involves whispering campaigns and grudges that go on for centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
