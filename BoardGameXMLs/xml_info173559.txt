			<description>Mouse-O-Mania is a roll-and-move game included as a pull-out insert in the children's book &amp;quot;Geronimo Stilton: A Christmas Tale.&amp;quot;  Players must roll dice and move along a track, trying to get Geronimo Stilton to his Christmas party. Along the way, players land on spaces referring to events in the book. These spaces may move them forward or back or cause them to gain or lose turns. The first player to get Geronimo Stilton to his Christmas party by landing on the end of the track by an exact roll wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
