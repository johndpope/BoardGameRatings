							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sky Ace (24-Hour RPG Version)</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sky Ace is a 24-hour RPG product from 2005.  The game is played with a standard pack of playing cards driving all actions.  The first part of the rules describes card handling and rules to drive miniatures tactical combat.  The game can be used as a standalone tactical exercise.  The second part of the rules describes the integration of the miniatures and card aspects of the game into an ongoing role-playing game experience with a process for character advancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, by far the most interesting aspect of the game is the use of cards to drive combat, etc.  The various role-playing elements are traditional and very light-weight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
