							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sword of the Bastard Elf (Let&#039;s Play Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kicked out of home at the cruelly young age of 60, you're left to fend for yourself in the wilds surrounding Bilgeton. You are the Bastard Elf: embark on an epic quest in search of your human father and his fabled couch upon which you might crash, or blow that off as soon as something better comes along. Can you survive in this strange and vicious fantasy realm?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sword of the Bastard Elf was the first book from Two-Fisted Fantasy played through on the Something Awful Forums. This is the remnants of a Let's Play: about 120 pages of story, a collection of item cards and a handful of bestiary entries. It's a funny and, at times, horrible adventure which might be worth your time to read to give you an idea of what Two-Fisted Fantasy is all about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is being re-made and the full, complete version of this adventure will be available in mid-2017 in PDF and print forms from this very site. Though this pdf will give you a taste of what's to come and fill you in on some of the setting, the adventure will not be completely identical and I doubt much will be spoiled for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning: this isn't for kids. While there's no expicit sex there's some gross violence and something called a &amp;quot;phalloknight&amp;quot; so beware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
