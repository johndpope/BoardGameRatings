							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">British Commandos - Book 4</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Commandos were an elite branch of the British Armed Forces during World War II. Theirs was the job of infiltrating behind enemy lines for missions such as reconnaissance, sabotage, lead elements of large assaults, and leading partisans. This book gives all the information necessary to make British Commandos part of Behind Enemy Lines. Character generation, special skills, and British equipment are included. A historical commando mission, Operation Frankton, is also included. This mission involved naval sabotage in the occupied French port of Boredeaux and was successfully completed by 12 commandos. It is typical of commando missions and will show the player what was expected of commandos and what they actually accomplished during World War II.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
