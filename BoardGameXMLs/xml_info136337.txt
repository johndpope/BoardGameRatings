			<description>The future is here! Build the foundations of the Future Ages of Exploration in Culture, Science, Trade and Military while forming the Organizations that will rule Mankind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Marvels 6 Express (SM6e) is a PnP Express tile laying game for 2 to 5 players in the vein of 7 Wonders playable in 15-20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin by each choosing a different Marvel Board, divided into 3 different sections, or Ages of exploration. Each board gives the player an initial resource. Players are also given 3 credits to start the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are then dealt a hand of tiles (8 tiles 2-3 players, 6 tiles for 4-5 players) and may do one of three things during each phase of a round:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a. Play a tile if they can pay the cost in resources, gaining future benefits, resources, and other bonuses&lt;br/&gt;b. Use the tile face down + pay resources to build a section of their Marvel (thereby gaining bonus abilities)&lt;br/&gt;c. Discard the tile for 3 credits&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may play their tiles simultaneously and may buy resources from neighboring players at a cost of 2 credits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each player has played a tile, all players pass their remaining tiles to the player next to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rounds end when all tiles dealt have been played. A VP scoring round them occurs comparing Military strengths of each player. VP is awarded and a new round begins with the next set of tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 3 rounds of play, groups of tiles are scored for VP based upon Organizations built as well as credits earned and final Military strengths of each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player with the most VP is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the 2 player game, a dummy hand of tiles is dealt and players use that dummy hand as part of the hand passing portion of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner - 2013 In-A-Tin/Express Contest - Best Pre-Contest Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
