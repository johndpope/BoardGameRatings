Like other books in the series, there is also a 2-player monster fight mini-game included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE SERIES:&lt;br/&gt;Based on the live action television and film character, this new series of interactive gamebooks is adventure-packed! 64 pages of intense gameplay action with an innovative story structure that allows continuous play across multiple issues.
