			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;Aonir is a fantasy RPG created and published by Teemu Suontaka in 2014 as part of his master's thesis on degree of business economics used as a case example of getting from idea to product. It is available for sale as PDF on the RPG's official website and a free preview PDF about the game is also available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Aonir a fantasy world is invaded by alien tzerads, which causes steampunk technology development and appearance of mutated, green skinned orc race. The magic in Aonir is mostly based on psionics and alchemy. The game uses mainly d6 and d12 dice and also d12+d6 which is written as d18. The rules system is Teemu's own design but the main inspirations are from D&amp;amp;D and Praedor. The book includes seven character classes from mystic to ranger, three playable races: humans, mutated orcs and alien tzerads and all together over 70 weapons, spells and magic potions. The art for Aonir is all found from rpgnow.com under free-to-use license.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
