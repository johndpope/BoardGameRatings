			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awesome Powers is a supplement for the BASH! Ultimate Edition RPG. Inside, you will find new Powers, new Enhancements, new Limitations, and new ideas to incorporate into your BASH! campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chiefly, this product is designed to allow you to create characters with themes, making use of pre-designed powers.  You can use these powers for inspiration, or you can even create your character by rolling for powers at random. As the Awesome Powers library grows, so will the list of available powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume 7 of Awesome Powers deals with powers of Fortune; both in the sense of Luck (whether good or bad) and in the sense of predicting the future: Precognition. Each of those Power Suites has a number of useful powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of the powers in Volume 7 are completely unique, as they interact in new ways with Hero Points and Setbacks, or make use of newer game mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll also find all new Limitations and Enhancements, Advantages, Disadvantages, and two new rule options: Overkill (for when you roll REALLY lucky) and Bonus Dice / Penalty Dice (which can really shift the odds).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume 7 has included a Random Power Generator compiling all powers from Awesome Powers 1-7. So now you can completely create a character without needing to flip through multiple books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
