							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Montezuma&#039;s Lost Treasure</name>
									
			<description>In this daring game of adventure, you race through the twisting maze of Montezuma's Treasury collecting artifacts as you attempt to reach the Treasure room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But beware, each tile you or an opponent lay can twist your path and lead you away from the Treasure.  Each tile may reward you with an artifact, but chances are they are laced with deadly hazards that your opponents can trigger through drafting an Event card; crushing walls, pits, spikes, trap doors, shooting arrows, rotating rooms, and a boulder that rolls across the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using your action points, pick up items in your adventure to help navigate past these hazards.  Scramble through secret passageways, fight off dangerous creatures, activate secret doors and find your way through pitch black rooms.  That map you found might be of help, but chances are the path behind you will cave in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even if you can't make it to the Treasure room you might have enough to win if you were able to collect enough Items with treasure points or Artifacts that are scattered throughout the Treasury.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For every hidden door you open, boulder that rolls through the maze, crushing walls that close, spikes that rise, trap door that opens you are impacting another area of the map as you move those tokens to a new area of the map.  This might buy you enough time to find an exit with your arms full of riches.  First one out watches the Treasury collapse from the inside out, chasing out or trapping everyone else inside!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Balance the Item cards you'll need to get out with the treasure you need to win, because the player that makes it out alive with the most treasure points in their hand wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each players turn consists of 3 steps:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Draft one Event card.  &lt;br/&gt;        Event cards include triggering specific hazards on tiles (i.e. Arrows, Spikes, Rotating a room, Secret passageways)&lt;br/&gt;        and attacking other players through Thieves, Spiders and Rats event cards.(2) Perform 2 of the following actions&lt;br/&gt;        Move, Move, Take Item (cards), Play Item card, Rest (raise health by 1), take Treasure cards when in the treasure room&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Place new map tiles adjacent to the tiles your token is on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Components&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1  Board&lt;br/&gt;     12 Artifact Cards&lt;br/&gt;     20 Event Cards (12 unique)&lt;br/&gt;     38 Treasure Cards&lt;br/&gt;     51 Item Cards  (10 unique)&lt;br/&gt;     1  Die to resolve conflict&lt;br/&gt;     4  Player Adventure Markers&lt;br/&gt;     4  Player Health Markers&lt;br/&gt;     1  Bag&lt;br/&gt;        Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     90 Map Tiles&lt;br/&gt;     1  Treasure Room tile &lt;br/&gt;     3  Raised Spikes Tokens&lt;br/&gt;     4  Door Tokens&lt;br/&gt;     2  Open Trap Door Tokens&lt;br/&gt;     1  Boulder Token&lt;br/&gt;     1  Crushing Wall Token&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
