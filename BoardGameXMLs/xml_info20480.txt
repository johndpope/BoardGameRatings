			<description>Funny family &amp;amp; party game for 2-6 players. Who can guess the other's plans? Who's fooling who? You better stay 'cool' flying through the dimensions...and be aware of the nasty timeholes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving their spaceship around whatever 'dimension' he is in (each dimension is represented by a circular board, and there are three dimensions.) The object is to move your ship through each dimension, starting with Dimension 1. Turning each round, one player acts as the 'Time-Master' and is able to place 1 to 3 'timeholes' which cause players either to go back to the start of the dimension (if you are in Dimension 1) or to drop back to the previous dimension on the space corresponding to the space you landed on (i.e. If you were on space 6 in Dimension 2 when you landed on a timehole you'd go back to space 6 in Dimension 1.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to pass the Time Jump space in Dimension 3 safely (i.e. If you pass the Time Jump space but land on a timehole, the game continues.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.printgames.net/english/detail_e/timejump.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.printgames.net/english/detail_e/timejump.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
