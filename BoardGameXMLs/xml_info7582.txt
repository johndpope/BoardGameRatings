			<description>This boardgame has been published together with Warhammer: 28 periodical issues sold in the Italian newspaperkiosks. They included the game, a Warhammer Encyclopedia (by Andrea Angiolino himself) and short stories set in Warhammer world.&lt;br/&gt;The boardgame is played on squared modular tiles to form dungeons and outdoor battlefields: several underground, open field and mixed scenarios are included. The issues included cardboard models of two houses and a tower, to be used in the game. Game characters depict all the main races of the Warhammer world, together with monsters and some characters from the short stories in the issues, as Felix and Gotrek.&lt;br/&gt;The game uses cardboard counters, but there was on sale a box with all the lead miniatures included in the game.&lt;br/&gt;The issues have been published and distributed by the Italian publisher Hobby &amp;amp; Work. Nexus Editrice designed and edited all the materials up to the printing stage. Games Workshop licensed the issues and provided the miniature sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
