			<description>&amp;quot;Costruire i libri-gioco - Come scriverli e utlizzarli per la didattica, la scrittura collettiva e il teatro interattivo&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;How to build gamebooks - How to write them and how to use them in teaching, collective writing and interactive theatre&amp;quot;) is dedicated to enthusiasts and collectors of gamebooks, reviewing all the production of that kind of books. It is also dedicated to would-be authors, explaining them step-by-step how to write choose-your-own-adventure stories and transform them in computer hypertexts, that can also be put on the Web.&lt;br/&gt;The book is also dedicated to teachers, librarians and moer in general people working with kids and teenagers, to explain them how the group reading and expecially writing of a gamebook can be an occasion of fun but also be inserted in a didactic activity. &lt;br/&gt;All this with the taste for wandering, as in gamebooks themselves: in the pages of the book you can find complete short-stories and notes about boardgames, suggestions on how to make a choose-your-own-story theatre show and the description of a gamebook for little kids still unable to read. All this involving names as Borges and Calvino, Queneau and the Oulipo, Diderot and Umberto Eco.&lt;br/&gt;As examples, the book collects the short gamebook stories of &amp;quot;Mitico!&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
