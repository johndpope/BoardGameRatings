			<description>Millennium Gravitas is a tactical science-fiction cardgame of eXploration, eXpansion, eXploitation, and eXtermination (4X). The game features Invasion and Colonization of Planets, Technology Research, Tactical Space-combat, Ship Construction and Customization, Anomalies and Resource Management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay consists of building structures (ex. energy collectors) to gather resources, colonize planets to man your spaceships and research technology to equip your fleet, planets and shipyard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is accomplished by drawing cards from your deck and playing them according to various rules and time-based mechanics (building ships takes time for example).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to defeat the opposing player according to three different victory-conditions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extinction - The opposing player loses all Population (by invasion or destruction of planets or structures)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starvation - The opposing player loses all Energy (by stealing energy or destroying collectors)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Burnout - The opposing player loses the ability to play Units (by losing all cards in his main deck and hand)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Millennium Gravitas relies less on luck-of-the-draw than other comparable games and gives the player more control over their strategy. The core mechanics are focused on flexibility and tactics rather than deck-building or owning the most powerful cards to overpower your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game supports different game-modes, like 1vs1, 2vs2 or +4vs (the mechanics theoretically do not limit the amount of players that are able to play together or against each other). All complex play styles are supported, from team-matches to last-man-standing. This creates many interesting games with temporary alliances and even politics as emergent game-play. Additionally Millennium does not require a game-board or sophisticated game-pieces and miniatures, all you need to play is knowledge of the rules, your own deck, and something to be used as tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
