							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gomony</name>
									
			<description>Somewhat resembling Russian Checkers variants such as Bashni or Shashki, as well as Emanuel Lasker's Laska from 1911, Gomony is essentially Checkers with the captured pieces remaining on the board, in stacks. It is played on an 8x8 checkered board (unlike Lasca's 7x7 board,) with 12 bi-colored pieces: white-and-green and brown-and-black. The darker colors remain on the bottom half until the pieces are promoted and turned over; this way, players are able to see which pieces beneath a stack have been promoted.     &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    Players' beginning positions and movements are the same as ordinary Checkers, with the exception that upon jumping over an opponent's piece, instead of removing it from the board, it is stacked upon by the capturing player. Stacks are controlled by the piece on top, ordinary or promoted, unless the other player captures the top piece and frees one of his own below. To win, the opposing player's pieces must all be buried under stacks or incapable of moving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
