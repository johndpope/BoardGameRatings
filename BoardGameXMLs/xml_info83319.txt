			<description>Nature took millions of years to achieve the conditions for life on earth. Now the oceans are warming, and the Poles have fractured into Icebergs of four different colors melting into the sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Colors of Cold, which are responsible for maintaining the climate of the Icecaps, have become separated. They have drifted north and south and mixed together in the center of the ocean: the play area for our game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realizing their plight, the Polar Bears and Penguins have taken responsibility for restoring the climate of their environment. They know that the pattern of the Colors of Cold, which nature took so long to create, can be reset with their help. They must help the colors return to their Polar patterns before the ice melts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you do.&lt;br/&gt;Play the Polar Bears or Penguins responsible for returning the melting icebergs to their poles.  The polar animals work alone or in pairs. Too many false moves and the bergs will be gone forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take-away-thought &amp;ldquo;Nature can heal with our help&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;Nature is quite capable of restoring the right conditions for life, it just needs a little help from the life forms it supports sometimes...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(From the publisher website: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.gamewhys.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.gamewhys.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
