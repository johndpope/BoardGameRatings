			<description>Copied from Rules of Play insert:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Treasure Dive Game was invented by Ronald C. Ketchum, an internationally certified Scuba Instructor.  He created the game as a fun means of review of scuba safety skills for his diving students in Australia.  The game has since been revised to include a basic level for children and an advanced level for scuba divers, so that both may play the game at their own level.&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION... Imagine you and your friends each discovering eight pieces of 8 coins on a beach.  You know a treasure ship must lay offshore, with a treasure chest containing fabulous wealth.  The race is on to be the first one to reach the treasure and claim exclusive salvage rights. &lt;br/&gt;OBJECT...The object of the game is to become the first diver to reach the sunken treasure and return to the surface, thereby staking claim as the Legal Salvor.  Descent to the treasure is made by earning various levels of scuba certification.  Hazards about, and a knowledge of first aid and diving safety will help you reach the treasure safely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
