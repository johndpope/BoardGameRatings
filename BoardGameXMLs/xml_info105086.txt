							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">David&#039;s Midnight Magic</name>
									
			<description>David's Midnight Magic is an early computer pinball simulation written by David Snider and released by Br&amp;oslash;derbund in 1982. (The game was published in Europe by Ariolasoft). The game was originally released for the Apple II computer platform and was later released for the Commodore 64 and Atari 8-bit platforms. Along with Raster Blaster and Night Mission, David's Midnight Magic represented the first wave of home computer pinball simulations available with relatively realistic pinball features. In a review by Computer Gaming World, Midnight Magic was flatly stated as a better game than Raster Blaster. However, the review also lamented the requirement of removing write protection from the floppy, thus voiding the warranty, in order to save high scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;David's Midnight Magic&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
