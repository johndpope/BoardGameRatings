							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mexican Standoff: The Black Scorpion Promo Card</name>
									
			<description>JEFE ESCORPI&amp;Oacute;N ALFREDO is the wicked wraith of the infamous bandit JEFE ESCORPI&amp;Oacute;N NEGRO appearing in the base game of Mexican Standoff. Due to his unpredictable and testy personality only the bravest dare to enter into an alliance with him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of shuffling into the deck, put the promo card on the table within easy reach. Before playing the first card of the round the player who was dealt Jefe Escorpi&amp;oacute;n Negro of the base game may replace Jefe Escorpi&amp;oacute;n Negro with Jefe Escorpi&amp;oacute;n Alfredo (the one with the black background).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The promo card has two special features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-    After losing a duel in which the promo card was played as a base card the player may retrieve the promo card and put it back into his hand by discarding one card from his hand. The promo card may not be retrieved if the player has no cards left to discard.&lt;br/&gt;-    The player who won the card of Jefe Escorpi&amp;oacute;n Alfredo with a trick, scores 25 bonus points. In case the player who got the card originally cannot keep it by taking a trick, i.e. another player takes it, the original owner of the card gets -25 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each round replace the promo card with the card of Jefe Escorpi&amp;oacute;n Negro of the base game, put the promo card back on the table and reshuffle the deck to start a new round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
