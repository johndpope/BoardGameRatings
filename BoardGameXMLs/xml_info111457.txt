							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shatterzone Classic Reprint PDF (with card deck)</name>
									
			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You just melted the barrel of your gun and your armor is shot full of holes. No cavalry is coming over the hill and you've still got to fly the shatterzone. You thought you were going to get rich and get home. Now it looks like all you may get is dead. All in all, a hell of a bad day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a vast and dangerous sea of planets and stars, where a group of adventurers can just as easily improve their own fortunes or meet a swift and brutal death. Explore all its wonder, from the heart of the Core Worlds to the mysterious and deadly shatterzone itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scanned reprint combines the Shatterzone: The Rule Book, Shatterzone: The Players' Guide, and Shatterzone:  The Universe Guide into a single volume. and also includes remastered MasterDeck&amp;trade; action cards in PDF format (in both black &amp;amp; white and color, for both single and double-sided printing).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
