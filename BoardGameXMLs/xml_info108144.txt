							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eve Sylver</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Her name is Eve Sylver. She was created to be an arrogant scientist's showpiece and personal toy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When she realized that her fate was to be nothing more than a means to satisfy his ego and other lusts, she murdered her creator, and fled to live on the streets, where she is constantly in danger from criminals, demons, aliens, and a murderous AI that wants her body for all the wrong reasons. That's what happens, though, when you're in the world of HOT CHICKS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the fourth in a series of Character Studies... detailed examinations of characters that occupy the back alleys and shadows of the Earth of 2015. Included are over fifty images of Eve in various stages of dress, including none at all. She may not have had a good relationship since... well, ever, but there's always hope!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Read her history, study her form, and view her statistics. She makes an ideal NPC companion, ally, and is a beautiful complication for your Hot Chicks games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
