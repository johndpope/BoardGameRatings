			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Although Dr Alphonse Moreau perished on Noble's Isle&lt;br/&gt;sometime in late 1887, his work did not. In 1891, an expedition&lt;br/&gt;was sent by the British government to salvage what they could&lt;br/&gt;and return any papers or specimens that were still alive.&lt;br/&gt;Although the expedition was publicly reported as a failure, it&lt;br/&gt;did succeed in bringing back enough information for scientists&lt;br/&gt;to replicate Dr Moreau's work - the surgical hybridisation of&lt;br/&gt;Man and Beast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small laboratory was established somewhere in the bucolic&lt;br/&gt;conutryside of England. The scientists at the laboratory&lt;br/&gt;successully reproduced all of Moreau's techniques and added&lt;br/&gt;page after page to their new bestiary. The new creations were&lt;br/&gt;studied, both physically and mentally, to see what use they&lt;br/&gt;could be in the new century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;His is the Hand&amp;quot;, the players take the part of the Beast-Men:&lt;br/&gt;hybrids created from the legacy of Dr Moreau.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
