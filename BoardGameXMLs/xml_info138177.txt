			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conspiracies II: Lethal Networks is the second installment in the Conspiracies series of full motion video adventure games. Conspiracies II: Lethal Networks was developed by Anima Interactive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the year 2063, Earth joined the Peripheral Galactic Alliance as an equal member. Now, for the first time, Earth is expecting a significant improvement in its situation. Everybody believes that a new era is beginning: an era of development, prosperity, and closer co-operation with other civilizations that will lead to the eventual solution of the political, economic and social problems of the planet. Nick Delios, ex private eye and now a governmental secret agent, is accused of attempted murder against Annita Argyriou, the President of the powerful Detronics S.A., but someone has framed him. In his effort to find the truth, he will find himself in the middle of multiple conspiracy networks throughout the Peripheral Galactic Alliance, threatening even its own existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
