							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Continuous Delivery: The Game</name>
									
			<description>The game consists of a board with 20 spaces, where 10-20 cubes representing software work items shall be pushed forward according to the rules. The goal is to make the work items finish as soon as possible at the end space. A lot of set-backs will appear on cards drawn from a deck. The set-backs have names that people within the software development are familiar with.&lt;br/&gt;The cooperative game is won if the group manages to overcome all the trouble caused by the event cards, by choosing from the development cards and implement them in a proper order.&lt;br/&gt;In each turn the players make up a short-term plan for which developments to go for, and which work items to progress. There are dice used for progress during the &amp;quot;testing phase&amp;quot;, the middle part of the track where the work items can be stuck if the group has bad luck.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Continuous Delivery - The Game&amp;quot; is a cooperative board game for 3-5 players who together will try to transform a traditional software development way of working into a Continuous Delivery pipeline.&lt;br/&gt;Each player represents a department, for instance Development, Test or Operations. Together they can discuss and plan how to improve the software development process.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this game is to create awareness of what implementing Continuous Delivery can be about. This game can be played by anyone and does not require any prior knowledge or experience of Continuous Delivery.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Continuous Delivery - The Game&amp;quot; is the first of its kind and unique in how it mixes the fun of a board game and the teachings&lt;br/&gt;of Continuous Delivery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
