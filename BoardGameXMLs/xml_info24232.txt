							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rogue Football League</name>
									
			<description>UPDATED TO VERSION 2 - updated graphics and more streamlined gameplay!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rogue Football League is a quasi-simulation of the construction and operation of a professional football league in the 1970&amp;rsquo;s and early 1980&amp;rsquo;s.  In RFL, players take on the role of a franchise manager and coach.  The players will draft rookies, sign free agents, manage franchise finances and try to make a run at the league championship, all at the same time!  Rogue Football League runs over the course of three seasons, so owners will have plenty of time to see their league grow and succeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes RFL fun to play is that while players are trying to beat each other on the field, they must work together for the success of the league off the field, or no one wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not necessary to have eight players to play RFL.  While the game has mechanics for non-player franchises, and can even be played solitaire, interaction is a BIG part of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;League models, or templates, are available for leagues of between six and twelve teams. Each individual game on the schedule can be resolved in 3-5 minutes with the two owners rolling against each other, or a quick play function is available if owners wish to concentrate on the managerial/financial aspects of the league.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rogue Football League comes with a 14-page rulebook, 24 franchise cards, 52 veteran cards, 44 rookie cards, 60 event cards, originals of all necessary game forms, and three double-sided player aid cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Two expansions have been released: Foreign Fields, which adds in more league templates, more cards and rules for Canadian/European franchises; and Ghosts of the Past, which adds in more cards, a random event table and scenarios for recreating the USFL, WFL, and WLAF&lt;br/&gt; Available from Brothers-in-Arms Games at biagamesonline.tripod.com - check out the site and check out the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
