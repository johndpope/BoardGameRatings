							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Outlast: The Zombie Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This game offers extremely easy accessibility, fun interaction, strategic gameplay, and diverse experiences. All you need is a standard deck of cards, the rules, one or more friends willing to learn the game and want to have fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with a group of survivors, represented by the cards in their hand. Each turn, which represents a normal day, consists of gathering resources, creating defenses, expanding the group's strength, battling other groups of survivors, and of course killing zombies. Throughout the game, players use card combinations in order to experience unique scenarios like fighting against zombie hordes, training up soldiers, and even witnessing their own members turn zombie. The simplistic nature of this game offers great entertainment and interaction between players, yet it provides enough challenge and diversity to keep you playing over and over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to win, players must survive through the deck by increasing the amount of cards in their hand. This is accomplished by gathering Resources, killing Zombies, creating Defenses, and battling other players. When the last card of the deck is drawn, each player takes a final turn. Then players count the remaining cards in their hand and keep track of that score. After three rounds of Outlast, whoever has the highest total score wins and has &amp;ldquo;Outlasted&amp;rdquo; everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the mechanics of this game is simple, the complex part of this game is that each card has a different value, whether it represents zombies, gas, food, defense, guns, or more. Combinations with different cards also add an extra layer of strategy as players must decide what to play to help themselves and hurt others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game offers an instruction manual, a place matt, specific player inventory cards, and player help charts (to keep track of the different card values). Each piece is designed beautifully and all work together to give the player an imaginative experience. Being sold at a low price, because of not offering a custom deck, this game calls out to all types of game players who want to play a fun game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
