			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the game &amp;quot;Atacama&amp;quot; from the company Mucke Spiele&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Excitement in the Atacama! Valuable mineral resources &amp;mdash; gold, silver and copper &amp;mdash; have been found in the 1,200 km long desert in Chile and Peru along the coast of the Pacific Ocean. Several companies are already busy prospecting by erecting huge drilling rigs as the resources are deep under the surface. Due to security reasons, the drilling rigs cannot be installed too close to one another, so each new rig limits the possibilities for erecting new ones in the surrounding areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s more, the mining rights have been limited by the government. The companies have received a concession for only two of the three commodities &amp;ndash; and extracting the &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; type of commodity will result in penalties. Becoming rich is a difficult business, but the stakes are worthwhile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
