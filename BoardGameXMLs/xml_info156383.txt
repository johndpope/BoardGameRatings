							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gasometer</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partially obscured by earthen embankments and a high steel fence topped with barbed wire rolls are these two voluminous gas tanks only part of a much larger industrial complex. These gasometers are only part of a storage network for the gas needed here. The pipes disappearing into the ground as well as the access hatches to the underground shut-off valves are a strong hint to this fact. Very few people know this fact though and even fewer would be allowed to get this close. After all the two spheres store enough gas for quite a spectacular firework. Even the maintenance workers allowed to approach them are rather uneasy when at the site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
