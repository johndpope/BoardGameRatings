							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dino Drop</name>
									
			<description>Dino Drop is a fun-filled, fast paced and challenging interactive trade off game that allows a single player to swap dinosaur eggs in order to make a three in a row set.  While getting three in a row causes the player to remove the set and earning points, getting more than three also removes the group and earns the player more points.  Dino Drop encourages matching and strategy thought processes as the player is having fun building sets. In order to advance through the levels, the player must earn points while moving dinosaur eggs left or right and up and down.  Each level progressively gets more challenging.  To advance through the levels, players must earn an incrementally escalating amount of points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
