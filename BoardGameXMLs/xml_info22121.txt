							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Okay Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Featuring illustrations from Todd Parr's children's book &amp;quot;It's Okay,&amp;quot; this simple memory game helps reinforce the idea that &amp;quot;there are LOTS of things that are, after all, OKAY!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are each dealt five cards, and five cards are placed face up in the center of the playing area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player closes his eyes while one of the five cards is turned face down. The player then opens his eyes and tries to remember which card is turned over. If the player remembers correctly, he may take one card from his hand and add it to the cards in the center. If the player guesses wrong, a card is added to the center from the draw pile. Either way, more cards are added to the center each turn, making it more difficult for players to remember them all. The winner is the first player to get rid of his original five cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
