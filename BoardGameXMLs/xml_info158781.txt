			<description>Brangle is a party game for four or more players. The game is played with a deck of 54 cards, each with three topics or categories written on one side. One player draws a card and selects the first, second, or third category (by choice or convention, depending on which set of rules is used). The player then names something that belongs to the category, prompting the next player to do the same, and so on. Play continues in this fashion until a player cannot give an answer in a reasonable amount of time (typically about 2 seconds) or repeats an answer previously used during the round. Once a player loses the round, they place the card in front of them, and draw a new card to begin the next round. The player with the fewest cards in front of them after 54 rounds is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules included in Brangle offer suggestions for modifying gameplay. One example is to play an &amp;quot;elimination game&amp;quot; in which players are removed from the game after accumulating three cards. The last player remaining is the winner. It is also suggested that the game can end after a predetermined amount of time (30 minutes) instead of playing through the entire deck of cards. Another suggestion is to allow players to choose which of the three categories on each card they want to play, rather than always choosing the first, second or third.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creative or unusual answers and responses are highly encouraged. An excerpt from the rules: &amp;quot;For the category, &amp;ldquo;things that roll&amp;rdquo;, a creative answer could be &amp;ldquo;stones&amp;rdquo; (Rolling Stones), &amp;ldquo;Rick Astley&amp;rdquo; (Rick Roll), or &amp;ldquo;spring&amp;rdquo; (spring-roll) &amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brangle was created by a small group of US Marines and RAF Airmen in Afghanistan in 2011, and later developed into a commercial product by a member of that group after his service was completed in 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
