			<description>&amp;ldquo;Luke, Han and Leia need to get back to the Millennium Falcon in the Death Star&amp;rsquo;s Docking  Bay. But Vader and his minions are in hot pursuit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on the map from the Escape From the Death Star miniature game, or the players may design a custom map. The object of the game is to destroy all of your opponent&amp;rsquo;s characters. Each player controls three characters. The Rebel player plays Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo. The Empire player plays Darth Vader, an anonymous Stormtrooper, and (from the Episode III cutting room floor?) Boba Fett.&lt;br/&gt;Each character has a deck of cards containing a specific number of Power, Toughness, and Force cards in allocations intended to represent the relative abilities of the characters. These cards are used to resolve combat. Movement of the characters is determined by drawing Area cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
