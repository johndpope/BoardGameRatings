							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Peculiar Pentad</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a lonely life investigating grisly affairs and confronting unnameable horrors, and it requires all sorts of materials that can&amp;rsquo;t be bought at the corner store as well as information that isn&amp;rsquo;t found in mass-market publications. Sometimes it seems like an investigator is all on his or her own, with no one to turn to for advice, assistance, or just fairly-priced goods of a specific nature. But if you wander down the right back alley, you may be surprised what you find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Peculiar Pentad presents five shops that every investigator may want, or need, to visit - a rare book store where the proprietor quotes from texts that were supposedly lost to the ages; a repair shop whose owner can get any mechanical device, no matter where or when it was made, functioning as good as new - probably better; a private social club that caters to those who have seen things no human ever should, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by a quintet of fan-favorite and award-winning game designers including Jeff Grubb, Gwendolyn F.M. Kestrel, Jeff Quick, John D. Rateliff, and Thomas M. Reid, A Peculiar Pentad is the first in a series of sourcebooks designed to provide resources and inspiration to Call of Cthulhu players and Keepers alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
