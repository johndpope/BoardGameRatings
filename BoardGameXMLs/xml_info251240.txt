			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Need a side adventure to fill out your game, or an idea to get things going?  Do you find you are hard-pressed to come up with a fun adventure or location for your group this week?  Well, we here at Avalon Games have wandered in with just the thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avalon Lairs offers a short 5e D&amp;amp;D adventure for you to run your players through.  Featuring a lair of some type of creature, each issue of the series will offer a fully realized adventure with encounters, locations, and maps as needed. Nothing grand and detailed, and the adventure is easy to use, simple in design, and fast to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let Avalon do all the work for you so you can have more fun running the game.  Avalon Lairs is that perfect pick-up for the busy gamemaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure takes you into road side inn that has more to offer then just a good ale&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
