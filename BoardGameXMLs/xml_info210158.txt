							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">World-Wide Headlines: Volume Two â€“ Historical Events</name>
									
			<description>This is a party game comprised of 48 cards, each of which bears the title of a fake newspaper, a real date, and a scrambled headline. Players compete to be the first to yell out the correct unscrambled headline, and the player who succeeds most often wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For instance, the Freedom Final for December 24, 1776 reads: SHWANIGOTN ROSCSES LADEEWAR IVRRE. Solution: Washington Crosses Delaware River.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in four versions: World-Wide News (Vol. 1); Historical Events (Vol. 2); Show Business (Vol. 3); and Sports Highlights (Vol. 4).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
