							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Buried Treasure</name>
									
			<description>You have to play cards from your hand to build other players buried treasure. Each round one player gets to dig for treasure from his buried treasure pile, whatever he finds is his to keep but beware turn over the wrong card and another player may steal the remaining treasure or the rest of the dig may be washed away by a flood. A nice pile with lots of cards may be also full of cards from players trying to steal. Easy enough for children to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
