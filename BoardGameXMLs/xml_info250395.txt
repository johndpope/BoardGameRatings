							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Augusta Rose</name>
									
			<description>In 1862, you and your small group of Union spies have been sent on a mission to commandeer a Confederate train, known as the Augusta Rose. You have managed to break into the roundhouse where it is being developed; the train&amp;rsquo;s exterior is similar looking to most steam engines of the day, but once you board the crew cab of the engine, it is a clear that it uses a configuration of technology that you don&amp;rsquo;t understand. &lt;br/&gt;You hear people yelling from outside of the roundhouse. It is time to go. Will you and your company be able to steal the Augusta Rose back to Union territory?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Augusta Rose is a hack of Lasers and Feelings. It is a one-page one-shot game that uses the serial numbers on dollar bills to generate your character and as a way to resolve actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
