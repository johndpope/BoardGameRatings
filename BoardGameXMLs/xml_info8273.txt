							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alexandros</name>
									
			<description>Alexandros is an abstract strategy by Leo Colovini, thematically inspired by the military expansion of Alexander the Great. It includes the &amp;quot;triggered scoring for all&amp;quot; mechanism, which can be considered a trademark of the designer, implemented in many of his games. It forces players to evaluate their actions in relation to what other players can earn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to have more points than other players when the trail/border markers are depleted or someone scores 100 points first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is driven by cards, used for all actions. Clockwise, players are first obliged to move the figure representing Alexandros across a triangular grid. They do this by playing cards with symbols matching those on destination spots. This is the core concept of the game - when the figure of Alexandros is moved, it leaves a trail of borders behind it. Soon, these borders begin to form provinces composed of triangular spaces: either with symbols or empty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After moving Alexandros, players either build their hand of cards by drawing them, take over provinces or trigger scorings if the situation on the board suits them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can occupy provinces by playing cards from their hand and placing tokens representing their leaders on spaces with corresponding symbols. When a scoring is triggered, provinces earn points equal to the number of empty spaces in them. Players can take over empty provinces and/or those occupied by other players. Each player has only four generals and placing them costs valuable cards - the game requires careful hand management and point-to-point movement - to create worthy provinces for scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awarded title of &amp;quot;Best Family Strategy Game&amp;quot; by Games Magazine in 2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
