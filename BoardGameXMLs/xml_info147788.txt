			<description>In Back Up! the object is to reduce your back pain to zero.    Each turn, players pick up a card from the deck and discard, while trying to collect HEALTH cards in their hand.  HEALTH cards reduce your pain, while PAIN cards increase it.  ACTION cards allow players to take cards from other players, discard cards, or draw extra cards from the deck.  Finally, some HEALTH cards cannot be played without a MONEY or INSURANCE card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with 5 cards, but the ACTION cards change the number of cards in your hand. Sometimes you are forced to discard cards that you need.  The rules are simple, but the ACTION cards add a layer of strategy. It has a light humorous feel.  There are 68 cards in a deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
