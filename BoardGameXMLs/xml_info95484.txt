			<description>Card game where each player is a runner in a 100 meter race. The cards (ordinary deck of 52 cards) are shuffled and each player receives 13 cards face down. The players now look at them and sort out 4 cards and from these 4 cards he decides whether to use 1,2,3 or all 4 of them to use in the race. They are used to determine the result of the player. Spades are not allowed to use among these 4 cards. They are instead among the the rest of the cards (9 cards) which are placed face down in front of the player. If a player accuses another player for being doped, he then chooses to look at one (or maybe 2 or up to 4 cards depending on how many cards the player used for the race) of his 9 face down cards, and if any of these cards is a spade, the player is doped and disqualified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This card game was invented by Dan Glimne in 1988 inspired by  Ben Johnson&amp;acute;s Olympic doping scandal at that time. It was published in Spielbox magazine (1989), Games Review Monthly (1989), Dan Glimne book, Nya Spel (1994) and later also in Kortspelshandboken (2005) and Lilla Korstspelshandboken (2006).  It was also published in a Swedish Daily Newspaper (1988).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
