							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dodge Ball</name>
									
			<description>A game played on an 8x8 grid or chessboard. Each player needs six pawns or checkers, etc., to represent the dodge ball team members. These are placed on the back rows of the board at the start of the game. Skills are rolled for each of the players (there are six: Dodge, Fast, Aim, Catch, Strong, and Quick). One piece on each side is designated the Team Captain, who receives a second skill. The game is played using a custom deck of cards. The cards are played to move a player or throw the ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
