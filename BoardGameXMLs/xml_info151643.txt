							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Jane Game</name>
									
			<description>The Jane Game is a trivia board game devoted to Jane Austen&amp;rsquo;s six novels. It is designed to bring Austen admirers together to share in her stories, characters, wit and language. While playing, each participant enters Jane&amp;rsquo;s world as one of her heroines. As such, you seek after a fortunate life by becoming an accomplished woman, gaining societal experience and choosing to marry or not. Through chance, expertise and choice you could become the envied Mrs. Darcy, the pitied Mrs. Collins or the new roommate of Miss Bates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jane Game is for 2-7 players (Austen wrote seven heroines into her six novels) and lasts about an hour to an hour and a half, depending on how chatty and good-humored the heroines are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objective is to obtain the greatest Life Fortune. This can be done by trading your accomplishment cards in for something of greater value. The player with the most Life Fortune is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer's Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jane Game is a mixture between a role-playing and trivia game. Each player becomes one of Jane Austen&amp;rsquo;s heroines seeking after a fortunate life. This fortunate life is best achieved by becoming an accomplished lady, a societal woman and by marrying well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has two phases: Courtship and Marriage.&lt;br/&gt; During the Courtship Phase, turns consist of either answering trivia (there are options of guidance from a governess for those who are not as well versed in Austen&amp;rsquo;s works) or of acquiring Societal Tokens (Family, Ball, Trip). Trivia answered correctly gives Accomplishment Cards, which are used to acquire Societal Tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Marriage Phase is quick and starts once the first heroine is married. At this point, each heroine goes to the church where proposals come according to how well trivia is answered. She then can choose her hero (i.e. Mr. Darcy), alternate (i.e. Mr. Collins), or to not marry at all (i.e. become Miss Bates&amp;rsquo; new roommate).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all heroines have the option to marry or not, Life Fortune Points are counted and the heroine with the most wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
