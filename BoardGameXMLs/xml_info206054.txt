			<description>The Berlin Slang-Memo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yourself as Bolle amuse? No problem with the memory game Kodderschnauze!&lt;br/&gt;Acquire at Aldi ne pack Schrippenpuffer or lubricates ne nice plate sandwiches with Moppelkotze, the Miefquirl turns on and off you go. Here two different word-parts have to be discovered, which together make up a typical Berlin slang - equal with High German translation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All cards are placed with the Word face down on the table and mixed well.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in a clockwise direction.&lt;br/&gt;On his turn, a player must turn over two cards. If the two cards add up to a real slang expression, the player may take the card pair and once again turn over two cards. That is until he reveals two non-matching cards. Then the next player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;To win the game you have to collect the most pairs of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
