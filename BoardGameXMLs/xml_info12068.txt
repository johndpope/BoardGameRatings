			<description>This game is simply a small booklet, 36 pages.  The players need to supply miniatures, terrain, dice, etc.  This game is strictly for skirmish wargaming, meaning one figure represents one person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains rules for miniatures gaming with 17th-century swashbuckling pirates and musketeers, as seen in the movies.  Rules are given for movement, ranged combat,  melee combat, morale, etc.  The most interesting rules are the &amp;quot;cinematic&amp;quot; rules, however.  Figures are defined as either Leading Players, Supporting Actors, Bit Parts or Extras.  A Leading Player can mow through a &lt;b&gt;lot&lt;/b&gt; of Extras without even slowing down, but combat between two characters of the same level is tense and more drawn out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are also given for two types of stunts: Deeds of Derring-Do and Dramatic Entrances.  Very entertaining!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules not only deal with figures, but also cover ship-to-ship combat and boarding.  The ship movement system is very simple and completely ignores the wind even though these are sailing ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the game provides two scenarios - &amp;quot;Scripts,&amp;quot; they call it, in keeping with their cinematic theme.  One scenario is for pirates and the other for musketeers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a light, easy, not too detailed set of miniatures rules aimed at fun rather than historical accuracy.  It doesn't require a lot of miniatures to get started - even four figures per side makes for an entertaining game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Note: there is a companion volume, Once Upon a Time in the West Country, set in the English Civil War.  Similar rules system, somewhat less cinematic.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
