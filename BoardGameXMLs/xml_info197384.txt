							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Noises in the Old Theater</name>
									
			<description>An introductory one-shot suitable for small groups or a brave adventurer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rumor is that yesterday, the second rate thieves that camp in the abandoned theater intercepted a fine merchant convoy, and now most of them are in the city, drunk or wasted. Perfect day for a small incursion in the thieves lair. In 'n' out. Easy money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But last night a huge thump was heard near the entrance. Probably just another piece of roof falling apart. The few thieves that guard the keep have been hearing constant noises since, they are afraid that the building may collapse. If only they knew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is for beginning characters using nearly any tabletop fantasy role-playing game.  Statistics are provided in a generic format somewhat like &amp;quot;old school&amp;quot; gaming products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
