			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conflict: Desert Storm II, released as Conflict: Desert Storm II: Back to Baghdad in North America, is a 2003 video game set during the Gulf War. The game puts the player in command of a special forces squad of four men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set during the first Gulf War, the four squad members of either the British 22nd SAS or the US Army Delta Force must battle their way through ten missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can control one member at a time but can also give remote commands to other squad members. It is possible for two players to play simultaneously, each controlling two soldiers. Up to four can play in the Gamecube and Xbox versions. The player can use different tactics, such as focusing on a head on approach or by using stealth against a variety of forces from the Iraqi military. The player is not limited to the original arsenal, and may appropriate enemy weapons and munitions. Different orders, such as &amp;quot;follow me&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;fire at will&amp;quot; can be given to the soldiers not being controlled by the player (who can switch control between them at will).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
