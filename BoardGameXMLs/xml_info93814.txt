							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Leap Frog</name>
									
			<description>Leap Frog is a children's game for two players. The board contains a grid, representing a lilly pond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has five lilly pad counters, which are moved around the pond according to the roll of a die. In addition, each player has four frog counters, which start on opposite banks of the pond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to move all four frogs to the other side of the pond - but you're only allowed to jump to a location that contains a lilly pad. Frogs are allowed to &amp;quot;leapfrog&amp;quot; over lilly pads which contain another frog (as long as there's an empty lilly pad on the other side).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to successfully move all four frogs to the opposite side of the board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
