			<description>Vistula-Oder-Berlin: the campaign in Poland and East Germany, 1945 is a simulation for two or more players that simulate the 1945 campaign  in Poland and Eastern Germany from January to May.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historically, the Soviet troops occupied Berlin in May 1945 and the third Reich collapsed. However if the Panzer Army, sent to the Hungarian Front, was defending the capital, the final result could have been different. On the other hand, if the Soviet forces besieging the fortified city of K&amp;ouml;nigsberg had concentrated their fighting power in the center, the fight might have been bigger than historical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The German army is specialized in mobile counterattacks by armored troops and the Soviet army has excellent breakthrough ability and large concentrating firepower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two scenarios: campaign (Deutschland Kaputt! January-May, from the Vistula-Oder operation to the fall of Berlin and Prague) and Der Katastrophe (January-March 1945).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 turn = 2 weeks&lt;br/&gt;1 hex = about 20 km&lt;br/&gt;1 Unit = German Army: Battalion to Division, Soviet Army: Corps&lt;br/&gt;Number of players = 2&lt;br/&gt;Play time = 6 to 10 hours (depending on the scenario)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    308 pieces (12.5 mm square)&lt;br/&gt;    One map (A1 size)&lt;br/&gt;    One rule book (12 pages)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(adapted from Japanese website text)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game system is similar to Hongrie 1944-1945 (Vae Victis #78, Command Japan #100) system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
