			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mini-adventure for the Tails of Equestria storytelling game has been written so that a Games Master can use it as a scene within a main adventure he or she is running. If you want to take part in this adventure as a pony character, do not read on as you will spoil your enjoyment of it for you and your friends. Everything written below is for the eyes of the GM only!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure involves the pony characters meeting a practical joker whose pranks unintentionally cause mayhem and endanger everyone around. The PCs must try to repair the damage caused and make the prankster realise that sometimes a joke can have unintended consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
