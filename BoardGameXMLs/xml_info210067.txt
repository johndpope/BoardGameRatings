							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Giant Tales: Well of Victory &amp; The Chosen</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two giant themed adventures to challenge your party.  These adventures can stand alone, or be easily integrated into your Storm King's Thunder campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Well of Victory, characters follow Berdusk Grey, relic hunter, into a sacred barbarian barrow mound and find an ancient memorial to giants that fell in the great war against dragons.  This adventure is designd for a party of 4-6 characters of 4th level.  It provides a perfect transition from A Great Upheaval or other low-level adventures into the main storyline of Storm king's Thunder.  Besides opportunities for role playing and combat, the adventure introduces a bit of giant lore to the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Chosen, the characters meet the neighbors from hell.  An ettin priest, pregnant with the Chosen of Grolantor, and her mate have been hunting the lands around their home for the past two weeks &amp;ndash; pillaging livestock from the farms in the area.  This adventure is designed for a party of 4-6 level 7 characters and can be placed seamlessly into the chapter 3 explorations of Storm King's Thunder.  The adventure subtly hints at the possible reorganization of the giant Ordning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Giant Tales also includes two new magic items.  The Kongspira is a giant-sized ceremonial whetstone embued with the power of the Kong (king) rune.  The rune casting bowl gives a character the opportunity to become a seer - bloody viking fortune cookie prophecies!  This magic item includes meanings for each of the 20 giant runes (based on similar Norse runes) and 40 magical effects (including 13 unlucky effects).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
