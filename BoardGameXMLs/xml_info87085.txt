			<description>Enter the Labyrinth and Rescue the Princess is a free print and play game in which one or two players must explore a labyrinth to rescue a princess in an attempt to win her love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has two paths to victory. In the first, you must try to find at least six of the princesses seven missing belongings in order to curry her favor. In the second, you must kill the labyrinth's minotaur and bring its horns to the princess to prove your courage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a paragraph system for events. When a player lands in a square, he or she looks up that square in the paragraph book to see what happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the two player game, the player who retrieves the most missing possessions wins. If one player slays the minotaur then he or she is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
