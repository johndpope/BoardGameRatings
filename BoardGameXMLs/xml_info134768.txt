							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sagas of the Icelanders (Preview Version)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains the rules and instructions for a tabletop roleplaying game, specifically a game about Viking settlers in Iceland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is about the trials, tribulations and adventures of the first settlers of Iceland, as described in the Icelandic Sagas. The so called Saga Period lasted roughly from 875, when the first permanent Norse settlers arrived, until 1085, when the first local bishop established a church in the south of Iceland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the game is rooted both in history and prose of the Sagas, it is not your job to recreate either of those. While I strove to make the information in this book as factual as possible, it is not your place to fret about &amp;ldquo;historical accuracy&amp;rdquo; or worry whether you're following the actual narrative of the sagas. We play to to discover and be surprised, not to retell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We also play because the characters are cool, mysterious, fallible, badass, despicable, inspiring human beings. We want to follow their lives, see what they do and what happens to them, just like the characters we love to see in the best kind of fiction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version was just distributed to the Indiegogo project backers. It is pre-editing and pre-art, so it's not clear how much will change before the final version, though the game play certainly won't.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
