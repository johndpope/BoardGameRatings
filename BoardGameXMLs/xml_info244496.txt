							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Herding Cats (with Goblins)</name>
									
			<description>Izzy Ickybit, a boisterous Goblin Matriarch, is rather fond of her collection of singing/yowling cats. Each morning, these scraggly felines express their anguish and hunger through a symphony of hisses and wails while their cages sway and clink in the breeze.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On boring afternoons these cats are released into a den of embittered Owlbedillos alongside several of Izzy's more annoying subjects. These poor unfortunate souls (a.k.a. you) will have to finagle your footing and fight dirty to collect as many points worth of cats as possible. This may sound easy, but then again you're herding cats - with Goblins...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Herding Cats (with Goblins) is a quick and chaotic arena based card game designed in 30 days for Concrete Canoes' and The Game Crafters' &amp;quot;Hook box challenge&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unique game takes the 18 cards available to their limit. Each card determines the random placement of adorable cats, vicious &amp;quot;Owlbedillos&amp;quot; (which are also adorable) and player characters; the abilities that characters are capable of using each turn; AND measuring the different distances that your characters can move during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
