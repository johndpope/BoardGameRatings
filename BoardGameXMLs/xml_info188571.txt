			<description>Santa Guise is coming to town! He's decking the halls AND decking villains right and left! He has presents for all of his friends, but you can only unwrap them when he says it's OK, so you'd better be on his &amp;quot;Nice&amp;quot; list! And beware: if Guise is incapacitated, the dreaded Green Grosser will enact his latest plot, ushering in his War on Christmas!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, the heroes known as Bunker, Absolute Zero, and Unity are working to uncover the mystery behind the villain Chokepoint. How did she get so much power? And why was she locked up in a secret bunker in Fort Adamant? What is really going on here? Armed with some new tricks, the heroes have to get to the bottom of this, before it's too late...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
