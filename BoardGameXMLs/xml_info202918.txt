							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Newcomb: Prison Planet</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Newcomb: Prison Planet details an Imperial prison world in the Solomani Rim subsector, Newcomb / Banasdan 2913. There are over 301 billion inhabitants in the Solomani Rim, and the 40,000 or so relatively law-abiding inhabitants of Newcomb reside alongside around 1,700 of the most dangerous captive criminals among that population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Solomani Rim is of course politically divided between the Imperium and the Solomani Confederation, and this is invariably refl ected upon Newcomb. The prison facility is a rough and ready institution, socially isolated, politically neglected, and severely lacking in investment over a number of years. It is a run-down, relatively low technology facility, operated by people who don&amp;rsquo;t want to be there, but have no choice other than to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
