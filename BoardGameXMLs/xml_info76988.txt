			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on the success of their isometric 3D game Android Two, Vortex published a helicopter game, Cyclone. You fly over landscapes, rescuing people and five crates. Accurate and careful control is needed, and the player can switch between views. This helps locate items, but confuses your flying. You land to refuel and the levels get harder as you progress. Again, by clever use of the Spectrum's graphics, a strong 3D illusion is well made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
