			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He's Swift. She's Lucky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before they were Mercury (PL 10) and Violet (PL 10), the Niemczyk twins were just Pavel and Wioletta, Polish orphans living a harsh life of foster homes and abuse. When their Meta powers flourished, they were taken in by Polarity, the powerful master of the Meta nation group, who claimed he just wanted safety and peace for their kind. But when he was revealed to be a warmonger, Mercury and Violet used their superhuman speed and probability manipulation to assist in defeating Polarity, and have since gained a pardon in return for joining the hero group the Sentinels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
