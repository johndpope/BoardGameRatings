			<description>Sacraboar is a real-time capture-the-pig strategy game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, what does this mean and what is &amp;quot;capture the pig&amp;quot;?&lt;br/&gt;You command your units like you do in well-known real-time strategy games. Your goal is to get the enemy's pig trophy and protect your own from being stolen. To take the enemy's pig trophy you have to send one of your units to the enemy's pig stand to grab it. When the unit has taken the trophy you need to send it back to your own pig stand to score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enemy can stop you by killing the capper (the unit that carries the pig), or he can prevent you from scoring by grabbing your pig. You can only score when your pig is on its stand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a pig-carrier is killed, he drops the pig. You can return it to your own pig stand by having one of your units walk over it - the pig will then be teleported back to its stand. When one of your units touches a dropped enemy pig, it will automatically grab it and be a new capper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building your army&lt;br/&gt;When the game starts, each player has enough credits to build a good army. You can start producing units right from the first second. Each time one of your units is killed, you will instantly get your money back. So make sure you have your units out there and not too much money in your account! You can raise your budget by building resource towers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units&lt;br/&gt;There are seven different types of units. Six of them are fighters, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. The seventh unit is the builder: builders are unarmed and cannot carry or return the pig. They can transform into towers that give you more money or powerful spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Towers&lt;br/&gt;A builder can transform into one of the following towers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resource Tower:    Increases your budget so that you can build a bigger army.&lt;br/&gt;Speed Tower:    Gives you access to the speed spells. Accelerate your units, slow down the enemies.&lt;br/&gt;Neutralize Tower:    Freeze the enemy's units, delete spells that he cast on your units or block him from using spells for a limited time.&lt;br/&gt;Protection Tower:    Heal your units or make them invulnerable for a limited time.&lt;br/&gt;Damage Tower:    Increase the damage of your unit's guns, block shots of enemy units or transform one of your units into a running time-bomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;16 powerful spells to choose from&lt;br/&gt;5 different towers&lt;br/&gt;League mode with four difficulty levels&lt;br/&gt;Cup mode with four difficulty levels&lt;br/&gt;89 Missions, each with three difficulty levels&lt;br/&gt;6 additional tutorial missions&lt;br/&gt;Skirmish and Extended Skirmish with 18 difficulty levels&lt;br/&gt;Mixing of game modes possible&lt;br/&gt;Easy code system for saving interesting combinations of game modes&lt;br/&gt;Saving replays&lt;br/&gt;Win Bronze, Silver, Gold and All Star league and cup trophies&lt;br/&gt;Win Bronze, Silver and Gold medals for accomplished missions&lt;br/&gt;Get Fame Points for winning missions&lt;br/&gt;LAN games&lt;br/&gt;Internet games&lt;br/&gt;Trophy room that lists all your achievements&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
