							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Isle of Dread</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Based loosely on the old D&amp;amp;D Expert Rules system. This is a conversion of Dungeon Module X1 'The Isle of Dread'. Each player has an Adventuring Party in search of Adventure &amp;amp; Fortune. Each party is represented by a pawn on the track.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls a party of six adventurers. Each adventurer has a class (Fighter, Thief, Cleric, Magic User, Elf, Dwarf, or Halfling) and skills in three attributes (Stealth, Magic, and Fighting.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a track ninety spaces long, which abstractly represents distance and time. The game ends when the first party reaches the end space. The player who has the most gold at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played using the WarpQuest game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
