							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scramble for Africa</name>
									
			<description>Scramble for Africa is a strategic-level game of European expansion on the African continent in the late 19th Century, including all sorts of politically incorrect activities such as exploitation of natural resources, oppression of hapless natives and various other forms of naked aggression that should never be attempted in real life.  Two to seven players compete to establish their empires, responding to unexpected discoveries that could represent either a boon or a challenge. The blank map of Africa is before you; will Great Britain build an empire from Cairo to the Cape of Good Hope, will the French restore their pride with an empire second to none, or will other imperial powers old and new claim a place in the sun? &lt;br/&gt; Scramble for Africa recreates the European partition of Africa in the final decades of the nineteenth century, combining a strong historical theme and the random element of discovery with a simple positional game system reminiscent of the Japanese game of go. Each player manages one of the great imperial powers, exploring, staking claims, and developing areas. Intended as an introductory game for the uninitiated or light entertainment for the veteran, Scramble for Africa will appeal to &amp;quot;Euro&amp;quot; gamers and historical gamers alike. &lt;br/&gt; Played on an authentic 19th-century map of Africa, Scramble for Africa includes two scenarios, one historical and one hypothetical, each playable in under two hours. Complexity is easy (about 2/10).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
