			<description>A Match Made In Austen is a game of storytelling, strategy and serendipity, inspired by the timeless works of Jane Austen. Tell your story, roll the dice, and see if your matches are made in heaven or in hell... or in Austen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains key male and female characters from the main novels of Jane Austen, namely: Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Emma, Persuasion, Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. The goal of the game is to create the best possible romantic matches between them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has three male cards and three female cards. Each player takes a turn hosting an event (parties, afternoon teas, dinners) and players bring one, or more, pair of male and female characters to the party. During the events, incidents occur, described by the host. Each female character reacts to the event by trying to showcase one of the following virtues: beauty, wit, friendliness, propriety, accomplishments, loyalty, fortune, and independence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the event is over, the host chooses the best storyteller among the other players. This player gets an advantage in the next part of the round: the proposal. The players use one male character to propose to one lady present, making their choices according to the virtues listed on the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has three matches. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
