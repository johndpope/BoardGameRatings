							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">My 1st Game Association: Emotions</name>
									
			<description>This game is aimed at introducing little ones to the world of board games as early as age 2. At his age they are very skilled at recognizing the many emotions vital to their social development. Joy, sorrow, anger and fear are four basic emotions underlying social interaction. This game provides an excellent opportunity for you to accompany little ones in this new way of interacting with others through a simplified game designed just for them. With its two levels of difficulty, this association game will follow children as they progress.&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to fill the illustrated game boards with the emotion-disks. At first the child is just playing a matching game on their own which introduces them to emotions. In multi-player form each player gets a board and on your turn you turn over a disk. If a player has that disk on their board they get to keep it otherwise is it set aside. In the more advanced version you only keep the disk if it is on your board otherwise you put it back face down. The first player to fill their game board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
