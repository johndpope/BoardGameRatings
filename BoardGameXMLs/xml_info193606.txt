							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Trickster</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most tricksters are two steps ahead of the competition. A few know how to win before the race even begins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trickster is a new Pathfinder Roleplaying Game compatible class which combines arcane magic with roguish skills. Use your special Forte ability to perform incredible acrobatics, summon a magical familiar to act as an accomplice, beguile enemies, or steal spells as they&amp;rsquo;re being cast! Outwit your foes and outrun your enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Paths 8: The Trickster gives you everything you need to play a trickster whose understanding of the arcane is matched only by his charming and debonair style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer Marc Radle has provided a daring and risk-taking new base class including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    4 new Fortes such as Arcane Accomplice, Beguiling, and Spell Pilfering&lt;br/&gt;    8 new base class abilities such as Sneakspell and Ranged Legerdemain&lt;br/&gt;    a full 20-level class that knows when to walk away, and when to run!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you use these powers for good, for seduction, or for power and wealth is entirely up to you--but who says you have to choose just one? Get The Trickster today, wield great arcane might, and have the satisfaction of always being ahead of the pack!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
