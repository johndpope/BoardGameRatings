							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">In Yer Face Wrasslin: Board Game</name>
									
			<description>A tabletop Pro-Wrestling match simulation board game.&lt;br/&gt;Two players each take the role of one of nine outrageous and 'In Yer Face' Wrasslers as they face off in a one vs one Wrasslin match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wrasslers take turns spending MP to move around the game's box (the Ring) and Attack.  Every Wrassler has varying Attack and Defend cards to try and either deal Hurt to an opponent, or avoid taking Hurt themselves.  After Attack and Defend cards are revealed, the Attacker rolls a single 6-sided Attack dice to determine if the Attack hit or missed.  &lt;br/&gt;Wrasslers can also pay MP to run, climb to the top rope, and brawl outside of the ring, as well as use traditional Wrasslin' weapons like Chairs and Tables to do even more Hurt.  Finishers, Taunts, Special cards, and unique Wrassler abilities also feature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reduce a Wrassler's Hurt Points low enough, and a player can try to Pin or Submit that Wrassler and win the match!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tag team matches allow up to 4 players, and 5 different stipulation matches, like the 'Raise the Roof' Ladder match are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
