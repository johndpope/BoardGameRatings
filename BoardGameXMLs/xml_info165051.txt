			<description>Journey treacherous tombs, vanquish vile creatures, defend your homeland from ancient evil. Oh, and don't forget to grab the loot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doom Tomb Tactics is a strategy-adventure game which pits one or two players against The Wretched, a dark and powerful force who has returned from the grave to strike fear into the hearts of the peaceful Onakwan people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player assumes the role of one of four classic characters, each with their own unique skills and abilities. Heroes traverse four different Levels, infiltrating Tombs in an attempt to slay the abominations within, and if successful, claim defeated Wretchs' Loot, which can later be used to purchase Artifacts including weapons, armor, and spells. During exploration and combat, Heroes spend Power Tokens to activate and resolve Artifacts and Special Abilities, and can also seek out Treasure, including more Loot and Power Tokens, but beware. Sometimes it's a Trap!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each level is constructed with four Maps. The first three of these maps are completely randomized, and contain various obstacles and enemies, while the last map contains the level's Tomb Boss. To accomplish their Quest, the Heroes of Onakwa must fight their way through these Forbidden Tombs and defeat all four Tomb Bosses, including the dreaded Zhakoros.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
