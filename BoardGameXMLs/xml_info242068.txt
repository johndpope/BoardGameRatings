							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Glamis Castle</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to ancient legend and records, [Glamis Castle] is one of the most haunted sites in Great Britain.  One Lady Glamis, known to be in league with the devil, liked to send out a destructive demon to harass the townspeople.  She finally was burnt at the stake on Castle Hill, cursing as she died all future generations of the Lyon family.  Her demon still seems to haunt that spot, murdering the curious who stray up to Castle Hill after dark.  The curse stipulated that each succeeding generation would have at least one child, often female, who would be a vampire.  When an heir comes of age, there is a secret ceremony in which the heir, his father, and the steward take crowbars and chip away plaster concealing a hidden chamber, known only to them, that Earl Patie used when he gambled with the devil.  Another tradition says that a creature, half-man, half-beast stalks the passages of in the walls of Glamis to insure the fulfilling of the curse.  The mystery, of course, is to determine the location of this secret chamber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This title had a lengthy (and repeatedly delayed) development and release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
