			<description>The idea for this game is based on Reinhold Wittig's earlier game &amp;quot;Spiel&amp;quot; (#2229). In fact, it contains the same game board, but instead of dice there are building bricks in different sizes, rubber bands and wooden balls. &lt;br/&gt;The original game contains a rule sheet with three games and the encouragement to invent more (much like in &amp;quot;Spiel&amp;quot;, for which way over 100 game ideas were submitted by players, about 50 of which were published in a rule booklet).&lt;br/&gt;The game rules supplied include:&lt;br/&gt;- &amp;quot;Das Nest&amp;quot;: Two players place their bricks on the game board, trying to build &amp;quot;nests&amp;quot; (holes which only consist of their own color). Then they can put an &amp;quot;egg&amp;quot; (wooden ball) into the nest. The player who placed most eggs at the end of the game, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- &amp;quot;Balance&amp;quot;: The game board is placed upright, with one brick under it in one corner. Another brick is placed on top of that corner. All players then take turn placing bricks into the other side of the base, trying to make it topple. The first player to suspect an imbalance can lift the brick on top of the corner. If the board topples, that player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- &amp;quot;Die h&amp;auml;ngenden G&amp;auml;rten der Semiramis&amp;quot;: The game board is turned over. Two rubber bands are stretched over the bottom, then bricks are piled up by the players. Whoever topples the fragile construction, loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
