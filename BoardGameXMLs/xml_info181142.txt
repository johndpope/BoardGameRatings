							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War on the High Seas</name>
									
			<description>War on the High Seas is set in the year of 1750 around the time that world trade was plagued by piracy, dangerous ocean voyages and fierce wars. Can you a small time merchant battle the stormy oceans and avoid the scourge of piracy to rise up with a fleet of merchant ships and enough wealth to become the leading merchant the world has ever known. Or will you get drawn in to a life of piracy, fighting and stealing your fortune. Or perhaps you will find wealth in war and help your nation conquer the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin the game representing one of the major nations of 1750 as a small time merchant with limited ships and wealth, they have to trade goods across the world visiting ports until they can expand. With each new ship they add to their convoy their power across the oceans grows and they must decide when the time is right how they will gain a victory and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four ways to win the game, by trade, piracy, war or a mixture of all three. Each turn players roll a dice and move across the seas from port to port, where they can either trade, attack, offer passage, repair or buy another ship. Attacking ports and other convoys will lead to piracy unless first a letter of marquee is obtained from the players government. Becoming a Pirate has few rewards and will immediately alienate you from ports unless it too flies the Jolly Rodger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game evolves quickly and as the players get closer to their winning objectives, a race emerges to either beat them to the pip or to sabotage their efforts and gain some more time to build on their own convoy. Only the brave and unscrupulous can hope to gain a foot hold in the war on the high seas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
