							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Mr Graves</name>
									
			<description>Mr. Graves is an expansion unit for Malifaux. He belongs to the Neverborn faction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Graves is the Honeypot's bouncer and secret Nephilim skinwalker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mobility&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Graves respectable walk and charge ranges and has Shove Aside, allowing him to move through HT 1 or 2 models. He has a (1) action called &amp;quot;Show ya the door&amp;quot; that initiates a CB-&amp;gt;DF Duel with Graves and an enemy model within 1&amp;quot;. If Graves wins he can Push the model up to 5&amp;quot; and graves can then push himself into Base contact with that model. He has a (0) spell called &amp;quot;Bar's Closed&amp;quot; that's a 6&amp;quot; pulse. He picks a spot within LOS and 6&amp;quot; and any model that fails to resist the spell (using willpower) is pushed 4&amp;quot; directly away from the chosen spot. Although this ability does not move Mr. Graves himself, it can be useful for adding to the speed of his crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Offense&lt;br/&gt;His fencepost packs a nasty punch with a minimum of 3 Dg and receives a positive flip to damage against Height 1 and height 2 models. He can flurry with that Fence post, and he gets a Rams to his combat when swinging on models with the Brilliance characteristic. This allows him to easily trigger &amp;quot;Broke Something&amp;quot; which causes a model damaged by the Fence Post to be unable to spend more than 2 AP during its next activation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He has the Wicked and Ruthless characteristics as well to let his disengaging strikes hurt and ignore those harmless/pitiful models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He also has a ranged damaging spell - Settel Tab, one that he can discard cards for in order to gain positive flips on its damage. This can be used in melee and has a respectable severe damage of 5. Bear this in mind if you are facing spirits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resilience&lt;br/&gt;He has Black Blood to punish people hitting him in Melee along with Armor 1 and Slow to Die. He has a (0) spell called &amp;quot;Keeping the Peace&amp;quot; that's a 6&amp;quot; Aura that makes charging enemy models win a CB-&amp;gt;12 duel before their attack flip or they receive a negative flip to their charge damage. He is Ht3, so keep this in mind when it comes to hiding models behind him and when trying to get him into cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tips and Tricks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bar's Closed&lt;br/&gt;Although at first glance Mr. Graves seems to be not a lot more than a beatstick, this surprisingly versatile spell gives him much more scope in a crew. Unlike similar spells, such as Zoraida's repulsive, the push effect does not emanate from the model generating the pulse, but from a point he picks when he casts the spell. It must be noted that it isn't models within 6&amp;quot; of the point that are affected, its all models within 6&amp;quot; of Mr. Graves.&lt;br/&gt;Some tricks that can be played with this ability include, but are not limited to:&lt;br/&gt;push your models further up the table&lt;br/&gt;push enemy models off objectives&lt;br/&gt;push models into Mr. Graves' melee range so that he can flurry them.&lt;br/&gt;push models off heights to cause damage&lt;br/&gt;separate models that are engaged in melee&lt;br/&gt;push brilliant models towards the Hungering Darkness so it can feed from them&lt;br/&gt;bring a model closer to Mr. Graves so that he can use Show Ya The Door&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
