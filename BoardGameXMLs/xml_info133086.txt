			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes rules supplements read like the world-setting bible of frustrated novelists. While solid world- building is a useful skill, you don&amp;rsquo;t always need four paragraphs of flavor text to tell you swords are cool, magic is power, shadows are scary, and orcs are savage. Sometimes a GM doesn&amp;rsquo;t have time to slog through a page of history for every magic weapon. Sometimes all that&amp;rsquo;s needed are a few cool ideas, with just enough information to use them in a game. Sometimes, all you need are bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1 With A Bullet Point is a line of very short, cheap PDFs each of which gives the bare bones of a set of related options. It may be five spells, six feats, eight magic weapon special abilities, or any other short set of related rules we can cram into about a page. Short and simple, these PDFs are for GMs and players who know how to integrate new ideas into their campaigns without any hand-holding, and just need fresh ideas and the rules to support them. No in-character fiction setting the game world. No charts and tables. No sidebars of explanations and optional rules. Just one sentence of explanation for the High Concept of the PDF, then bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five feats designed to augment spells used with riders, or improve &amp;ldquo;steed spells&amp;rdquo; (spells that conjure a creature or force to act as a mount for one or more characters, such as ghost wolf, mount, phantom chariot, phantom steed, and the communal versions of such spells).This is the latest in a series of products to celebrate the &amp;quot;Summer of Bullets&amp;quot; event!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The feats included are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Aethon: When you use spells to protect yourself or allies, you also extend that protection to their steeds.&lt;br/&gt;    Buraq: When you use spells to heal yourself or allies, you also extend that healing to their steeds.&lt;br/&gt;    Augment Steed: Your steed spells can boost the effectiveness of mundane steeds.&lt;br/&gt;    Heighten Steed Spell: You can make your conjured steeds are faster and tougher than most.&lt;br/&gt;    Summon Steed: You can summon monsters ready to serve as steeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
