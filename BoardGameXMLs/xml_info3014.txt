			<description>HiQue bills itself as &amp;quot;the missing link between Chess and Checkers&amp;quot;. Play is on a 7x7 board, but the black and white squares are rotated 45 degrees so as to appear as diamonds to the players. There are 9 pieces per side: 5 &amp;quot;runners&amp;quot; and 4 &amp;quot;guards&amp;quot;. The object is to get a runner from your back row to the opponent's back row. Runners may move one space forward or to either side, but not backwards. Guards may move any number of unobstructed spaces in any of the 4 directions. Due to the diamond formation, guards are always on black squares and runners always on white squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Runners may be captured if 2 enemy guards occupy adjacent spaces. Multiple runners may be captured in one move of a guard in this manner. Guards may never be captured. Play ends when one runner makes it to the enemy back line, or all of one side's runners are eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game plays quickly and easily. There aren't a lot of pieces, and the runners are in constant jeopardy from the guards. This is a game of deterrent: making sure your opponent doesn't take your pieces by setting up attacks of your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sides seem to be the safest places for runners, but they're very vulnerable anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A &amp;quot;lite&amp;quot; game that is perfect for a few quick matches on a rainy day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
