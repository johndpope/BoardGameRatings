			<description>The game is played in 5 rounds for which the number of cards per player changes each time (7,8,9,8,7).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player bets on the number of tricks that he hoped to get.&lt;br/&gt;There are 5 colors with the numbers 1 to 9 and knight, king,  executioner (0 or 10 depending on the player's choice), dragon and the witch who are are stronger (except in the last 3 turn or they are worthless).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player commits a color, the others should play the same color and bigger card to take the trick.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game everyone counts the number of tricks performed. if the bet is won, the player multiplies the &amp;quot;tricks&amp;quot; by two and adds it to his 100 points. If the bet is not won it calculates and subtracts the difference to his score.&lt;br/&gt;Player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
