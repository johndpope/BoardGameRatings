			<description>A snowmobile racing game (&amp;quot;Cat&amp;quot; refers to the &amp;quot;Arctic Cat&amp;quot; model of snowmobile) with individually rated machines and drivers. Hard to find and collectible, it has a plastic-covered board with slots for vehicle and driver cards, so that maneuvers can be marked during the course of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is divided into regions with different speed characteristics, and there are numerous hazards (bumps, grooves, and ice) that drivers must take into account when making moves. There is also the ability to &amp;quot;force over&amp;quot; other drivers, even off the racing surface - giving the game a more gladiatorial twist. Movement and reaction to hazards are effected by dice rolls, though some drivers provide the ability to move at &amp;quot;maximum speed&amp;quot; during the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
