			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each character played is a unique individual, whose skills and talents vary from other characters, be it in their classes, skills or feats. Have you been looking for those feats that should exist, but just don't? Maybe you want a multiclass psion / monk? Then Ascetic Mind is for you. Or maybe you have a passion for the wilder? Euphoric Aura or Master Wilder might be just what you're looking for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose the feats that really fit your character with the 12 pages of new material found in The Mind Unveiled: Feats, which details over 60 new feats, granting a host of new options for your characters - player and non-player alike!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the host of new general, psionic, and metapsionic feats introduced, a new mantra feat is introduced, as well as two brand new feat types: phrenic and qaelic, which are available to those creatures who have survived encounters with the dreaded phrenic scourge, or who have studied the connection to the Dreamscape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mind Unveiled: Feats is written by Andreas R&amp;ouml;nnqvist, whose other works include The Mind Unveiled: Morphean, High Psionics: Psicrystals Expanded, and High Psionics: Sequestral Feats, and has artwork by Trejo Ruelas and V. Shane.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
