			<description>A Game of aerial Dragon Combat!  Use your dragon to fight others in 3-D aerial action.  Anywhere from two to ten players can engage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in the air surrounding a floating castle.  Teams of 5 dragons each (chromatic on one side, metallic on the other) square off in battle to decide who takes possession of the floating Castle and the immense treasure within!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic game starts with each dragon's player rolling a d10 for initiative.  Highest roll goes first, ties roll-off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement then commences, allowing each dragon to move 18 inches, curving or turning at will.  Facing is not taken into account.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After movement, each dragon may attack (either with breath weapons or by melee if in range) or defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attacking with breath weapons have a 9 inch range, and automatically hits any target within range.  The target takes the 1d8x10 hp, and may save for half damage (all of the dragon stats are listed on a stat sheet that was included).  Breath weapons may be used three times per dragon per game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For melee attacks, the dragon must be within base contact.  The dragon rolls a d20, and hits on a six or better.  damage is recorded against the targets hp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a dragon is out of range, it may Defend, allowing it to strike any dragon that comes into attack range, even on another dragon's turn (used to counterstrike when an enemy dragon moves into range).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragons are defeated when their HP are reduced to zero.  The first team to destroy the other, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced rules allow for dragon individualization, age categories, distinct breath weapon types, better Thac0 or ht points, immunities, riders, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
