			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Nemesis VII: Unsettled Spirits, we present five incorporeal entities ready to challenge your heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wualhan: A demon who, through an imperfect summoning, is now bound to the form of a common black dog. Despite the weakened form, Wualhan is still more than capable of causing destruction wherever he roams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elizabeth Goodmanne: The ghost of a nine-year-old girl that &amp;quot;adopts&amp;quot; other corporeal undead as her parents, and then lures the unsuspecting to serve as a meal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amos Haber: After leading an angry mob that murdered an innocent woman, Haber and the entire village found themselves cursed. Now Haber haunts his old home to terrorize both the living and his fellow ghosts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Queen Cordellia: After losing her kingdom, Cordellia slowly lost her sanity and was eventually executed for multiple murderers. Now her ghost seeks to reclaim her lost treasures...at any cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taylor Johnson: A novice adventurer caught in the snare of a cursed mask, Johnson now wanders from tavern to tavern, unaware of his own undead state, trying to recruit other adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product also includes five unique items that can be used with these NPCs, or as stand-alone story hooks themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is designed for 3.5/OGL fantasy settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
