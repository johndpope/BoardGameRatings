			<description>Welcome to West's Great American Case Race Game. The objective is to have some old-fashioned fun as you learn the advantages that determine success in computer-assisted legal research. But that's not all. It's a fast-moving game, and it will take some strategy and thinking to win. You will have to make a lot of on-the-spot decisions. The challenge makes the game all the more fun! The rules are straightforward and most of the rules for the game are printed on the board itself. &lt;br/&gt;West Publishing Company was the parent company for the Westlaw computer-assisted research service, which this game was apparently designed to promote over the competing service, Lexis. The game includes Westlaw and Lexis cards. The Westlaw cards usually score points for the player due to efficient and easy to use services, while the Lexis cards typically cause the players to lose points because of purported 'difficulties' with West's competitor's service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
