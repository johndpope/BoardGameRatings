							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ruins of Trostenhal: Entrance</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago the Dwarves of Trostenhal were famous throughout the Fourteen Kingdoms as smiths, weaponmasters and runemages. People travelled to the grand hold of Trostenhal and the trade made the Dwarves wealthy and respected. What happened to ruin this is unclear - the scribes still struggle to piece together the accounts - but what is clear is that a huge cataclysm shook the mountain and destroyed Trostenhal, allowing the ice and frost to claim the ruined hold for it's own. Now only rubble and snow fill the lonely corridors, and perhaps the ghosts of those that lived and died there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A printable battlemap compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl game. The map can be used as a standalone battlemap, or combined with the rest of the Trostenhal set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A 20 x 20 map depicting the frozen entrance to a ruined Dwarven hold. Wintery trees grow near the large steps, leading into a vast chamber. Rubble and fallen statues litter the ground, and various doors lead off to sealed rooms or deeper into the Hold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
