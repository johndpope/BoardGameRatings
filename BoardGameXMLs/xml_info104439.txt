			<description>Oz is a peg-filling game.  The object of the game is to fill all 25 holes in the game board with pegs so that no peg is next to another of the same color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty-five pegs (five each of five different colors) are loaded into an interior compartment of the handheld base.  One by one the pegs are removed from a hole in the base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first four pegs must be placed in turn in the four corner holes.  Each following peg must be placed next to a peg already on the board.  Pegs may be placed horizontally or vertically, but never diagonally.  No peg may be placed next to another of the same color in any direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;May also be recognized as 'Are you a Wizard of Oz' (based on box copy)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
