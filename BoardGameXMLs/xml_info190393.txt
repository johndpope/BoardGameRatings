							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Gunner</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This flexible class not only lets you outfit a gunslinger-type character, but also lets you roll out something more akin to a gunner from Tera, or the heavy and sniper from Team Fortress 2. You choose how your gun was built (magic, flesh, or some sort of pseudo-science), how big it is (a pistol, rifle, or big-ass cannon, which you can change over time), and then let the bullets&amp;mdash;or lightning, magic, or chitinous spikes&amp;mdash;fly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though the class is initially intended as a ranged damage-dealer (a number of moves give you bonus damage, add or let you swap out tags, or let you blow your entire load in one big attack), plenty of moves let you bleed into more of a supporting role: you can give your allies bonus armor against ranged attacks, provide covering fire, lead the way on a perilous journey, keep watch while everyone else rests, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains three files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One is a letter-sized character sheet that uses our new character sheet layout (which allowed us to fit 31 of the 40ish advanced moves).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other two are digest-sized books, one in color, the other in black and white (to make it easier to print off at home if you want). They both contain:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The gunner class (and its 31 advanced moves).&lt;br/&gt;    New ranged weapons&amp;mdash;including a variety of guns and a repeating crossbow&amp;mdash;and armor (including a gun-shield attachment for bigger guns).&lt;br/&gt;    A director's cut with questions to ask yourself, explanations for some of the moves, and nine advanced moves that we couldn't fit on the sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
