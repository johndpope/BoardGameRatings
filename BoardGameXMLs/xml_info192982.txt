			<description>This game doesn't have a board, instead it has 56 wooden jig-saw pieces with different Disney charachers on them. You start the game by &amp;quot;building the game&amp;quot; with the wooden jig-saw pieces. You roll the die and take that many pieces, then you place them on the table, creating one long path. That is the path you then will play the game on. &lt;br/&gt;Then the game actually starts. You roll the die and move your game pawn that many spaces. The character you land on (5 different ones) decides which of the (5 different) piles you get to take a card from. The cards have different Disney characters on them, and there are three different ones to collect in each family. To make it a little harder every character is cut in two pieces. When you've collected all three characters (which is a total of 6 cards) of the same family (there are 5 different families, hence the 5 different card piles) you've won the game. &lt;br/&gt;The different families are Donald (Donald, Daisy, Scrooge), Mickey (Mickey, Goofy, Pluto), Snow White (Snow White, The Queen, Dopey),, Bambi (Bambi, Thumper, Flower) and The Jungle Book (Mowgli, Baloo, Bagheera).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
