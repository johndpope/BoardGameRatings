							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Luxor: Queenie 2 – The Snake God&#039;s Boon</name>
									
			<description>The snake god tiles change the way you play Luxor significantly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As long as one adventurer is placed on a tile, he unlocks a very powerful ability for that player to use every turn. The player has the ability as long as at least one of his adventurers is remaining on the tile. The player may chose to not use an ability on his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During set-up these tiles replace the Osiris tiles of the basic game. So there are 4 abilities to gain during each play. How long will you stay on one tile and get the benefit before you move your adventurer off, to not fall behind...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The abilities:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Play any card except the card in the middle of your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Place the drawn card anywhere on your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Disregard your played card and move one of your adventurers 1-3 spaces further&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Disregard your played card and chose one of your adventurers that does not move but activates the tile again, if he can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 4 ability tiles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
