			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Penchant for Adventure &amp;ndash; 3 is the solo adventure for a 3rd level character. This adventure begins with a message delivery to the post commander in Penchant. Sadly for your PC Lt. Kateryn Hawtrey is gone and the PC will need to wait until her return.  While wandering through town yelling is heard and someone is in trouble. Investigation reveals that a small child has fallen into one of the town&amp;rsquo;s wells and needs help getting out. While forming a rescue plan the child, CeCe, screams and disappears from sight. Is your player brave enough to venture into the darkness alone? As with all adventures in the Penchant series it can be difficult and not for the faint of heart!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 5th Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for a 3rd level solo adventurer and DM.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
