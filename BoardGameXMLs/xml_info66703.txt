			<description>Valiant Britons: Tribal warfare in Celtic Briton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ancients miniatures wargame. Game scales are provided for playing with 15mm, 25mm, or 6mm figures. Battles may be fought between two Celtic warbands, or against Roman forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Excerpts from rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is a wargame set in ancient times, somewhere between the 4th Century BC and 1st Century AD about tribal warfare.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In this game each player is a Big Chief in a Celtic tribe. The tribe is organised into a &amp;lsquo;King&amp;rsquo; who is the first among equals, and his Big Chiefs. There is also usually a Druid - who is also from the warrior caste, but has additional insight into the mysteries of the gods.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The King will have called out the Warband, provided the council have agreed. This usually only happens in very serious cases.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game is as much about the player's status within the tribe as it is about fighting a battle.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The status of a player's King is measured in &amp;quot;heads&amp;quot; (warrior heads taken in battle), cattle, followers, and kudos (representing force of personality or presence).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
