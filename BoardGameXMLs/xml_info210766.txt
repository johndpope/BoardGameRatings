			<description>Escape the Dragon's ice cave with two jewels.&lt;br/&gt;2 to 4 players have to attempt to carry 2 jewels, one at a time along a winding path out of a cave. Rolling a dice will cause you to either move your playing piece which has a jewel balanced atop it a number of spaces along the path or activate a battery operated random moving dragons neck and head. If the dragon doesn't knock a jewels off the top of your movement piece then you continue on the path out of the cave but if the dragon knocks your jewel off your playing piece then you start back at the beginning.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get 2 jewels out of the cave is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
