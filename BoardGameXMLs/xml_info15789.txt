							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Little Red School House</name>
									
			<description>This is a children's track game that teaches young players math and spelling skills. The game features a wooden School House in the center of the board, beneath which a question disk is inserted. On your turn, you draw an Arithmetic Card and read the equation (such as 8-2=6). If moving 6 spaces would land you on a Question space, you must move there, otherwise you may move from 1-6 spaces (your choice) and land on a Letter space. If you land on a Letter space, you take a corresponding Letter Tile from the box. You can use the letters to form words and turn them in for Star Tokens - the longer the word, the more Stars you earn. If you land on a Question Space, you turn the School House to rotate the question disk, then read the question appearing in the board window. If you answer the question correctly, you receive a Star. The first player to reach the FINISH space ends the game and receives a three Star bonus. The player with the most Stars is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
