							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hockey (1982)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hockey is a challenging high-speed video action game of skill for two, three, or four people.  Written in machine language, Hockey produces realistic action involving two four-man teams.  An offensive player can carry the puck, pass, and shoot.  A defensive player can steal the puck and intercept passes.  Even the goalie gets a piece of the action.  An advanced feature of this program is the inclusion of &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; players who perform automatically.  In case of a tie after regulation time, there is even sudden-death overtime!  High resolution color, sound, multiple-play options, and real-time action make Hockey an exciting game for your Atari computer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
