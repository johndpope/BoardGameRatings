			<description>The game is played on a A1 size board which is divided into 64 A7 fields. The two players hold A7 sized cards in their own color. At first, the players take turns putting one of their cards into each of the four quadrants of the board, afterwards they can put them onto any field. When all cards have been placed, the cards can be moved to adjacent fields. Two adjacent cards can be moved together. When a player manages to form a four card (A5 sized) rectangle, he/she can take one of the opponent's cards out and place it on the rectangle - these cards are now secure (and can be moved together, too).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player manages to form a second A5 rectangle, he/she is the winner. The game promotes the standard paper sizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
