							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Monster For Every Season (Summer 2013)</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It may have taken a year longer, but we&amp;rsquo;re finally at the second volume of A Monster for Every Season. We&amp;rsquo;ve made a number of improvements since last time, many of them based on your feedback. Most importantly, all the printable pages now have their image content contained within the half-inch margin line rather than one-quarter inch. Many of you told me that your printer couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle the thinner margins, so I&amp;rsquo;ve adjusted the layout accordingly. In a few cases, the fold-up tabs still run out into that space, but that&amp;rsquo;s unavoidable in the case of our first Colossal monster&amp;mdash;the ancient Red Dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This time around, we're focusing on the ocean. This set has all the aquatic encounters you could ever need, with a wide variety of marine animals, amphibious humanoids, and just plain old sea monsters. But there's plenty of foes for dry land, too, with classic mainstays like the kobold, the ogre, and the lizardfolk. And the first two of the elemental types arrive&amp;mdash;fire and water. The remaining two, earth and air, should be along in the Winter set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
