							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Big Guy Game</name>
									
			<description>The Big Guy Game pitches itself as a chance for players to become big stars in the radio entertainment industry.  Released during the heyday of WKRP in Cincinnati, a television show about life in a fictional radio station, the board game features prominently a prominent character of WKRP, Arthur &amp;quot;Big Guy&amp;quot; Carlson, in its presentation and theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players roll a die and move their tokens by its result on the board, following instructions printed on the spaces the tokens land on.  Players draw a card (from one of five decks) when their tokens land on certain spaces; these cards task the players to read out tongue twisters, news bulletins, and ad lib to scenarios.  These performances at being sports announcers, comedians, and talk show hosts could advance the players' positions in the game.  The first player to move his token to the last spot (the star) on the board wins and ends the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
