							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hoppin&#039; Checkers</name>
									
			<description>This is a simple checkers game for children featuring the Disney characters Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. The board is a 7x7 grid of squares with 5 Rock spaces (where your pieces start) at each end, and Lily Pad spaces in the middle. These are checkered by River spaces that cannot be played on. You must get your 5 Mickey or Donald pieces to the rock on the other side of the river. Play is like regular checkers, but you cannot make multiple jumps. An advance game introduces Frogs which are neutral pieces that can be moved to block board spaces. The first player to cross the river with all his or her pieces wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
