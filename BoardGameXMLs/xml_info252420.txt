			<description>The animals are loose in the Alhambra! Your goal is to bring them to the chambers. But each kind of animal only brings victory points if they are in a chamber with just their kind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time a chamber is revealed to the building market two animal tiles are drawn and placed on that chamber. There are 6 different animal kinds in the game, each awarding points at the end, but only if it is kept in a chamber which only has his kind on it. In order to move the animals to the desired chambers a player has the option to play a money card at the end of their turn, moving an animal one space (from building to building) for each value on the card plaid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who organizes their animals most cleverly will earn additional victory points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 18 animal chips&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
