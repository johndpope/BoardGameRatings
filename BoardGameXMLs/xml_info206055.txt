			<description>Joe-Mo is travelling with his spaceship through outer space. On his way he has to stop at several stations and pick up the Nasuris and robots in order to drop them off on their planets. But the spaceship is not big enought for everyone that wants to get on. Who will be the one to wait at the next station ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The youngest player starts. You play clockwise. Twist the arrow of the UFO-board.&lt;br/&gt;The section where the arrow stops shows which robot or Nasuri will be picked up by Joe-Mo. But watch out - the spaceship is very small, not all of them will fit in. Follow the rules according to the face-up cards of the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first one to put all cards aside is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
