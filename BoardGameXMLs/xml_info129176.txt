							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vengeance of Excalibur</name>
									
			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Spirit of Excalibur, the Knights of the Round Table fought to defend medieval Britain from the evil sorceress, Morgan Le Fay. Morgan, dabbling in dark arts beyond even her ability to control, had summoned a great Lord of Demons, the Shadowmaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Morgan's death, the Shadowmaster was freed to work his evil will against the unprepared folk of Britain. Striking in the night, he imprisoned the king with a spell, stole the greatest treasure of the realm and kidnapped Nineve, the court enchantress. With the loss of the sword Excalibur and newly recovered Holy Grail, Britain begins to sicken and die. The Shadowmaster must be stopped!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Vengeance of Excalibur, your pursuit of the demon lord will take you to Spain, a divided land ruled by the bickering Christian kings in the north and by the powerful Moslem Caliph in the south. With the unending feuds between the rival kingdoms, and greedy mercenaries spoiling for a fight at the beck and call of the highest bidder, Spain is a hazardous place to visit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vast map portrays the rich diversity of medieval Spain in all its resplendent variety and beauty and is yours to wander at will. Command the knights and whatever followers they are able to recruit to explore the hundreds of villages and cities, fortresses and castles, dungeons and palaces and all the secret places where the Shadowmaster may dwell. Seek what aid you can as you acquire and learn the use of sorceries of Moorish Spain, for only with the aid of enchantments and the loyalty of strong allies will you stand a chance of ridding the world of the demonic Shadowmaster once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
