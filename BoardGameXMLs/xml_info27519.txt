			<description>This game is a trick-taking game published in 2000. A variant of hearts, this game has 59 cards divided into 5 suits.&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;endangered suit&amp;quot; acts like the heart suit in &amp;quot;Hearts&amp;quot;, but are worth two points per card taken rather than one. In addition, the &amp;quot;Zoo&amp;quot; is a sideboard that the dealer can swap cards after the endangered suit has been declared but before the round starts.&lt;br/&gt;Many of the cards have additional rules text that affect the game in various ways. &lt;br/&gt;Play four hands (for four players); the player with the lowest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
