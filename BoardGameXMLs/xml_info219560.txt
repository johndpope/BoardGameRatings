			<description>Wrestling Spirit, created by Adam Ryland, takes its lead from its predecessor, Total Extreme Wrestling, and allows you to take control of the career of a professional wrestler, guiding his career through the world title wins, the tough matches, and the rivalries. You will control each match, negotiate contracts, personal finances, deal with injuries, and manage all the backstage politics. The accurate simulation engine and realistic AI offers up an extremely unique and immersive wrestling experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
