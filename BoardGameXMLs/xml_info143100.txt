							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons: Tower of Doom and its sequel Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons: Shadow over Mystara, the classic arcade beat-'em-up adaptations of Wizards of the Coast's pen-and-paper RPG are BACK, remastered and refined for the modern age.  These games are returning with updated HD graphics and a wealth of other enhancements as a definitive double pack, titled Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just as in the arcades, up to four players will select their character class before doing battle against the mythical beasts from the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons universe with a mix of melee, ranged and magic attacks. But now, thanks to GGPO, there&amp;rsquo;s no need to stand in line for hours at the smoke-filled arcade, since Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara offers seamless drop-in/drop-out online gameplay. In addition to the classic arcade mode famous for its branching paths and multiple endings, players can utilize the all new 'House Rules' feature and customize gameplay for a completely different experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But wait--there's more. The Character Visualizer lets players track which characters they and their friends use most often and can help create a more balanced multiplayer dungeon party, or point out which characters are most under-used; with further gameplay stats tracked via a global leaderboard. Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara also includes a Challenge system that sets players in-game goals in return for level-ups and coins which can be spent in the Vault: a treasure trove of unlockables and gameplay loot. Finally, owners of the Wii U version will be able to use the GamePad touch screen to select spells and items with ease, allowing for a more streamlined gameplay experience.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
