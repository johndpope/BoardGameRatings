			<description>This is a game that combines a Schloss Schlotterstein mechanic with dice rolling.  You start by rolling the dice onto the board.  You then guide the plastic mice with a magnetic stick from under the board, to push dice into your area. Once all the dice are claimed, you total up the score of the dice to determine who wins.  The game can also be played in rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The copy I found from thrifting says it was made in Western Germany, so it was made before pre-unification, but I didn't see a copyright, but most likely mid-80s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
