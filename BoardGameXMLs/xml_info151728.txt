			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Valtor is a god who enjoys the good things in life like hard work, a good meal and friends. It is only when threats emerge that he aggressively attacks. Valtor&amp;rsquo;s clerics share his love for life and are often found in communities of all sizes, training the young to fight and sharing in the most difficult work as well as every local celebration...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In in this issue of Delving Deeper, you will find a description of the major god, Valtor the Mighty, his faith's essential teachings, the daily duties of his clergy, the five most common ceremonies of Valtor, six custom cleric spells for his clergy (including both Labyrinth Lord and OSRIC versions!) and one minor artifact of the faith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
