			<description>From the official website:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Champions of Indines delivers the complete Strategy Tabletop experience in a single play session--from character creation, to backstory, to climactic battle--in just one to two hours!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Champions of Indines is a Cooperative-Competitive Constructed Tactical Tabletop Game to be played by 2 to 6 players. In the game, players take on the roles of a mercenary organization, the Champions of Indines, that travel around their world searching for powerful enemies to fight and people in need to protect. Each game is called an encounter, and takes around two hours to play from start to finish (though some encounters might be longer or shorter). The larger team of players form the Heroes--individual characters who work together to fight as a group. The other team is comprised of a Boss--a single player who controls one exceptionally powerful character or a number of minions (or some combination in between).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is available now as a print-and-play from the official website. Players are encouraged to print the game, play it, and give feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the characters from Champions of Indines also appear in BattleCON. Though the two games are not related in terms of gameplay, they do take place in the same world and follow similar storylines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
