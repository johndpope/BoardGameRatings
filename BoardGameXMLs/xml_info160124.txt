			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are on the verge of interstellar travel. The year is 2310 AD and the solar system is teeming with humanity. Science is taking the populations of all the new worlds to heights no one has ever known before, including great zap guns and sleek outfits with finned caps. While we are in contact with alien civilizations, we are threatened by mysterious yet ancient foes. Rocket Ships guard our borders as well as explore where no one has gone before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The crew of the Venture will be tasked with somehow retrieving the experimental Icarus-X1 after it has just tested the Beagle engines. The ship hit one-tenth the speed of light and then collided with an other-dimensional ship going faster than the speed of light.. The two ships are fused together in a weird astro-physical sort of way and the aliens, a decidedly unfriendly lot, are trying to pull both ships back into their space-time continuum. Once the Venture is in contact with the craft, they will have 26 hours to stop the &amp;quot;phasing&amp;quot; and decelerate it enough for other Oort Corp rockets to assist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is one installment in the ongoing Rocketmen vs. the Saucers serial, but has been designed to stand alone, needing only the TAG SPACERS rules to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
