			<description>The original 520ST case design was created by Ira Velinsky &amp;mdash; Atari's chief Industrial Designer.[17] The ST was basically wedge shaped, featuring bold angular lines and a series of grilles cut into the rear for airflow. The keyboard had soft tactile feedback and rhomboid-shaped function keys across the top. The 520ST was an all-in-one unit, similar to earlier home computers like the Commodore 64. By the time the 520ST reached the market, however, consumers demanded a keyboard with cursor keys and a numeric keypad. For this reason, the 520ST ended up significantly larger than previous popular all-in-one machines like the Commodore 64.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 520ST used an external &amp;quot;brick&amp;quot; power supply, floppy disk, monitor and mouse. Even basic system setups thus suffered from cable spaghetti, a problem future versions would address to one degree or another. Early 520ST owners became accustomed to the &amp;quot;Atari Twist&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Atari Drop&amp;quot; service procedures[citation needed]. The &amp;quot;Atari Twist&amp;quot; seemed to help discharge built-up static electricity (Atari soldered-down the metal shielding to fix the problem) while the &amp;quot;Atari Drop&amp;quot; appeared to help re-seat chips which may have become partially unseated over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Atari ST&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
