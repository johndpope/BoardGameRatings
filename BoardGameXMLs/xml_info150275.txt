			<description>Flickin' Cars With Guns is a tabletop dexterity game for 2 or more players playable in as little as 10 minutes. Players use diecast toy cars (like Hot Wheels or Matchbox) to represent armed vehicles. The goal is to destroy your opponents by shooting and crashing into them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is meant to be played on a standard kitchen table, and you can use household items as obstacles and terrain. A 4'x3' table littered with plates, cups, and bowls is pretty standard. In fact playing a quick game after dinner, before cleaning up the table, is one of the funnest approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the player &amp;quot;flicks&amp;quot; their car twice and shoots once. The act of flicking is where the physical skill and challenge of the game come in. Crashing into an obstacle hurts your car, and accidentally flicking off the table is penalized as well, so players have to be careful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shooting is done by rolling 2D6 with a to-hit target number equal to the number of inches to your target. So if your opponent is 8&amp;quot; away you need 8+ to hit. Double damage on double 6s, and shots always miss on double 1s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several variants and optional rules that can be bolted onto this core system, such as droppable weapons, demolition derby mode, a drinking game, stunt bonuses, power ups, using playing cards, etc. to ensure plenty of longevity and suitability for all types of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
