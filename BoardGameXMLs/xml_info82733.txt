			<description>Racing Simulation 2 is a driving simulation video game, released for PC developed and released by UbiSoft in 1998 (although it was minorly re-released in 2002) It incorporates and is based around factors from the sport of Formula One. It is the second Racing Simulation game to be released, following the original F1 Racing Simulation and predecessing Racing Simulation 3, which was released in 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has two outstanding variations of play - Modern and Classic. Whereas Modern concerns with today's modern formatof Formula One, Classic features original Formula One formats and tracks, mostly from the period of the 1950s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leading on from this, the game has two outstanding difficulty variations - Easy and Realistic. Easy automatically adjusts the player's car to the standard of suitably for each up-and-coming race and provides a simple steering guide for each race, whereas Realistic acquires the player having to do this manually and restricts the steering guide, meaning it is a lot harder. It also provides more game modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Racing Simulation 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
