							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wacky Wheels</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;While racing, players can collect hedgehogs, bombs and other objects that can be used to shoot or distract opponents. The game features both single and multiplayer play, with split-screen, modem, or direct serial link. In multiplayer mode, two human players can either race against each other or battle in special arenas where the sole purpose is to hit the opponent a certain number of times with hedgehogs. This last gaming mode, called Wacky shoot-out, is similar to the classic deathmatch mode from first-person shooter games or the Battle Mode of Super Mario Kart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was and still is distributed as shareware, with only a few characters and courses active. Registration is required to unlock the remaining characters and courses. It is also the first game to feature a Dopefish cameo appearance.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Wacky Wheels , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
