							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Seven Voyages of Zylarthen Electronic Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SEVEN VOYAGES of ZYLARTHEN is a re-imagining of the original edition of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular paper and pencil fantasy adventure game, first published in 1974. The brilliance and charm of the original edition was its simplicity and elegance, combined with a certain asymmetrical quirkiness. It invoked many sources&amp;mdash;King Arthur, the Crusades, Middle-earth, the Arabian Nights, pulp fantasy, fairy tales, even science fiction. Its breadth of tone was a virtue, offering to the players a multiplicity of delights. SEVEN VOYAGES of ZYLARTHEN is a different game, published under the Open Game License. We are not affiliated with TSR (old or new) or the current Wizards of the Coast. But our intention was to follow the spirit of the original as closely as possible. Happy dungeoneering! Guard the innocent! Avenge the wronged! May you find heaps of gold at the end of your path, or at the least a memorable and heroic demise! But above all, God grant that you find wonder everywhere!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new Electronic Edition features revised, consolidated and extensively bookmarked/linked versions of the four original booklets for the now classic OD&amp;amp;D neo-clone. It also includes the complete text of Supplement 1: Book of Spells, as well as a printable Player Reference Sheets booklet. There are 146 new Zylarthen spells, including 80 unique to reimagined versions of the Witch and High Priest NPC classes. The Electronic Edition also features new rules on age and aging, wilderness travel and more. We feel the revised and expanded version is even more in the spirit of its 1974 parent. Fight On!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
