			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stacks TNT is a block-based sandbox game where each block follows the laws of Jelly-physics! You play Chuck, a guy stranded in a desolate world, with only a jet pack and a pair of hands to work with. To get back home, you need to EXPLORE the terrain for resources. BUILD factories to convert resources to useful items, like guns, bombs and rocket engines. DEFEND your flag against waves of MobCorp agents by building fortresses and laying out traps. CONQUER the world by constructing towers, bridges, rocket propelled ships and anything else you can imagine within in a fully dynamic world. FIND a mysterious hidden relic. And finally, build the Ark space ship and bring yourself home!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
