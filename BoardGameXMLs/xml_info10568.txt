							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pas de Calais</name>
									
			<description>This is the first game of the Westwar series. Other games using a similar system are Tide of Fortune, To The Far Shore and the Italian Campaign series (Sicily, Salerno, Anzio and Med War).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In 1944 the Germans expected Patton to lead the cross-channel attack at Calais. They were right...&amp;quot; Pas de Calais features features the hypothetical Allied invasion of France at Calais in 1944, as well as the planned Allied operations &amp;quot;Sledgehammer&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Roundup&amp;quot; of 1943, against the historical German defenses. Pas de Calais also allows for a wide variety of scenarios which players may design to their own liking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scale is 1-2 days/turn (variable because of the Impulse system), 3 km/hex. Units are regiments/brigades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has 2 19&amp;quot;x27&amp;quot; maps, 300 counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heart of the system is the Operations phase where players alternate activating formations (divisions) which execute Orders (Assault, Advance, Maneuver etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players bid for Initiative and there are possibilities for the Reaction player to foil the initiative player's moves by having units react and do spoiling attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Losses can be applied to the HQ of a formation, not only directly to units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low counter density, high maneuver. Medium-high complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
