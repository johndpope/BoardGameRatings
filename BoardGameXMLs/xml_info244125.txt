			<description>Magorum is an exciting, fast-paced customizable fantasy card game where players take the roles of powerful Mages that do battle by casting incredible spells, perform enchantments, conjure up magical items, and even call forth powerful incantations. The big difference is that in Magorum the player doesn&amp;rsquo;t control any units such as monsters or robots or fighters. Instead, YOU are the center of the battle and you use YOUR power to perform amazing feats of magic and destruction in order to defeat the opponent. The only permanent cards on the field are the magical items that empower the player. In this fast-paced magical warfare, players have to use wit and strategy to overpower their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main box set consists of 200 different cards which are divided into 5 different schools of magic: Ignogan (Fire), Aqualibrium (Water), Winderis (Air), Terrakov (Earth) and Gromnik (Electricity). Players can mix and match cards from different schools to create their ideal deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players mix and match cards from each school to create a deck of 57 cards, and a side-deck of up to 7 cards. The players then take turns placing cards in the manapool and using the mana they've accumulated to cast spells and deal damage. Each point of damage equals 1 card discarded from the top of the opponent's deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to deal enough damage to the opponent to discard all of the cards from their deck, thus winning the duel!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
