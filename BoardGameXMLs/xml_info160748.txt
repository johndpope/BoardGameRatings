			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab your bag and get ready...You're going on a trip!  How many places will you travel to and how will you get there?  Will you go to the mountains or a tropical island?  Will you visit a museum or an amusement park?  Each time you reach one of your travel destinations, you collect a souvenir to pack in your suitcase.  Whoever packs their suitcase fastest is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The suspense builds as players draw chance cards and use clever strategy to collect their souvenirs before other players get theirs.  One bad move can change the outcome, so it's a race to the finish to see who will win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the Game:&lt;br/&gt;Players travel the game board hoping to collect the Souvenirs and Transportation cards they need to fill their suitcases.  The first player to finish packing his or her own suitcase wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
