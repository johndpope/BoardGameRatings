			<description>The game includes a 3D representation of the Pinocchio's world (the village and the sea with the whale).&lt;br/&gt;The players move their pawns to both the mainland and the sea trying to gain gold coins and, in the same time, trying to avoid the various hazards because a player could be eaten by the whale during the game. If the whale was selected, the player should listen to its message (there is a disc in it where there was recorded several sentences) and suffer the consequences.&lt;br/&gt;At the end, the player who will have more gold coins will be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
