			<description>In Museums: The Card Game you are a Museum Director trying to build the best museums with the most amount of items and the best visitors you can attract.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will have a hand of cards. On your turn you have four options. You can (1) play a Museum cards, (2) play an Artifact card on Museums, (3) play a Visitor card, or (4) draw a card from the draw deck. You are limited to playing three actions per turn. The first two actions can be playing Museums and/or Artifact cards and the third action can be playing one Visitor card. If you choose not to play a card, you may draw a card instead. Likewise, if you choose not to play any cards you may draw three cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Museum cards are played first and then Artifact cards are played on top of Museum cards. The Artifact has to match the type of Museum it is played on. Visitor cards are played to score points. Once a Visitor card is played, for each artifact card with the same interests as the Visitor, all players score one point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to reach 20 points. The first to reach the goal is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
