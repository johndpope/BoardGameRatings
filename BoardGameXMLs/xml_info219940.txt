							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">I&#039;ve Brought You Back a Baby Dragon</name>
									
			<description>Board game in which people go off on a trip and have to bring back ice cream, postcards and purple dragons. You go round the board (with some choice as to where you go), nip into shops picking up souvenirs, and head home when you have a full set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other players are both racing against you and can occasionally swap what you have with someone else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a work of art, and the pieces are typical tourists with flowery hats and cameras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a dice for movement and to help you escape the task of browsing in a shop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has symbols, so the game should be playable in any language with a set of rules in that language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are simple and complete. You can learn the game in about 2-3 minutes, and there are no surprises (e.g. odd exceptions) so the game flows well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
