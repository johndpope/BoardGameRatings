			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2022: Gaea, Mother nature, had had enough and was taking back the planet. She had decided there needed to be a new dominant life form on Planet Earth. Slowly the flowers began to move and they were pissed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2025: The first attack occurred when a handful of 6 foot daisies attacked a small town in Virginia. The flowers were easily defeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2037: A second attack besieged the same small Virginian town, this time leveling it. Up sprang the first Garden, a city of flowers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2050: Gardens were now everywhere. Human cities all over the World were beginning to crumble to the might of the flowers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2055: Humans now lived in fortified towns. All major cities were gone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2060: Despite all their efforts and victories, despite driving the Humans back to a state of primitiveness, the flowers still had not achieved success in their mission to take over the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a soldier in Gaea's army. You are striving to be the new dominant life form on the planet. You are an Angry Flower!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Angry Flowers is a rules lite rpg of furious foliage in the future.  It's meant for a quick, easy evening of role playing for 2 or more players and a game master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
