			<description>Iron Wrath is the second expansion for the PC version of Raven Shield. It was in production for almost 2 years before Ubisoft decided to release it to FilePlanet subscribers as a free download on June 9, 2005. Developed by Ubisoft-Casablanca, this latest expansion features a 7-mission campaign, 3 classic missions, 8 new multiplayer maps, 6 new weapons, as well as 5 new multiplayer game modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2007, Team Rainbow is called in to clear out the last of the terrorist group responsible for the actions in Athena Sword. Flushed out of their initial position, they have taken refuge in the main building of EVTIMOV UNIVERSITY, where they have been pinned down by police and are now taking hostages. But is this the last move of the endgame, or the start of a new fight against terror?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's New?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tom Clancy&amp;rsquo;s Rainbow Six 3: Iron Wrath is the second mission pack for Tom Clancy&amp;rsquo;s Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield. As an upgrade for Raven Shield, it adds even higher levels of excitement and realism to the Rainbow Six experience. All the basic features of Raven Shield are present in Iron Wrath. Controls, gameplay, and game flow all remain the same. If you need to refresh your knowledge of how the basic game works, please refer to your original Raven Shield manual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among its new features, Iron Wrath includes a brand-new singleplayer campaign consisting of seven missions. You&amp;rsquo;ll find the same team and the same equipment, plus six new real-world weapons. A detailed list of these new weapons appears in this manual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron Wrath also provides a series of eight new multiplayer maps, playable with five new modes, to expand the online excitement of Raven Shield. These maps can also be played in Single Player from the Custom Mission screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last but not least, Iron Wrath includes three classic missions. These totally revamped environments and missions are from the earliest chapters of the Rainbow Six saga. Classic mission locations are also available in other single-player gameplay modes via the Custom Mission screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
