			<description>This card game is the first game of Waryson, an Italian publisher. The game comes with Italian rules only, but is otherwise language-independent.&lt;br/&gt;The topic is that of a breakout from prison. One of the players will become the escapee in the course of the game, and to be successful he needs to collect certain cards that allow him to &amp;quot;escape&amp;quot;, such as a passport, a destination country, and a transport to go there.&lt;br/&gt;The game seems to be rather simple, and so are the graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
