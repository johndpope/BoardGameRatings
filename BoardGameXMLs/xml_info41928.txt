							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Book of Mormon Quest</name>
									
			<description>A sister game to Bible Quest, this one uses a different game mechanic and is aimed Latter-day Saint (Mormon) families, drawing on knowledge of the Book of Mormon.  It includes a somewhat Pacheesi/Sorry-like board, rules/questions booklet, 12-sided die, 4 pawn, 4 Celestial Markers (colored tokens), 10 white bonus tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a turn, a player is first asked a trivia question from the booklet, about the Book of Mormon, along with the 3 suggested answers.  (Wee folk can get just 2 answers to choose from.)  If answered correctly, the player rolls the die and moves his pawn around the outer track.  Several outer spaces affect the player's next turn (roll &amp;amp; move twice, choose which direction to go, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player also has an inner path, whose steps are labeled with important spiritual steps (baptism, confirmation, temple marriage, enduring to the end) toward the center (heaven).  Their Celestial Marker is placed on the first step when the pawn lands on a colored space; each step after that comes from turning in 2 bonus tokens, which are earned by landing on a corner space.  The first player to the center wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Options are also described for cooperative play, team play, activities, chance cards, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
