			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alignment is a way of describing the moral code of a creature.  These rules are for use with the Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basics of Alignment&lt;br/&gt;A creature&amp;rsquo;s general moral and personal attitudes are represented by its alignment: lawful good, neutral good, chaotic   good,   lawful   neutral,   neutral,   chaotic neutral, lawful evil, neutral evil, or chaotic evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the campaign, the GM may  require that players choose an alignment for their characters. Alignment is a tool for developing your character's identity. It is not a straitjacket for restricting your character. Each alignment represents a broad range of personality types or personal philosophies, so two characters of the same alignment can still be quite different from each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
