			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build the Monster then get ready to run! If he catches you - he'll scare you back to the start!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the dungeon is a laboratory with parts from an experiment that was never finished - an experiment to build the legendary Frankenstein! But suddenly - piece by piece - he comes together. Then he starts to come after you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, you roll the die, move your playing piece and start to build Frankenstein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First you add the head, then the arms, and finally the legs. When he is totally built, he starts moving along the gameboard...one space at a time. If he catches you...he'll send you back to the start!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So don't look back! Just keep on moving and trying to Escape from Frankenstein! The first player to race out of the dungeon wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 to 4 players Ages 6 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
