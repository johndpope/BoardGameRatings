			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A high plateau. Overlooked by crags, its aurorae play over a garish scrubland of mineral-rich rock riddled by the warrens of burrowers and quarried by settlers of a league of rival towns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Condensed to one page for slipping in among other materials, this sandbox-oriented content is intended as an easily absorbed framework for improvisation to be adapted by the user as preferred for a wider setting and specific system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It presents core ideas and key numbers to fall back on, with general approaches that can be applied in other situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The content covers map generation on the fly for an abstracted plateau as well as suggestions for aspects of the locality, including inhabitants, towns, settler activity, burrows and the rock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The towns could be detailed using Events: Goings-on Seen or Heard of in the Olde Worlde Settlement as well as Pseudohistorical Buildings on 2+ Dice, and the settlers developed using Character: More or Less Promising Olde Worlde Adventurers, all of which are part of the main bundle. The burrow networks could be simplified or extended using one or more of the maps in the Location, Landscape &amp;amp; World bundle, most obviously The Vermian Maze.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
