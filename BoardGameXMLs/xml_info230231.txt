			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a tribute to the classic Blockbuster Movies of the 80&amp;rsquo;s; the fantasy and adventure Summer Blockbusters which filled us all with fun, wonder and awe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you can play-out the likes of E.T., The Goonies, Jaws, Monster Squad, Labyrinth, The Neverending Story, Gremlins or The Last Starfighter. It also lends itself well to playing episodic stories similar to Stanger Things, Eerie Indiana, The X-Files and the like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movie Night is a Role Playing Game (or &amp;lsquo;RPG&amp;rsquo;) where you take on characters and play-out their adventures. One person runs the game- they are the Gamesmaster- and the rest are the Players. You can play Movie Night with just one Player if you like, or as a group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is distributed as a ZIP archive including the 56-page game document, three 1-page supporting documents (character sheet, clapperboards, and shooting script - all also are included in the rule book), and two cover image files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
