			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still in active development and available to the public for purchase in it's unfinished state, either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is currently in development with early access available through the games website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself is a take on 4x strategy and empire builder. This has been done before, but here the take is that your tribe is forced to migrate as resources deplete around you. In the game you are fighting the Romans and Mother Nature in order to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent changes in development has seen the midgame change. At some point in time you have grown so big and strong that you will want to settle for good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more on development, follow the game and the designers thoughts on the game dev blog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
