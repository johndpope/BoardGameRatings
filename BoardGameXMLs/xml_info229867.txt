			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are all familiar with the mindless, untiring wave of zombies that taxes our resources and tires our heroes&amp;rsquo; hearts with their fearless march into battle. But a new wrinkle got added to this familiar scene in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Besti-ary 2 when the juju zombie was introduced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Juju zombies are not the mindless undead we usually associate with the word &amp;lsquo;zombie&amp;rsquo;. Juju zombies keep the skills and abilities they had in life and gain additional powers and protections through the conversion to undeath. The downside is that even though a juju zombie will never die due to the passage of time, its advancement in power, skills, and abilities is frozen at the time of its transformation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
