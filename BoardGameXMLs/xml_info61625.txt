			<description>The game is a trivia game which also includes a large block of wood, a hammer and some nails. The active player rolls a die to determine a category of question (skip the trivia part on a roll of 6). When the player can answer the question asked, he or she can hit his or her nail (which is in the block of wood) with the hammer once. The first player whose nail is completely inside the wood is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
