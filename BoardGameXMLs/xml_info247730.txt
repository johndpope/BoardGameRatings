			<description>A game of Poc! is played in three rounds. Each player owns five coasters numbered from 1 to 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first round, you place the box without lid in the center of the table. On your turn, place a coaster on your closed fist, 20cm away from the box. Then try to flick your coaster either inside the box, or on top of one or more coasters lying on the table. If you manage the latter you take back your coaster(s) to play them again and any opponent's coaster goes under your fist as points to be scored in the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player doesn't have any more coasters to play. All coasters inside the box are worth twice their printed value to their owner and any opponent's coaster under your fist is worth their printed value in points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the second round, do the same, except the lid goes on top of the box and you try to flick your coaster on top of the lid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the same round, place the trampoline coaster in the middle instead of the box. Any coaster landing on the trampoline goes back to their owner's fist. All other rules still apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points in the end wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
