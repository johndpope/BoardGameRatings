			<description>Wizards' Towers is family game about building tower from wooden elements and casting spells by using Elements (Water, Wind, Fire, Earth) in order to attack other players towers. Attacks can destroy some parts of player tower, block his queue, steal construction (wooden elements from tower) and more.&lt;br/&gt;Winner is player who will build highest tower when there are no wooden bricks (construction) to summon from Source.&lt;br/&gt;During game, tactic is very important, as well as hand management. But game has two modes, for younger and older players:&lt;br/&gt;Basic - for younger players. It's rather building race then real fight. Basic mode will let you learn about game mechanics and summoning Construction (wooden bricks)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced - it's where real magic starts. In this mode players use Special Cards, which contains additional attacks (3 per card). And those spells are much more powerful then basic attacks (from Attack Chart). Also, its easier to get cards to attack, named Elements. There are 4 elements in game: Fire, Wind, Earth and Water.&lt;br/&gt;While your tower is getting bigger, you need to focus to prevent lower sections from being destroyed. For this, you use Section. You can summon Section each 5 levels of tower, and when you have 8 or 6 (depends on game type) constructions in your storage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in the box:&lt;br/&gt;- 126 wooden bricks (0,6x06x2,3 inch)&lt;br/&gt;- 20 Summoning Cards&lt;br/&gt;- 24 Elements Cards&lt;br/&gt;- 11 Special Cards&lt;br/&gt;- 12 Securing Sections&lt;br/&gt;- Attack Chart&lt;br/&gt;- Instruction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is for what?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wooden bricks allow players to build towers. Each floor of tower consists from 2 bricks. Those bricks are named &amp;ldquo;construction&amp;rdquo;, and can be removed by other player when he uses hostile action (attack) on yours tower&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Securing Section building this prevents lower parts of tower from most attacks, however there are some strong spells that can remove it and even construction below!&lt;br/&gt;Summoning cards allows to summon construction elements from &amp;ldquo;source&amp;rdquo;. Summoned construction can be used for building tower or placed in Storage (near tower). Bricks in storage can be traded for Attack Card or Section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elements Cards are used mostly to assembly spells, like attacks, area attacks, stealing, blocking move, forcing other player to make bad move, ect.&lt;br/&gt;Special Cards are used in Advanced game. They add 33 actions to the game. Spells and attacks are much stronger. Also, these cards adds some defensive abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
