							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conquest, the card game</name>
									
			<description>Conquest is an exciting game where the goal is to triumph over your opponents to gain the most land. A player may use a variety of characters, each with an unique ability, to travel to new lands, form alliances, and fight duels. This innovative card game uses each part of the card for different plays, even the backs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Conquest the card game, the object is to be the first player to capture the majority of landmarks.  Players are dealt 5 cards.  There are 9 landmarks in the game.  Players can set the length and difficulty of the game at the start by choosing 3, 5, 7, or 9 landmarks or choosing landmarks that are more difficult to reach.  Players move to different landmarks by playing cards from their hand that match the combination of terrain icons on each landmark card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player assumes the role of one of 15 characters who may travel to different landmarks to try to take possession of them or duel opponent&amp;rsquo;s character.  Players may also form alliances to avoid being attacked with the added bonus of getting the opportunity to secretly buy the allied player&amp;rsquo;s land.  Some of the characters include samurai, pirate, spy, witch, and ninja.  Each character has a unique ability that players can use to gain an advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players also control armies and officers that can battle to take over other player&amp;rsquo;s landmarks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conquest is not a CCG.  It is a complete game with a deck of 63 cards, however, because each card can be used in multiple ways, it feels more like a deck of 200.  Each corner on the face of the cards represents a different aspect of the game:  characters, alliances, armies or terrain.  On the back of each card is a mythological beast which is used to resolve duels between characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 63 cards representing:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;15 characters (including 4 officers)&lt;br/&gt; 3 mythological beasts (dragon, unicorn, minotaur)&lt;br/&gt; 4 alliances  (eagle, elephant, lion, bear)&lt;br/&gt; 4 terrain types (mountains, forest, desert, river)&lt;br/&gt;12 shield markers&lt;br/&gt;27 army cards&lt;br/&gt; 9 landmarks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
