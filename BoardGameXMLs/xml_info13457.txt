							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great American Flag Game</name>
									
			<description>This educational game was released in 1940, and re-released in 1943 with slightly altered rules. The game board depicts a map of the United States with all the State Capitals listed, and a track of Stars (spaces), each listing a State's name and the year it was admitted to the Union. An American flag is placed on every eighth Star (there were only 48 states at the time), while Red Tokens are placed on the remaining Stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player spins the spinner and moves his playing piece the number of Stars indicated. He then reads aloud the name of the State he landed on, the year it was admitted to the Union, and (without looking at the map) the State's Capital. If he names the Capital correctly he may keep the Flag or Token. If the player is incorrect he moves backwards to the first vacant space. If he spins a &amp;quot;1776&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;Statue of Liberty&amp;quot; he moves forward to the next space with a flag or token and, if he correctly names the Capital, may spin again. The game ends when a player reaches the last space. All players add up their scores - Flags are worth 10 points, tokens are worth 1 point - and the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
