							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rolly Poker</name>
									
			<description>A combination of standard Poker bidding and bluffing rules with a dexterity game. The box plastic inlay holds a tilted cardboard surface in which wooden pegs are placed - these serve as obstacles for a glass marble, which is flicked from one of four starting points to roll down the surface and land in one of five numbered target pockets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player tries to reach a certain score determined by cards - the other players may or may not believe that he will be successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are printed in English and French - the cheap produced instruction sheet in the German edition leaves much of the game's rules obscured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
