							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Road Rally USA: Dead Man&#039;s Curve Expansion</name>
									
			<description>Set Up: You can play with either or both tiles in any combination.  To mix things  up you may flip the tiles before playing the game to see which side you will be playing with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before receiving your starting cards, place a shortcut between two unconnected squares on the same track tile, matching the layout of the pre-printed shortcuts (i.e. the shortcut skips over 3 spaces).  The spaces (that you create a shortcut to and from) may have other features on them.  You may also place and shortcut directly over another shortcut if you wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Green, Green, Grass&amp;quot; Short Cut: The Green, Green, Grass Short Cut may only be used by spending 3 or more green cards as your standard movement.  If you do, you may use this shortcut to skip over the intervening spaces during your normal move.  You do not have to end your turn at its entrance, nor do you have to stop at its exit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Red Right Hand Turn&amp;quot; Short Cut: The Red Right Hand Turn Short Cut may only be used by spending red cards as your standard movement.  If you do, you may use this shortcut to skip over the intervening spaces during your normal move.  You do not have to end your turn at its entrance.  However, you must end your movement at the shortcut's exit space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
