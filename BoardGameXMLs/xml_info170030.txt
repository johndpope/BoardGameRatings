Tokugawa-sama!&lt;br/&gt;Ieyasu: You&amp;rsquo;ve managed to come to the battlefield! May I know why?&lt;br/&gt;Lady Razan: Oh! Yes, Oh! You naughty naughty Tokugawa! I&amp;rsquo;m your living reminder of our summer sak&amp;eacute; party &amp;hellip;Oh! You&amp;rsquo;re even worse than Hidetada&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;Ieyasu: Please leave at once! This is a dangerous place for a delicatessen as you. And don&amp;rsquo;t worry&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve instructed the Generals in our war council. I&amp;rsquo;ve explained them the notions of priorities and timings&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;Lady Razan: OK! mumbo-jumbo-sama! 1800 hours, not a minute more&amp;hellip; You have been warned!&lt;br/&gt;Old man that was passing by chance, whispering, through the battlefield: And so it was. Everyone was at bliss, at least at Tokugawa&amp;rsquo;s mighty army. The low rank soldiers were partying since 0600 hours. Generals were laughing, confident and very moody about the upcoming battle. Ieyasu&amp;rsquo;s son, the Shogun Tokugawa Hidetada, began to move his full army in four parallel lines, prepared to make flanking maneuvers of their own. Oh yes I know&amp;hellip; Richard Wilhelm already told that &amp;ldquo;The way to study the past is not to confine oneself to mere knowledge of history but, through application of this knowledge, to give actuality to the past&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Osaka Main Castle 1130 hours.&lt;br/&gt;A Toyotomi ninja reported Ieyasu&amp;rsquo;s plan. He was aware that Lady Razan would be somewhere in the battlefield&amp;hellip; If somehow they could resist until 1800 hours&amp;hellip; a last samurai plot was in forge&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;Ninja: Grand Massster Toyotomi-sssama I wasss near master&amp;rsquo;sss SSSanada army and I wasss able to sssee it with my own armsss, hear with my own hair and sssmelling with my own fingersss ninja.&lt;br/&gt;Hideyori: I knew it! That cheap sl*t! And are you aware of why I knew?&lt;br/&gt;Ninja: sss no Massster Toyotomi-sssama ninja.&lt;br/&gt;Hideyori: A long time ago, around two solar calendar years, I had a close relation with Lady Razan based on a conspiring plot against the old man Ieyasu, Shogun at that time&amp;hellip; But that was before I decked in love for her&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;The in meanwhile old man was passing through Osaka castle, whispering: Toyotomi immediately issued a hammer-and-anvil operation, in which his strongest core would attack the center of the Tokugawa Army, while a second force, would flank them from the rear to scare Lady Razan out of the battlefield. History tells that &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi participated in the battle on the Tokugawa Army side, though there is no recorded documental base in this battle&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE TIME IS: 1200 hours, 3 June 1615. &lt;br/&gt;A 0001 hour comical and competitive 2 player Super Postcard Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
