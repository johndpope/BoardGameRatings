			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 48 x 30 inch, full color battlemap of a set of Temple Steps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;What?! They have stolen our holiest of artifact? Make sure they never steal anything again; even a breath of air from the sky father. After them!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ascending the temple steps to reach the temple can be a dangerous proposition with temple monks leaping from level to level to close on interlopers in melee and archers raining down arrows from high positions next to the doorway. Descending the steps can lead to an interesting chase away from the temple as melee attackers run after the fleeing group as archers aim arrows at their backs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Temple Steps is an exterior map of a succession of stairs ascending to a doorway to a temple. This is a transitional map that could be used to enter or leave a temple or dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Temple Steps is intended for use in fantasy, modern, horror, or adventure pulp games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Hook for this map which uses our Ancient Temple Interior as the temple interior (The Jade Mask is in the secret treasure room of the Ancient Temple Interior):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theft of the Sacred Mask: The group got into the ancient temple and has stolen the Jade Mask. The Cult of the Jade Mask is swarming around the original temple entrance forcing the group to frantically search for another escape route. The group finds a secret back exit of steps descending into the surrounding jungle. But just as they reach halfway down the first flight of steps, the Cult of the Jade Mask emerges from the back entrance and follows the group down the steps. Will they be able to get away from the Cult of the Jade Mask and slip away into the jungle with their holy artifact?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
