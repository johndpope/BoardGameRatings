			<description>The players move their birds around the game board. Movement is determined by a die. When the players get their bird on their own nest or on the picture of a bird, they get to put an egg in their nest. If they get on the cuckoo in the center on the board, they have to place the cuckoo egg in their nest. If a bird gets on a nest with the cuckoo egg, it's player has to place the cuckoo egg in his own nest. As soon as a player has all 4 eggs in his nest, he beginns to breed! When he gets his bird on a space whose number is 5 or a multiple of 5, he gets to turn over an egg, so it shows the little bird. The first player to turn over all 4 eggs and doesn't have the cuckoo egg in his nest, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
