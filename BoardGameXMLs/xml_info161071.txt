			<description>You are a bear, and the goal of every bear to eat a balanced diet. You've collected some food, but now you need to protect it from the other hungry bears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in as many rounds as there are players. Each player is the &amp;quot;parent&amp;quot; bear for one round, during which the other players try to steal food tokens from the parent's table using one of four food cards. The parent can defend one type of food each round, and if the other bears get too greedy, none of them will steal anything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
