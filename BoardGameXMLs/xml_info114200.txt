							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fallen Fane</name>
									
			<description>From the publishers description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed for First Edition Advanced Rules. With minor modifications it can be used with any fantasy role playing system (OD&amp;amp;D, Holmes, Moldvay-Cook-Marsh, Mentzer) It is meant for a party of 6 to 9 characters of levels 4th to 8th, which should include at least 1 cleric and magic-user of 5th to 7th level. Centuries past a woodland faun became obsessed with a forest nymph. Kidnapping her, he took her deep into the heart of an ancient wood where he found the ruins of a fallen fane. When the nymph's people came to rescue her the faun prayed to the deity of the ruins for help, but was tricked. Now the faun's petrified body rests within the ruins, awaiting to be rejoined with its spirit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
