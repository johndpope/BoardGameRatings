			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Is This?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a teenager I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big fan of superhero comics. It was the comics-coded-four-color-silver-age, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until Watchmen and Dark Knight and DC&amp;rsquo;s Vertigo line of comics &amp;ldquo;suggested for mature readers&amp;rdquo; came along that I came to like superheroes again, learned that superheroes almost always have a human side, learned that you could tell a story about a superhero and it could still be a good story with good writing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Likewise, I haven&amp;rsquo;t played many superhero RPG&amp;rsquo;s. Because most of them shoot for that silver age feel. They&amp;rsquo;re for kids. There&amp;rsquo;s lots of punching and explosions and psychic nosebleeds and maybe even talking gorillas but there isn&amp;rsquo;t much real drama or character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I started looking for the game that would do superheroes the way I wanted them, all grown up. Tried Sorcerer ... Capes &amp;hellip; Fiasco &amp;hellip; Just Heroes &amp;hellip; Microscope &amp;hellip; these games were all good but not exactly what I was looking for. It looked like if I wanted a superhero game to meet my needs I&amp;rsquo;d have to make it myself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A campaign of Joe McDaldno&amp;rsquo;s Monsterhearts accidentally ended up being the best &amp;ldquo;superhero&amp;rdquo; RPG I&amp;rsquo;d ever played. Ostensibly a game about monsters, I played a character who decided to use his monster-powers for good, who wore a costume and fought crime, and because that&amp;rsquo;s the way Monsterhearts rolls he ended up doing more harm than good, lost his way, but finally got his shit together and made the ultimate sacrifice to stop a vampire who may not have been all that bad a guy&amp;hellip; It. Was. Awesome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So &amp;hellip; I made this. To see if I can recapture some of that lightning and be explicitly superheroic. You could practically call this game &amp;ldquo;Superhearts&amp;rdquo; because it owes so much to Joe. Like Monsterhearts and Just Heroes, it&amp;rsquo;s a hack of Apocalypse World. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to know how to run Apocalypse World or Monsterhearts or Dungeon World to run this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
