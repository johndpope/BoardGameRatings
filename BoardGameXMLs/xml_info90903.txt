			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PSIONICS IN DAWNING STAR &amp;bull; &amp;bull; &amp;bull;&lt;br/&gt;In designing the world of Dawning Star, we strived to adhere to two overriding guidelines: Make it fun, and make it believable. We knew from the beginning that we wanted to include psionics and that we would need to develop a unique take to meet both of our criteria. The result of all this hard work is Red Truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psionics in Dawning Star differs from psionics in D20 MODERN due to its source. In Dawning Star, Psionics involves perceiving and modifying the information contained in a parallel dimension, called &amp;quot;Red Truth&amp;quot; by most who access it. Poorly understood even in the days of the Star Confederation, Red Truth is a dimension comprised of pure information. Depending on which Red Truth scholar describes it, this dimension lies &amp;quot;beneath&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;within&amp;quot; our own dimension-a reflection of our reality. Some Star Confederation psionicists believe that Red Truth is the &amp;quot;blueprint&amp;quot; of the universe left over by some creator god long ago; while others see it more secularly as a nigh-infinite puzzle containing the very secret of the universe. Over the millions of years that individuals have been interacting with Red Truth, thousands of theories, religions, and philosophies have cropped up about it. These beliefs have even inspired religious wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
