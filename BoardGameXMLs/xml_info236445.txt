							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Test of Honour: The Samurai Miniatures Game – Bandits &amp; Brigands</name>
									
			<description>Kojirō leads a gang of bandits and brigands with a reputation for robbing travellers in sudden, vicious attacks. His lack of mercy has earned him the nickname 'Oni' - the demon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ruthless, cunning and upholding little to no honour, these bandits and brigands will fight for any side if they have the right amount of money. Nothing is too beneath them and nothing is too challenging, making them the ideal hire for anyone who wants a job done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kojirō&amp;rsquo;s has the ability to take Coin cards from samurai he cuts down, and make use of those cards for the rest of the battle. Combine that with other skill cards like Rotten to the Core, Ambush and Mob Tactics, and you have a dangerous bunch of thieves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get more out of your battlefield with rules for climbing, leaping (and falling!), entering buildings and fighting from defended positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for night-time battles &amp;ndash; keep your enemies at a distance and they&amp;rsquo;ll have a hard time spotting you through the darkness unless you&amp;rsquo;ve strayed too close to a lantern!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for unaware enemies, for battles in which one side is launching a surprise attack and the other is initially clueless about the danger. This allows you to sneak around, trying to take down outlying foes without alerting the others&amp;hellip; But if an unaware warrior spots a dead body or overhears the commotion of an attack, they&amp;rsquo;ll soon become suspicious and realise what&amp;rsquo;s happening!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three new scenarios &amp;ndash; Sudden Attack, Ambush in the Dark and Undercover Raid &amp;ndash; which utilise the new Darkness and Unaware rules. These battles are perfect to try out the less honourable behaviour of the warriors in this set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
