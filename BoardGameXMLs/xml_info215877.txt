							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Motor Strike: Immortal Legends</name>
									
			<description>ver the past years, a lot of racing games have been released. However, in those games, action is usually relegated to a second level compared to the driving. Motor Strike: Immortal Legends comes to break the mold, being an action and racing game where the former is actually the star. You will have fun non-stop, trying to take down other players and minions as you drive through crazy tracks. In order to do that, you will have a selection of special skills and weapons at your disposal. Every car being unique and familiar, their abilities will make up for a totally different gameplay. Driving in reverse, being invisible or simply throwing a burst of missiles to your enemies had never been so fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
