			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MonsterForge was a community-build electronic character sheet for Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 3.5 Edition.  The product received regular updates, particularly as Monster Manuals were released for the game.  The product was released as an XLS and, later, XLSX workbook for Microsoft Excel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product allowed for the selection of any monster in the official monster manuals and the application of any official and legal template to the monster.  Furthermore, monsters could be advanced by hit die with commensurate increases in Skills and Feats.  The spreadsheet would calculate these automatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the spreadsheet required extensive data derived from the copyrighted books it was considered by some to be controversial for infringement of intellectual property.  The developers and promoters believed the product was compliant with the open game license, however.  The final version released was 4.0b.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
