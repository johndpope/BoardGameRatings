							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">14 Halfling Burglar Feats</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes rules supplements read like the world-setting bible of frustrated novelists. While solid world- building is a useful skill, you don't always need four paragraphs of flavor text to tell you swords are cool, magic is power, shadows are scary, and orcs are savage. Sometimes a GM doesn't have time to slog through a page of history for every magic weapon. Sometimes all that's needed are a few cool ideas, with just enough information to use them in a game. Sometimes, all you need are bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bullet Points are a line of very short, cheap PDFs each of which gives the bare bones of a set of related options. It may be five spells, six feats, eight magic weapon special abilities, or any other short set of related rules we can cram into about a page. Short and simple, these PDFs are for GMs and players who know how to integrate new ideas into their campaigns without any hand-holding, and just need fresh ideas and the rules to support them. No in-character fiction setting the game world. No charts and tables. No sidebars of explanations and optional rules. Just one sentence of explanation for the High Concept of the PDF, then bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Concept: Feats tying to halfling racial traits (including those found in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Race Guide) to allow halfling burglars (of any class) to feel like more than short elf rogues or gnomish bards without low-light vision (and if a group of players decided they all wanted to be halfling burglars, perhaps after seeing a good fantasy movie, also to give them way to differentiate their characters).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The feats included are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Duck and Weave: You are adept at diving through the chaos of combat.&lt;br/&gt;    Hair Part: Traps are rarely designed to catch creatures your size and shape, and you&amp;rsquo;ve learned to use that fact to your advantage.&lt;br/&gt;    Knuckle-Cracker: You are skilled at hitting a foe&amp;rsquo;s hands with sling stones and forcing them to drop something.&lt;br/&gt;    Lucky Number: A group&amp;rsquo;s fortunes are improved just by having you as one of their members.&lt;br/&gt;    Marcherbook: You keep a journal of your adventures, and those of friends and allies.&lt;br/&gt;    Master Pickpocket: Your targets never notice when you decide to find out what&amp;rsquo;s in their pockets.&lt;br/&gt;    Old Blood: Your family is noted as having features that make you seem even more halfling than other halflings, and at the same time more adventurous and sneaky.&lt;br/&gt;    Parody: You can create songs or rhymes that anger your foes and throw them off their game.&lt;br/&gt;    Professional Burglar: You are not afraid to admit you are a professional burglar, trained in the art of entering buildings and steal the valuables within.&lt;br/&gt;    Proud Feet: Your feet are as tough and calloused as any boot, but still quite sensitive and nimble.&lt;br/&gt;    Riddlemaster: You can create a web of words that leave your foes bewildered.&lt;br/&gt;    Right in the Shins: You&amp;rsquo;ve learned how to take advantage of your small size and a foe&amp;rsquo;s distraction to hit where it hurts.&lt;br/&gt;    Scamper: You trust in your own ability to crouch down to a small size, and hurtle through tight spaces without pausing to consider the consequences.&lt;br/&gt;    Unseen By Most: If you focus on it, you can sneak about in places bigger and louder creatures cannot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
