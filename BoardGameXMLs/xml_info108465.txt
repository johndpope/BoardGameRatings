			<description>Fluchmory, an auditory memory game, is played with 24 cards and 24 tiles, which come in pairs. On each pair, a proverb is printed (both on the card and on the tile).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, the tiles placed face-down on the table in a grid, and the cards are shuffled placed face-down in a stack. The first player draws the first card and reads its text out loud. Now, the players take turns picking up one tile (without showing it to the other players) and reading the text out loud. If the player has found the tile matching the card, he keeps the tile, and the next card is read. Otherwise, the tile is returned to its spot on the table, face-down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all tiles have been claimed. The player who has collected the most tiles wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
