			<description>(from the back of the book)&lt;br/&gt;The arms-manual (Waffen-Handbuch) covers all weapons off all periods that can be imagined for the Cthulhu role-playing game, ranging from the Stone Age to Now, and presents all known weapons of aliens and their cultists in text and pictures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arms-manual is a catalog of weapons. Each weapon type is described and illustrated with a picture. For each weapon type specifications are given. Of course, for every weapon the stats for the Cthulhu RPG are given. A total of over 1,300 weapons are described with stats!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arms-manual is not a catalog of weapons. It is not limited to collections of weapons, but also gives information on game-related issues, for example on the topics of silencers, weapon jammings, weapon laws and the equipment of military, police and criminal forces of different eras. In addition, there are numerous texts that provide ideas for adventures, and historical persons are described, that are connected with the issue of arms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
