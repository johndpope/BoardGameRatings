			<description>This game from McLoughlin Brothers was a game that featured a mechanical man who was controlled by the player. The scorecard that came with the game showed how long each hole was and a conversion into inches was then made by the players. There was an out-of bounds marker and a sand trap and movable green to navigate to and then with a deft touch the ball could be putted into the hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
