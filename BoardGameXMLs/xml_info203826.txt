			<description>This horse-racing game, undated but likely 1930s, uses a deck of cards to determine movement. The game contains six thick cardboard cards, each having a track of 12 holes from Start to Finish. Each track is marked with one of the suits and represents the horses &amp;quot;Club Foot&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Diamond Jim&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Spade Tail&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Heart Throb&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the basic Stake Race game, each player turns over a card, the horse of the drawn suit moves ahead one space, and the owning player must pay $1 into the stakes. First to reach the finish takes the accumulated stakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are additional rules for Steeplechase, Handicap, Daily Double and Hi-Stepping races, as well as a Number-Pool game that can be added to any of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If more than six people play at once, a second deck of cards is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
