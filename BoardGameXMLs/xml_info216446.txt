							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strato Checkers</name>
									
			<description>Strato Checkers is a retro futuristic view of what Checkers could become. Made by the same folk that brought us Strato Tac-Tics. It's made in the same acrylic plastic with oversized board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strato Checkers differs from regular checkers in that there are stacking and unstacking rules. Lower pieces in the stack also effect movement of the stacked piece, helping pieces move forward, backwards, or sideways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
