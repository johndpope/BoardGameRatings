			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scott is a patriot who believes in the American dream, and in a nation where a person is judged on his or her own merits, not race, religion, or creed. He values loyalty and honesty, and uses these as his code and shield. Though at times he can be gullible, he never forgets a wrong done to him or his friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scott knows he is a hero for the generations and inspiration for many younger superheroes coming up through the ranks; he does his best to live up to these expectations, knowing that even though he is long-lived, this newer generation is the world's next heroes and guardians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
