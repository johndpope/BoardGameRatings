			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This article marks the first in a series that will look at the various cryptic locations and struggling communities situated among the ruins of Los Angeles, better known simply as the &amp;quot;Necropolis&amp;quot; by the inhabitants of the Twisted Earth. A broader overlook of the Necropolis is given in the Darwin's World (Second Edition) rulebook. These articles will attempt to focus on a specific adventure location, monster lair, or a community clinging to survival among the ruins.&lt;br/&gt;Note: The details of this article are based on the outcome of a play by e-mail game run in 2000 set in the Twisted Earth setting of Darwin's World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally titled &amp;quot;Necropolis&amp;quot;, this game pitted a group of players against one another in a grueling competition to take several impoverished groups of survivors and build viable communities among the burnt-out and radiated ruins of Los Angeles.However, the locations portrayed here aren't necessarily limited to Los Angeles; with only a little modification you can port the locations and monsters to virtually any post-apocalyptic environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
