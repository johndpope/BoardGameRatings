			<description>Red riding hood is going to grandmother's house with all kinds of treats. But in Grandmother's bed the big bad wolf is waiting for her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board consists of 4 puzzle pieces and a 3D-bed in which grandmother lays. In the beginning of the game a mask has to be put on grandmother, so she becomes the wolf. Red riding hood is being placed on a small rotating disc at the end of the bed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players have to take three treats to grandmother. Every turn a player has to move one pawn according to the number of pips on the die.  If the turn ends on a stone, the next player takes a turn. If the turn ends in grandmother's house, the player turns red riding hood. If the wolf stays asleep in bed, the player takes his pawn and lays it in front of him. He then continues play with his second pawn. If the wolf wakes up  the player has to start over with that pawn. The first player who places his third pawn in front of him, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
