			<description>To the Moon is an indie RPG/Adventure game, about two doctors traversing through the memories of a dying man to fulfill his last wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a 16-bit era RPG graphics style to tell a science-fiction story about the possibility of reliving a life from the beginning. The premise is that scientists have developed a means of permanently altering a person's memories. However, because the procedure is permanent and can be harmful, it is only performed on people close to death to allow them to experience their life had they fulfilled their deepest wishes just prior to dying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
