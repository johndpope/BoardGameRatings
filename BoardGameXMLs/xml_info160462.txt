			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blazing through the galaxy in a gleaming ship, our intrepid heroes desperately struggle to outrun the ruthless Scape Pirate Captain Zartok and his crew of celestial scallywags! While they manage a daring escape, the party finds themselves out of fuel and adrift in a sea of stars. With few options, the crew lands on a mysteriously quiet mining station to refuel and repair. But when a religiously passionate group of robots meets them at the airlock, the mystery begins! Where is the Human crew of the station? What is the enigmatic organism at war with the robots? Does the Mainframe really store the robot&amp;rsquo;s Digital Gods? Our heroes&amp;rsquo; search for the truth has only begun, but they better hurry, for Captain Zartok is on their trail!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Episode 16 - The Digital Gods&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: By popular demand the Gagmen have taken a flying leap... into Star Frontiers. We come up with a little story with religious robots, weird space slugs, and space pirates. Can your characters get off the base filled with this insanity, or are you doomed to end up a brain in a jar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
