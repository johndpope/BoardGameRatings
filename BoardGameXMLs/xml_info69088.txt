							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">County Precinct Police Station</name>
									
			<description>From the Editorial Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Police Station is the second of what we hope will be a large selection of adventure locales for use with Villains &amp;amp; Vigilantes from Dave Woodrum and Stacy Smith. This is, like the earlier Pawn Shop, a location designed to be dropped into any campaign and to fill a void in completing a game world for such campaigns. The Police Station is probably useful more often and there are plans for other, similar types of locations that might be visited repeatedly and regularly by the player-heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dave Woodrum is also at work on adventures and larger locations which will be included in the planned V&amp;amp;V Giant Adventure books which will include several adventures in larger, thick books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We all hope that you (the GM or Player) find these locations to be useful and that they add to your enjoyment of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second in a series of free PDF downloads that herald a new line of V&amp;amp;V products from Fantasy Games Unlimited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The County Precinct Police Station contains a GM's Map and a Player's Map, a key to all of the locations (each with its own description), along with a thorough listing of the staff of the facility and the miscreants that might be found incarcerated within. This creates a location that can be dropped into just about any V&amp;amp;V campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement also includes an extremely handy set of &amp;quot;Thugmaker&amp;quot; tables which allow the GM to random generate male &amp;amp; female last names, memorable features/personality quirks, criminal history, etc. Set also introduces stats for various police equipment (like pepper spray, etc.). The authors even take the time to include a couple of &amp;quot;Bonus Scenario&amp;quot; plot seeds that involve the police station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
