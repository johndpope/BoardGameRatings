			<description>&amp;ldquo;G.I. Joe vs Cobra. 2 player game: Board, Cards, Dice. There are 2 decks. One player gets the Joe Deck. The other player gets the Cobra Deck. Victory: You win if you ever capture your opponent&amp;rsquo;s base, or you control all &amp;lsquo;Urban&amp;rsquo; spaces on the board.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on an 8x8 grid with spaces large enough to hold a card. The G.I. Joe base is in one corner of the board and the Cobra base is in the opposite corner. The remaining 62 spaces are a random mix of eight terrain types: Jungle, Swamp, Sea, Desert, Mountain, Forest, Urban, and Arctic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with four Teams and a hand of cards. Each card has the name and statistics for a soldier. The cards are placed under each Team counter to represent the soldiers in that Team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teams engage in combat by moving into the same space as an opposing Team. Combat is resolved based on one of three unit factors (as determined randomly by a die roll): Firepower, Close Combat, or Tactics. Combat bonuses are given for various factors, including having a team with soldiers from the same service branch or when units are defending their base. Combat resolution also takes into consideration artillery units, armor units vs. anti-armor, and air units vs. &amp;ldquo;anti-air.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
