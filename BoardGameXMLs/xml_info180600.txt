							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Meltdown</name>
									
			<description>This is a cooperative chemistry review game in which students must work together to keep a nuclear power plant from melting down.  As the game progresses, radioactive nuclei will undergo fission and as a result neutrons will be emitted to continue the chain reaction.  Students must control the rate of fission by using control rods to absorb the neutrons before they collide with another nucleus.  Students must answer review questions in order to obtain the all important control rods.  Students choose an employee role, such as the Nuclear Technician, Nuclear Scientist, Station Manager, etc.  Each role has its own special ability.  To win, students are going to have to find a way to work together to coordinate the special abilities of the employees to stop the meltdown!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch out for surprises along the way!  Funding cuts happen as well as radiation leaks.  Students must stay on their toes because they never know when an Uncontrolled Chain Reaction might occur!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game forces students to work together and apply what they have learned in the classroom to achieve a common goal:  Stop the Meltdown!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
