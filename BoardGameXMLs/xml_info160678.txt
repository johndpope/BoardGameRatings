			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three Days Until Retirement is a fast-paced, over-the-top, well-hyphenated game about loose-cannon police officers trying to solve one last case before they retire. The game uses playing cards instead of dice and is designed for those new to gaming as well as grumpy veteran gamers who are looking for something new.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Across the space of a few hours, two to four players assume the role of grizzled police officers and one player assumes the role of Game Runner. The players must interrogate, investigate and intimidate their way through a nefarious plot and deal justice to the criminal scum that plague the streets of Metro City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
