			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panzer-Jagd (German for Tank Hunt) is a truly remarkable graphic game of armored warfare on the Eastern Front of World War II.  Additionally, two complete games come on the enclosed software, Panzer-Jagd and Panzerun.  In Panzer-Jagd you command from 1 to 18 German panzers and must advance across a randomly generated terrain map literally laced with ambush points.  Your attack force consists of a number of the fearsome Panther tanks and some not-so-fearsome Panzer III's.  You must also keep a watchful eye on each panzer unit's fuel supply; running out of petrol on the Russian steppe spells certain doom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panzerun adds additional realism and some new terrain types.  You command an assault force consisting of 25 armored and infantry units with artillery support.  Units that survive the initial encounter are available for the next battle (a new map is created).  Your goal is to go as far as possible with the allotted forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In both games the computer checks all lines of sight and calculates all &amp;quot;To Hit&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;To Kill&amp;quot; probabilities.  You simply lock in the target with your joystick controller and FIRE!  There is no &amp;quot;pretending you don't know&amp;quot; where the enemy is as you maneuver your forces, you really DON'T KNOW enemy locations until they open fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
