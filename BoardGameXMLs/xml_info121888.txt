			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Marble Madness clone. The back of the box says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Battle against the clock and marauding enemies as you attempt to free each screen from darkness in this challenging and perplexing arcade puzzle game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game manual says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;At the outset of each level, the world you must free is shown briefly before it is blacked out. Take careful note of this, as you will not get another look at the entire level until it is completed. By travelling over the square sectors that make up each chequered world you can illuminate it. When all the squares have been illuminated, the exit square for that level flashes and must be reached before the time limit expires to teleport to the next world.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Become trapped on a 'dead end' square, your only alternative is to commit suicide. As the game progresses, more alien enemies are introduced and the hidden paths for each level become more difficult to negociate. Points are awarded for revealing squares, with a bonus given upon the completion of each level, and additional points awarded for time remaining.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
