							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hephaestus</name>
									
			<description>From time to time, blacksmiths from all around the world gather in a competition that shall decide who is the world's best blacksmith, the only one entitled to the blessing of Hephaestus, the god of the forge. But not all are worthy of such honor, and only those artisans able to create the best weapons, armor and shields have a chance.  &lt;br/&gt;Hephaestus is a simple, yet very involving game that brings all the strategy from the worker placement mechanics using only cards. Each blacksmith has a special skill and a single specialty. On her turn, the player must choose one of the actions of the game and pick up the card of that action:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Buy resources  &lt;br/&gt;     Purchase contracts  &lt;br/&gt;     Buy improvements for weapons  &lt;br/&gt;     And Install Improvements  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each contract describes how to create an equipment, which can be either a weapon, an armor or a shield, and shows the resources and the amount of work needed to create the equipment. For each piece of equipment you will need to heat the metal, cool it down and then smash it with your hammer! The required time for each step depends on the equipment, and the time you will actually take to forge it depends on the action cards you will take during the game. Each time you complete a contract, you receive the number of victory points described in it, earning bonus points according to their powers and their improvements! The game ends when the contract card deck is over, and the blacksmith who has the most victory points is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Components:&lt;br/&gt;- 104 Cards  &lt;br/&gt;- 4 players boards  &lt;br/&gt;- 26 Resource tokens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
