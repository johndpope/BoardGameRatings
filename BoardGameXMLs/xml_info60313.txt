			<description>The players want to get more money in every round and the one with the most at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules of the cards (What color is trump or no trump, open or close calling of your tricks and other things) change every round. A dice will tell you how many cards you will get this round (it can be from 1-10) and than you will guess how many tricks you will get. Bevor the round starts everybody has to bid money on his guess (min. 5, max.20). If you were correct you double your money. Wrong guess? All money is gone...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And of course there are also the tactical special cards...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
