			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Masks have captivated us for centuries as a medium for mystic transformation, divine communication, and spiritual ritual. Here are some masks that will captivate your foes while you and the rest of your party whups up on them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sample:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alignment Mask (Crusader)&lt;br/&gt;This mask bestows certain spell like abilities upon its wearer, provided that they are of lawful good alignment. The wearer becomes protected as though affected by a continuous protection from evil spell for as long as the mask is worn. The wearer can also use the mask to cast the order's wrath spell three times per day. Lastly, as a one-time effect, the wearer can remove the mask and break it in half. Doing so destroys the mask, releasing the arcane energies trapped within. These energies take the form of a summon monster V spell, calling forth a creature to protect the mask's former owner. The creature summoned must be of lawful good, lawful neutral, or neutral good alignment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
