			<description>Ninja Burger, the world's only fast-food chain run by ninja, is looking for new recruits. Do you have what it takes to work for them? Pirates need not apply! The second edition of the award-winning Ninja Burger RPG has been completely revamped and rewritten, with an all-new game engine and all new ninja content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Over 100 pages of funny, fast-paced action, ideal for both one-shot &amp;quot;Beer &amp;amp; Pretzels&amp;quot; gaming as well as longer campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;- The PDQ system, a game engine designed for evocative simplicity, speed and flexibility in play, as seen in the award-winning Monkey, Ninja, Pirate, Robot and Truth &amp;amp; Justice (PDQ System Design by Chad Underkoffler, Atomic Sock Monkey Press).&lt;br/&gt;- Fully-customizable character creation, with five suggested jobs for quick-play action. Be a Ninja Driver, Chef, Deliverator, or even a master of Ninja Magic! &lt;br/&gt;- San Francisco - A complete city setting for all your Ninja Burger adventures. &lt;br/&gt;- An 8-page starting adventure, plus four 2-page mini-deliveries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
