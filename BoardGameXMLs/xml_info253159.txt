							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Random Taverns</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taverns and inns are staples of fantasy settings. Characters meet up there, find adventures, speak to contacts and occasionally even get food, drinks or accommodation. They can be found in nearly every settlement, and cities can easily have dozens of them or more, most of which will not be described or even listed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a list of 100 different taverns that can be dropped into a setting. Each tavern is briefly described, with its name and some other features of interest, such as the building, owner and clientele. Although these could be randomly chosen, it is a better idea for the GM to choose specific taverns, as not every tavern is suited to every location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Ales You: Opened by the singer and songwriter Gillian Cartwright, this tavern has a small stage along one side, and several slates above the bar with the day&amp;rsquo;s specials. Beautiful art graces the walls, and those with a taste for wordplay will find plenty to chuckle over in the names of the drinks, the dishes, and even the acts that perform on a nightly basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the front cover and one page the front matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
