							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trouble at Mille</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Trouble at Mille, the party arrives at the small but prosperous town of Mille. Their latest task complete, the heroes are left to wander the streets of this strange frontier town. There is money here, to be certain, but there is something else. Late at night, trouble roams the streets and recently, the prosperous town has suffered something of a drain on its resources. The town elders are at a loss as to how to respond to the crisis. Is the party the answer to their prayers? This encounter can be dropped into any ongoing campaign with ease as the players need only be looking for work in a city to be offered the job escorting the caravan to Mille. If the party is already wandering in the wild, skip the introduction and have them arrive at Mille by other means.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
