			<description>A Conta da Copa &amp;eacute; Nossa! is a card game who pictures the process of building the infrastructure of Brazil's 2014 World Cup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player represents a contractor which competes with other players to gain more profit and participation in the constructions. To achieve their goals, the players will have at their disposal a humorous deck of illustrated cards with politicians and characters which can help you with many tasks: gain favors, spoil the adversaries, work around difficult situations, among other things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning, each player gets 20 cards of characters. Three piles are stocked at the center of the table: constructions, governors, and sponsors. After that, 8 construction cards, 1 governor and 2 sponsors are removed from their piles, and the players can use them, replacing the cards as they are used. There are material tokens that make constructions possible. They are obtained by using the characters and politicians cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each construction sums points to a total, and the highest total wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
