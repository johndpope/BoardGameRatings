Including record sheets for everyone in the command - which includes eight, never-before-seen 'Mech variants - as well as a unique track system that allows players to develop their own scenarios, players will be firing autocannons and tossing PPC lightning at one another in no time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Classic BattleTech Introductory Box Set is required to use Starterbook: Sword and Dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also designed to be used in conjunction with Iron Wind Metals' Sword and Dragon 'MechPack: House Davion and Sword and Dragon 'MechPack: House Kurita.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
