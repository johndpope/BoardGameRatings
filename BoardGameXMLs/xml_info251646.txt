			<description>So, what does Landmarks bring to Villages of Valeria? The primary new mechanic is a new follow opportunity called &amp;quot;Build A Landmark&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Landmarks, if you cannot or choose not to follow the lead action, you can build a landmark as your follow action.You simply discard a specific card from your hand and, based on the resource icon at the bottom of the Building card, you take a certain landmark token and place it on your castle card. For example, discard a Building card with a Food resource at the bottom to establish a Silo as a Landmark in your village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landmark tokens do not count as Buildings, but at the end of the game, the player with the most of each type of Landmark will earn victory points! For each set of all five different Landmarks you've collected, you'll gain even more victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Landmarks expansion also comes with new Adventurer cards that trigger on the Landmarks you've collected, new Building cards to grow your village with cool new powers, and all-new Architect cards to award hidden end-game bonus points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increase your Landmark holdings, leverage the new Buildings, attract the new Adventurers, and show your rivals what a proper village looks like!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-From the Kickstarter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
