			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ukiyo Zoshi was published as HTML in an unfinished state.  The setting is partially and unevenly developed.  The basic premise suggests several &amp;quot;factions&amp;quot; that vie for power and influence.  The geographic setting consists of several &amp;quot;sectors&amp;quot; that connect to each other along defined pathways, all meeting at a central sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action resolution system is referred to as the ISOMER System.  It is presented as a standalone resolution mechanism using cards.  Players flip a card and add their skill to the value, comparing this result against the game master's card flip added to a difficulty factor.  In general, the card values swamp the modifiers making resolution mostly random.  The rules favor narrative resolution whenever possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
