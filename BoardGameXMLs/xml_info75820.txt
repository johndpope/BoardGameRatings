			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intergalactic hero Rob Bot, along with his robotic buddies Zero Zero and Blinx Bot, has saved the universe countless times in the popular Rob Bot and His Robotic Buds animated series. This new roleplaying game (RPG), created by series creator Philip Reed, lets you take on the role of Rob and his friends as they delve deep into mystery, suspense, destruction, and the quest for the perfect afternoon snack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to play the Rob Bot and His Robotic Buds adventure game you will need this rulebook, copies of the Bot Sheets, a stop watch, and several six-sided dice. This adventure game is designed for two to four players, one of which will take on the role of Black Bot Five, Rob Bot's nemesis and the narrator of the Rob Bot animated series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other players will play the roles of Rob Bot, Zero Zero, and Blinx Bot. The exact characters each player will play depends on the action at hand and, during the course of the game, each player will get the chance to roleplay Rob Bot. Roleplaying is what we do in this game. Search the web for info on RPGs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
