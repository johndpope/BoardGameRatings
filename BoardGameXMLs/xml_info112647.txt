			<description>The NEC PC-8801 was an early Zilog Z80-based computer exclusively released in Japan, where it became very popular, by NEC Corporation in 1981. It was informally called the &amp;quot;PC-88&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PC-8801BE was launched as a business computer in the UK with 8&amp;quot; floppy drives around 1982 but it was not as successful as the PC-8001 it was intended to replace.  Variations of the PC-8801 were also sold in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For its time, the PC-8801SR (V2-mode) had a high display resolution, but could only display 8 out of 512 colors simultaneously. The 640 &amp;times; 400 mode was monochrome only. Its sound-producing capabilities were also more advanced than other machines of the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Companies that produced exclusive software for the NEC PC-8801 included Enix, Square, Sega, Falcom, Bandai Soft, Hal Laboratory, ASCII, Pony, T&amp;amp;E Soft, Wolf Team, Dempa, Champion Soft, Starcraft, Micro Cabin, PSK, and Bothtec. Certain games produced for the PC-8801 had a shared release with the MSX, such as those produced by Game Arts, ELF, and Konami. Many popular series first appeared on the NEC PC-8801, including Snatcher, Thexder, Dragon Slayer, RPG Maker, and Ys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nintendo licensed Hudson Soft to port some of Nintendo's Family Computer games for the console, including Excitebike, Balloon Fight, Tennis, Donkey Kong 3, Golf, and Ice Climber, as well as new editions of Mario Bros. called Mario Bros. Special and Punch Ball Mario Bros. and a unique Super Mario Bros. game for the computer, Super Mario Bros. Special.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The computer also had its own BASIC dialect: N88-BASIC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;NEC PC-8801&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
