							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Peacekeepers</name>
									
			<description>Peacekeepers tells the story of 5 factions seeking to bring peace and stability to a war torn nation. Peace must be created without using the factions greatest assets, overwhelming fire-power and military strength. &lt;br/&gt;Imagine advanced western nations with their mech&amp;rsquo;s striving to keep the peace in a country as it tears itself apart.  But imagine being unable to use many of those powerful weapons because your mission is to prevent carnage and civilian causalities. Where the mission to being peace is a harder tactical challenge to your leaders than to invade. Peacekeepers is set a civil war in a mid-European country, 30 years in the future. Where fires of war still darken the night-time skies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine ingenious insurgents using stolen, scavenged and bolted together machines and monstrous weapons to attack, or welded together parts of western mechs, or black market weapons. While commanders must show restraint and work out who is the enemy or the innocent on the ground. This is the setting of peacekeepers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peacekeepers is a 4X inspired game set in a near future world reminiscent of our world. It is a &amp;lsquo;peace em up&amp;rsquo; where civilian casualties are the 'countdown' timer in the game and where players can cooperate to protect the populace from events, or compete with each other. Its board game about peace - using giant machines of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peacekeepers thus is a delicate balance of strategy, public relations and maneuvering.&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes not using tactics is harder than using tactics. Sometimes the hardest strategy game of all is to not fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
