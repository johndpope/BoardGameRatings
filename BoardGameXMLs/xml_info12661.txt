			<description>In the Town and Country Traffic game, 2-5 players race from their starting point to their goal point driven by the display on a plunger-driven mechanical wheel. Players can gain and lose points (money) along the way. When one player reaches their goal, the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sixth player can be added. This player does not control a car, but does collect all fines imposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In essence, the Town &amp;amp; Country Traffic game could be viewed as an overproduced spin-and-move game. Metal cars and the metal plunger-driven wheel provide visual appeal, though the wheel could easily have been replaced with a simpler, cheaper, and more reliable spinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At least two component variations exist. One variation uses different colored plastic chips as its game money. The other has a punch out sheet with denominated cardboard &amp;quot;coin&amp;quot; tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
