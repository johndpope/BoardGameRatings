							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Consensus Junior</name>
									
			<description>Consensus Junior is the third and newest addition to the award-winning Consensus collection. As the name implies, this one's for the kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game follows the same, award-winning design as the other two versions. There's a large, colorful board, a deck of 200 noun cards, a deck of 75 adjective cards, a deck of voting cards (8 sets of cards, each with a unique border color, numbering 1-10) and a collection of 8 colored pawns, one for each of the sets of voting cards. The board has numbered spaces for 10 noun cards, a space for the adjective card, and a scoring track. The noun cards are drawn and placed face-up, one in each of the numbered spaces on the board. An adjective card is turned over. Players select the one noun they think most closely fits the adjective, place their vote face down on the table, and then take turns revealing their selection. The answer receiving the greatest number of votes is deemed the winning answer and the players who chose the winning answer move ahead one space. In a case where there is no clear majority, no one scores. Hence the name, Consensus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key to the difference between the Junior Edition and the other editions of Consensus is the content of the noun and adjective cards. Given, for example, the following randomly selected noun cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Bee Hive&lt;br/&gt;    * Bed Bug&lt;br/&gt;    * My Daddy&lt;br/&gt;    * Nemo&lt;br/&gt;    * World Peace&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which would you vote for if the adjective were (also a random sample):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Rare&lt;br/&gt;    * Adorable&lt;br/&gt;    * Unforgettable&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the adjective were &amp;quot;rare,&amp;quot; which do you think is, um, rarest: your daddy, world peace, Nemo? Which the most adorable? Which the most self-evidently unforgettable?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even as the mature person you most obviously are, you'd still have a somewhat clear and more or less patently obvious choice, regardless of which adjective was chosen. And, with an &amp;quot;opponent&amp;quot; of the unabashed certainty of an eight-year-old, you know there will be strong opinions about everything. This is what makes the Junior Edition so appealing: everyone counts, everyone in the family finds themselves personally invited, everyone has an opinion, everyone feels equally entitled, equally correct, and, with the Junior edition, pretty much equally informed. How many family games can you say that about?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
