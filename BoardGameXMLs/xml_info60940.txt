			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to your orientation for Chochokpi University, the premiere institute of higher learning in the American Heartland.  Haven&amp;rsquo;t declared a major yet?...Well, there is the Parker-Walsh School of Archeological Research.  Field work includes excavating nearby pre-Columbian ruins.  You never know what you might dig up.  There is also the Alber Engineering School.  Work on some exciting technologies like the IX45836 Unipolar Generator, as soon as you sign this waiver&amp;hellip;oh, those rumors of researchers disappearing are just that&amp;hellip;. If that doesn&amp;rsquo;t interest you, there is also the Justice and Forensic Studies Center.  Earn extra credit by discrediting crooked civil servants and destroying the cases of incompetent prosecutors&amp;hellip;More of a Liberal Arts person?  You might be interested in our interdisciplinary degree in Paranormal and Occult Studies.  You aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid of ghosts, are you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chochokpi University is a generic college campus that is anything but generic.  This fully developed location sourcebook provides you with a wealth of new ideas, story seeds, NPCs, and more to use in modern games.  Designed for the Karma Roleplaying System, the ideas and background information in this book can be easily integrated into almost any modern game system.
