			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost a century ago. Durenian colonists landed on the norther coast.  There, they raised bustling cities under the cooling breezes from the sea, but, except for soldiers, traders, and ambitious adventurers, no one ventures far into the fever-ridden, mosquito-cursed interior.  Even these are usually content to stay close to the outposts, taking an occasional profit when some of the friendlier Taweii come in to sell their pelts, their medicinal herbs, and some exotic, jungle products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You turn and stroll back to the fort.

To begin your adventure, go to...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for characters of a maximum of 40 combat adds and 4th level spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
