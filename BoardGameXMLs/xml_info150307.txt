							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The City Block</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle Maps:  The City Block is the first 1&amp;quot;=5' full color miniature battle map offering from Stoneworker Cartography.  It is a very large map when completely printed out, spanning 88 pages at eighty by eighty inches.  That's almost 6.7 feet of pure battle mapping goodness!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map is a replica of a smaller virtual table top version of the City Block map, found here.  Because I had to create this map from scratch (since the original was far too small for miniature gaming), some details may have changed between the original and this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included within are both a colored version and a black and white version of this map.  There is also a small key included to demonstrate the major features of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep in mind that it may not be necessary to print the entire 88 pages of this map for your game.  6.7' is a lot of space being used up by a single map, and most tables aren't large enough to accommodate this file in its entirety.  If you find this is the case, you can always print out smaller sections of the map to cover only the areas you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
