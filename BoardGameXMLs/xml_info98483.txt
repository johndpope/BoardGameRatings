							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Chronicle of Mutation</name>
									
			<description>designer's blog comment:&lt;br/&gt;Heavily based on the setting of the old Heartbreaker  game The Mutant Chronicles (duh!), the rules are a fairly radical departure from the original. It&amp;rsquo;s also greatly reduced in scope, something that I see as a decided plus (if I do say so myself). The earlier RPG suffered a bit from the over-whelming options: if one person wanted to play an Imperial Blood Beret, one person an inquisitorial assassin, and a 3rd a Mishima corporate samurai in giant robo battle gear, and the last one as a freelancer journalist&amp;hellip;well crap, how are you supposed to GM THAT type of freakshow? My micro-version tunes it down to the simple freelancer level, though with a twist: you&amp;rsquo;re nominally associated with the Holy Inquisition (my version of the Cathedral) and thus have a definite type of objective (sniffing out heretics) for missions/adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment:&lt;br/&gt;This one-page microRPG is available as a free download from the designer's blog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
