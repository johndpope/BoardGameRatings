			<description>A children's game based on the poem of the same name. &amp;quot;The Object of the game is to see which player who represents the Froggie can avoid being gobbled up by Lily White Duck.&amp;quot; The components consist of 47 cards and a box (with the rules on the inside of the lid.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player, in turn, randomly draws a card from the hand of an adjacent player. If the card makes a pair with another card in the player's hand, the pair is played to the center of the table. This continues until all of the pairs have been played. The player left holding the Lily White card is considered to have been gobbled up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
