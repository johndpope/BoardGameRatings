			<description>A chess variant using cards. Basic two player chess rules board and pieces apply modified by the introduction of a common deck of cards.  The deck includes a range of alternative plays that players can elect to use rather than normal movement for that turn.  Examples are: move 3 pieces, move pawn like a rook, switch two of your opponent&amp;rsquo;s pieces, move bishop to any empty space etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck is placed beside the chessboard and four cards turned face up.  One of these forms the start of the discard pile, one is available for use by the black player, one for use by only the white player, and one (the free card) is available for use by both players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you can move as normal or you can play either the free card or your colour card.  If you play a card it goes to the discard and is replaced by the top card of the deck.  If you make a normal move, you may cause the free card or your colour card to be discarded and summarily replaced by the top card of the deck.  &lt;br/&gt;If the deck runs out, shuffle the discard and draw from it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in normal chess the winner is the player to checkmate his opponent&amp;rsquo;s King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
