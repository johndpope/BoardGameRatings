			<description>[From the back of the box]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A Wild Cyberspace Adventure to Save the Next Millennium- Silicon Valley was intended to be the most technologically advanced amusement park civilization has ever known. Shortly after take-off, it disappeared. Now, in the year 3000, it's back and on a collision course with Earth! It's up to you to conquer the 30 levels in four incredibly lavish environments, take control of the totally original, wacky and -at times- life-threatening characters and unlock the mysteries of the valley. It's all great fun but remember, the fate of the world is in your hands!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You control a microchip that hops from one robotic animal to the next. Each animal has its own powers, ranging from simple melee attacks, to missiles. Complete a set of goals in each level to be beamed back aboard the ship. The station is divided into four different areas. &amp;quot;Euro Eden&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Arctic Kingdom&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Jungle Safari&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Desert Adventure.&amp;quot; Each area has nine levels, but one must only finish three of them to move on to the next area. Finishing 8 will unlock the ninth level, a boss level of sorts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
