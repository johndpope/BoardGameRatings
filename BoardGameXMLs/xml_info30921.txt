			<description>A simple betting game, based on the roll of three standard 6-sided dice held within a turnable cage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the printed rule sheet:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You may invite any number of people to play. The first step is to set out your equipment and select a person to be Banker. The Banker pays off all bets for any agreed number of plays or time limit at the completion of which another player acts as Banker.&lt;br/&gt;All numbers on the layout do not have to be sold. For example, only two or three people may participate in a single play. The profit percentage is exactly the same as if all numbers were covered. &lt;br/&gt;When all bets are down on the layout, the Banker gives the cage a turn which raises and drops the dice at the opposite end of the cage. The three numbers on the top surface of the dice are the winners. &lt;br/&gt;If a bettor's number appears on one die he receives the return of his stake plus a like amount (even money). If it appears on 2 dice he is rewarded with the return of his bet plus twice the amount bet (2 to 1). Three like numbers rewards the players with thrice the amount bet plus the bet (3 to 1).&lt;br/&gt;Lowe's CHUCK-A-LUCK is an exact duplicate of the regulation casino game. It has all the play features of the larger size game and will give players the same high degree of enjoyment.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
