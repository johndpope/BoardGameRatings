			<description>Set of miniatures wargame rules for fighting battles of the American Civil War circa 1862.  From the cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Being a set of very playable recreational Wargame rules that will create, to some degree, the excitement and pageantry of Tactical Battles of the late War for Southern Independence&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assuming 25mm\28mm figures are used:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game scale: One inch = 22 yards&lt;br/&gt;One infantry figure = 25 men&lt;br/&gt;Twenty infantry figures equal a 500 men regiment&lt;br/&gt;Six figures and three gun models equal a 6-gun battery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reduced scale rulers are provided for playing with figures smaller than 25mm\28mm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mounted cavalry is not covered in the rules (it's assumed that they have dismounted prior to the start of the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sequence of play:&lt;br/&gt;1) Movement Phase: Brigades are moved in order of a draw from a deck of cards.
