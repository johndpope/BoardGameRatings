							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of States and Cities</name>
									
			<description>The cards in this game contain a map side and a question side.  The map side contains a map of the United States with a state blackened in.  The question side has the name of a state and 6 questions about the state (state flowers, topographical features, capitals etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two games to play.  The first involves players looking at the map sides of the cards and making guesses as to which state is blackened in.  If they are correct they score the card.  If they are wrong it goes to the bottom of their card stack.  The second game involves players asking the trivia questions and the other players answering (each player gets one guess and the the players are asked in order around the table).  If you answer correctly you get the card.  If no one answers a question you ask, you get that card.  Most cards win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is covered by U.S. patent 1745946.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
