			<description>From &amp;quot;Introduction:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Euphorium, everyone's favorite one-stop shop for all things hippie/goth/punk since 1973, is being forced to close their doors if they can't come up with $50,000 in back rent. The store owners, Sunflower and her husband Smokey, have been friends with the locals in The Hollow for a long time, but people have been buying their music, clothes, games, and comics online in ever-increasing numbers, this small mom-and-pop store has found it difficult to complete. Chad Bradley (the Euphorium's landlord and all-around corporate dirtbag) sees this as an opportune time to kick out the hippies and tear down the store to build a franchised yuppie watering hole named after a day of the week with lots of crazy crap on the walls and waiters that wear too many smarmy buttons on their suspenders. Sunflower has three days to collect the cash or the store will be no more. Since the spookybeans are regulars in the shop, Sunflower asks them to help raise the money to stay open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opposing the spookybeans are the Yuppie Youth Organization, a preppy right-wing high school club that torments the freaky kids on a daily basis, and they will do everything they can to try and make it near impossible for them to raise any money. The YYO is made up of all the preps, jocks, cheerleaders, and wanna-bes and rich kids at Ross Perot high school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
