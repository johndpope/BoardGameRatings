							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Island Conquest</name>
									
			<description>Island Conquest is a network building game for 2 to 6 players. Players start with an equal number of islands under their control and using resource management and well planned strategy, battle their way toward building the largest collection of islands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The larger and more connected an island, the more powerful and influential it may become, providing additional resources per turn and a stronger base from which to launch attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameboard is designed to be played in two different formats, allowing for faster gameplay and even starting points with both the full board being utilized for 5 or 6 players, and a smaller portion of the board sectioned off for less players. So ready your troops, gather your resources and start building bridges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight to the end and fight the urge to retreat. This is your quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
