							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mark of Heroes Fastplay Characters</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mark of Heroes organized play campaign supported &amp;quot;fastplay&amp;quot; characters.  These characters were pre-generated &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; characters that could be picked up and used immediately.  Every fastplay character was designed around a specific D&amp;amp;D Miniature and if the character was represented by the associated miniature a modest play bonus was gained.  In addition, a fastplay character could be used and the experienced gained could be applied to the player's default campaign character (with some restrictions).  This process allowed an impromptu adventuring party with e.g. two fighters to &amp;quot;swap out&amp;quot; one fighter for a fastplay e.g. cleric, without penalizing the player willing to perform the swap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fastplay characters were available at 1st, 4th, and 7th level builds.  Six &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; characters were available at all three build levels (each provided as a 4-page character sheet at each build level):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Changeling Rogue&lt;br/&gt;        Elf Ranger&lt;br/&gt;        Gnome Cleric&lt;br/&gt;        Human Fighter&lt;br/&gt;        Kobold Wizard&lt;br/&gt;        Shifter Barbarian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four characters from the core D&amp;amp;D Miniatures Game were available only at 1st level (each provided as a 4-page character sheet):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Dwarf Artificer&lt;br/&gt;        Human Bard&lt;br/&gt;        Human Fighter (Alternate)&lt;br/&gt;        Warforged Wizard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four characters from the Angelfire Miniatures Game were available only at 4th level (these did not have character sheets, but used the miniature's stat card's roleplaying statistics for the session):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Dwarf Fighter&lt;br/&gt;        Dwarf Wizard&lt;br/&gt;        Human Cleric&lt;br/&gt;        Talenta Halfing Ranger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three characters from the War Drums Miniatures Game were available only at 7th level (these did not have character sheets, but used the miniature's stat card's roleplaying statistics for the session):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Halfling Rogue&lt;br/&gt;        Human Cleric&lt;br/&gt;        Warforged Fighter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three characters from the Underdark Miniatures Game were available only at 7th level (these did not have character sheets, but used the miniature's stat card's roleplaying statistics for the session):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Elf Ranger&lt;br/&gt;        Half-Orc Paladin&lt;br/&gt;        Human Wizard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
