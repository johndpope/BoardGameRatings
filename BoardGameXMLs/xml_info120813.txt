							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elder Scrolls BRP-yfied</name>
									
			<description>From the web page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I got my hands on the BRP-tome, this was my test of it. It said it could do anything, could it do Morrowind? &amp;nbsp;I think it can. This is my attempt. It is not the only way, nor necessarily the right way, but it is the way I choose to do it. It is a work in progress, rough and irregularly playtested, but it's still alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
