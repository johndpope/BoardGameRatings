							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fox and Hounds</name>
									
			<description>In this track game one player becomes the Fox and the others act as the Hounds. The Fox has the first move, spins the spinner, and advances along any path the number of spaces indicated. The Hounds then spin in turn, trying to capture the Fox by landing exactly on the space the Fox occupies. The Fox is safe on the Red track, but must move out on his next turn. If the Fox can reach the Fox's Den space by exact count, before being captured by one of the Hounds, he wins - otherwise the player whose Hound captures the Fox wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
