			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 40 x 20 inch, two level, full color battlemap of a Tavern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT) and include a 360 degree view of the inside of the Tavern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Thy wickedness will be thy undoing, ye of noble blood tainted black by the vileness that oozes from thy heart. Just one cut will reveal this to all, but only a thousand cuts could slay a slithering snake such as thyself.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Victoreaux, hero of the play, Cut the Wicked a Thousand Ways&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Phoenix Tavern is where careers come back from the ashes! As well as drunks rising from their night's revelries!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Phoenix Tavern is a two floor map of the interior of a tavern suitable for a medieval or renaissance era with an exterior city street in front shown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Phoenix Tavern is suitable for use in fantasy, medieval, or renaissance eras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Troupe of Heroes: A traveling troupe is performing a play based on a group of heroes that slay an evil noble. A noble in town has been told that the evil noble in the play bears an uncanny likeness to him. He has decided to stay the night at theThe Phoenix Tavern, observe the play from the second floor and confirm the truth of this rumor. If true, he has already drafted a decree to arrest the troupe and have them executed the next day at high noon by guillotine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The troupe is mostly performers; however, the group also includes actual heroes (the player characters) performing a masquerade to assassinate the character of the noble. Playing on his vanity, they hope the play brings him out of his fortified manor to where he is vulnerable and can atone for his wicked treatment of his servants. With the stage set, the heroes must figure out a way to sneak out of the performance area, get through the noble&amp;rsquo;s royal guards and get to the noble to challenge him to a duel. The noble refuses and attempts to flee out a second story window when cornered this way. In his haste to escape, he may lose the parchment with the decree written on it, and tip off the group to his plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the noble makes it out alive, he has his soldiers arrest the troupe, forcing the heroes to try and stop their execution the next day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
