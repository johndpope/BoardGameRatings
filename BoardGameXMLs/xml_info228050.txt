							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tree Golem</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The art of golem crafting does not belong solely to mages and dwarves, working with dead stone away from prying eyes.. In fact, the Forgotten Druids of the Vale developed a technique of crafting golems from living plants. Considered more reliable than taming elementals, this process created servants who might guard sacred locations, or defend children well into adulthood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trouble is, the Forgotten Druids may be forgotten, but their golems stayed behind. And unlike their stone cousins, they continue to grow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the forest they were originally protecting still stands, these golems will stay out of harms way. But if it was destroyed in a forest fire or logging operation, they might wander until they find a landscape which looks more familiar - even if their path takes them through a populated city. And since many of these creatures now tower above the trees horizon, they can become a problem which only brave adventurers can solve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
