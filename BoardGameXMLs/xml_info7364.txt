			<description>NBC Game of the Week Baseball is a card-driven game using a simple chart, spinners, and a gridded gameboard / playing field to determine the result of each play. Each team selects a batting line-up from the two identical teams of individually-rated players (&amp;quot;.210 medium left,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;.300 heavy right,&amp;quot; etc). The team in the field positions its players on the grid. The &amp;quot;pitcher&amp;quot; throws one of the ten blue &amp;quot;pitch&amp;quot; cards he holds at the same time the &amp;quot;batter&amp;quot; throws one of the seven red &amp;quot;hit&amp;quot; cards he holds. The two cards are indexed against the chart featured on the board. If the chart indicates the ball has been hit, the &amp;quot;distance&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;direction&amp;quot; spinners are used to indicate exactly where the ball has been hit. If that indication is the white dot of the grid on which a fielder is stationed, or an immediately adjacent dot, the out is made. Otherwise, it's a base hit, and extra bases depending on how far it is away from a fielder. There are additional rules for base runner advance, double plays, force outs, sacrifices, hit-&amp;amp;-run, pick-offs, and errors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
