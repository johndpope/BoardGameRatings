							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">13 Nano Augmentors</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology is a topic about which very little is known. The potential appears to be endless, but the execution is currently sorely lacking. That being said, wouldn?t it be cool if we could all just be injected with some little machines that makes us faster, stronger, healthier, etc.?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In that vein, albeit focused more on combat and adventuring, this 7-page PDF by Michael Hammes presents thirteen nanoaugmenters designed to give PCs the edge over their opponents (assuming their opponents don?t also have nanoaugmenters). They are written in the style, and to the standard, set forth in the standard rules and are ready to plug-and-play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
