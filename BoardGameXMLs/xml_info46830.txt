							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Excellent Prismatic Spray (Volume 1, Number 2)</name>
									
			<description>Being a Commodious Compendium of erudition, intelligence, advice, narrative and insight of inestimable value to those of a DISCERNING TEMPERAMENT and ADVENTUROUS INCLINATION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the cover:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Erudite readers will note that while we have adopted a magazine format, the cunningly bound volume is actually a timeless resource for the Role Player.  The magazine format merely allows us to be more flexible in the material we use, enabling us to shun the formulaic approach that dogs so many other game supplements.  Within these pages you will find a range of material which, whilst obviously designed for Jack Vance's Dying Earth, will enliven any fantasy role-playing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have a scenario from the pen of Robin D. Laws, Gary Gygax on how the work of Jack Vance shaped his approach to writing of Role Playing Games, and Phil Masters in person has provided some interesting Tweaks to enable you to get the best from the rules.  We also provide much else that is useful.  Turgubut's Fatal Statistics shows what might happen when spells are mis-cast.  Steven S. Long's The Three Golden Swans describes a hostelry that will prove immensely useful in any setting.  And in the Cozener's Expedients shrewd locals try to trick the party, separating them from their hard-earned money or (in extreme cases) their lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buy this indispensible supplement now! For after many years of good service you will pass it on to your grateful grandchildren who will likewise treasure it as an irreplaceable resource.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
