			<description>A free Print and Play game ruthlessly taking the deck building mechanism from Dominion, Ascension, Resident Evil etc. However instead of a bleak and bleary fantasy world, players take the roles of football (soccer) team managers and build their club up to challenge for league glory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buy in squad players, build stadium improvements, get yourself a feeder team, hire physios, coaches and an assistant manager as you develop your squad to become the best it can be and take on the best teams in the league!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Managers start with a small deck of cards consisting of a few average players and some money. On their turn a manager can use the money to buy new items from a selection available and they can turn to their players to play games against a dozen different teams, some stronger than others. Over the course of the game, the manager's club (their hand of cards) will grow bigger and stronger, allowing them to compete against and beat the stronger opposition teams in the game. Build For The Title is all about building a strong and streamlined club that is capable of beating everyone in their way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
