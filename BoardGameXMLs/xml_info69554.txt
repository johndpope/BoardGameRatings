			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delta was Thalamus' second game for the C64, also programmed by Stavros Fasoulas. Delta is a horisontal shooter with 40 short stages, with a power-up system similar to that of Gradius. By shooting down a whole squadron of enemies, the player got a &amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;, and the more &amp;quot;credits&amp;quot; the played had when the &amp;quot;bonus block area&amp;quot; arrived, the higher bonus weapon the player could take. Un-lit bonus weapon blocks were treated as walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The title and game music was written by Rob Hubbard, where the title music was inspired by the music from the movie &amp;quot;Koyaanisqatsi&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;Stavros Fasoulas: Design, programming&lt;br/&gt;Rob Hubbard: Music&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
