			<description>Zig Zag is a racing game using shared pieces but with the players having hidden goals.  Each player is given a card that shows the order in which they want the pieces to finish the race.  During the game, players take turns moving the three coloured markers on the game board.  A turn consists of moving any piece on the board.  The space on which this piece lands will dictate the next piece to move, and how.  This continues until the forced movement is impossible, and then the next player takes a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when two pieces make it to the finish line.  The player holding the results card showing the order of finish wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
