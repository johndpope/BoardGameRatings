							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vampsylvania</name>
									
			<description>You're a newbie vampire in the most vamp-hostile town on Earth! A fast-paced competitive card &amp;amp; dice game for 3-6 players ages 10 &amp;amp; up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vampsylvania is a card and dice game set in a lighthearted world of monsters and mayhem. In Vampsylvania, you&amp;rsquo;re a newly-risen vampire ready to take the world by the throat. Unfortunately, you&amp;rsquo;ve risen in the most vampire-savvy place on Earth. Hunting here isn&amp;rsquo;t gonna be easy. The villagers are tough, and they&amp;rsquo;re loaded with anti-vamp weapons, skills, and allies. And to make matters worse, your fellow vamps keep trying to sabotage you, too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is pretty simple. Each round&amp;mdash;which we call a Hunt&amp;mdash;a new Villager is revealed. Players compete to capture the Villager by playing bonuses on themselves to raise their Vamp score, which increases their chances of capturing a Villager. But players can also complicate things for other each other. Spoiler cards can be used to lower a player&amp;rsquo;s Vamp score, or even take a player out completely&amp;hellip;for now, anyway. Some spoilers make Villagers tougher, which makes things harder for everyone, but if you think you alone have the cards to pull it off, it might be just the edge you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once everyone has played their cards, everyone rolls dice and adds the result to their Vamp score; if you get a high enough score, you capture the villager! Capture enough Villagers, and you win the game. Don&amp;rsquo;t get cocky, though. Villagers will often escape the Hunt without being captured, and end up in the Angry Mob pile. If enough Villagers end up in the Angry Mob, all the players lose and the Villagers win! Like we said, winning here isn&amp;rsquo;t gonna be easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
