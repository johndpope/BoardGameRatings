							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chuck Mallard</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Not His World. He Just Has To Live In It.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Look, it&amp;rsquo;s tough to be a Duck in a Human&amp;rsquo;s world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chuck Mallard was just a magazine layout artist on the planet of Avair&amp;hellip; until Secundus the Sun Eater consumed it and the Antiquitarian saved Chuck as a relic of a lost world. Of course Chuck made friends with the other&amp;hellip; collectables&amp;hellip; on the Antiquitarian&amp;rsquo;s ship. And when the Antiquitarian collected a few women from earth&amp;hellip;. who happened to include a few superpowered heroines and Kimberly &amp;ldquo;Kimmy&amp;rdquo; Neumeyer, Chuck was sure to help them in their breakout. And he and Kimmy become chummy. So he joined her, on Earth. Now Chuck and Kimmy are trying to live their life&amp;hellip; in-between the insane hijinks. One day Chuck is winning the lottery, only to have his winnings eaten by extra-dimensional termites. Then he is whisked off with Recluse, trying to save the world from an army of infernal minotaurs. Chuck has been an animal control officer, an adult film actor, and even a Congressional candidate, in his search to find a place on Earth. Recently, he has settled on becoming a private investigator. And, currently, Chuck is trying to find a way to afford a wedding for him and Kimmy&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powered Legends. Because sometimes what you need is a character everyone will recognize, even if they&amp;rsquo;ve never met her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
