							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Korg: 70,000 B.C. Game</name>
									
			<description>The game is based on the lives of Neanderthals. In the game teams must find all of the items they need to survive. Among these items are food, water and weapons. The hunt must be performed in teams of two. The game becomes tricky when one source of water or food that is normally available is dried up. Teams must quickly determine an alternate source.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best way to win the game is to find and secure water and food first. Drying up resources will force the their team to have to go further out to secure the same basics. This will then allow you time to gather the minor items, while they are still searching for basic resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
