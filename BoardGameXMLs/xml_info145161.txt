			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edan of Peskil is an experienced and highly skilled woodturner. He is known throughout Lenedshire in Melderyn for his functional and highly decorative products, from bowls to chairs. Although Edan&amp;rsquo;s designs are utilitarian, they are finely finished and blemish free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This article is a location expansion intended for use with &amp;ldquo;Clord Manor&amp;rdquo; article in the HârnManor module (COL #4751). It describes the master woodcrafter and his establishment. Full color plans of the building are included, along with several adventure hooks the GM can use to bring the location into play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
