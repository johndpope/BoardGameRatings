			<description>Splurge is an exciting game of skill and fortune for 2 to 6 players.  It incorporates in a single board game a number of famous and popular dice and card games (poker, blackjack, craps, etc...).  Each player attempts to win by a combination of plays on the board and successful side-betting with other players in the game.  The game is ended when one player gets both his tokens to the finish, and the winner is the player who has accumulated the most money at that time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
