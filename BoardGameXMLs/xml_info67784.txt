			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instant adventure for 4-6 characters levels 3-5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When traveling along the northern frontier, you're always prepared for the worst.  But the bitter storm that blew in from the mountains seemed to come out of nowhere, and the bleak landscape offers little protection from the harsh wind, blinding snow, and biting cold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you discovered the small vale and quiet village, it seemed like a godsend.  A roof over your head, a warm fire, and hearty food have all served to banish the memory of the storm, though you can still hear the wind howling outside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Thoruke have lived in peace in their isolated vale for many years.  They are an unusual people, with smoky gray skin and rather severe features that are quite at odds with their calm and cheerful demeanors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's more to the Thoruke than meets the eye, though.  You're sure of it.  What secrets hide behind those dark, lively eyes?  What painful memory lies buried here?  What great tragedy has befallen these simple people that weighs so heavily on their spirits?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their stories speak of the wrath of an old enemy, of the vengeance of a dark goddess.  Outside, the wind and snow still lash the simple timber lodgings of the village.  But you wonder...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is there another storm coming?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
