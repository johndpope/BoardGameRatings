			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meet the irrepressible Brenna McIntyre, senior student of the School of Seven Stars and Brother Spark of the Black Lanterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given that our Brother is in a place of magic, he chose to err on the side of caution and not file his reports in the normal way. Instead, she sends letters home to her &amp;quot;parents&amp;quot; and other family with no one the wiser that the family she writes too is us. Her reports seem innocuous but she's provided us a great deal of information on the names and locations of these schools along with the types of magic you'll likely find being practised.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She's also provided us with the names and abilities of several of her teachers along with a number of new spells, applications and items that an up and coming sorcerer can use to remember certain types of spells better or enhance one of their senses or abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll find what you need to develop a history for a character or NPC  that includes these schools, what a person would study there and how their days are structured. You'll aslo find some new magic items, gear, edges, powers, spells and applications too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
