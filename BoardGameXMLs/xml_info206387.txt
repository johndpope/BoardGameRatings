							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Contagion Survival Guide 1.25: Improvised Weapons for Contagion</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now just to clear a few things up before we get started. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t written because the loveable furry character needed a spin off. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t done because the actor with the dwindling career needed to get his name out there one more time. And this wasn&amp;rsquo;t done because &amp;ldquo;I wanted to give my vision full clarity&amp;rdquo;. It was written because there a lot of damn whiners and know it all&amp;rsquo;s out there. &amp;ldquo;Hey Dan, you forgot this...&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Hey Dan, what about that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re right sparky, I didn&amp;rsquo;t list everything you could fight a person with. Know why? Because that list would be impossibly long. Next thing you know it&amp;rsquo;s going to be my responsibility to pick out your clothes and tie your shoes. You want me to feed you too? Jerks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the list of things I&amp;rsquo;m giving you is some of the more relevant things that people used in their (mis) adventures. This is a strange ass world we live in so this list is all over the place. Some are useful. Some come with tales of woe. Really, as with all things, its buyer beware. For you trigger happy gun types I didn&amp;rsquo;t include any firearms. In the initial Survival Guide, I did a damn fine job on modern weapons if I do say so. If you guys really REALLY want muskets and black powder rifles, let me know. It&amp;rsquo;s stupid, but I&amp;rsquo;m a slave to my craft and I&amp;rsquo;ll do it. I&amp;rsquo;m sure some nut in West Virginia is out there hunting the supernatural with a rifle that uses black powder. Bunch of damn weirdo&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh and I may or may not have a Survival Guide 2.0. Thing is, I have all sorts of good solid info to pass on. I have a few friends to help me too. Why should I tell you the ins and outs about drugs when a customer of mine who runs a drug ring and can give you the full monty. I can tell you about weapons and gear. Drugs, fast cars, faster women, street magic and homelessness. Those are subjects best left to a few experts that I know. So there may or may not be something cooking in that regard. And then do I call it &amp;lsquo;Survival Guide 2.0&amp;rsquo;? Do I find a better name? Hell, I don&amp;rsquo;t know. I guess time will tell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So anyway, here you go. Survival Guide 1.25&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
