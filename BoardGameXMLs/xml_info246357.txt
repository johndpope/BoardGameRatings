							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes of Normandie: South Lancashire Regiment</name>
									
			<description>A fan-made 'Print &amp;amp; Play' punchboard that expands the Commonwealth Army of Heroes of Normandie. Made by Devil Pig's Games French forum moderator, GDuprez. Approved by Devil Pig Games' Yann and Clem as an 'official product'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; one regular recruitment tile of the South Lancashire Regiment (3rd Infantry Division, 8th Infantry Brigade, 1st Battalion) with its recruitment options (Vickers Platoon, Fire Platoon, Bren Platoon).&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; one High Command Recruitment Tile with Lt.Col. Gordon Duffin and his 'Artillery Spotter' ability.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; a few common Commonwealth units: a Daimler Armoured Car, a 6 Pounder AT Gun and a Sergeant NCO.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; a few other options &lt;br/&gt;______________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quoting GDuprez, January 2018:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;As you know, during the past months the Pigs have been extremely busy (that&amp;rsquo;s putting it mildly): finalization of the card game KS as well as that of Age of Towers, add to that of course, the creation of Black Reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, since HoN and SoN were lying somewhat dormant, I tried to create units, tiles, markers and other options. Thanks to Clem and Yann who generously gave precious advice and granted access to the rich graphic library of Devil Pig, I have been equipped with both intel and means to embark on this adventure which is in all quite new to me.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
