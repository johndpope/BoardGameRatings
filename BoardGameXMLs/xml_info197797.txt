			<description>Can you run a successful hotel even though the world has ended? Repair, renovate, and decorate the &amp;lsquo;Apocalypse Hotel&amp;rsquo; while fending off zombies, mutants and the alien Gogfang!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the alien invasion: the Gogfang began terraforming Earth, pumping out toxic chemicals to transform it into the perfect trans-dimensional, methane paradise&amp;hellip; the process should take fifty years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the meantime the strange blend of chemicals has begun to mutate the populace, turning some into hideous, fish-people, and reanimating the dead. So far you have been immune to these changes and have fought your way across the country back to your parents&amp;rsquo; hotel, hoping they are still alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether they are or not, you have decided to make a go of it, to repair and renovate their unsightly, sixties-styled hotel into a community where people can be safe from the aliens, mutants, and zombies. Of course&amp;hellip; they will have to pay you for the service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
