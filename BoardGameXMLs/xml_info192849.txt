			<description>Fleet Commander: Avatar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the conflict between the &amp;quot;League of Phoebe&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Hegemony of Amycles&amp;quot; intensified, great leaders emerged to impose their views of warfare. Some of them earned their leadership by their zeal, their determination, or their ingenuity -- while others simply took power from their defeated opponents. However, one thing nobody dares to contest, is that each of them has their own distinct advantage to lead these huge fleets to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avatar is an expansion for ''Fleet Commander: Genesis'' that will allow players to add to their fleet the heavy battleships and commanders which give bonuses during any battle. It also contains new terrain tiles and special weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
