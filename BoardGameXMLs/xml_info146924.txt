			<description>(from Clash of Arms website:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mediterranean Fleets includes over 150 ships and 90 aircraft! For the first time the Admiralty Trilogy covers the Greek, Turkish and Yugoslavian Navies. Previous listings of Italian ships and aircraft have been updated with information from many new reference sources (including Italian naval experts in Italy who were consulted and graciously shared information that resolved many questions a number of issues caused by limited English references. Fire control Gunnery accuracy and ASW capabilities especially benefitted from their assistance).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All data and information has been updated to Command at Sea 4th edition standard. More than just making the information compatible with Command at Sea, this data is now in the same format as &amp;quot;Harpoon&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Fear God and Dreadnought&amp;quot;, the other core games in the Admiralty Trilogy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All ships and aircraft extant from 1939 to 1945, including several projected or hypothetical platforms are here; such as the projected Italian aircraft carriers, the Turkish Batiray mine laying submarine, and the Italian G.55/II Centauro fighter and the Piaggo P.108 bomber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
