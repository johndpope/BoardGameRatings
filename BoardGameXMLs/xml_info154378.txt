			<description>This trivia game was created as a project of Geary Elementary School to celebrate the bicentennial of the Canadian province of New Brunswick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 130 trivia cards covering 5 different categories:  Tourist Attractions, Bygone Days, Famous People, Travelogue and Hodge Podge.  Each card contains 4 questions, for a total of 520 questions.  The game also comes with a single standard 6-sided die and single page of instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No specific age range or number of players is specified.  The instructions suggest playing as individuals or teams, while playing to one of two possible win conditions:&lt;br/&gt;- After each correct answer, roll the die and score that many points.  The first individual or team to 50 points wins.  &lt;br/&gt;OR&lt;br/&gt;- The letters in the words &amp;quot;NEW BRUNSWICK&amp;quot; are assigned numerical values from 1 to 6, as follows: &amp;quot;123 456123456&amp;quot;.  Thus the number 2 is assigned to the &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; of &amp;quot;NEW&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; of &amp;quot;BRUNSWICK&amp;quot;.  After each correct answer, roll the die and acquire the corresponding letters in the words &amp;quot;NEW BRUNSWICK&amp;quot;.  The first player to spell the words &amp;quot;NEW BRUNSWICK&amp;quot; wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
