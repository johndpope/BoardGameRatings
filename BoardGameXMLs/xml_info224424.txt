			<description>August 1994 - Making their premier at GenCon '94 in clear plastic packages, not that which we know them in today.  Many new concepts were brought in this set.  First and most obvious, Ravenloft became the 4th world to formally join Spellfire.  This Set also gave us the first werebeasts (Loup Garou, Sir Heirgaard, etc) and the first real undead (sorry, but 4 allies and one champion from the first Edition set don't qualify to me).  Also, some new game concepts came up.  First, we got the concept of Limbo from two cards (Strahd Von Zarovich [#100] and Ring of Reversion [#63]).  Also, this set gave us the first arguement that created the Order of Activation (The question, if you care, was that of Midnight, Goddess of Magic vs. the Ring of Reversion).  Finally, we had one more type of new card: The Rule Card.  There were only 3, but rule cards are such a core concept now, it's wierd to think of not having them.  Also, this is the only set printed to date that was not printed with chase of any sort.  Landmark Cards: Dementilieu (#11); Quirk of Fate (#26); City States (#30); Conjure Grave Elemental (#35); Tarokka Deck (#56); Ring of Reversion (#63); Flesh Golems (#73); Loup Garou (#79); Headless Horseman (#88); and Strahd Von Zarovich (#100).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
