			<description>Guess Who&amp;rsquo;s Coming to Dinner is a fun and zany party game in which players try to arrange celebrities at restaurant tables. Due to the fact that the cards become obsolete in a few years, if not months, and that a different version would be needed not only for each language, but for each country, it will never be published, so I have published it as a downloadable pdf on this website. Of course, the cards are for a French version, but if anyone finds the idea fun enough and wants to make a US version (or a version for any other country), he is welcome to do it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
