							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hypergate Centurion; Hypergate Patrol</name>
									
			<description>Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the Hypergate Centurion, the guardian of the gateway to other galaxies. It is your sworn duty to protect the friendly military and cargo spaceships as they transit the hypergate. You carry out your mission nestled deep within the core of the Centurion Base Asteroid. You have at your disposal the centurion computer, a powerful plasma disruptor weapon, and a small but efficient fleet of patrol ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a simple hand-eye coordination shoot'um down, but a highly sophisticated real time simulation requiring learned mental skills of decision and judgement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some features of Hypergate Centurion are: a cast of fifty different objects displayed in detail; four skill levels, from trainee to master; five quarrelsome alliances; and a detailed, thirty-two page instruction manual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Hypergate Patrol, you command a Hypergate Patrol Ship. You must contend with most of the same situations from Hypergate Centurion on a grueling ship to ship basis. The Centurion on Duty assigns you various missions; from rescuing stranded spacecraft to harpooning huge space monsters. You must also master the technique of hypergate navigation so that you can patrol the galaxies of the Local Super Cluster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an intense, one-player, stop-action strategy simulation. It is written in BASIC but uses Machine Language subroutines for the explosion scenes and sound effects. Hypergate Patrol contains excellent action sounds and action graphics, four weapon types, numerous command options, and a multitude of combat and navigational aids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
