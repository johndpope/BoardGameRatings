			<description>Subtitle: A World of Grim and Gritty Survival Resting in the Shadow of Eternal Chaos&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;The Rising Dark: an Introduction to Agraphar is an experiment in creative setting design. The premise of this book is to provide a sandbox-style setting for use with the 4th edition ruleset that is designed to serve as a useful guide and toolbox of plot ideas for game masters interested in a world and campaign environment that offers just enough detail to provide a useful backdrop to his or her adventures, but not so much detail that the setting proves overwhelming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume looks at an overview of the world and its denizens, as well as a gazetteer in two part: being the broad northwestern region of Tariach, and the more detailed northern province of Aruthain, as well as a variety of plot and encounter suggestions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you would like to see more material set in the world of Agraphar, write the author and let him know!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
