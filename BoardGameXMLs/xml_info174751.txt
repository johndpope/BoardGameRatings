							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Five Elements</name>
									
			<description>The era of this world is coming to a close. Before the planet collapses, we need you to extract the essence of the Five Elements so we can rebuild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game revolves around the idea of the Elemental Cycle: when elemental energies are used, rather than being depleted, they just change state.&lt;br/&gt;Fire burns things, leaving only Earth.&lt;br/&gt;Earth pours out springs of Water.&lt;br/&gt;Water evaporates and becomes Wind.&lt;br/&gt;Wind blows in storms with Lightning.&lt;br/&gt;Lightning strikes and creates Fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game's defining feature is the use of the &amp;quot;dice progression&amp;quot; mechanic. Each die has the five elements on a different face, with an arrow pointing to the next element in the cycle. During the game, the dice will be rotated, following the arrows, through the cycle of elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use your dice to obtain cards, which in turn help you build clever combos to manipulate your dice even more. Align your dice and cards to get essence tokens. Whoever can collect essence of all Five Elements wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
