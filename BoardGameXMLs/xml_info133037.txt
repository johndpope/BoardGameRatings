			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;quot;We're very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries, David and Nigel, they're like poets, like Shelley and Byron. They're two distinct types of visionaries, it's like fire and ice, basically. I feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that, kind of like lukewarm water.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;mdash; Derek Smalls, &amp;quot;This is Spinal Tap&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One Night Only is a roleplaying game about second chances. The characters are all ex-members of a musical group that has found success in the past, but then broken up. However, they have managed to arrange one last chance at fame; a reunion concert. Will they be able put their differences behind them, and restart their careers? Or will all the old conflicts resurface, dooming their revival?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the course of the game, the players will explore the reasons the group broke up, how it has affected their characters, and whether they will be able to start again. They will attempt to resolve their past conflicts, and try to restart the passion and motivation that made them join the group in the first place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play, you will need 2 to 4 friends, pencil and paper, and a bunch of six-sided dice (or d6). One Night Only is a GM-less game. This means that everyone is a player, and no-one needs to prepare the game in advance. Instead, the players will be creating the game as they go. That said, it will require at least one player to be familiar with the rules before starting play. It is recommended that you read through the whole document before beginning play. Don't worry, it's short!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
