			<description>Meow&amp;hellip; meow&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;Aww, there's so many cute kittens that need to be adopted in Math Cat! But they are only interested to a person who bring their favourite stuff and number (yeah because it's a game of math of course). As a cat lover, you can attract their attention with different kind of lures that you have. Just be cautious that you are not the only one who interested in adopting these cats!&lt;br/&gt;So, are you ready to adopt these adorable creatures....with Math?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is simple, you as a cat lover trying to adopt a cat by giving them a lure card that has a number on them. When the lure card(s) in play can be calculated equal to the number on the Cat Card, you deserve to adopt that adorable cat. The game ends when no lure card or no cat card can be acquired. The player who collected the most Cats is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's also a speed mode which your speed of counting is tested among your peers...but be careful, you must maintain your manner if you don't want those adorable cats run off from you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
