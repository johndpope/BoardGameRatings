			<description>from Branham translation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many thousand meters above the surface of the earth lives the people of the cloud platforms. These people build graceful floating platforms in the sky, and castles on the clouds. The builders of the most beautiful cloud castles gain great privilege and respect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Often, however, their contests made very difficult by inclement weather. Strong rains and sudden storms take a heavy toll on lives and the castles themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: Whoever manages to complete 3 cloud castles. (With 2-3 players, 4 cloud castles) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
