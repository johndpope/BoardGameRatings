			<description>Asterix &amp;amp; Obelix XXL 2: Mission Wifix is an Action-adventure game for the PlayStation Portable and the Nintendo DS, sequel of Asterix &amp;amp; Obelix XXL. It is a remake of Asterix &amp;amp; Obelix XXL 2: Mission Las Vegum. It revolves around the same plot, with added touch screen minigames, and Wi-Fi.&lt;br/&gt;The game is a sidescroller through a 3D world. It uses almost all of the same elements as the console version. The player can switch between Asterix and Obelix at any time. Almost every room from the console version is recreated with its hundreds of parodies of many video game series. Occasionally the player must complete touch-screen mini-games throughout the story which can also be played outside of the main adventure mode.&lt;br/&gt;The game takes the player through such places like Little Paris, WCW, LuckSore, Little Venetia, Pirate Island, and even SeizeUs Palace with each room being created in great detail. The game was considered fun and interesting by users receiving a score of 87 from 47 user ratings on Gamespot.com&lt;br/&gt;The main drawback noted by users was that the game could become repetitive after some time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Asterix &amp;amp; Obelix XXL 2: Mission: Wifix&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
