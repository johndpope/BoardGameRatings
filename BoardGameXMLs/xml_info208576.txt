							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Road to Calemma Vol. 1</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looking for adventure along the vast stretch of road known to all as the Kings&amp;rsquo; Road seemed like a marvelous type of road trip.  But what started off as a good idea to several hard on their luck adventurers, turns into the most mundane wagon ride through the middle of nowhere.  There are two wagons, some armed guards, and a few wagon hands and drivers.  The second wagon carries a party of who-knows-what.  You haven&amp;rsquo;t spoken to them at all during the trip.  The only time you saw them was when everyone loaded up for the trip, and that was for a brief second.  They were dressed in black robes, and haven&amp;rsquo;t come out at all during the entire journey.  You figure it has to smell to high heaven in there.  The wagon hands and drivers aren&amp;rsquo;t much of roadside entertainers either.  Lewd, predictable jokes, and stale ale are all they have to offer as road rations are handed out for meals.  The guards are well armed for some reason, and you try to figure out the amount paid for the trip, and how much it cost for the protection.  Seems like someone did some bad math.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And then there is a halt in the middle of the day.  Broken wagon wheel?  Nope.  Arrows, lots of arrows, and fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seems like the middle of nowhere CAN provide some adventuring after all&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
