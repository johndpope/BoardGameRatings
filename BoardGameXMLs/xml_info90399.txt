							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mana Khemia 2: Fall of Alchemy</name>
									
			<description>The Fall of Al-Revis Academy...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Al-Revis Academy...The greatest alchemy institute which lies atop a floating land in the sky. It is known for producing most of the greatest alchemists in the world.&lt;br/&gt;However, in recent years...The academy hasn't lived up to its reputation, due to a decline in quality teachers.&lt;br/&gt;To make matters worse, there has been a steady decrease in the power of Mana throughout the world. The Academy, which was held up in the sky by the power of Mana, fell to the ground.  Because of this, the Academy was renovated around a new school system. They expanded their teachings to other subjects, such as combat, government, and law. This major change spurred a negative reaction in some people, but the number of applicants increased dramatically. Meanwhile, two particular students enrolled at the Academy. One was a boy with a drak past with Mana. He was dragged there by a girl who he has served since childhood. The other was a girl from a small village. She came to obtain a Mana, but has almost no knowledge of alchemy. Will they cross paths during their busy campus lives, and how will they spent their time...?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
