							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Avara</name>
									
			<description>Avara is a 1996 computer action game made by Ambrosia Software for the Apple Macintosh. A fast, fluid true 3D engine, integrated Internet play, and extremely easy level editing were notable features at the time of its release. Although the graphics and gameplay are primitive by today's standards, Avara had extraordinarily low system requirements, and enjoyed a dedicated cult following.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, you control a robotic fighting machine known as H.E.C.T.O.R. (a thinly-guised tribute to Hector the Office Parrot).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Avara&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
