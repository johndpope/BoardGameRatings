							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Road to Madness: NCAA Basketball</name>
									
			<description>Road to Madness is a print &amp;amp; play, solitaire statistical replay game on College Basketball, featuring individual yearbooks with data for all Division I teams and also for the entire NCAA Tournament brackets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team is rated for offense and defense and the game is resolved comparing the opposing team values and rolling a couple of 6-sided dice on a Result table, with modifiers given by a random die modifier, that could be activated or not activated at all, according to real performance during the season or the tournament (a team with a winning record has more chance to activate the random modifier than a team with a losing record, but there is the possibility to the underdog to win a match).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As most of TCS Games sport design, the game privileges easiness and speed of play than deepness and strategy (is a solo game after all, and the player takes both sides, so he doesn't have to make any decision).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two yearbooks available till now: 1977/78 and 1978/79&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
