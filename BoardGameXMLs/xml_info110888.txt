							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Skull Kick</name>
									
			<description>The Grim Reaper sets the rules in this graveyard but Skully, an adorable undead creature, toys around after hours by kicking his head!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Skull Kick you help Skully kick his head and bounce it as far as you can. As Skully's head bounces various graves it encounters either make his head bounce further, bounce higher, earn some rare power ups, or stops it in place! Touch the screen to control how fast the head falls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Local and Online leaderboards will test your skills in the graveyard against yourself and your friends! Dress up Skully with different outfits (and personalities).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How much kick is there to your game? Can you beat the reaper?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
