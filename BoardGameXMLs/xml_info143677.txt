			<description>In Wash Out, players are trying to collect cards that depict the clothes hanging on their clothes line. They need to match both color and style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is for 3-6, but the rules say 4 is best. The game is setup with each player sitting in front of a clothesline they wish to use for the game (these are depicted on the board). Then a number of clothespins equal to the number of players, minus 1, is put in the center of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn players will be looking at their hand of five cards, quickly, and passing one of them to the left after playing any that apply to themselves. The rules state this whole process should be done &amp;quot;as rapidly as possible and may be done as noisily as desired.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has the cards that depicts their clothesline, they quietly remove a clothespin from the center. Then all other players may do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is repeated 5 times and end scoring determines the winner. Scoring is based on clothespins and number of cards completing their clothesline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
