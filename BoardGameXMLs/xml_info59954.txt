			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Queensguard! Queensguard is a short campaign for the Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game. It is set in an alternate version of America in which steam technology and magic are woven into the fabric of society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Queensguard is divided into two acts, each of which should consume approximately two four-hour game sessions. The campaign strives to be consistently fast-paced and exciting, and it takes advantage of the unusual setting. Investigation, clever planning, and physical combat are all important. For a plotted scenario, Queensguard grants players a large degree of freedom. Key tasks within each act may be completed in any order, frequent Contingency sections help the keeper adapt the plot to varied player choices, and players may succeed or fail in Act 1 without foreclosing opportunities in Act 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four-session campaign detailed in this book need not be the end of your adventures in the Kingdom of America. A substantial amount of information about the politics, history, technology, and magic of the setting is provided in the next chapter, A Tour of the World of Queensguard. The two campaign chapters contain many additional ideas and characters. Using this information and a little creativity, Queensguard can be a steampunk setting for Call of Cthulhu adventures of your own devising.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
