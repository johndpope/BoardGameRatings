							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Amityville Project: Lethargos</name>
									
			<description>Saturday the 27th, 1964&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is been 14 days since the detective was lost in the Amytiville Asylum and no one knowns anything about his disappearance. The members of the Syndicate trapped him and made him their lab pet. All this time, they try to reform his mind but they do not know that another group of people was watching his moves and knows what he wanted to achieve. On the side of the city this team plans to rescue the detective. A couple days later, the team tries to penetrate the Amytiville Asylum and they achieve it. They found the detective tied on a bed, drugged and they save him from his torture. Thanks to their plan, they managed to take him and transfer them to their hiding. There, the mastermind of the team has a plan. He has built a dangerous device capable of entering the detective's mind. The team agrees that they will try to awake the detective from his Lethargos but they must first come to same state as the detective through the new device and there is a high possibility that they will die from the pressure their minds will suffer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Lethargos you lead the members of the team trying to find information and awake the detective. You enter to his dream asylum and there you have to face several Ghosts, trapped memories of the detective inside his own mind which try to kill you but occasionally to help you. The Ghosts which own several abilities, are managed by an extra player who takes the role of the detective. Your purpose here is to open the 6 of the 12 Asylum Tiles and then to find the real exit in order to escape. When the last tile is revealed, several walls and one real exit are placed around the tiles and you must find the real one. If one of the team reaches the real exit, then all the team escapes the dream world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round the players follow some certain actions: Movement and Search. Each player can move 1 space inside an Asylum Tile and can search the different rooms on that tile by drawing cards. These cards give different abilities which allow to the players to reveal new Asylum Tiles and trap the Ghost. At the end of each player's turn the Detective-Player rolls a special 6-sided die and based on the result he can activate a Ghost and hit a player. The Detective-Player handles an Event Deck and activates such a card for each new revealed Asylum Tile and he also owns the Phobometer. The Phobometer includes several numbers and each time a Ghost hits a Player, the Phobometer is increased. If the Phobo token reaches the last number, then you lose the game. In this game all the players must work together in order to survive and escape the Detective's Dream World. Be prepared to face your worst living nightmare!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fear is your only god!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
