							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Covert Ops Core Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a war going on every day. Its soldiers don&amp;rsquo;t march in lines or report to a large obvious pentagonal building. It is a shadow war where information and bullets hold equal weight, and enemies don&amp;rsquo;t always wear uniforms. This game is about clandestine Special Forces parachuting behind enemy lines to carry out a discrete mission that no government will claim ever happened. It is about special agents receiving their missions from men and women whose names and identities won&amp;rsquo;t turn up on any database. It is about mercenaries. It is about spies. It is about secrets, seduction, stealth, deception, assassination, bribery, infiltration, action, and adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Covert Ops, a role playing game of espionage and paramilitary adventure. This game takes advantage of the d00Lite system, a fast and simple set of game mechanics created by DwD Studios. Those of you familiar with BareBones Fantasy RPG will find the core mechanics familiar and the learning curve minimal.  Those unfamiliar with our fantasy offering will find a game that somehow manages to be comprehensive, lite, and fun all in a tiny 6&amp;quot;x9&amp;quot; package.  Everyone is sure to have a fun time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
