							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Loot Ninja</name>
									
			<description>Loot Ninja is a fast-paced dexterity/puzzle hybrid game in which players take on the role of adventurers vying for the supreme loot collection!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a backpack which they must attempt to fill as efficiently as possible with polyiamond &amp;quot;loot&amp;quot; tiles. Gameplay consists of players throwing dice at tiles in an attempt to grab the most desirable items before their so-called friends can get their grubby little paws on them! Proximity is the goal, but beware... some items have effects that can modify the layout or content of the loot drop!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
