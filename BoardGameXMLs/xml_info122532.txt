			<description>Elaborate game of chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before play, the game has to be assembled. When finished there will be a three-piece slide. At the top of the slide you place a ball. The ball will now trundle downwards, going from one part of the slide to another until it comes out at the end and on to the board. With luck, it will settle into one of the holes and the player scores points for where it has ended up. The winner would be the first to reach a pre-agreed total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This doesn't seem to have any skill at all. You cannot influence the speed of the ball so it is sheer luck where it ends up. However, I can see it having novelty value, especially for children. And it is rather beautiful to look at.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
