			<description>A Snooker-based game that needed to be 'made' by any interested gamer. It was self-published in a fanzine from the mid-eighties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards provide a variety of options open to a Snooker player when he comes to the table. When a player takes on a pot, cards are used to generate three decisions. The first card drawn will tell if the shot is Easy, Medium or Hard. The next card will give you the first digit of a two-digit number between 01 and 99. And the third card completes the number. Numerous charts and tables are required for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules allow for special events - a Foul Shot, a snooker, Bad Kicks, Getting out of a snooker and a choice of playing safely or riskily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
