			<description>From the cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On April 12, 1959, a stunned American public was first made aware of the terrifying truth of what science had wrought behind the Iron Curtain. It was on that fateful day a frightened free world first learned the Soviet Union had perfected the surgical know-how necessary to construct a two-headed canine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much as the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor had done a generation earlier, this one sudden, shocking event stirred all America to action, as the entire nation pulled together in an effort to close the gap in two-headed transplant technology. &amp;quot;Better two-headed than Red&amp;quot; became the credo of the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, as time wore on, many Americans-particularly young people-openly began to doubt the country's two-headed transplanting prowess. Indeed, many of the nation's youth questioned the inherent scientific value of being able to sew an extra head on household pets, and their growing disillusionment gave rise to the socially turbulent decade that was the 1960's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dissatisfied with their country's inability to deliver so much as a multi-headed hamster, the youth of America turned to the open road for kicks, and became a new breed of motorcycle-riding outlaws in the 1970s and 1980s. Fueled by high-octane hogs, free love, freer drugs, and rock 'n' roll music, these biker gangs began a relentless nationwide campaign of terrorizing normal folks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a new millennium dawns, the clash between the two-headed transplanting idealism of the past and the Harley Davidson rebellion of the present is inevitable. In this epic struggle, drink will flow, blood will spill, and the Victims of Circumstance will become frightened witnesses to the sheer, unadulterated horror of The Incredible 2-Headed Satan's Angels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
