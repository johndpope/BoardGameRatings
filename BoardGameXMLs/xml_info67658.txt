							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rooms &amp; Encounters: The Living Tomb</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trap door opens, dim light flickers and unearthly shadows bounce and reflect from every angle and you&amp;rsquo;re immediately assaulted by the foul stench of ancient rotting blood. A faint creaking sound comes from the ceiling above. As your eyes quickly adjust, you realize that the walls and ceiling of the room are covered in large mirrored panels set into a spidery framework of black lacquered bone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ceiling arches up in the center into a high dome, no less than twenty feet above the floor. Horrifically suspended in the middle is a large, ten-foot-radius, bone chandelier, with a most grisly center piece- a humanoid corpse entwined in cobwebs, hanging by its back from flesh hooks with its throat slit open laterally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Welcome&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo; it says calmly in a dry, toneless, non-sibilant voice, &amp;ldquo;I am Qomaq, welcome to my living tomb&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Under the Mountain is a massive dungeon complex extending endlessly below the ground. In a remote past, ancient evil beings dwelled in the area. Now, the remaining of these mysterious evil beings have seized the dungeons and filled it with deadly traps and monsters. Also, many known villains have established their strongholds in the depths of The Dungeon Under the Mountain. Nobody knows why this dungeon is filled by danger, but nobody cares, since this dungeon is the most prized adventure ground of the world. However be warned, adventurers, your life will be not easy here and dozens of self-calling heroes never returned from The Dungeon Under the Mountain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the third of a series of products detailing the rooms in the massive The Dungeon Under the Mountain environment. This is Room 8, Level 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains one room or one dungeon-based encounter. All the rooms featured here are taken from one of The Dungeon Under the Mountain products, although these products are not necessary, since the encounter can be adapted without effort to any existing dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
