							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guess It</name>
									
			<description>A game of deduction and bluffing with eleven playing cards, JT98765432A, and two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One secret card is laid face-down in the middle of the table. The rest are dealt between the players. The goal is to guess the secret card. A guess ends the game and determines the winner, according to whether the guess was correct or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns either asking the other if s/he has a given card or making a guess. When asked about a card, the opponent must answer truthfully and lay it face up if the card was held. A player may ask the opponent about a card s/he holds, in which case, s/he will lay it face up on his/her next turn. (The idea is that this bluff might make the opponent make an incorrect guess.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
