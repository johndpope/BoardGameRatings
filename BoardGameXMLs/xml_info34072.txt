			<description>'Hollywood Casting' is a face building game. The young lady in the frame is a drama student who dreams of becoming a hollywood starlet, so the story goes. &lt;br/&gt;'Hollywood Casting' is about quick decision-making and risk taking. The aim of the game is to create the tallest possible face by selecting and assembling different face tiles. When it is their turn, players roll the dice and select a face tile corresponding to the colour or part of the face shown on the dice, and add it to their face under construction. When a player has completed a face, there may still be room to improve it before everyone else has finished theirs, and the game is over. However, the first player to complete a face on an entirely red background or a 'rainbow' face where each tile has a different background colour, wins immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
