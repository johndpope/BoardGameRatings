			<description>Imagine an intricately mechanized clash of spy against spy, introducing corporate espionage to a Steampunk world of industrial revolution; filled with all of the plot twists and thrills of both genres. That's the world of Steam Spy, a Steampunk themed role playing card game for 2 players. Steam Spy unites the character development and narrative of a traditional role playing game with the intimacy and spontaneity of a card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players create a unique secret agent character who works for one of the organizations designated to protect and serve one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest corporations.  Then they face off against an operative from an opposing secret industrial organization in a one on one battle of wits, luck and exotic steampunk gadgets.  One player instigates some kind of espionage mission while the other does their best to stop them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players collect, play and draw cards that help create a series of exciting encounters that ultimately determine if the instigating antagonists succeeds at their mission, or the determined protagonist chases them down and defeats them; players then advance their spy character, or create a group of secret agent specialists in preparation for the next face off against operatives from opposing agencies and corporation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steam Spy: Shadows and Circuits allows you to investigate the mysterious as an agent of the Shadow Bureau, the Eastern European agency that helps protect the lines of transportation developed by the Transylvanian Transportation Company. Or you can join the Dragon Sect and take advantage of the marvelous technology developed by its parent company Orisaku Artificials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
