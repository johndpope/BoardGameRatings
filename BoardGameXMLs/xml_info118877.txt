			<description>Tank Battalion is a multi-directional shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1980. It was later ported to the Japanese Famicom (with a corresponding Vs. System game) and Game Boy, but for unknown reasons was retitled Battle City. This game was also ported to the MSX 8-bit computers with its original name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tank Battalion&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
