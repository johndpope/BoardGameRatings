			<description>This is a car racing game, so the first player to finish a certain number of turns, wins the game. The players use one die (not included in the game). If a player lands on a space with a star, he has to follow the instructions, printed on the game board. 16 collectible coins are used as playing pieces and are stored in recesses in the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board and the coins were published as a merchandising tool by Shell in the 1970s. There is no box!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
