							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wilderness Survival: The Adventurer&#039;s Definitive Guide to Staying Alive</name>
									
			<description>A supplement for players, gamemasters, and LARPers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wilderness Survival Guide has been written with the in-depth player/game master in mind. Those of us who like to take our game beyond the dice rolls, battles and statistics to a more immersive place, where the borderline between player and player character blur ever so slightly, where we actually learn from the feats and wisdom of our other-worldly personas and where the consequences of small actions have a greater effect on the overall game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book can be used in conjunction with any fantasy role-playing system, be it attribute and dice based or a less restrictive form of diceless game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is also ideal for Live Action Role Play, however, the reader must realise that this book is not a perfect survival guide and should not be applied to the wilderness of the real world. Certain things have been simplified, others have been adapted to the genre of fantasy and sorcery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
