							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Universal Adventures Caves of the Unknown</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Through the thinning mist rising off the river, the early morning light shines on a small, tree-shrouded cove, and the cave mouth beyond.  Water flows out of the cave mouth, feeding the cove and, eventually, the river.  What lies within the cave is not known.  What you can be certain of is that within the unknown, lies adventure.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Universal Adventures Caves of the Unknown is a complete adventure site for use with any fantasy roleplaying game.  Caves of the Unknown includes a map of the caves and descriptions of each of the 34 areas that comprise the adventure site.  As a Game Master, all you need to do is assign the monsters and treasures to each of the areas and you are ready to play.  Highly reusable, easily customizable, and fun to play, Caves of the Unknown is perfect for an evening&amp;rsquo;s adventure or as part of an ongoing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Portions of Caves of the Unknown were part of CV2 Caverns of Chaos and have been modified and included in this product as part of an adventure suitable for any FRPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
