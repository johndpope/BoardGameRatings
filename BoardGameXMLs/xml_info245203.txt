			<description>Guided by their neighbor, each player in Stumblewood has thirty seconds to get out of a dangerous forest. The further you go, the more new traps you must face: Hold the knife in front of you to clear the cobwebs, pinch your nose to cross the river, throw a bone to keep the wolf away...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever gets lost or falls into a trap must begin again from the starting point, and at the end of the allotted time, the next player gets to try their luck. Keep your cool and memorize your route so that you don't make mistakes when your turn comes around again! The first player who manages to leave the forest returns home and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
