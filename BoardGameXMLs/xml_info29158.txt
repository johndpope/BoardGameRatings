			<description>Listed in American Games, #4172.  1940s, Travel, Air, Board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three Point Landing -- Race your planes through all their destinations -- Here&amp;rsquo;s a thrilling game Full of sensations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three Point Landing consists of a play board illustrated with a map of the United States and part of Canada, 24 destination cards, a spinner and wooden figures representing airplanes, (in the deluxe edition the map on the play board also includes Central and South America, and 36 instead of 24 destination cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advance Games Corp, N.Y.C.&lt;br/&gt;No.242 1942 Made in USA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Directions for Playing&lt;br/&gt;Distribute the destination cards equally among all the players. Each player is also given a figure which represents his aeroplane. The object of &amp;ldquo;THREE POINT LANDING&amp;rdquo; is to cover all cities listed on your destination cards and then return to the starting place, namely &amp;ldquo;LaGuardia Field&amp;rdquo; New York City, before your opponents. Whoever returns first is the winner, before beginning study your route cards, and the map to determine the shortest round trip route, and arrange your cards accordingly. The players spin the dial in turn, and moves along the desired route, advancing the same amount of spaces as the spin. He must land on every city listed on the cards even though he spins a greater number. (Example: if he is three spaces from one of his cities and spins a six he still only advances three spaces to the city and then waits his next turn.) If a stop is made at a space with a &amp;ldquo;FORCED LANDING&amp;rdquo; or a &amp;ldquo;MOTOR REPAIRING&amp;rdquo; picture - ---in red clolor---the player must return to the last numbered town, it is necessary to spin the exact number of spaces to LaGuardia Field, New York City in order to land there at the finish. (Example: if there are three spaces left to the field, a three must be spun in order to land there.) The cities on the map have numbers that correspond to the numbers on the destination cards, so that small children will have no difficulty in identifying the position of the cities on the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
