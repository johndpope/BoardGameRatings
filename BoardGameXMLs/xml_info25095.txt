							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Naval War Game</name>
									
			<description>Abstracted from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1898 Fred Jane published 'Rules for the Jane naval war game - a Sea Kriegspiel'. This was also the year when the first of the 'Jane's Fighting Ships' appeared. There seems to have been a 1906 version of the game, but his last work on the subject was the 1912 version, here reprinted in 1990.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fred Jane's version of the 'Seekriegspiel' was regarded as sufficently accurate imitation of reality to be used by most modern navies for tactical training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The notes and reports on actual games which have been played, which appear at the end of the reprint, give a good idea of possibilities for large scale games, including 'press reports' and other 'goings on' which are possible where there are enough players and umpires and plenty of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
