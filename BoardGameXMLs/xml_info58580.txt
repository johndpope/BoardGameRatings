			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At last! A role playing game based on your favourite intergalactic anti-hero, Jack Cosmos - the Space Rat. You&amp;rsquo;ve read of his cheesy escapades in the international best selling novels, you&amp;rsquo;ve seen his devious antics on the nationally syndicated television series, and collected the spring-loaded glow-in-the-dark action figures. Now you can take part in his outrageous adventures too! Suit up and prepare for action -you&amp;rsquo;re about to join the Space Rat&amp;rsquo;s cadre of needy girlfriends, the Femme Babes, as they set out on another wild ride across the universe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Space Rat: the Jack Cosmos Adventure Game! players become members of the Femme Babes, helping Jack on his adventures in the hope that he will pay them a little extra attention. As a Femme Babe you will have to work with the other girls to complete the mission, but at the same time you want to make sure no one upstages you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has been created in twenty-fourhours. A single, continuous rotation of the insignificant planet Earth around its pale yellow sun. That&amp;rsquo;s why I included all those bits it turns out you didn&amp;rsquo;t like.&lt;br/&gt;It has also been created as my entry in the Ronnies. I took for my inspiration the words Rat and Girlfriend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
