			<description>The first-aid and safety game for all ages.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Pick a playing piece and race your opponents around the outer board to enter the wheel. Everyone gets the chance to be &amp;quot;Question Master&amp;quot; and take charge of the time buzzer.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the start square players roll the dice and move. The player is asked a safety or first-aid question related to the topic of the square they land on. A timer is started once the question has been read and the answer must be given before the timer sounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has completed the external track on the board they enter the central area and then must answer questions based on the spinner result. If answering successfully the player gets to point to one PREVENTIT lettercard of any opponent. If it is the correct colour they add it to their scorecard. If it is not the correct colour the lettercard remains face-down in front of the opponent. In either case play passes to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win: The first player to fill their PREVENTIT scorecard wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
