			<description>User Summary: Generic Sci-Fi setting for any rpg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Far Avalon&lt;br/&gt;A complete SF game setting from Avenger Enterprises and ComStar Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Far Avalon&lt;br/&gt;Until ten years ago, the Far Avalon region was a backwater on the edge of uncharted space. Linked to the distant Home Worlds by the Translight Conduit at Lubeck, the region was home to dozens of colonies and small independent states overseen by the Colonial District Authority.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Event&lt;br/&gt;A decade ago, the Lubeck conduit failed for unknown reasons, cutting off Far Avalon from the rest of human space. Now each faction, each alliance and each government must chart its own course into an uncertain future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Old Order Collapses&lt;br/&gt;Each colony is thrown back on its own resources. Now, with the navy gone, a handful of corvettes is a battlefleet, and a world that can build them is a major power. A single cruiser represents a massive naval force. Those that possess such might will emerge as the new leaders in Far Avalon, and those that do not must find other means to secure their future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Political Turmoil&lt;br/&gt;Some seek to build empires or secure rare resources. Others send out missions to explore the uncharted reaches of space. The remnants of the Colonial District Authority fleet try to maintain order and impose leadership on the fractious states of Far Avalon, but they are few and their ships are worn out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Time of Danger&lt;br/&gt;Raiders prey on the colonies of Far Avalon, as rivals seek to conquer them. Factions settle their differences with knives and guns on the backstreets while shady deals are made in the colonial capitals. Space travel is hazardous, but isolation means a slow slide into extinction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Time of Opportunity&lt;br/&gt;This is the hour of the independent merchant ship, the mercenary group, and the expert-for-hire. Governments and factions will pay well for expertise and firepower. Adventurers can make their fortune with their wits alone- but one mistake could lead to an early grave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great Questions&lt;br/&gt;Why did the Lubeck conduit fail? What is happening on the far side of it? Has the rest of humanity succumbed to some terrible disaster, or will ships arrive from the Home Worlds tomorrow? There are those who claim that they know the answers- but can they be trusted?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Far Avalon Game Setting&lt;br/&gt;This book presents a complete and self-contained science-fiction game setting. It includes overview of the region complete with its factions, alliances and states. Dozens of star systems are detailed, containing worlds ranging from frontier colonies to major interstellar powers. The world of Far Avalon itself is presented in great detail, including the intrigue-ridden Freeport of Landing City with its many local factions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventures in Far Avalon&lt;br/&gt;Take command of an exploration starship seeking out other lost enclaves of humans, or an ageing naval cruiser trying to uphold interstellar law in a universe gone mad. Fight for freedom against a burgeoning empire, or raid rival worlds for desperately needed resources to build your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take a berth aboard an independent merchant ship running contraband, or salvage the drifting remains of former fleet warships. Seek answers to the great questions in forgotten temples and ruins on airless worlds, or try to make a living in the sleazy freeports of the independent colonies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old order has collapsed. Now is your chance to build the new one...or to tear it down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
