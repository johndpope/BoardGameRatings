			<description>Billed as &amp;quot;The Greatest Rock and Pop Quiz Game ever.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, players have to answer 5 questions from one of 4 categories:&lt;br/&gt;Bands and Singers&lt;br/&gt;Poplines (lyrics)&lt;br/&gt;The Charts&lt;br/&gt;Pop Luck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The category they have to answer depends on the color that they land on.  They move their pieces up the charts (the board) according to how many questions they answer correctly.  If anyone lands on &amp;quot;Spot the Intro&amp;quot; then a section from a CD (included in the box) is played.  Each section has 5 tracks and any that aren't answered by the team landing on the space are then passed to the next team on the left.  Every correct answer moves your team one space closer to the coveted number one position, where you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CD contains 99 sections of 5 song-clips each.  Extra CDs are available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
