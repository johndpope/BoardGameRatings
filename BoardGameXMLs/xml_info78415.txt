							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Bomberman 5</name>
									
			<description>Super Bomberman 5, was released in two variations: a standard cartridge and a gold cartridge, which was sold exclusively through CoroCoro Comic. The gold cartridge contains included extra maps in battle mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single Player&lt;br/&gt;The single-player portion of Super Bomberman 5 is nonlinear, giving players a choice of which level they'd like to complete next. These phases are all based on the four previous Super Bomberman games for the SNES, containing remixed music and the same sprites of the game, and the fifth phase is completely new. Depending on your path, you can accumulate 100% of completion. There are two endings available, depending on where you face the final boss.  After finishing 100%, the game map is reset, which allows player to finish the maps 200%. When completing 200% of the map, a new password is given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multi Player&lt;br/&gt;There are nine characters to choose from, and over 10 maps to play on (though the extra three maps in the gold version can be unlocked in the normal cart as well). A create-a-character mode, which is unique to Super Bomberman 5, lets players choose their character and color and allows them a number of points. These points can be used to equip the power-up items from the single-player game. If you enter in password menu (Options &amp;rarr; Password) 0413, the maps in battle mode will change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in Super Bomberman 3, spotted green eggs containing the kangaroo-like creature named Looey can be found in both the story and multiplayer modes. They are released from their eggs when the player character makes contact with the egg. In Super Bomberman 5, the Looeys each have a different attire, ability and color, as opposed to the Looeys in Super Bomberman 3 which have only a different color and ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Super Bomberman 5 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
