			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;laquo;New Voices in Art&amp;raquo; is a chamberlarp concept, for 10-25 players. It is set in the world of contemporary art, but art in itself is not the actual theme of the game. Rather, art and the social scene that accompanies it is used to explore themes of ambition, social pretence, our desire to be creative individuals, and of everyone being alone with their innermost thoughts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays out like a party where people mostly don't know each other beforehand, chatting, flirting, discussing art, networking and mostly having a good time. The players will be playing a version of themselves in an alternate reality, in which they are artists on the verge of a major breakthrough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reading this, you are presumably considering or already planning to organise a game of New Voices in Art. When designing this game, we had some very clear priorities. We wanted to make a larp where players simply could show up and participate, and which also took little effort to organise. We wanted to make a game that could be written down and published on the net, and then picked up and played by someone who haven't attended a prior run of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Voices in Art has certain features designed to accomplish these goals. A handout folder is provided for a highly structured briefing phase, and this text will cover most of the preparations you are required to make.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the following you will find a section on preparations, this lists the practical stuff you will need to organise before the game. After this you will find a section on the pre game briefing you will need to hold. Following this comes a section on playing the game, which also includes certain optional concepts which may be included. Lastly, you will find ready to print materials for the briefing phase of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
