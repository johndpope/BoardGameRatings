							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Calamitous Curses</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;100 Calamitous Curses provides the Castles &amp;amp; Crusades Castle Keeper with 100 unusual and interesting curses. These can be bestowed upon player characters through mischance and misfortune or used by player character clerics and wizards on hapless non-player enemies. While designed for use with Castles &amp;amp; Crusades, the curses are easily adapted to any fantasy role-playing game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few of these curses are of the immediately deadly sort, save perhaps to 1st level characters; they are all designed to fall within the parameters set by the bestow curse spell, the reverse of the remove curse spell which is useable as a 3rd level clerical spell or 4th level wizard spell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for removing curses and details for including cursed scrolls in treasure troves are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
