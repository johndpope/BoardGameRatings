The magical inhabitants of Fairies, Dwarves and legendary creatures are powerless to prevent the tragedy yet there is just one chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A committee of Fairies gather at Asguaard's highest village - their immense task is to summon a creature able to achieve miracles, a creature read about in the oldest of books, a creature that is in possession of something that the Asguaard kind can only dream of and hold in awe. The possession is a soul and the creature - a human.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come join the fight for Asguaard, a tale of friendship, passion and heroism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
