			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters belong to one of eighteen named races; this determines some future development options.  Characters in Red Ash World Engine have numerous &amp;quot;variables&amp;quot;.  The first set are ten Abilities with numeric Scores.  Additionally, characters have Size, Weight, Encumbrance, Status, Effects, Traits, and Skills.  Magic is handled as a Skill.  Characters enter into a Class with a predefined level progression.  Levels run from 1 to 100; training is required to increase Level (to &amp;quot;level up&amp;quot;) from Levels 2 to 50, thereafter characters are considered masters of the Class.  The system presents sixteen classes, half of which are restricted to specific races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is complex and supports numerous routine and special actions and circumstances, as well as terrain features and facing.  Actions during combat are controlled by impulse point allocation--when an actor is out of points they cannot further act in the round.  Armor does not offer protection from being hit, but does absorb damage from any hits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules (text) are released under a creative commons license.  The site also offers several javascript play utilities, including:  Creation Points Calculator; Experience Calculator; and Dice Roller.  Note the presentation as HTML-only, with numerous drop-down selection boxes for individual elements, etc., makes use cumbersome (this is partially ameliorated by the Site Menu).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
