			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Gregs Tagebuch: Von Idioten umzingelt!, you're new at school and (as might be expected) at the very bottom of the class in terms of popularity &amp;ndash; but that situation can change through your cool actions. Just don't risk too much for popularity as whoever touches the stinky cheese gets cursed by the cheese and will see his prestige plunge!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, each player represents a character from the first volume of the popular book series, and everyone wants their character to rise to the top. To do this, you need to select one or more cards from a pile. Most cards have positive values and help you climb the ladder of success, but negative cards exist as well. Worst of all is the stinky cheese that adheres to your fingers and drops your popularity. Your only hope is to pass the curse on to another player, who will then stink even worse than you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
