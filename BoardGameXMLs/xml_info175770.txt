			<description>Welcome Archeologists! This tomb has been recently uncovered by a freak sand storm. It&amp;rsquo;s up to you and your rival archeologists to traverse the long forgotten tunnels, defeat monsters, and search for the vast treasures beyond your wildest dreams Before the tomb is once again lost to the sands of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, a player rolls 1d6 to determine their movement to explore the tomb. The tomb itself is broken down into 3x3 square tiles that you draw randomly and add to the map as you go. Sometimes you might find a monster Hiding in the halls. These monsters are hoarding the treasures for themselves and it's up to you to defeat them by rolling a higher dice roll than their power level. Once the monster is defeated you get the treasure for yourself. Some of this treasure may help you in your adventure, or be a curse that hinders your progression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be careful though. The tomb is only open for a limited time and anyone can trigger the collapse. Once the tomb collapses you have a limited amount of time to get back to the entrance. If you make it out then congratulations, count up your treasure. The archeologist with the most treasure wins! If you don't make it out, sorry about your luck. Maybe someday the tomb will be uncovered again and a future archeologist will find your corpse among a pile of valuable treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
