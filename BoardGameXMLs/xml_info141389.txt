			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lots of times, we want to play a roleplaying game but just don't have the time for all the prep work involved. We wanted to try creating a simple fantasy roleplaying game that gives a group of players all the tools they need to play an exciting fantasy adventure in a single evening, no homework, no fuss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the Wall and Other Adventures gives you a kit to make a gang of childhood friends and send them off on their first big adventure, just like in the novels we loved growing up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We're trying to seed your imagination without cramping your style, so we've built a familiar-feeling OSR game that many players will remember without having to read the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyone with a background in OSR games will already be comfortable with the core rules of Beyond the Wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Inspired by the works of Ursula K. LeGuin and Lloyd Alexander.&lt;br/&gt;     Character Playbooks and Scenario Packs for play in a single evening with no prep.&lt;br/&gt;     Guidelines for making your own custom classes, as well as demons, dragons, and goblins.&lt;br/&gt;     Full magic system with cantrips, spells, and rituals.&lt;br/&gt;     Player driven village design for fleshing out the characters' home.&lt;br/&gt;     This set contains four rules documents, six Character Playbooks, and the Hidden Cult Scenario Pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
