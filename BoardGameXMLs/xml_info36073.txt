			<description>&amp;ldquo;Board &amp;amp; card game for 2 players. Space Combat in the Games Workshop Warhammer 40K Space Fleet Universe. Pick your Fleet: Tyranid, Imperial, Eldar, or Necron. Abstract skirmish level combat. Each figure represents a single Ship (unit). Victory: You win if you Destroy the opposing Flagship.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chessboard or other 8x8 grid. Miniatures or counters are used to represent the combat units. Each player has a fleet of sixteen ships comprised of one flagship and four other types of ships, which vary depending on the type of fleet chosen. Each ship is rated for hits, movement, and size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each type of fleet uses a custom deck of cards which is central to the play of the game. The players draw hands of cards from their decks. Card play determines when units may move, attack, or defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
