							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deadly Towers</name>
									
			<description>Deadly Towers is a video game developed by Lenar and exclusively-licensed by Irem as a software title for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It was released in Japan on December 15, 1986, and in North America in September of the following year. One of the earliest published titles for the NES in North America, Deadly Towers proved to be markedly unpopular, largely due to the high learning curve and high difficulty level when starting the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Japan, Deadly Towers was titled Mashō (魔鐘), literally meaning &amp;quot;Evil Bell&amp;quot;. It is a pun of the word mashō (魔性), meaning &amp;quot;devilishness&amp;quot;, and in keeping with this theme, the Japanese cartridge contained a red LED at the top which illuminated when turned on[1]. Fittingly, the original title outside the Japanese market was to have been &amp;quot;Hell's Bells,&amp;quot; but according to the game's producer, Nintendo of America ordered the name changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the moonlit eve of his coronation ceremony, pensive Prince Myer sits at the lakeside to ponder the future of the kingdom. Suddenly, a shadowy kami called Khan rises from the lake and coalesces into the form of a man. Although he doesn't identify himself, the figure greets Prince Myer by name, and informs him that the wizard Rubas, the &amp;quot;Devil of Darkness&amp;quot;, is preparing to overtake Willner Kingdom by using seven magic bells capable of summoning an army of monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To ensure peace, Khan says, Prince Myer must travel to the northern mountain to burn the Seven Bells in the sacred flame, burn down the seven bell towers in Rubas' magic palace, and, ultimately, defeat Rubas himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Deadly Towers&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
