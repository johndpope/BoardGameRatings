			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paths of Virtue is distributed as a series of eight PDF files.  The distribution documents include character creation and action resolution, in addition to a cybernetic equipment guide.  Also, the game provides a substantial amount of setting detail that support the rules.  The character build process is somewhat setting dependent but could be utilized without the campaign specifics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have eight Stats (attributes): Psyche, Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, Perception, and Physical Beauty.  The Stats have values assigned by one of several methods, all involving dice.  They range from 2 to 24.  Once Stats are randomized, the remainder of the build uses Character Points.  Skills are purchased and assigned a Level (which cannot exceed 30).  Spell-casting is a Skill.  Flaws and Powers are then selected.  Powers also have a Level assigned and a narrative rank (Weak, Intermediate, or Great).  Any remaining Character Points can be spent on a variety of other advantages such as contacts or resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat requires an Action Declaration from players before the round begins.  Attacks require a d100 roll under the character's &amp;quot;To-Hit Value&amp;quot; (a derived value).  Some characters with high Dexterity may receive more than one attack per round.  Because combat often involves melee weapons, firearms, spells, and tech weapons, it is fairly complex and involves numerous rules covering special circumstances.  Any damage is applied to a randomly-determined hit location and reduced by armor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
