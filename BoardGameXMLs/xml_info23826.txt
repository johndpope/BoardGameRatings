							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Day at the Races</name>
									
			<description>A Day at the Races is a novel if somewhat random attempt at creating the excitement of a race meet complete with betting on the family room table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game comes from the Crown and Andrews stable well-noted for their tabletop cricket simulation &amp;quot;Test Match&amp;quot; which has stood the test of time as the benchmark children&amp;rsquo;s cricket game that delivers strategy and fun through a heavily TOY based game. e.g.: manually triggering your bowler to bowl a ball which the batsman needs to manually trigger and hit to toy fieldsmen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However a Day at the Races involves you clamping one end of the racetrack to the end of your table with two provided metal clamps and then pulling a tensioned green vinyl racetrack out until you can hook it over the other end of the table. Then it is a matter of setting up the other colorful bits such as the starting stalls, the finishing post and of course the five lovely plastic horses complete with weighted swinging jockeys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then present their stall cards to get their starting places and have an opportunity to bet on who they think will hit the finish line first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From here it is a matter of turning a crank at the starting line which causes the track to vibrate under the horses propelling them slowly forward, until a winner emerges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As far as I can determine this seems entirely random (although the weighted jockeys seem to behave differently each time). Though the game would be a great beer and pretzels action affair or for those loving horse racing. Due to the random nature and betting I wouldn't really recommend for youngsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
