			<description>Megateh (めがて＝目我天) is a three-dimensional, multi-player game especially suitable for any player with restricted sight. Equally challenging and fun regardless of vision limitations, this highly tactile, physical game with ceramic and wooden pieces is based on touch and does not rely on artificial sound effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to make four-in-a-row by placing pieces on the board. The board structure is designed to aide sight-impaired players. Holes on the board indicate where players can legally place their pieces. The pieces are formed in various ways to make them easy to recognize by touch alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you and your friends are sighted or sight-impaired this game provides a fun evening of strategy, gaming and fun conversation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although published in Japanese, gameplay is language free and an easy explanation in English is on the publisher's website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
