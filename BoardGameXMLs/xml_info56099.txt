							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goodbye, Kankee</name>
									
			<description>A lizard-beast slithers up the side of your hijacked walker and starts to plant an explosive device. Clyde, your bearish partner, cracks a smile. 'Eeeehaaa!' he bellows, pushing his huge, furry mitt through the glass. The lizard tumbles head over claws with a squeal, the device exploding in its hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'How'd we get into this MESS?' you yell, beaming a few shots below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Hey, don't look at me, pal. I didn't scoop up no long-nosed nobleman's daughter. I just wanted the loot.' Clyde steers the space walker over a reptile, and crushed the scaly creature beneath a three-ton metal foot. 'Eeeehaaa!'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Oh, SURE,' you retort. 'Next time we rip off a ship to shake 3 zillion Imperial thugs from our tail, I'll ask the cops to check things out before we leave. Yeah, right.' You prime the laser for another blast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Well, NEXT time,' Clyde replies, 'I say we don't even touch a ship, if it's got anything to do with Kankee.' He reels the walker around, heading toward your vessel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'If there IS a next time', you yell, winging a frag grenade to the right, 'From word &amp;quot;go&amp;quot;, it's... GOODBYE' KANKEE.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOODBYE, KANKEE is a STAR ACE game adventure packed with enough action, sizzle, and surprise to challenge any new Star Team rebel and smuggler. Inside you'll ding an exciting story in several linked episodes, each designed for an evening of play. You'll also find character cards, maps, new ships and robots, and hours of role-playing fun. Be sure to look for other fine products from Pacesetter.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
