			<description>Commander in Chief is a game showing a soldier's rise through the ranks from Private to Commander in Chief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game seems to represent the Spanish American War, in fact one portion of the primary Illustration on the game board seems to be an inverse of Fredric Remington's &amp;quot;Grimes Battery&amp;quot;, a drawing representing Battery A, 2nd U.S. Artillery. They saw action in Cuba and were involved in the attack on San Juan Hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player count is unknown as is the method of moving players around the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no clue as to date of publication or publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
