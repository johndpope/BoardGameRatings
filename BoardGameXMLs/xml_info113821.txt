			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control a square. When you get close to another square, you begin to spin, and gain points. This also slows the movement of the other square. If you get close to two squares, you spin even faster and gain even more points. Likewise the more squares you are close to. The closer you are the faster you spin and the more points you gain, but if you touch another square the game will end and points determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original version of Love had just one game mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developer rereleased the game as part of the Child of Eden Ubisoft/Kongregate contest, slightly adjusting the gameplay and introducing a second game mode named 'infidelity' where your mouse movement controls two squares at once that move with mirrored motion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
