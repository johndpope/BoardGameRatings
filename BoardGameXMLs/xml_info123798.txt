			<description>Far away in the depths of the ancient world permeated by streams of magical energy 4 kingdoms are situated. They are not just neighbors. They are 4 civilizations, 4 philosophies, 4 stories and 4 eternal enemies. Will there be one who can subdue their power, reveal all their secrets and fulfill predestined him by the destiny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes of Realms is a unique fusion of deck-building games and adventure, where each player chooses his own path, and tries to pass it through. Imagine a classic adventure game where you compose your playing field every time. Besides, already completed locations can bring you both income and be useful in the future. You do not just compose it, but create real kingdom, and you are the one who decides how it will look like. You will decide to what regions your kingdom will stretch, with whom you will neighbor and what it will promise you. Attack and defend yourself from other players! And for this you will need a good army, besides, without it you will not be able to expand your holdings. But do not forget that in addition to the army, you need to develop your skills, to achieve victory. For more detailed analysis of the elements of mechanics read the diaries of designers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
