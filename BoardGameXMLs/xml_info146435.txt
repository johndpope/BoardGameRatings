			<description>The object of Where's the Wizard? is to collect three Silver Charms by listening and guessing correctly where the young wizard is hiding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a turntable with 10 conical wizard hats along the edge. One hat conceals an electronic wizard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with a hand of six cards and must draw on their turn until they have a complete set which allows a spin of the turntable. The suits (wizard, wand, owl, spell book, newt, rat, and toad) require different numbers of cards to form a set. Wizards require only one card, spell books require four cards, but newts, rats and toads are worthless and can never be used to earn a spin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the player has collected a complete set of cards, he spins the turntable which causes the hidden wizard to laugh. The player then lifts a hat and if the wizard is found, the player collects one silver charm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect 3 silver charms wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
