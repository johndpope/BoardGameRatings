							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Shoe Thief</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A shoe thief is an odd fey that seems to exist purely for the purpose of stealing mortals&amp;rsquo; footwear. Their standing among other fae, their social structure, and their self-worth are all rooted in their personal hoard of stolen shoes. There are a variety of rules governing when, where, and why a shoe thief is allowed to steal - but the most common of them is some wrong done to another fae. The shoe thief is then contracted to deal with slight or injury by stealing the mortal&amp;rsquo;s shoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Physically, a shoe thief is appears to be an aged, oversized gnome with a thick furry coat and stumpy legs ending in perfectly normal humanoid feet. Their arms are much like a bird&amp;rsquo;s scaly legs, ending in taloned claws that they do not hesitate to use against those who are reluctant to part with their footwear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shoe thieves are exceptionally fond of magical footwear, going so far as to create and disseminate a spell for their summoning among mortal spellcasters in order to increase their chances of being called upon to acquire such objects. Magic footwear, seeing as it usually conveys exceptional powers of movement to the wearer, is often much easier to steal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
