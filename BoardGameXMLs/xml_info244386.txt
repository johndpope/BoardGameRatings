							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nuclien</name>
									
			<description>Nuclien has a long history, it was originally called &amp;quot;Alpha Gene&amp;quot; and was released on Windows phone in 2010,&lt;br/&gt;Several years later after becoming a full time indie developer I decided to dig up the code, refine it and re-release it on iOS and Android. As my second proper release (after Hiragana Pixel Party) I had high hopes. The game was featured on Kotaku, and gained a relatively large user base (the game is currently a premium title).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date the game has been downloaded 30,000 times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
