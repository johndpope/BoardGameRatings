							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fall of the Titans</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Fall of the Titans&amp;quot; is a 2-player asymmetrical card game, based on the video game &amp;quot;Shadow of the Colossus.&amp;quot; In &amp;quot;Fall,&amp;quot; one player takes on the role of Ronin, a human assigned with the task of defeating the great Titan...which is played by the other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a different process and actions that they perform. Essentially, the Titan player sets up a defense, the Ronin player determines a course of action against those defenses, results are determined, and the player then moves. But careful consideration must be taken into account with regards to planning, bluffing, and resources available in hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a standard deck of cards, a pawn, and some coins or some other markers, in addition to the Titan board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
