			<description>User Summary: Revision of BTRC's earlier Warpworld rpg to the EABA system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;The old gods have returned. As the universe ages, stresses on the fabric of spacetime cause the fundamental relationships between matter and energy and time and space to shift into new configurations. The last time this happened was in the age of Atlantis, millennia before recorded history, an age rich in the forces men called magic and the beings men knew as gods. Then, the universe shifted, and magic and gods that were once mandatory became impossible. The magically supported works of men crumbled, and the gods became myth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2010CE, the universe shifts back. Magic and the old gods return, and many of the principles we take for granted suddenly aren't there anymore. Civilization collapses, and the gods walk the earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WarpWorld is a gameworld with a built-in 300 year story arc, with players taking part from the first chaotic day of the new world, to the final conflict that determines ultimate fate of mankind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
