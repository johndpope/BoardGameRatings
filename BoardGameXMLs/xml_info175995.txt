			<description>What would happen if mankind lost control over what it created?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There would be environmental disasters, NPP explosions, chemical plants catastrophes, extensive contamination over large areas.&lt;br/&gt;Civilization would be derailed and nature would gradually take the man&amp;rsquo;s place. There will be new species, better adapted to survive in the new conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to survive in this madness? When the world has become a mere human nightmare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the walls of the former populated cities there's the terrifying forest, that you can only get through with armored vehicles. In the city mad birds and animals crawl in from every side, frantically trying to trap survivors in the ruins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
