							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Body Parts &amp; Harvesting</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At some point, after killing a dragon, one or more enterprising heroes are going to wonder what the corpse itself is worth, or even just a part of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presented here are details about the various body parts, what they are worth, some equipment and food and drink based off these body parts, with a few plot hooks as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novus Draco is not needed to use this but is highly recommended as is &amp;ldquo;Death Effects&amp;rdquo;, also by Ennead Games as it makes harvesting more risky and a race against the clock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
