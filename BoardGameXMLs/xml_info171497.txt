			<description>Can you get your dragon around the island before anyone else? You'll get to try in Drachen-Rallye which pits players not only against one another but against gusty winds that sometimes blow you ahead and sometimes blow you back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up the game board, place the dragons on their start spaces, then assemble the windmill-like second board and place it on the first game board with one of the arms of the windmill directly behind the dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, you first roll a die. If you roll a number, you move your dragon clockwise exactly this many spaces; if you land on a green space, you then move forward two spaces, and if on a red space, you move back two spaces. If you roll a tailwind, you turn the windmill clockwise 1-3 spaces, pushing any dragons sitting at the front of that wind or riding on the clouds; if you roll a headwind, you turn it 1-3 spaces counterclockwise. (Once you've played a few times, you can use a second die that allows you to choose headwind or tailwind as you like, in addition to the distance that you move.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to circle the island and land on or pass its starting space wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
