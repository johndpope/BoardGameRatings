							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">16 Impossible Things Before Breakfast</name>
									
			<description>Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast. - The White Queen from Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon walking one early morning, you and your companions have found yourselves stumbling upon a Mad Tea Party set up in the woods.  Unfortunately for you, no one can leave; at least, not yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now that you are there, you are obliged to stay and join in six conversations.  A strange rule for a strange party.  There are exactly sixteen concurrent conversations, so at least you will not be obliged to join them all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is another twist.  Each attendee starts with six points of confusion - after all, a Mad Tea Party was not something you expected to find!  Should you lose your confusion, you will be staying here, for it does not seem that odd at all.  Should you gain more confusion, you will need to join in more conversations (equal to the number of your confusion) before you can leave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now that you have arrived, please do join in.  After all, we are all mad here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
