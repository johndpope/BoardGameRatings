			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the depths of the Abyss&amp;hellip; The Demon Lords of Porphyra!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, Demon Lords from the pits, the blasted layers of the Abyss, hear my cry, accept my sacrifice, recognize my obedience and grant me the boon I wish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ayporos, patron of self-inflicted poison&amp;hellip; The Dark Mistress, demon Lord of the sinister city of Shadowlight&amp;hellip; Morcheox, demon-asteroid celestial destroyer&amp;hellip; Tajam&amp;rsquo;muhur, balor-Lord of the vandal hordes&amp;hellip;and Zaqqit, fallen angel of goddess-arbiter Gerana- these are a few of the Demon Lords that have a foothold in the Patchwork Planet of Pophyra.  Rejected in the struggle of the NewGods War, the myriad Demon Lords are lesser in power than the Gods, but have ways of coercing the weak with demonstrations of how Chaos and Evil can give them gain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perry Fehr&amp;rsquo;s Demon Lords of Porphyra from Purple Duck Games contains detailed data on 15 demon lords in statistics of legend, church, and rituals, and demonic boons.  Magic items are listed, including the awful Book of the Demon Lords and the Blood-Queen Thurin&amp;rsquo;Waethil&amp;rsquo;s Revenge&amp;rsquo;s Tear artifacts.  14 spells are here, favored by many of the demon lords, that can be used by adventurers, or their enemies.  Finally, several new domains and subdomains are writ her for your guarded study, such as Anarchy, Betrayal, and Genocide!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your interests lean towards the dangerous, chaotic and slightly sinful, get your copy of Demon Lords of Porphyra from the dastardly demonologists at Purple Duck Games today, because, as the forbidden knowledge of Naehemoth the Crawling Evil would tell you, our games are what you want&amp;hellip; and tell them Pazuzu sent you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
