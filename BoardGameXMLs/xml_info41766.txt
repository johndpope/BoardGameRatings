			<description>The game consists of a wooden step pyramid and 72 wooden bricks in three sizes and four colors. There are four sets of game rules included, three of them dealing with building the pyramid (= laying the bricks onto the wooden gameboard until it is completely covered), one with dismantling it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- In the first variant, the color of each layer is fixed. Players try to get rid of their large pieces first, as the first player to run out of pieces wins, and the larger the piece, the harder it is to place once the layers get smaller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- In the second variant, any color can be placed anywhere, except that no brick can touch another brick of the same color&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- In the third variant, everything is allowed (a quick and rather random variant)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- In the dismantling variant, every player can take one piece per turn, trying to get the biggest pieces as they count most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
