			<description>Author's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of the Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls role-playing game, particularly the 4th edition of the rules; I like to think of it as the pre-inflation period of Tunnels and Trolls. Weapons have less dice to juggle and armour has more manageable ratings. Generally speaking, the smaller numbers lead to a less stressful GM experience (for me at least).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This booklet represents a condensed version of the basic rules of play - a selection of bits and pieces culled from editions 4, 5 and 7 shuffled to taste, slightly different but still very much T&amp;amp;T. I call it R3 or Retro Role-playing Realms!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This text assumes that you are familiar with role-playing games in general and T&amp;amp;T in particular. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t consult your friendly internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
