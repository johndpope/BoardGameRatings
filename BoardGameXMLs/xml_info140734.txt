			<description>WarBreeds is a Real Time Strategy computer game created by Red Orb and published by Br&amp;oslash;derbund. WarBreeds was released in 1999. The game is set in a far off galaxy where the humanoid amphibian race called the Yedda have died out due to famine, disease and civil war, leaving their four former servitor races to fight for supremacy for their planet. WarBreeds features the ability to fully customise the warriors with many types of weapons which provide over 35,000 unique combinations. The central theme and mechanic of the game is genetic engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;WarBreeds&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
