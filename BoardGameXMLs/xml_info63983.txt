							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dunir Keep</name>
									
			<description>From the cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dunir is an isolated keep and small town on the northwestern coast of Kanday, although it gets more traffic than one would expect. The road from Selvos to Menekod enters Rethem and is blocked by Hyen Keep, headquarters of the Agrikan Company of the Copper Hook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fighting order once held Selvos, Menekod, and Dunir and has never accepted the Peace of Selvos. Hence, all military traffic and most trade in northwestern Kanday passes through Dunir. Although now a peaceful area, remnants of the dark churches that once dominated Dunir, still linger like a black raven, watching, waiting for the old days to return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dunir Keep is on Harn Atlas Map D8, adjacent to D7, which holds Selvos Castle and the City of Golotha. Dunir and Selvos are both within the Kingdom of Kanday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because Dunir is so isolated, it makes an excellent place to start a Harnic campaign. GMs can get a feel for all the detail available before introducing their PCs to the richer envronment of Selvos or the delicious complexity of Golotha.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
