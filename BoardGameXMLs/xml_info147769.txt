							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Complete Post-Apocalyptic Scavenger&#039;s Field Guide</name>
									
			<description>user summary:&lt;br/&gt;This is a fan-made sourcebook compiling equipment lists, details, statistics and new rules for Gamma World (1st Edition) and Gamma World (2nd Edition).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Foreword:&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Complete Post-Apocalyptic Scavenger&amp;rsquo;s Field Guide, the second in the DeEvolution series of 1st/2nd edition Gamma World netbook supplements. In compiling the equipment from across so many editions and sources, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to put together the Gamma World supplement I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to have on MY bookshelf next to the Basic Rules Booklet. No more searching through a dozen out-of-print modules and magazines just to find an artifact, no more cross-referencing between two books to find the REST of the stats. This is Gamma World the way it should be. If you&amp;rsquo;re the gearhead Gamma Merigan type, check out the rules for constructing robots and power armor. If you&amp;rsquo;re a Game Master looking to give your game that &amp;ldquo;Modern Primitive&amp;rdquo; touch, check out the updated and expanded low tech weapons and armor. No longer is a club just a piece of wood in this wasteland! Lastly, players and GM&amp;rsquo;s alike will get just the facts they need from the comprehensive equipment listings, all indexed for quick reference. So,next time you&amp;rsquo;re taking a roadtrip into the Deathlands, remember to have the Field Guide handy, keep your Mark V warm, and don&amp;rsquo;t eat the glowing snow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
