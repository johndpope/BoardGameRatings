			<description>Two players race counter-clockwise around a wooden board, trying to eliminate their opponent's pegs by landing on them. First player to eliminate all six of their opponent's pegs wins. Player's pegs start in a home section of the same color. A pair of dice are rolled to determine movement. Each die may be used to move two separate pegs, or they may be combined to move a single peg twice. A peg must land in either an empty space, or on an opponent's peg, eliminating it. A peg in its home section cannot be eliminated. A player is not allowed to land on his own pegs. If a player cannot move, the player must pass. Once either player is down to one peg, the home section is no longer safe. However, the final peg can only be eliminated by a 6 on a single die. If both players are down to one peg, then it is a race to see who can eliminate the other, or who can land in their own home section first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
