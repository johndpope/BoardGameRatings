			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a group of friends who met in high school. For various reason, they were not well liked by most of the classmates, and they banded together to form their own group. They were dubbed the &amp;quot;Oddballs&amp;quot; by their classmates because they were such a disparate group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They all have had brushes with the law doing illegal actions. They still keep in contact with each other, sometimes assisting each other in one scam or another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
