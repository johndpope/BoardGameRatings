			<description>Frenzy is a fast action card game for 2 - 6 players (ages 6+).  The game offers simultaneous play making it extremely quick and chaotic!  The goal is to build a troop of spider monkeys by quickly getting rid of your deck of cards (48 cards per deck).  Each player can have 5 &amp;quot;on deck&amp;quot; cards infront of them and turn over 2 cards at a time for game play.  Players create community piles with a tail card and then cards are played in sequential order as follows: tail, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, head.  A completed pile creates a spider monkey and is removed from the playing area.  A player wins by creating 4 spider monkeys for their troop and yelling Frenzy!
