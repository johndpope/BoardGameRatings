			<description>Grave Digger is a push-your-luck game where each player acts as one of four Grave Diggers in a race to beat a curse that causes the dead to rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling 3 dice at a time, claiming spots on a 3x3 grid of playing cards by placing the dice on matching cards. Face cards have a value of 10, and Aces can be 1 or 11. A dice roll of double 6 can be placed anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player can stop rolling any time, and collect any claimed cards, or must stop when no dice can be placed, losing any claimed cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has collected 10 cards. Each other player gets one more turn. The player who has collected the most cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
