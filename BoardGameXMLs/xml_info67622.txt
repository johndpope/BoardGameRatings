			<description>From the Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bandit Raid!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A rich caravan plods along the road, making little sound other than the rumble of wagon wheels and the hoofbeats of horses and oxen. Suddenly, the quiet is broken by a hail of arrows and the screams of the passengers and guards as they realize the worst -- a full scale bandit attack!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Thieves' Guild 10 you and your comrades can join or even organize a large bandit gang, seeking to prey on the wealthy merchant and passenger caravans that travel the roadways of the Realm of the Ten Cities. Thieves' Guild 10 provides all the rules necessary for running large group combats and ambushes, instructions for designing and outfitting caravan groups, and describes the contents of several sample caravans upon which the players may test their newfound skills. Become the terror of the highways -- in this issues first scenario, Bandit Gangs and Caravans!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile back in the city of Haven, a powerful merchant has broken his agreement with the Thieves' Guild. The guildmaster wants his revenge -- and has given you the assignment of burglarizing the traitor's house of its most prized treasures. Can you teach this upstart merchant The Lesson he so well deserves about what happens to those who dare to cross the Guild?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both the adventures in Thieves' Guild 10 are designed for a party of intermediate to upper level thief characters; the Bandit Gang scenario may also include fighters and other character types. The scenarios and rules re presented in the Thieves' Guild standard format but can be easily adapted to any fantasy role-playing system. Like its predecessors, Thieves' Guild 10 is a great mix of rip-roaring action and careful planning, and a true test of any adventurer's skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
