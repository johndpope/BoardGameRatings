			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carry TWO Big Sticks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Top operative Kite (PL 8) didn&amp;rsquo;t set out to become a super-agent. Billie-Jeanne Beauchamp wanted to improve the world. She studied hard, earned a PhD, and eventually became a law-enforcement officer. Then, she discovered how much the system doesn&amp;rsquo;t always treat its representatives equally. Despite facing sexist assignments, Billie uncovered a major operation of the terrorist organization Horde, survived an assassination attempt, and was invited to become a CASTLE agent. She continued to excel and impress, and is now one of Director Nathan Storm's most valued assets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powered Legends. Because sometimes you need a character everyone recognizes, even when meeting them for the first time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
