							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Instructors Manual: Constantine and the Council of Nicaea 325 C.E.: Defining Orthodoxy and Heresy in Christianity</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game examines a number of issues of Christian doctrine and practice in the context of the first Council of Nicaea in 325 CE. Students will explore a range of possible interpretations of the person Jesus of Nazareth. The decision reached by the Council became the basis of the Doctrine of the Trinity, which is at the center of most modern Christianity. The results in the game will often be close to the historical outcome, however, the Aryan alternative is a possible outcome as well. Since there was a back and forth between these two competing doctrines for decades following the Council, either outcome represents a historical possibility. Other outcomes, Gnostic, Marcionite, etc. are not really possible in the game, but all these possibilities are raised in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
