			<description>The goal of the game is to get with all four pawns into one sector (II, III, V, VI) of the game board. The first player to achieve this wins the game. If a player gets three pawns in an sector, all other players have to vacate this sector. Placement and movement of the pawns is determined by two dies, a standard die (1-6) and a degree-of-latitude-die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second game rule is for a travel game, where the players are to get their pawn from their starting point (colored dot on the game board) to three destinations (determined by the draw of 3 &amp;quot;Orts-Karten&amp;quot; and back to their starting points. On the roll of a 6 the Player has to move his pawn and draw a &amp;quot;Zufalls-Karte&amp;quot; and follow the printed instructions on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
