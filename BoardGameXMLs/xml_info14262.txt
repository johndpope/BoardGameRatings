			<description>One player takes the role of the Government and the other player takes the role of Anti-Government.  The players move around the board and buy properties such as &amp;quot;Air Force&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Labor Unions&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Central Bank&amp;quot; in a manner similar to Monopoly. Properties can also be gained through negotiation or cards.  Like in Monopoly future visitors to the space owe the owner a penalty, but the properties also give differing advantages to the owner.  To win players must control three of the four sectors (Political, Military, Financial, and Service), or capture a select few properties indicating a coup or dictatorship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
