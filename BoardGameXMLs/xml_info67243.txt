							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Metabarons Roleplaying Game Guidebook #1: Path of the Warrior</name>
									
			<description>User Summary (drafted from introduction and cover text):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover a universe of endless possibilities....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Metabaron is the most feared warrior in the galaxy. Cunning, meticulous, and fierce, the Metabaron is unparalleled in battle. Long before this unstoppable force roamed the universe, his ancestors spent generations crafting his legacy and formulating his unique code of honor. The comic book series, &amp;quot;The Metabarons,&amp;quot; examines this lineage from the very beginnings of the Metabaron clan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first five issues of The Metabarons comic book were collected into a one-volume trade paperback (called &amp;quot;Path of the Warrior&amp;quot;) in 2001. As an aid to the play of The Metabarons RPG, we have prepared Guidebook #1 with background information, stats, and other data to integrate this storyline into your gaming sessions. In addition, Guidebook #1 offers a gamemasters' guide to working with comics continuity, a new scenario called &amp;quot;The Pirate Necklace,&amp;quot; and rules to convert between the Classic D6 System and the new D6 Legend System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you ready to experience playing in one of the most fully developed space opera settings in history? &amp;quot;Metabarons RPG Guidebook #1: Path of the Warrior&amp;quot; will give you everything you need to begin your journey. Surviving is up to you....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More Info:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Metabaron first appeared in 1981 in the French printing of Moebius and Jodorowsky's &amp;quot;The Incal,&amp;quot; which eventually grew to six volumes. It was first seen on American shores in three soft-cover editions printed by Marvel/Epic in 1988. As The Incal spun off successful sequels, the Metabaron became so popular that Jodorowsky began work on a story that would trace the history of the Metabarons' bloodline. The result was the comic book series, &amp;quot;The Metabarons.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement, &amp;quot;Metabarons RPG Guidebook #1: Path of the Warrior,&amp;quot; is the second follow-up to the Metabarons Roleplaying Game Rulebook, released in March, 2001. As in the Metabarons RPG and the original Star Wars RPG, the authors suggest that you do not necessarily play one of the major characters, and instead weave your campaigns around the rich subplots and supporting characters that populate the stories. To that end, they naturally recommend mining the Metabarons comics or trade paperback collections for ideas and source material to fully enhance your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
