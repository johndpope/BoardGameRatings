			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If attributes define what natural gifts a character starts with and class defines the path they have chosen, then feats define what tricks a character has up their sleeve that are not defined by class. When the rigors of adventure put a character in a defining moment, what choices have you made for that character?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tides of War is a series of small PDFs that focus on creating new feat lines and paths for a character to choose. These will not always be optimal, but they will have flavor and most importantly be useful. From this series you can expect new teamwork feats, new style feats, all sorts of class specific feat lines, and support for some of our alternate base classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our first installment looks to make mounted warriors appreciate more weapons than just the lance. Have thou no fear, for there is only glory or death when the charge is sounded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
