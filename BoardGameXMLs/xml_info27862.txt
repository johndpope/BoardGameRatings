							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Baseball&#039;s Board Game</name>
									
			<description>This easy-to-learn game for two players features a baseball-diamond board design and includes two dice, chips that represent players, a scoreboard to keep track of runs and outs, and a statistical sheet to follow up singles, doubles, triples and other plays. It is based on aspects of the baseball game played around the world. The game consists of odd innings (five, seven or nine), and championships can be played by preliminary rounds. Baseball&amp;rsquo;s Board Game is endorsed by Carlos Lee, Star Game player in 2005 and 2006, MLB Home Run Derby 2005, and current star of the Houston Astros.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
