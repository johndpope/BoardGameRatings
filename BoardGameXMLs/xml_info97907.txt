							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Game of Thrones: Genesis</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;A Game of Thrones &amp;ndash; Genesis&amp;quot;, Cyanide Studio&amp;rsquo;s new strategy game for PC, adaptation in a video game of the successful saga A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R Martin, finally unveils itself! We invite you today to discover the two very first screenshots taken from this real-time strategy game, in which your political prowess will be as important as your strategic and military skills!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to a well-developed single player campaign written under supervision of the author George R.R. Martin, &amp;quot;A Game of Thrones &amp;ndash; Genesis&amp;quot; immerses you into the heart of the battles and intrigues between the Houses that shaped the Kingdom of Westeros. Live the origins of the A Song of Ice and Fire saga through more than 1000 years of History, and take part in Westeros&amp;rsquo; founding events and largest battles such as Aegon the Conqueror&amp;rsquo;s invasion on the continent or the War of the Usurper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this great strategy game, victory does not necessarily result from brute force. You can choose to use a military approach and besiege your opponents, strangle them in an economical war, or even use dirty tricks and diplomacy to politically crush them. Treachery and deception are everywhere, so watch your back and prepare for battle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
