			<description>&amp;quot;Uchuu Race: Astro Go! Go! (宇宙レース アストロゴー！ゴー！, &amp;quot;Space Race: Astro Go! Go!&amp;quot;) is a Japan-exclusive racing video game for the Super Famicom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the game is in 3D, there is no camera rotation in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike F-Zero, losing the race due to death (falling in pits, running out of energy, etc.) is impossible because the rescue vehicle is always available to rescue players. The services of the rescue vehicle are used when the player is stuck in an unrecoverable situation or when the player falls into the bottomless pit. Players have a choice between a time trial mode and a Grand Prix mode. In the Grand Prix mode, the player is given five chances to get third place or better. Losing five times will ask the player to continue the game using the standings earned prior to getting disqualified, but the sixth loss will lead to game over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player's top five total times and the player's fastest lap are stored in the game's internal battery backed RAM. All fifteen courses can be played from the time trial mode, even those that have never been raced on Grand Prix mode. The game is single-player only.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Uchuu Race: Astro Go!
