							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monstrosity</name>
									
			<description>In the not-too distant future, a group of underground mad surgeons assemble creatures from spare mutated body parts and make them fight. Join the insanity and send your own personal monstrosity into battle against your opponent's creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monstrosity is played in two phases, with two distinct decks (50+ cards each). During the first round, players acquire spare body parts (arms, legs, torsos and heads) from the black market and construct creatures in their operating theaters. As each player collects mutated limbs and tries to assemble them, their opponent attempts to steal parts, sabotage the supplies, and generally dismantle the opposing creation. Round two pits the creatures against one another, as their owners play attack and defend cards to bolster their monstrosity's fighting abilities. It's a fast-paced, gruesome, and strategic battle game best suited for two players (although up to four can play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
