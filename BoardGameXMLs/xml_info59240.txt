			<description>From the Back of the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;At midnight everyone will die...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Azalin the lich lord is launching another diabolical plan. He has allied himself with the entity known as Death, and together they plan to raze the domain of Darkon. From the ashes of this once-mighty land will rise a new domain--Necropolis, the land of the dead!&lt;br/&gt;For the citizens of Darkon, death has become an everyday companion, and sometimes a yearned-for end to suffering. However, now the cold comfort of the grave is forever denied these good man and women as they find themselves walking the land after their breath has left them.&lt;br/&gt;Heroes have always considered the undead to be mere monsters, legions of mindless evil to be slain with no second thought. Now the heroes will learn the agony of actually being one of the living dead. They become the monsters, and the entire world becomes their enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This boxed set contains everything necessary to take your characters beyond death's veil and into the shadowy world of unlife, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Requiem: 96 pages of rules for the generation and play of undead characters as well as tips for Dungeon Masters. This book details 12 different types of creatures that characters can become after death, as well as dozens of powers and weaknesses they may possess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Necropolis: 32 pages covering the new domain of Necropolis. Although little has changed physically in the former domain of Darkon, the people, animals, plants, and even the land itself have been infused with the power of the new demilord, Death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Death Triumphant: A 64-page adventure that puts the heroes in the middle of Lord Azalin's ultimate scheme to escape Ravenloft. Death Triumphant can be played as a stand-alone adventure or as the final chapter in the Grim Harvest series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Poster Map: One two-sided, full-color map detailing the headquarters of Azalin's secret police and the new domain of Necropolis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For three to six characters of levels 6-10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
