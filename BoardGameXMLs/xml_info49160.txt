							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">It&#039;s a Dog&#039;s Life</name>
									
			<description>The second edition of the greatest prairie dog role-playing game ever. What Role in the Dawn Eagle Tribe will your character take? Be a Brave, strong and fearless with his Bark of Courage. Be a Healer with her lore of plants and her famed Bark of Life. Take the Role of a Scout, ever searching for the legendary First Town of Thundertown, never losing his direction. Or you could be the protector of the Tribe, a Sentinel, with eye for danger and his steadfast demeanor. The Speaker, with his knowledge of the ancient Prairie Tales and his mighty Bark of Command, is the heart of the Tribe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is full of Legends, Traditions, background into the prairie dog society and the town of Great Home, critters, adventures and adventure seeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a Dog&amp;rsquo;s Life is a fantasy game, but not in the traditional sense of elves, dwarves, magic and swordplay. The prairie dogs in this game take the place of the heroes that you might be used to playing. Although It&amp;rsquo;s a Dog&amp;rsquo;s Life is fantasy it does have its basis in reality and a lot of what is written about prairie dogs in these rules is taken from fact. There are more real-life facts about prairie dogs in the last chapter of this book, just in case you are interested. Some of these facts might even find their way into your own games and they will certainly help you understand more about these interesting critters. However, the game is not about playing real prairie dogs but fantasy ones. So don&amp;rsquo;t let real-life natural history rule your games - after all this is a game, so just go and have some fun with it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--publisher's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
