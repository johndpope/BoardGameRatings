			<description>A strategy game of selective acquisition! The modular gameboard consists of 15 black acrylic hexagon rings, 3&amp;quot; diameter. Each &amp;quot;cave&amp;quot; holds two gems drawn at random from the velvet bag. Your goal is to collect 3 different types of gems on each turn, from three caves adjacent in a straight line. A wild card (clear stone) lets you collect a fourth, or alter the board. Six kinds of gems (102 in all) with varying values and quantities to collect with careful planning. Refill the caves from the bag after each turn and mark the harvested hollows with 3 black stones. At least one of your three caves must contain a black stone. Tally your hoard when the bag is empty. Most novel feature&amp;mdash;the current player nominates who plays next! Don't worry, each player gets a turn in every round. Fascinating play for 1 to 5 players, Ages 8 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.gamepuzzles.com/abstrct2.htm#Gem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.gamepuzzles.com/abstrct2.htm#Gem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
