			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Village on the Hill players become little spirits called Kami whose sole purpose is to help people on Earth. This is an all-ages storytelling game about teamwork, positivity and harmony - a game that replaces combat with problem-solving and fosters creativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Kami has their own coloured aura, which helps them undertake tasks. For instance, a Kami with the purple Aura of the Body is strong and athletic. Character sheets are kept incredibly simple, with a focus on storytelling and interaction over rules. The game uses a framework of obstacles, consequences and resolutions to build a shared story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Village on the Hill is a game for 3-5 friends who want to get together for an hour or so to work together and have a great time doing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
