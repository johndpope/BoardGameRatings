			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They say a man with a lot of responsibility, a man who can perform a number of jobs wears many hats. Here at Helper Monkey, we've taken that sentiment to heart. If you have a problem, any problem, we'll dispatch a team of cybernetic monkeys to help you! Our team of monkeys come with bio-mechanical neural interfaces to give them the skills they need to complete any mission. This not only allows our monkeys to understand both written and spoken language, it also allows them to learn valuable skills based on the hats they equip themselves with. To have Helper Monkeys solve your problem, simply log on, describe the nature of your problem in 140 characters or less (we do accept tweets), and our code monkeys will trace you down and send a top team of gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans, and other simians to help you! No matter the problem, no matter how far, we have a monkey in a hat for that!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the Game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HelperMonkey.com is a silly game of action, adventure, and bananas. Each player takes on the role of a primate cybernetically enhanced to possess certain skills based on the specially prepared hats they wear. You'll choose your animal and adjust his abilities. Then, you'll choose his primary hat, which you are presumed to always have. You'll then choose one Perk and one Drawback. One player will not play one primate, but will instead represent the rest of the world. In different games, he has different titles, such as Game Master or Storyteller. In this game, he's the dispatcher, the one responsible for deciding what mission your monkeys will be sent on. He will also monitor the mission to keep you (and the code monkeys back at home base) aware of everything going on. If there's ever a question about what happens, the dispatch will monitor the situation impartially and make the call.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play this game, you will need some pencils, paper, a few players, some fudge dice (ideally four per player, but we'll talk about how to get around that later), some tokens to represent bananas, and some imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
