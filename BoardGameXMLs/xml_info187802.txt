			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This young country is in chaos. It was not too long ago that the founding fathers drafted the Declaration of Independence and formally recognized their separation from England. This is a tense time, one where a young nation should be developing its policies and stabilizing it&amp;rsquo;s government and economy and is instead being besieged on all sides by enemies. Two wars are being waged; a physical war against two distinctly hostile forces both looking to destroy the bonds holding the people together, and a spiritual war. Not just a war of ideology, but an attack on the essence of humanity. An unholy force of darkness is assaulting both the people&amp;rsquo;s militia and the greedy war mongering British. This chapter is intended for people with little knowledge of American colonial history. If you do not need context you can skip ahead to the section entitled &amp;ldquo;The End of Hope&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game combines fairly traditional role-playing rules (Attribute, Class, Skill, etc.) with an unusual and slightly comedic setting of Revolutionary-era Colonial America suffering an undead plague.  Much of the setting is presented as a series of short fiction pieces.  Just as America is plagued by the undead, the book is unfortunately plagued by typographical errors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
