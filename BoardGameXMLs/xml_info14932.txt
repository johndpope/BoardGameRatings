							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Erotic 4 real</name>
									
			<description>As the name indicates it's an erotic game, but not the sleazy kind. It's the perfect game for the couple who wants to get to know each other better. &lt;br/&gt;There are 3 categories of questions (ethics, emotions and passion) The first player reads the question and tries to guess what the partner would answer. The partner decides if this is the right answer or not. If the answer was right the first player rolls a dice and moves his/hers checker and picks up a gender card according to the first players gender. The gender cards tell you what to do to the partner. The winner is the player who has the least number of questions wrong and gets to choose one of the 10 winner card which can be anything from receiving a nice homemade dinner etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
