The player who plays tactically with his itinerary plans and exploits the ever-changing winds skillfully  has big chances to be the first to regain the home port. The game is also in a &amp;quot;race-variant&amp;quot; playable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives a yacht, two spinnakers cards and a number of port cards, which depends on the number of game participants. Pulled Harbor charts indicate which ports must be visited in each case. If you want to shorten or lengthen the playing time, one can agree on a larger or smaller number of port cards per person. In the &amp;quot;race-variant&amp;quot; is played with only 1 set of port cards, which is valid for all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publiced for Verlaghaus Die Barque&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
