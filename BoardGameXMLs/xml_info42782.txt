			<description>Only one player can play at a time. The length and inital letter of the word the player must generate is determined by spinner two spinners. The player has one minute, as timed by a sand timer, to generate that word on a specialty Word Clicking Unit. A player's score is determined by the value of the letters in the word composed. More common letters are worth less than less common letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to score one hundred points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
