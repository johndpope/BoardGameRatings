			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Black Spot is a storytelling game in which players act out the kinds of terrifying tales told in horror films like those of Sam Raimi, George A. Romero and Wes Craven. The ultimate fate of every player's character is determined via draws from a special deck of cards. Most of the rest of what happens in each story is left up to the players' imaginations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will Gretchen, the pensive cheerleader, outrun the Mad Slasher of Middletown Gorge? Will Hans, the happy-go-lucky drifter, ever discover the dark secret of that abandoned coal mine off Route 67? Will the passengers of Omega Airlines Flight 099 escape the desert island before awakening its grim and bloodthirsty protector? The answers to all such questions depend upon you, the player, with perhaps just the tiniest nudge from the hand of fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
