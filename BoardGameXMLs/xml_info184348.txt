			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the two founders of the Corellian Engineering Corporation started the company with a little seed money they had managed to gather from family and friends, beings throughout the Corellian system laughed and derided them for their vision of wanting to make quality spacecraft at affordable prices. No one expected Awvrell and Ilbourne Wayrcn to take the Corellian system by storm and forever turn shipwright manufacturing on its head by taking a company that started off in the backyard of the two brothers and turning it into one of the three largest manufacturers throughout the known galaxy and perhaps the most prolific manufacturer of the group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the Corellian Engineering Corps, the original name for the Corellian Engineering Corporation, established itself it became a long standing part of the Techno Union and building a permanent corporate headquarters located on C.E.C. Island, in the heart of Coronet the capital of Corellia. At the heart of company the dream of the Waycrn brothers has always remained the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
