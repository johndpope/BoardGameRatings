							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kubus Fugus</name>
									
			<description>Kubus Fugus consists of 30 wooden cubes (4 cm / 1.6 inch). Each cube has the same 6 different patterns on its sides, but no two cubes have the same arrangement of these six sides. The sides have dots or lines in different patterns, carved into the wooden surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player &amp;quot;owns&amp;quot; a type of side, e.g. the &amp;quot;cross&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;four dots&amp;quot; and places one cube on his turn onto the 5 x 6 grid board, starting from a corner. There are only a few rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Placing a cube, the sides surface-to-surface to another cube has to have the same pattern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. This also applies, if the cube has to fit in between two or three cubes already placed, thus limiting the possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. It is forbidden to place a cube in a way, that an adjacent cube cannot be placed. SO, sides facing a &amp;quot;spare&amp;quot; place are not allowed to be the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. There may not occur any &amp;quot;holes&amp;quot; on the board, so the whole grid is filled up slowly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since you have to draw your next cube randomly, there is a &amp;quot;luck factor&amp;quot;, for the limitations in placement can be huge or non-existent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring:&lt;br/&gt;If the grid is filled up - or cannot be filled any further - the sides showing upside are counted for each player. The player with the most sides showing up is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a lot of puzzles, too, for the 1-player-variant, and 3D-variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One special thing about this game is, that you can also play it blindfold or with blind people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
