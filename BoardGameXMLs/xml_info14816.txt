							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hordes &amp; Heroes</name>
									
			<description>Hordes &amp;amp; Heroes is a free, fast play, fantasy wargame designed to be played on a hexagon marked terrain using 10mm miniatures on (mostly) 20mmx40mm bases. The hexes are 100mm across, and can contain one unit of 4 or 6 stands.&lt;br/&gt;Movement is simple, up to number of hexes defined by unit type, or 1 hex in difficult terrain. Certain units can form column (reduced combat effectiveness) gaining +1 hex on clear terrain, or gain +1 hex on roads. Only units in command (by a general, hero, or wizard) can move.&lt;br/&gt;Combat is resolved with dice rolling, and using a simple Combat Results table with effects ranging from &amp;quot;No Effect&amp;quot; to forcing the unit to recoil, flee, and or losing stands. In case of recoil, and flight the winning unit may, or have to (depending on troop type) follow-up, and pursue.&lt;br/&gt;Troop types: infantry, mounted, mounted irregular, horde, behemoths, chariots, artillery, armored car (mechanical vehicles), flyers, mechanical flyers, and psychological.&lt;br/&gt;Command figures: generals, heroes, and magicians.&lt;br/&gt;Magic is kept to a minimum. (Only elemental summoning.)&lt;br/&gt;Simple siege rules are also included.&lt;br/&gt;And again, the rules are FREE, downloadable in pdf format.&lt;br/&gt;Check out the publisher's site offering modular terrain to be used with the rules, and 10mm miniatures packs. You can also find a pdf battle report there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
