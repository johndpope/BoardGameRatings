			<description>This is a roll and move game (also playable without the use of dice) on a Byzantine Chessboard.  Object of the game is to be the last remaining player.  In the game players will in the regular game, move as far as a single six sided die the roll tells them to, trying to avoid barriers put up in the game by players as they move.  In the game, as players get eliminated, they end up removing barriers the drop as the move.  The game feels a bit light a light cycle race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to be the last remaining player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the diceless variant, player's movement is governed by what other pieces are on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
