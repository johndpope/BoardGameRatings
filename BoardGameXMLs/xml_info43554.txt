			<description>T.O.O.L. is a boardgame inspired by M.U.L.E., Dani Bunten's revolutionary computer game from 1983. Players take the role of space pioneers that land on a barren planet, and go on to build a colony around a town square. Will the pioneers work together to help the colony flourish and prosper? Or will they sacrifice the colony's well being for their own financial benefit?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;T.O.O.L. is an exercise in supply and demand economics involving competition between three or four players. To win, players must cooperate for the survival of the colony while balancing the need to acquire the most wealth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Central to the game is the acquisition of land, and the use of TOOLs to harvest resources from that land. Each of the four resources has a unique purpose, and each one is vital to successful life on the colony. These resources are then bought and sold at a market, where supply and demand dictate the price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At its core, T.O.O.L. features a modular board and no luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
