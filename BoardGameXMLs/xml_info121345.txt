			<description>Sega Superstars is a game developed by Sonic Team in 2004 for the PlayStation 2 EyeToy. It features a series of games based on previous Sega titles. It also contains Chao, the virtual pets from the Sonic series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More games in the Sega Superstars series were produced, including Sega Superstars Tennis and Sonic &amp;amp; Sega All-Stars Racing. Both were developed for multiformats, including Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii and Nintendo DS. However, rather than having been developed by Sonic Team themselves, instead, they were developed by Sumo Digital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is similar to that of Eyetoy: Play, in which players use their body to play a variety of minigames. However, while that game only picked up player's movement, Sega Superstars uses a more advanced system. Before the start of each game, a setup screen with an orange area is shown. In order to start the game, players have to stand in a position where the orange area won't pick up any movement and select the continue button. This method determines what area is the background, allowing Eyetoy to pick up the player's position, as opposed to just what areas are moving. This is particularly prominent in games like Puyo Puyo, that uses the player's entire body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a total of 12 different full games to play in the main mode of Sega Superstars:&lt;br/&gt;    Sonic the Hedgehog &amp;ndash; As Sonic runs down a round tunnel, he follows the position of the player's hand. Using this method, the aim of the game is to gather rings and Chaos Emeralds in order to obtain the highest score at the end of the game. It is much like the Special Stage on Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic Heroes, and especially Sonic Rush.&lt;br/&gt;    Samba de Amigo &amp;ndash; Players choose a song, and then must hit 6 different targets around the screen as the 'beat balls' reach them in time with the music. Posing with hands over 2 of the targets, or holding one position until a trail of beat balls is complete, may also be required from the player.&lt;br/&gt;    ChuChu Rocket! &amp;ndash; Movement over a certain target on the screen will cause a bridge to raise, which the chu-chus then follow to the goal. The bridge also must be dropped at certain moments to prevent KapuKapus from destroying the score.&lt;br/&gt;    Puyo Pop Fever &amp;ndash; Differently colored puyos will fall from the top of the screen, and the player's body must be positioned to guide them into the corresponding pots and allow bombs to topple off the bottom of the screen.&lt;br/&gt;    Crazy Taxi &amp;ndash; Large movements and loud sounds must be undertaken to stop the Crazy Taxi and complete the level.&lt;br/&gt;    Super Monkey Ball &amp;ndash; The player must move their arms into different positions in order to guide the monkey ball around obstacles and towards the goal, picking up as many bananas as possible along the way.&lt;br/&gt;    NiGHTS Into Dreams &amp;ndash; NiGHTS must be controlled and navigated through rings, collecting chips along the way, by raising the arms into a 'flying' position and adjusting them along the way.&lt;br/&gt;    House of the Dead &amp;ndash; A multitude of different zombies must be attacked and defeated by hitting them. Innocent people who occasionally appear must also be avoided.&lt;br/&gt;    Virtua Striker &amp;ndash; As footballs drop from the top of the screen, the aim is to head them into differently colored and scored balloons on the opposite side of the screen in order to obtain the highest score.&lt;br/&gt;    Virtua Fighter &amp;ndash; Standing to one side, players kick and punch the corresponding attack prompts on the screen in order to defeat the opponent. Block and counter prompts also appear, and must be reacted to accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;    Space Channel 5 &amp;ndash; Different dance move combination must be remembered when shown by the Morolians, and then repeated in time to the music by hitting six different buttons on the screen.&lt;br/&gt;    Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg &amp;ndash; By waving their hands over two different targets, players must move Billy and the egg around, and crush enemies and collect fruits along the way to the goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extra modes:&lt;br/&gt;    In the &amp;quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&amp;quot; game, successfully completing all three difficulties with Sonic will unlock Shadow's story, which allows to control Shadow instead of Sonic, although this story is much harder.&lt;br/&gt;    In the &amp;quot;Puyo Pop Fever&amp;quot; game, by successfully completing all three levels, the player will unlock a mode called &amp;quot;Free Mode&amp;quot; that allows players to simply play around with puyos and experiment with moving them around.&lt;br/&gt;    In the &amp;quot;NiGHTS into Dreams&amp;quot; game, successfully completing all three levels opens up a new night-time area (Twin Seeds) with harder levels and different scenery.&lt;br/&gt;    Completing all three levels on both &amp;quot;Samba De Amigo&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Chu Chu Rocket&amp;quot; unlocks an extra-hard difficulty setting.&lt;br/&gt;    Also available is a variation of the Tiny Chao Garden from different Sonic games. Here, a Chao can be hatched and petted via different movements. It is also possible to interact with some scenery (shaking trees for fruit) and purchase items for the Chao using rings collected in the main game mode.&lt;br/&gt;    In the &amp;quot;Samba De Amigo&amp;quot; game, if every song is played, DLC songs from the first game will be added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sega Superstars&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
