			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grand Master is an action-RPG for the Famicom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls Rodi, a knight on a quest to save princess Serena from Dante the Demon King.  Rodi wields a variety of weapons including a sword, axe, moringstar, and a magic rod.  The game consists of 5 main stages which can be played in any order; followed by the final stage in 6 parts.  The order they are played in will effect the stories plot.  It's even possible to get a bad ending if the stages are played in the wrong order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is in the style of The Legend of Zelda. You explore areas in an overhead view, find treasure chests, and defeat bosses.  There is a simple leveling system with experience points.  You can find items and upgrades such as a shield, armor, and weapon upgrades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
