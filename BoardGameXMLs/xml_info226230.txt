			<description>SUM2ZERO is the innovative card game that puts a spin on zero-sum game theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy to Play&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 10 cards.  The object of the game is to place 1 to 3 cards, so that your cards plus the base card add to zero. The first player with no cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red cards are negative numbers from -1 to -12 while black cards are positive numbers from +1 to +12. Action cards &amp;ndash; Boom!, Reset, Checked, Imaginary, Thunder, and Cubit - have been added to give it a twist!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in the Box&lt;br/&gt;104 total cards&lt;br/&gt;- 44 positive number (1 to 12) cards&lt;br/&gt;- 44 negative number (-1 to -12) cards&lt;br/&gt;- 3 positive and 3 negative imaginary cards&lt;br/&gt;- 2 Boom!, 2 Reset, 2 Checked, 2 Thunder, and 2 Cubit cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Examples:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the base card is positive 7, a player could throw a negative 7 card.&lt;br/&gt;(+7) + (-7) = 0&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the base card is positive 7, a player could throw a negative 1, negative 2, and negative 4 cards.&lt;br/&gt;(+7) + (-1) + (-2) + (-4) = 0&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the base card is positive 7, a player could throw a positive 8, negative 10, and negative 5 cards.&lt;br/&gt;(+7) + (+8) + (-10) + (-5) = 0&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the base card is positive 7, a player could throw a negative imaginary card (choose the card to be -11) and a positive 4.&lt;br/&gt;(+7) + (-i) + (+4)= 0&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
