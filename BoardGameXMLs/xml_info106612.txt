							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wolf of the Battlefield: Commando 3</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the third game in the &amp;quot;Commando&amp;quot; series and holds true to the classic gameplay of the original. It is a top-down, dual-thumbstick shooter that oozes with 80s vibe. The player chooses one of the three playable Jackals: Wolf, Coyote, or Fox. There is no real difference in their gameplay, just their appearance. Each of the 5 levels features hundreds of enemies that stream toward the characters as the screen scrolls onward. The gamer picks of weapon power-ups that enable them to use one of four different weapons: spread gun, machine gun, flamethrower, or missile launcher. You also have the ability to lob grenades and unleash a screen-clearing &amp;quot;M-Crash&amp;quot;. There are also four difficulty levels: cake walk, routine exercise, black ops and suicide mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a single player option as well as network co-op multiplayer for up to 3 players. There is no local multiplayer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
