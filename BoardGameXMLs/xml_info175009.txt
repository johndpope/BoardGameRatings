							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Occult Chronicles</name>
									
			<description>The Occult Chronicles is a strategy game of adventure and exploration. Games usually take just a few hours to complete and dying a horrible death is all part of the experience. You will quickly get a feel for how far you can push your luck and often you will still push it too far because you think that snake eyes will never happen to you. Sometimes you&amp;rsquo;ll just run into some plain bad luck and find your desiccated bones littering a shabby corner of some forlorn mansion. So you&amp;rsquo;ll need to master the ability of knowing when to hold them, when to fold them and when to run away in stark raving terror. All that matters is that you complete your mission and make it out alive&amp;hellip;.or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
