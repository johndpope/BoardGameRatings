							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tank Operations: European Campaign</name>
									
			<description>Tank Operations: European Campaign is a turn-based, tactically demanding strategy game packed with a dozen historical scenarios set on the battlefields of World War II. With more than 50 faithfully-rendered, authentic army, navy and air force units, buildings and fortifications, tactical sabotage and supply chain management, the title offers challenging fun for clever strategists of all ranks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dynamically progressing missions lead virtual field marshals through a life-and-death campaign comprising 12 scenarios, from the landing of Allied troops in northwestern Africa to the invasion of Southern Italy, from the liberation of Paris to the final battle in Berlin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DessertEnemy troops actively react to the player&amp;rsquo;s decisions in each new battle, putting increasingly sophisticated tactics into play. The player can counter them with up to ten different special actions. The lightweight, well-designed interface enables the player to give orders to troops on the battlefield quickly and decisively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A dozen historical scenarios&lt;br/&gt;- More than 50 authentic units&lt;br/&gt;- More than 10 special actions&lt;br/&gt;- Strategically demanding challenges&lt;br/&gt;- Supply chain management&lt;br/&gt;- Tactical sabotage&lt;br/&gt;- Dynamic mission progression&lt;br/&gt;- Formidable enemy AI&lt;br/&gt;- Engaging turn-based gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
