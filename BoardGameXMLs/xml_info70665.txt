			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gran Turismo for the PSP was released both as a UMD-based game and as a PlayStation Store digital download; one of the launch titles for the PSP Go handheld system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features all of the core elements common to the Gran Turismo series, and the developers were keen to see that the game was seen not just as a 'portable' Gran Turismo, but as a full game in its own right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using an open-ended system of race progression, tailored for the short 'bursts' of gameplay common to handheld systems, Gran Turismo still features many of the gameplay elements from previous games in the series, including car buying/selling and driving challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also features several features absent from the previously released Gran Turismo 5: Prologue on PlayStation 3, such as the aforementioned driving challenges ('licenses') and rally modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On release, the game was praised by critics for its graphical fidelity - particularly given the portable hardware it runs on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
