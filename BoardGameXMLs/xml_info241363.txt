							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chimera Package (1980)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you think the legendary Chimera was hard to handle, wait until you try this Chimera Package, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reflex - round and round the little white ball rolls.  Only fast reflexes can guide it into the center of the maze.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon - you'll have to shoot down those pesky, fire-breathing dragons with your cannon.  If you succeed your castle will be safe; if not it will mean a call to your fire insurance company.  For one player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon - a very punctual guard comes down to the dungeon every day to torture you.  This means that you have only thirty seconds to dig your way under the castle to freedom.  For one player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon Hunt - you must go forth and slay a fire-breathing dragon.  The only thing that will protect you from the flames is your shield, if you know when to use it.  For one player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dropoff - you must make your opponent's men &amp;quot;dropoff&amp;quot; the board by moving and firing your own men.  For one or two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
