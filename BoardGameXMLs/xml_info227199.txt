			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I wrote this as a &amp;quot;sequel&amp;quot;, if you will, to Uncle Figgy's Guide to Good Game Mastering. I realized (after it was all done with, of course) that there are always tips for how a person can be a better Game Master, but very few on how a person can be a better player. And that's why I decided to write this guide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In so doing, I make the assumption that the reader has more than just a passing familiarity with roleplaying. That he or she has roleplayed in the past, knows the important terms and concepts, and is now looking to be a better player. As such, Uncle Figgy's Guide to Good Roleplaying really isn't for the person seeking to learn the basics of roleplaying, but more for the player who has mastered the basics and now seeks to go farther.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
