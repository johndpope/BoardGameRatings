							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Slayer&#039;s Guide to Kraken</name>
									
			<description>Nearly all monsters are shrouded in some mystery. Even the so-called &amp;quot;common&amp;quot; beasts that plague the intelligent races are in some ways unknown despite efforts to probe their secrets. Many become increasingly familiar to us as we constantly ask of our friends and allies, and from this information we piece together what we can. However, there are some creatures that will forever resist our attempts. Those that live beyond the material world are, by definition, inexplicable: anything we can learn is so otherworldly as to defy interpretation. However, even here on this plane there are creatures that we cannot hope to gather much information on. Of these creatures, the kraken stands in the forefront as the most mysterious. The Slayers Guide to Kraken offers an enormous amount of detail on these creatures, from their society through to kraken-worshipping prestige classes. A fully detailed example lair is also presented, to get your players right into the thick of things!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
