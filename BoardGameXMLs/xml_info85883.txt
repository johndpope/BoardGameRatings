			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The weather-beaten well-tanned old man with a bushy white beard wearing a well worn oil skin and leaning against the shop&amp;rsquo;s wall takes the charred and beaten old wooden pipe from his mouth and, knocking it out on his palm, clears his throat and startles the children.  &amp;ldquo;Well, lads, I would bet you that that there be the handy work of the infamous pair of Captain Red Jack Roberts and his partner Ezekiel Drake.&amp;rdquo;  Bending down and pulling a worn leather journal and quill from a gunny sack, he says, &amp;ldquo;I guess that&amp;rsquo;s my cue.  If you lads would excuse me I have to go talk to those survivors.&amp;rdquo;  With that, the old man picked up the gunny sack and set off toward the crowd that had gathered around the damaged ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blades of the Buccaneers: The Weapons of Captain Red Jack Roberts is the first book in a collection of books written by Old Pete, a scholar and sailor that has been dubbed &amp;ldquo;The Voice of the Sea.&amp;rdquo;  This product tells the story of the charismatic Red Jack Roberts and his companion, the skillful Ezekiel Drake through the blades that pass through their hands.  This book contains 16 weapons with a unique feel, detailed description and a history that both tells the story of the weapon and its wielders.  Most of the weapons in this product have a nautical or gadget-like feel to them.  The book also contains detailed rules for weapon entrapping and breaking and six feats that enhance these rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
