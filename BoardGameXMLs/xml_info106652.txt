			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Epicenter Rising, Written by Tim Hitchcock, serves as the pilot to an ongoing series set in the Great City. This is not the first adventure in a path, but instead, it concerns a mysterious event that will forever alter the Great City, setting the tone for future events. Throughout the year, &amp;Oslash;one games will release a number of short adventures whose various plots are all somehow entwined with the event. Each will be a stand-alone adventure, designed to be played independently without a specific sequence and can be completed in a single evening&amp;rsquo;s play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the centuries Azindralea, The Great City, has witnessed and bore numerous changes that come with the passage of time. It has survived miracles and devastation, revolution, and even the threat of apocalypse. Though still struggling to recover from recent uprisings that tore apart the throne, the City has fallen into a quiet peace. Yet there are several who eerily proclaim this peace shall be short lived. Among them stand faceless prophets who wander the streets hidden beneath shadowed cowls and whose dark whispers insinuate the genesis of a new era soon to befall the City. Dubbed fear-mongers, the Kortezian guard has posted warrants for those who falsely spread terror and incite the public. They arrested a handful of these so-called prophets, only to identify them as the bourgeoisie&amp;rsquo;s idle youth in the midst of performing an elaborate prank. Yet many believe that behind every seemingly innocuous hoax, lies deep-rooted conspiracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Epicenter Rising is an Adventure for the Pathfinder RPG System for 1st-level Player Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
