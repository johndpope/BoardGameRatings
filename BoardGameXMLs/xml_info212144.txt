							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kingdom Duel</name>
									
			<description>There once was a Kingdom where precious gems where the most invaluable treasure, but as every treasure comes with wealth it also comes with tragedies. Wars besieged the kingdom, every habitant desire for these treasures was bigger than the love for peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the Kingdom will perish in the hands of War, The king decided  to take part of the battle and ended it the best way possible. He and his followers decided to create some way to stop the war by allowing the combatants to face each other in a game where there was no bloodshed, so they invented Kingdom Duel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kingdom Duel is a Board Card Game where the players use their heroes, alongside Skill Cards to defeat the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Kingdom duel we have a modular board which can be modified as we like, we also have Heroes that will help us win and defend our walls from the upcoming attacks. Every Hero has their own set of abilities that can be use against the enemy or to help your own party win the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
