			<description>This is a Deer Hunting Game tested and approved by Deer Hunters.&lt;br/&gt;This game captures the essence of the hunt. Nearly every element of sitting in your tree stand waiting for the big buck to appear is woven into the fabric of this wonderful game. Players pick cards from 4 piles representing different locations in the woods, these cards include the deer, its orientation to the hunter and the range. When a player has all three he can shoot if he has the available tags. The deer are constantly moving and players need to make decisions about using an extra shot, buying an extra deer tag, or a scope.&lt;br/&gt;Hunters can fall asleep, spook deer, and track blood trails if not a clean shot. Not only is it fun for hunters, but non hunters love it too. The player with the most weight wins. There is also two score modifiers, the Deer Magnet razz given to a player who misses his shot, and the Warden who visits once per game. &lt;br/&gt;There is also a legendary King (ghost) Buck that is so elusive the game provides a hall of fame certificate to record any hunter who manages to bag this enormous buck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
