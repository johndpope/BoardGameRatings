			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our moonbase is being attacked by aliens!  In response to their call for help, your mothership has gone into lunar orbit overhead.  Now you've got to land and rescue the moonbase crew, your two man rescue craft will have to make several trips to get them all out.  Once you've maneuvered through the asteroid belt, avoided the mountain peaks and landed safely, the real trouble starts!  The aliens reveal themselves and you've got to blast your way back to the mothership!  A lot of action, with color and sound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By John Wilson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
