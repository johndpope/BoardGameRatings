							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Delve Adventurer&#039;s Guide</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;All of the Dungeon, None of the Map&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delve is an exciting new fantasy adventure game that's built on story-game principles but designed to emulate old-school dungeon crawling action. Delve's philosophy is that a dungeon isn't a place, it's a plot, and the rules provide a framework for unfolding exciting adventures without the frustrations of being bound to a piece of grid paper. No more hours of boring play due to your thief never being able to make a lock-picking check, or getting into arguments because someone put a hallway to the east instead of to the west: just push ahead, earn your Adventure Points, and find the quest at your own pace!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
