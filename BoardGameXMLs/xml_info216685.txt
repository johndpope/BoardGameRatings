			<description>From the foreword:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I always liked simple rules systems for RPGs. I'd rather have a system I can pick up and play within minutes than a system where character creation alone takes hours. So, when I was looking for systems I could use for a lovecraftian game, I was delighted when I found Cthulhu Dark by Graham Walmsley. It was an elegant, easy to grasp system and explaining the rules and creating characters could be done in less than 5 minutes, theoretically. However, it was also a bit too simple. So I was even happier when I found Cthulhu Grey, a hack by Aaron M. Sturgill, whose group also thought the system was too simple, prompting Sturgill to change and expand the original Cthulhu Dark, by adding, for example, a stat to represent physical harm and a rudimentary skill system to make the characters more distinct. However, that was not enough for me and my group. I wanted rules that could apply to campaign play. Another player wanted more options to define his character. We also found the Insanity and Harm systems lacking a bit. So me and Jakob got together and brainstormed some ideas. Some just refinements of Sturgill's system, some inspired by systems found in Call and Trail of Cthulhu, and even some new, original ideas. In the end, we came up with a system that, in our eyes, kept the spirit of Cthulhu Dark &amp;ndash; a quick, easy to grasp system in which a character is defined almost entirely by words instead of numbers &amp;ndash; but also improved it for players who still want a bit more meat to their gameplay and want to play some longer campaigns, with deteriorating physical and mental states and character progression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We sincerely hope that other friends of lovecraftian horror and RPGs will enjoy this system. Have fun going mad!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
