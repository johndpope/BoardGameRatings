			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play the role of Spycat. After loyally (?) serving M.I.4. &amp;frac12; for over fifty years, you hear that you are soon to be retired - with only a pittance of a pension! This has something to do with M.I.4. &amp;frac12;'s cash shortages and the government's recent budget-cuts. You feel humiliated and betrayed; you resolve to find three important classified research documents, then flee to Greenland to write your memoirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During your endeavours, you will come across some familiar faces. Enlist their support if you can; you will need all the help you can get. Watch out for the technical wizard &amp;quot;Q&amp;quot; and his many strange (and dangerous) creations. At one stage, you will need to make a journey to somewhere so secret that no-one knows where it is!?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was written by Peter Scott under the pseudonym &amp;quot;Dylan&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
