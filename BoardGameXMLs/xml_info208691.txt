							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Trial 2D10</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the new 2D10 RPG, the Trial is a free fantasy adventure centered in a frontier village called Jegyr's Creek, following upon events presented in the first and second parts of the trilogy, the Truce &amp;amp; the Trail. The heroes have discovered a grave threat in the woods, a horde massing to destroy civilization. Aided by centaurs and local townsfolk, the adventurers must explore an ancient tomb to see if it contains something that might help good prevail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best of all, it's one page. And free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trial is the third part in a trilogy of adventures which can be inserted into a fantasy setting of choice or used to form the backdrop of a larger story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background Notes: This adventure was actually written many years ago, rediscoverd in a backup archive, and edited for use with 2D10. You can easily use it with another game system of choice. In particular, this one could be fleshed out more or easily modified to feel even more epic. Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
