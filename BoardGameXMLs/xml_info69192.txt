			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While planning ahead for each gaming session is critical, often times players do something unexpected. This can leave DMs struggling for quality material on a moment's notice. For you, we present Common Ground. Not yet another Random Generator! Not another Campaign or World System! The unique generation system in this series will allow you as DM to have a fully detailed map of an interesting location, stock it with fully equipped NPCs, and populate it with other likely patrons all in under 5 minutes on a handy reference sheet. Common Ground is designed for use right at the gaming table, at a moment's notice. Of course you could use it in pre-game planning as well. You, as DM, choose the details you need from different categories. The site you make thus fits your campaign setting. NPCs you create are appropriate to your world. The Common Ground generation system gives you basic stats for a wide variety of NPCs, objects, traps, etc., and then let's you customize for the unique traits - race, alignment, challenge rating, type, description - whatever you need. Hundreds of different sites are possible without having to work through table after table of possible items. The Common Ground series continues with all new sites: Thieves Guilds Private Clubs and an updated Guard Towers Of course the tool includes: Fully detailed maps; NPCs with gear, any race, any alignment, domains, and spells; Trap and Lock details; Quick reference sheets for future re-use All in just 5 minutes! Not a random generator - you are in control to make it fit your campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
