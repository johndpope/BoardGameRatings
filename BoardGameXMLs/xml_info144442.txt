							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">UNO: Jelly Belly Special Edition</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;UNO teams up with Jelly Belly for this special edition of the fast-paced card game loved by millions.  Each game box includes a special deck of bean-shaped UNO cards, Jelly Belly jelly beans and special rules that sweeten the play.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;54 cards&lt;br/&gt;3.5 oz. Jelly Belly jelly beans (5 flavors)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compared to a standard Uno deck, there are half as many cards, with only one Wild and one Wild Draw Four but still four zeroes.  The rules state that when you force someone to draw cards (with a Draw 2 or wild Draw 4) you can take that many beans from the source pile.  If you collect 10 beans, you may immediately discard all cards but one in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
