			<description>From the publisher's website bigboardraiders.net :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I do not have any affiliation with any investment entity and I am not encouraging anyone to invest in anything. This is intended for your entertainment and learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think we all know young boys or girls who seem like they were hard-wired for finance. When the subject of money is being discussed, they are right there like spounges soaking it up. I know because I was one of them, but my parents didn't take the time to teach me about money. Today lots of parents still don't teach their kids enough about money, and yet our kids will all deal with money most days in their lives and how early they begin to understand money, will directly influence their lifestyle. This game is for parents to encourage those little finance prodigies. The world is changing to where the cash in your hand is the crumbs from the table, while the banquet is inside the corporations. For Grade 5 and up, but best for teens and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Big Board&amp;rdquo; is like a nickname for Wall Street, while &amp;ldquo;Raiders&amp;rdquo; are the teams of entrepreneurs, lawyers, accountants, brokers and investment bankers who engaged in hostile takeovers of the companies they pursue. In Big Board Raiders, players can gang-up by pooling their capital to promote a cause or stop another player, but alliances don&amp;rsquo;t last forever and when they end, backstabbing is an inevitable strategy. Communication and deal making are very important enhancements to a player&amp;rsquo;s game strategy. A few choice words can help your portfolio or have the opposite effect on your opponent&amp;rsquo;s. It&amp;rsquo;s all about opportunities, timing and the hustle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two main objectives players engage in while playing Big Board Raiders; the first is to get elected by proxy as a director of a company and the second is to grow your portfolio using the many investment vehicles, so that you will have the capital to make your move to control your company; the company in which you were elected to the board by proxy. There are four trading companies: Yellow, Blue, Red, and Green. Six Subsidiaries, and each of these subsidiaries has a proxy vote that it gives to the players as they land on their subsidiary space on the game board. To win, grow your capital while collection the proxy votes to be elected as a director, then buy enough shares to take over control of that company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
