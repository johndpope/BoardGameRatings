							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scoundrel</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concentrating on Rogue and Drifter careers, Scoundrel brings to life some of the most favoured characters in Traveller - those who avoid legitimate lines of work, who straddle the grey areas of the law. Expanding the Rogue and Drifter careers, Scoundrel shows you just how to survive in a universe that insists on everyone doing an honest day&amp;rsquo;s work, without actually having to work for it. From confidence tricksters and gamblers to smugglers and thieves, Scoundrel is an essential companion for any Rogue or Drifter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some are dreamers, wishing to see the universe before settling down and conforming. Others are true independents, preferring to live and work away from the confines of civilisation and avoiding contact with all but a few close friends and companions. Then there are the true rogues and villains, Criminals who look to profit upon the weak, willing to break any law which tries to curtail their ruthless ambition and greed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoundrel deals with those living on the edges of society, from primitive barbarians to criminal masterminds and their minions. Inside are rules and information covering smuggling, piracy and criminal organisations. For those following more legal occupations gambling and salvaging are also detailed as well as an array of patrons with an assortment of odd jobs to keep the travellers occupied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking advantage of everything in this book will lead to many exciting adventures, as long as the travellers remain one step ahead of the law!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
