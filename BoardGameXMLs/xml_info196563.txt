							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Robot Jump Jump</name>
									
			<description>Super Robot Jump Jump is a 2D platformer with a simple control scheme. The game is about a Robot and his brain (CPU) inadvertently going off on an adventure. As you explore the various worlds you will learn of a great tale of adventure and bewilderment. It's a light hearted platformer for medium to high skill players. It features two difficulty modes, two player local co-op, and four worlds including boss encounters to overcome. The game was made mostly by Matt Rathbun as his first venture into indie development (and game development in general). The game includes art by Sebastian Wagner and music and audio by Ben Nichols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
