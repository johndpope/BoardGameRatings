			<description>This children's game combines a deck of 54 small cards and a playing board. The board has outlines of four large clown faces, each containing 12 spaces for cards. There also are six green spaces for individual cards. Each of the cards has a number and either a piece of clown face or an animal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt eight cards each, with the remainder forming a draw pile. In turn each must try to play a card on one of the spaces. The first player must play either a 1 card on one of the clown noses or an animal card on a green space. If he can do neither, he draws a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each clown face must be built up in number order, from 1 (nose) to 2 (eyes), 3 (mouth) 4 (eyebrows), 5-6 (ears) and finally 7 (hair). There are two spaces for eyebrows, eyes, mouth, and upper and lower ears, and the right and left numbered spaces must have precisely matching parts on each face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player either plays a card or draws until one player managers to win by being the first to empty his hand. The rules recommend continuing the game until all the clown faces are filled out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
