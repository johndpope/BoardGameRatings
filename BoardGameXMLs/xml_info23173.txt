			<description>Though the seas were calm, the public was not. Startling headlines with the sad news were everywhere! Our lovable &amp;quot;Baby New Year&amp;quot; has been taken from us!  Oh, the joyous holiday seasons will never be the same&amp;hellip;.in fact, every day will be just like the one before until the babe is found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems that while the world was celebrating the end of the old year and the start of the new, the year's first holiday representative, Baby New Year was abducted from the cruise ship USS Festival sometime between the hours of 11:00 PM and midnight. The &amp;quot;holidays&amp;quot; were taking their annual cruise on the Celebration Sea. Father Time, in preparation of his annual &amp;quot;departure&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;entrance&amp;quot; of the Baby at the stroke of 12, discovered the missing infant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come meet the recently divorced Santa, accompanied by his new gal, Candy Cane. Move over Hugh Hefner as Jelly Bean pays tribute to the Easter Bunny.    Halloween is represented by Jill and Jack O'Lantern and of course you will get to meet our Thanksgiving pilgrims, the Standishes&amp;hellip;.Miles and his infamous wife, Lucky. So get out your life jackets and hop aboard the USS Festival and help find the missing Baby New Year! Bon Voyage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
