			<description>A strategic game of adventure and dexterity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fabulous city of Paleo was swallowed up by the oceans 5,000 years ago and fell into oblivion. A parchment manuscript has just been discovered, revealing the location of its gates. The city&amp;rsquo;s immense riches described in the manuscript have inspired much desire and greed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the head of a team of explorers and mercenaries, you have set up camp in the Paleo Archipelago. But other teams have also arrived at the scene.&lt;br/&gt;Protected by your mercenaries, your explorers are ready to launch a search for the keys that will give access to the city. It is up to you to take advantage of the archipelago&amp;rsquo;s many reefs in order to stay ahead of your competitors.&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;In the basic two-player version of Paleo, players set up the 65 x 65 cm board with four central reefs, two sanctuaries for each player in the corners of the board, and five supplemental reefs placed according to various rules. Each player controls a team of five explorers and three mercenaries; you move these pieces by flicking them with your finger as in Crokinole. If your mercenary hits an opponent&amp;rsquo;s piece, that piece is removed from the board; remove all of the opponent&amp;rsquo;s pieces, and you win the round and score one point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The explorers are used to enter the opponent&amp;rsquo;s sanctuaries and recover two keys that then allow the player to enter the gate of Paleo in the center of the board. (Any of your pieces that enters a sanctuary can be exchanged for another piece already captured by the opponent.) This victory is worth two points, and a complete game requires a player to earn four points to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are included to accommodate three or four players, in addition to rules for ten other games for 2-4 players such as hockey, a kayak race, and Capture the King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
