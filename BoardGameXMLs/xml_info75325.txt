			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Making History: The Calm &amp;amp; The Storm is a World War II grand strategy computer game released in March 2007 by developer Muzzy Lane. Similar in ways to the popular board games Axis and Allies and Risk, Making History is turn-based with basic industrial, economic, resource, research and diplomatic management included, with inspiration possibly drawn from the Civilization PC game series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As of patch 2.03 players are able to play as any nation that had international recognition from 1936-1945, although players are encouraged to select from one of the more powerful entities of the era, namely Nationalist China, France, Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, Imperial Japan, The United Kingdom, The United States or the USSR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
