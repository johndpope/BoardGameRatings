							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Umbra</name>
									
			<description>DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Umbra is to move all five of your pieces to your victory zone. There are two players, North and South. Each player has five pieces. North's pieces are concave, South's pieces are convex. There are two zones on the board. Each zone consists of five positions marked by a nearby colored circle. The zones serve two purposes. At the start of game, each player takes turns placing their pieces in their starting zone. North's starting zone is at the top of the board, South's starting zone is at the bottom. North's starting zone is South's victory zone, and similarly, South's starting zone is North's victory zone. Once the placement phase has completed, the player's take turns moving one of their stones. The first player to move all of their pieces to the victory zone such that all piece colors match the color markings of the victory zone, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Umbra has a puzzle like quality to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PIECE MOVEMENT:&lt;br/&gt;Once all pieces have been placed, a piece can move in one of the follwing ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STEP move - The piece can move to any adjacent position. &lt;br/&gt;JUMP move - The piece can perform a non-capturing jump over an enemy piece as long as the target position advances the piece towards the victory zone. &lt;br/&gt;SWAP move - If your piece is adjacent to an enemy piece and the enemy piece is in your victory zone, the positions of the two pieces are exchanged.&lt;br/&gt;Note: To make the move, drag your piece and drop it over the enemy piece. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
