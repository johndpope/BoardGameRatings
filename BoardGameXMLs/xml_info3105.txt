			<description>A mix of action cards, special dice and drawing tiles as cowboys collect mustangs into their corral. The square tiles have multi-coloured edges, and players should place tiles to match the colours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From MNG-AJM Games Catalog 2005: Wild west ranching game in which the players try to get as many horses and especially broncos into their paddocks as possible. This is done by drawing and laying tiles, where the edges of the tiles must match those they are laid adjacent to on the paddock boards.  Action cards allow a leader to be kept in check, and the need to keep your herd together so it is harder for others to raid it adds to the decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
