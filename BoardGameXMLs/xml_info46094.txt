			<description>Introduction to the adventure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to the CITY OF TERRORS. This is the first open-air solitaire dungeon. It is set in the City of Gull on the sunbaked tropical island of Phoron. You come by ship, you disembark and are taken by carriage to the hotel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You take a room and tip the clerk 20 gps to make sure that your things don't get ripped off. Between adventures, you may drop stuff off in your room, change your clothing, or exchange your weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any humanoid creature, be it orc, ogre, or elf may journey here. If you happen to be a man-tiger (courtesy of the justifiably infamous Ken St. Andre and the Deathtrap Equalizer Dungeon) you will find what your are looking for to the east of the hotel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic may be used, but only in the very limited way it is allowed here. If I don't specifically say you can use it, you can't. There are job openings in Gull - if you sign on, follow the directions at your place of employment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dungeon was designed with the well-rounded, mid-level character in mind. However, at times a first-leveler will win out where a superhero loses. Keep this in mind. IF YOU ARE KILLED AS THE RESULT OF MISSING A SAVING ROLL, YOU MAY GO TO 4D AND GET ANOTHER CHANCE AT LIFE. If you forget to go there - and you are not reminded inside - then you die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At times your rewards will be in technologically advanced or magical devices. If you recover any of these, they are worth 1000 experience points (e.p.s.) when you leave the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenver you come to an intersection, you must roll up a WANDERING PERSON (&amp;quot;WP&amp;quot;) and figure out what happens to you. The WPs are listed at the back of the book. It is worth your while to read through that section before beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a couple of places where you can leave the dungeon without returning to your hotel. If you do so, you forfeit all the equipment, treasure and what have you which you left behind in your hotel room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saving rolls are made on all of the attributes at one point or another. Unless specified, all saving rolls will be made on Luck, and they are to be made AT THE CHARACTER'S OWN LEVEL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need dice, the rules to TUNNELS AND TROLLS, and maybe a deck of cards. Paper and pencil are vital and well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck. Be wary. The City of Terrors can live up to its name. Keep your weapon handy, a hand on your money belt, and GO TO 33C TO BEGIN.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
