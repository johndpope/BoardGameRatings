			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quasar Commander is an exciting game of skill to play on your TRS-80 color computer. You are at the helm of a Starship. Imagine that your video screen is a window looking into outerspace. Your laser sights are in the center of this &amp;quot;viewscreen&amp;quot;. Try to destroy as many enemy ships as possible before colliding with them. This game contains variations for countless hours of fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have control over the strategy of the enemy. Before the game begins, decide if you want the enemy to try to escape or remain stationary while you are &amp;quot;homing in&amp;quot; on their &amp;quot;ship&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enemy appears in three different forms. Scouts appear as two-winged ships. Battle Cruisers appear as one-winged ships with boxed ends. Disguised Battle Cruisers have a circular force-field that gives them the appearance of large dots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game offers a first-person pilot's perspective similar to Star Raiders. Features of your starship include radar and auto-pilot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several levels of difficulty are offered, in addition to &amp;quot;Family&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Expert&amp;quot; competition options which allow you to see who can score the most points within a set time limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
