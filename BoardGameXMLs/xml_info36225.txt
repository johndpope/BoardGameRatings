			<description>The closest you can get to football without wearing shoulder pads!&lt;br/&gt;Playbook Football appeals to anyone who enjoys football, from the armchair quarterback to the dedicated season ticket holder. It is easy to learn, fast to play, and has all of the tactical depth of football. Constructed out of high-quality, all-wood components, Playbook Football is a beautiful piece of home d&amp;eacute;cor as well as an engrossing game of strategy and luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 10 years of football statistics incorporated into the play cards this is the most accurate football board game ever brought to market. Players feel the excitement as the plays they call carry them down the field to victory or deny the opposing team critical yardage. From basic calls to fancy plays like the Blitz and Screen Pass, if you can do it in football, you can do it in Playbook Football!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players complete a full game in less than an hour. Every game is different, keeping players going all night long. Expansion packs with custom plays are planned for release in 2009, letting players build their own playbook and team. Want to see how your team stacks up to anyone else in the league? Grab a friend after the game and find out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
