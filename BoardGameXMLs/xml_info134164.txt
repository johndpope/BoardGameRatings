							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tactic Elastic</name>
									
			<description>Attach, strech and above all don't snap !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wheels indicate which elastic band the player must use, and which pillar it has to go round. The player may only use one hand to position the elastic band, while holding onto the board with the other hand.lf he fails, he receives a penalty point. Once a player has received ten penalty points, he is eliminated. The aim is ta be the last player left in the game!&lt;br/&gt;More you play more it's tight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
