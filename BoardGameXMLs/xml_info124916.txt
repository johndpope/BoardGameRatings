			<description>Fourth entry in the Glory that was Greece series, is a print and play game dedicated to two battles from the Peloponnesian War, Delium 424 BC and Amphipolis 422 BC. The famous greek philosopher Socrates took part in both of these campaigns, and fought with valor.&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a medium complexity system, with specific rules for the various kind of arms (hoplites, peltasts, cavalry, etc.) and their interaction. There are two integrated combat resolution charts, rules for leaders and their influence on the field of battle (both as aid in combat than in morale checks) and also optional rules with the use of combat cards for getting more variable in the combat phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
