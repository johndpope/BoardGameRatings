							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Library of Altinum</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Library of Altinum is an adventure written for Dungeons and Dragons and employs its 3rd Edition rules and d20 game system. It is designed for a party comprising 4-6 characters of 3rd to 5th level, ideally a combined total of 18-20 levels of experience, with a good mix of character classes. It can be played as an independent expedition or can be fitted into your own campaign world setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is a challenging one. It is advised that the Dungeon Master take time to read through the adventure before running it in order to become familiar with the setting and the encounters that the party will face. The Dungeon Master may want to adjust the numbers of monsters prior to starting the adventure to suit the size and strength of the adventuring party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure first appeared in the Red Giant (Volume 1, Number 2 - 1990) and has been revised and rewritten for use with Wizards of the Coast d20 Game System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
