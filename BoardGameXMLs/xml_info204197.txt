			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paadshaw village had been settled for centuries, a group of twenty or so homes nestling in a huge crater-like hollow, supplying a focus for the surrounding farming community. Little had happened there for years until a mild mannered man arrived and announced his intention to buy the recently vacated, and very expensive, manor house. The house had stood empty since the previous rather highly strung occupier fled complaining that the grounds were infested with ghosts. When the newcomer was told this he replied that this was exactly why he wanted it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a party of abt. 5th level characters, including a few spellcasters.  Usually distributed as a ZIP archive including the DOC adventure file and four image files (maps).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
