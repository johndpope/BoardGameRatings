			<description>The players have to get their 4 pawns into the blue center space (heaven). Movement is dertermined by a die. The 5th pawn is called &amp;quot;hellhound&amp;quot; and is placed on the big ringed space of it's own color to guard the neighbouring hell of the same color.&lt;br/&gt;Enemy pawns may be captured while moving on the outher ring of the game board and are placed on the hell-space of the active player. The hell-spaces are ringed by 7 smaler spaces of the same color. These are called hell-yards. pawns caught in hell may be rescued by another pawn, that enters hell through the hell-yards. It's the hellhounds task to prevent this.&lt;br/&gt;Pawns that are caught while moving on the inner ring aren't sent to hell but have to start from the beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
