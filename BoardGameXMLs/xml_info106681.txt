			<description>&amp;quot;Approved by the British Show Jumping Association&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the manual :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;As one of the leading national sports of the country, Show Jumping has steadily gained in popularity. Without doubt, Television has done much to interest many people in this sport, and evidence of the increase in local shows brings witness to the rapid growth of interest in Show Jumping.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game simulates show jumping and is designed to by instructional and fun. You lay out different courses to compete on using Britains Ltd plastic horse figures and fences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are six courses to choose from, the players layout the course with model fences. Each fence is numbered from 1 to 10. Players take it turn to jump the course by rolling the dice for each fence. They keep rolling until they roll the exact number on the fence and then take a hazard card to see if they received any faults for the jump. Total number of throws and faults are recorded on a scorepad for each fence. Time penalties are awarded based on the total number of dice rolls to get round the course and the winner is player with the least number of faults. There are rules variants for two other competition types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
