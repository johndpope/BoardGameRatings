							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Floating Prison</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 48 x 30 inch, full color floorplan of a Floating Prison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It comes with Square, Hex and No Ovelays and includes the VTT files for online use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;In all my years as warden, no one has ever escaped this prison. You will not be the first, no matter what you send against us!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The floating prison is a single map of a series of four rock islands connected by a series of bridges and a pulley lift. This product includes image files for your virtual tabletop (VTT). The PDF version has been left white around the islands to save on ink. The print on demand (POD) version will be double-sided with one side having a cloud and sky background and the other side having a water background. This allows you to use this as a floating prison or an island prison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is intended for use in fantasy games that use airships for a floating prison. You can also use this as an island prison that can be reached only by ships. In this context, it could be used as a prison for a notorious pirate in a pirate-themed game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The floating prison is said to be nigh impenetrable. But someone is angry that they imprisoned a famous criminal or pirate and they are throwing everything they have at the floating prison. The group can be involved in many different ways. They could be hired as mercenaries as extra security by the warden to try and protect the prison from the break out attempts. They could be part of the sky pirate crew attempting to be the first ones to break someone out of the prison successfully. They could have their own airship and are escorting a prisoner to the floating prison just before the next attack occurs and need to make sure he doesn&amp;rsquo;t escape. However they get involved, they need to bust into the prison and get the prisoner or they need to defend the prison from the sky pirates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
