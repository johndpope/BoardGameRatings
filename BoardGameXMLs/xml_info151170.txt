							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Burning Lair</name>
									
			<description>PDF Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Story so far... the great dragon, Astrellax, wages a terrible assault on the surrounding lands. His foul magics have twisted and corrupted many creatures and he has bound them to his service. He demands tribute and those cities that fail to pay he ravages or sends his minions to destroy. The King has called for a group of heroes to stop the dragon, offering lands, wealth, and titles to any who can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The volcano is difficult to reach overland. There is little normal wildlife in this broken land, but monsters and undead rove nearby in packs. Even the elements themselves have been broken to Astrellax&amp;rsquo;s will; air and earth elementals patrol the upper reaches of his lair, denying easy access to climbers or flyers. The characters must find a way into his lair using one of the various caves they can see upon approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
