			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The world of Earth in 2015 runs like a well-oiled machine. Technology makes day to day life operate smoothly and efficiently, with many networked machines working together to provide a never-ending flow of information and movement, from waking up through going to work through leisure time and back into sleep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But when there is a glitch in the system, when the machinery that composes the society has a breakdown, then the population begins to suffer, and day to day life becomes a struggle against ever-increasing odds. The worst situations are Major Malfunctions, where the machinery of society breaks down so far that, at any given moment, one or more people is in immediate danger of horrible&lt;br/&gt;death.&lt;br/&gt; Situations like, oh, say, a rogue cyborg with military Psych-Ops training, bent on causing as much pain and terror as it can to slake it&amp;rsquo;s thirst for sensation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yeah... that would be bad.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book provides both the game information on the situation involved, and a visual guide to the victims, the villain, and their interaction. It is meant for mature audiences only, as it goes into some graphic detail and involves nudity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
