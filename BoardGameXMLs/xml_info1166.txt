			<description>Dow Jones is a new version of Nicht geheuer im Gem&amp;auml;uer with a stock market theme. It contains a game board, 14 pawns (2 each in 7 colours), 1 'hausse' marker, 21 'baisse' sticks, 20 cards (stock certificates), 3 dice (one six-sided, one 12-sided, and one 20-sided).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is a grid of 12 by 20 squares. Each player receives 2 pawns and 3 'baisse' sticks. The stock certificates are ordered by value and placed face up next to the board, with the lowest value on top. One player rolls the special (1 12 sided, and 1 20 sided) dice and places the 'hausse' marker on the corresponding space on the grid. Players now roll the 6-sided dice to move one of their pawns onto the square with the hausse marker. If a player's pawn reaches the marker, that player receives the top stock certificate. The hausse marker is then placed on the game board by rolling the special dice as described above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, if a player hands in one of their 'baisse' sticks, they can immediately roll the special dice to move the marker (on their turn or on another player's turn).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player receives the last stock certificate. Each unused baisse stick is worth $50,000, and the player with the most money (stocks + unused baisse sticks) wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
