			<description>Translated from box back:&lt;br/&gt;Berlin has always been worth a journey, not only in today's time but for 750 years, because while the city was old then it is still much older today. Let yourself be captivated by the game of Berlin at the turn of the century. A stroll is worthwhile in itself as theaters, museums and much more besides lure you as you make your way into the city center seeing the sights. Enjoy again the splendor of old Berlin. An excursion into the outlying districts is worthwhile in itself as well. You will be astonished if suddenly a citizen of old Berlin emerges before you. Thus it goes as the train pulls in to platform 3 of the Goerlitzer station. &amp;ldquo;Everybody off!&amp;rdquo;, calls the station master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game summary:&lt;br/&gt;Players travel the streets of turn of the 19th century Berlin via foot, subway and horse carriage trying to see as many sights as possible. The first player to collect advertisements from ten attractions, or find the hidden anniversary pin, and make it to the finish station wins. Along the way players may encounter citizens of Berlin which will send them off to various parts of the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
