							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tote essen keine Kekse!: Ein mörderisches Rollenspiel für 6-11 Knabberfreunde</name>
									
			<description>The game plays in the cookie factory. It's a mixture of board game and role play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The director of the factory died and it's not clear if it was a crime or not. The players try to find out, what happened and which scandals happened in the company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a character (manager, purchaser, Marketing assistent, ...), and instructions on how to play their character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 parts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Moving a pawn around the plan of the factory by rolling a die to find objects.&lt;br/&gt;    Interrogate the other players to get more information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both should lead the players as team or against each other to solve the situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
