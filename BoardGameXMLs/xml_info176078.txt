			<description>In the margins...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the wide and empty spaces of a High School Chemistry students spiral notebook (that was supposed to be used for note-taking), a few strong and hastily drawn doodles have come to explore and live out there lives on the page. But across the emptiness, environments, obstacles and countless crudely drawn enemies are being written in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you and your friends traverse this 2D world and survive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What kind of adventure will you be a part of?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And will this child ever run out of ink!?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No really...?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stickmen: Basic Doodle Adventures is a small pick-up-and-play &amp;ldquo;Party Role-Playing Game&amp;rdquo; about platforming, creating funny little stick figures, and constant exploration. In hopes of getting off the page alive, and safely onto the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is great for introducing children to Role-Playing, light-weight enough for short games at parties, and has enough room to grow that some may find depth within the line segments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With features like: 30 second Character Creation, No planning needed, being easy to learn, and pureComedy GOLD!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
