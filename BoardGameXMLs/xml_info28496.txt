							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spear Song</name>
									
			<description>Spear Song is a set of tabletop wargame rules primarily based on the Dark Age/Medieval period. By concentrating on the 'mechanics' of pre-gunpowder warfare, rather than focusing on particular armies or battles, the system should be flexible enough to cater for the historical preferences of most players who are interested in this era. Rules for chariots and 'Eastern style' warriors further increase the potential by allowing for Celtic or Crusader type settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whilst the rules are mainly designed to create skirmishes and small-scale actions, a section is also included to enable larger scale battles to be fought using the same basic system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each major section of the text is followed by a fictional narrative that explains how the system works in game terms, and an introductory scenario based around the narratives is provided to familiarize players with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with other Dropwing systems, it is intended to extend the historical material that we produce in line with market demand. Having said this, Spear Song provides a 'stand alone' system in it's own right, which provides players with the basic material to fight battles using a wide variety of warriors from the 'Sword and Shield' era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
