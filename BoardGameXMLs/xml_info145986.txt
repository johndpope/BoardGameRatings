							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Leviathans: Ship Quirks &amp; Crew Abilities Card Deck</name>
									
			<description>The complexities of ship construction create unique design quirks that bring a flavor all their own to each leviathan, while the men and women who crew these airships bring their skills, passions and blood to elevate each vessel into legend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leviathans: Ship Quirks &amp;amp; Crew Abilities Card Deck is actually comprised of two decks: Ship Quirks and Crew Abilities, both of which feature cards with a positive or negative value. By using these cards, players can customize their airships prior to play, thereby having everyone start from differing circumstances each time you play. The rules recommend that when a player adds a positive Ship Quirk or Crew Ability that he take a similarly valued negative Quirk or Ability as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
