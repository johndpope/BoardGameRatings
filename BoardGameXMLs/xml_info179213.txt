			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bind energy to your chakras with the secrets held in Akashic Mysteries!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Akashic Mysteries, the veilweaving system of magic is introduced, where akashic energy is wielded by new classes like the vizier, daevic, and guru, who form this energy into veils that they bind to different chakras on the body. Inspired by Arabian and Indian myths, the mystical veils woven by these new classes imbue the veilweaver or the equipment they carry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each release in the series will contain different parts of the veilweaving system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this 30-page release is the daevic, an akashic knight who is bound in a symbiotic relationship with daeva, beings of pure akasha energy. In addition, included in this release are dozens of new feats for using veilweaving, the rules for veilweaving, and all of the veils a daevic can use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to get the entire book, be sure to instead pick up the on-going product that includes all individual releases like this release, as well as the final PDF combining all the parts of veilweaving into a single book!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
