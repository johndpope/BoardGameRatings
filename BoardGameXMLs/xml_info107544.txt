			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This third-person beat 'em up takes place 10 years before the events depicted in the classic comic, WATCHMEN. The game chronicles the early adventures of Night Owl and Rorschach while they were a crime-fighting duo. The gameplay differs slightly between the two characters. Rorschach is better at brawling crowd control, whereas Night Owl uses more finesse and is better at fighting enemies one at a time. Both characters have brutal finishing moves that can be used to put down enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2 consists of 3 chapters (the final chapter is a boss battle with the Twilight Lady). The choice you make during the final confrontation will determine the end of the game. It can be played single-player or local co-op for two players (there is no online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
