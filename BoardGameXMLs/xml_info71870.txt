			<description>&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Excitebike: World Rally, known in the PAL region as Excitebike: World Challenge and in Japan as Excitebike: World Race (エキサイトバイク ワールドレース), is a WiiWare  game in the Excitebike series.  The game was developed by Monster Games, and is their third game in the series. The title was announced on October 27, 2009 through the Nintendo Channel and was released in North America on November 9, 2009, in Japan on February 2, 2010 and in the PAL region on February 5, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Excitebike: World Rally follows a similar premise as the original Nintendo Entertainment System title released in 1985. The game's core design is that of a time trial arcade racer, that is, each race sees players attempting to get to the finish line in the shortest period of time possible. The player's bike has two options, an accelerator and a turbo function, the latter increases the player's engine temperature and overheating will cause the player's bike to stall. As in ExciteBots and ExciteTruck, the game features ranks S, A, B, C, and D which are determined by how well the player performs in races. Only gaining a rating of B or higher will allow the player to progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Races take place throughout different fictional tracks around the world, and include locales from London, America, Japan and Mexico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Excitebike: World Rally includes an online component, allowing players to play anonymously over the internet, or with friends in a similar fashion to Mario Kart Wii. Much like the original title, Excitebike: World Rally has a level editor, allowing players to create tracks and share them over the internet.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Excitebike:_World_Rally,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
