							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">D20 Magic: The Gathering Cards</name>
									
			<description> From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New players are often bewildered by the number of choices their characters have in the D20 Fantasy system. That doesn't include all the spells, feats, and class abilities they have at their disposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That got me thinking about Magic: The Gathering. Each rule is modular, easy to remember (because it's printed on a card), and you can pull it out for reference whenever you need to. Test runs proved their usefulness in play, especially as a DM who doesn't remember all of the rules all of the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I put together all of the combat actions and skill actions one might perform in a round (not including feats, spells, and class abilities). You can download these and print them. It took me five tries, but I got the card backs to line up correctly as well (I should point out they say &amp;quot;Arcanis&amp;quot; for our game). Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product was created using Oliver Weikopf's Magic: The Gathering Editor. Oliver rocks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
