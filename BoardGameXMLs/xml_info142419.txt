							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conspiracy Theory</name>
									
			<description>Conspiracy Theory is a co-operative game in which 2-6 players will work together in an attempt to thwart the nefarious schemes of a global conspiracy to dominate the world.  Each turn, players will use their actions to travel the globe, attempt to uncover pieces of the conspirator's plots, and struggle to remove the conspiracy's insidious influence.  However, the forward march of the conspiracy is relentless, and each turn another plot will be hatched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the game progresses, the plots will begin to build on one another, gradually growing in potency as the conspiracy races toward its final conclusion.  If the players are able to reveal enough plots in time, they will be able to expose the conspiracy to the rest of the world!  They must, however, remain vigilant, as the reach of the conspiracy is long, and they may have planted a traitor within your midst.  If the traitor is able to complete their secret objective before being exposed, then the rest of the team may lose their only chance to save the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
