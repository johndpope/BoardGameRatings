			<description>Kalteva torni is a dice game for 2-4 players. The game consists of 4 dices and 24 diagonal cylinder pieces in 4 different colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 6 diagonal cylinders and a dice. Players roll dice and the highest number starts. Then players roll dice and start to build a tower. Each round cylinder pieces are added to the tower according to the dice roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     one of the players has none of the cylinder pieces left without knocking the tower down. Other players count their left over cylinders and get a point for each.&lt;br/&gt;     the tower is knocked down. The player who knocked it down gets one point for each cylinder in the tower and other players get a point for every cylinder they have left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played multiple rounds which are determined before the game starts. After every round the points are counted and the player who has the least points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
