							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Continental Circus</name>
									
			<description>Continental Circus is an arcade racing game created and manufactured by Taito in 1987. It was then republished in 1989 along with a home version of the game, which was available on various platforms including the Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Amiga, Commodore 64, MSX and ZX Spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arcade version of this game comes in both upright or sit-down models, either of which may feature shutter-type 3-D glasses hanging above the player's head, used by Taito under license by the United States Navy, who held the patent on that technology. The home conversions of Continental Circus lack the full-on 3D and special glasses of the arcade version, but retain the essential gameplay structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The in-game vehicle is the 1987 Camel-sponsored Honda/Lotus 99T Formula One car as driven by Ayrton Senna and Satoru Nakajima. Due to licensing reasons, sponsor names such as &amp;quot;Camel or &amp;quot;DeLonghi&amp;quot; are intentionally misspelled to prevent copyright infringement under Japanese law.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player must successfully qualify in eight different races to win. At the beginning, the player must take 80th place or better to advance. As the player advances, so does the worst possible position to qualify. If the player fails to meet to qualify or if the timer runs out, the game is over. The player does, however, have the option to continue, but if the player fails to qualify in the final race, the game is automatically over, and the player cannot continue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2005, Continental Circus was released for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and the PC as part of Taito Legends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Continental Circus,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
