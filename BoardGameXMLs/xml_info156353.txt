			<description>Objective: Move one of your 3 'Double'-figures back home - or eliminate all opponent's 'Doubles'&lt;br/&gt; - moving by turns/ forward or backwards/starting positions white &amp;amp; black -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract strategy game where players move disc-shaped pieces across an 12 by 12 cross-hatched (&amp;quot;checker&amp;quot;) board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces only move diagonally, and only one or two  space(s) at a time.  &lt;br/&gt;If a player can move one of his/her pieces so that it jumps over adjacent pieces of their opponent (only foreward, laterally or backwards - NOT diagonally) into an empty space, that player captures the opponent's discs. Jumping moves must be taken when possible.&lt;br/&gt;If one of your discs reaches opponent's home base it mutates to a 'Double' (max. 3 x, after that opponent's home base is blocked). The movement range of a 'Double' is limited down to one space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note:&lt;br/&gt;Back of the board: 'Nine Men Morris'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
