			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hide mission-critical intel from operatives!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game master's screen for the Covert Ops role-playing game (see Core Product).  It is presented in a 6-page layout to be printed landscape and inserted into sleeve-based universal GM screen systems such as those sold elsewhere.  Alternatively, you can print on project paper (the printable self-adhesive paper available at most office supply stores) and adhered to project foamboard, cut and scored to bend properly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product came out of a discussion on the DwDStudios forums.  DwD Studios is offering this to you in a pay-what-you-want release model.  If you lack the funds, download it for free and enjoy!  If you have the funds to continue supporting our efforts to provide quality products at realistic prices, pay whatever you'd like and we thank you in advance for your patronage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This screen has everything one needs to run a Covert Ops game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The side facing the players has an image of the front cover, along with all outfitting tables the players need to outfit their operatives for an important mission.  Unlike the outfitting reference sheets presented in the core rulebook, these tables have complete summaries of how weapons and explosives operate - no more flipping to pages in the core rulebook to arbitrate how that fragmentation grenade works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The side facing the GM has every necessary table presented from the core rulebook.  It includes guidelines for awarding and spending DP, calculating Rank, summaries of the effects from the Getting Hurt section (quick - what's the rule for damage exposure to moderate radiation levels?), Getting Healed, rules summaries for each of the Conditions, ranges, automatic weapons, vehicle chases and combats, taking cover, rules for being at a &amp;quot;disadvantage&amp;quot; (which some of us forget to apply sometimes), the simple success modifier table, the table for breaking things, complete summaries of the rules for all martial maneuvers, and even the tables for dealing with animals for when the operatives find themselves in trouble outside the scope of cities and civilization.  This thing is packed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, a single bonus sheet is provided summarizing all the rules of the Security Systems &amp;amp; Traps section of the core rulebook.  Although normally only used during preparation for a mission, it's a great sheet to have handy and pull out when players take their operatives off the mission's prepared path and you have to wing it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
