							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Caloreimus: The Red Dawn</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Red Dawn is set on the continent of Caloreimus, formerly a peaceful realm, and heart of The One World. It is bordered with the cold, North lands of Zylbour, and is home to the great god, Lothar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the death of King Tarnis, Caloreimus suffered by the&lt;br/&gt;hands of a deceitful prince, Falcon Dan. In his quest for power, Falcon awakened the interests of the sleeping armies, who have patiently waited for the collapse of organized society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ruleset largely is derived from a previous live-action roleplaying game titled Castleland Live! which was, in turn, derived from a long running tabletop RPG campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
