			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;This is the book you have all been waiting for!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Steamfortress Victory alternate history universe is on the verge of marking its third anniversary of publication. And let me tell you, we have been on a long journey since 2010...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This latest book, World of Steamfortress Victory, marks a major turning point for the game. For three years, we have been building up the tone of the Five Nations and giving you a taste of the pre-history that led up to the destruction of the United States of America. We have given you a rich background to work with, setting up a clockwork world on the very edge of Total War. Well, guess what?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Total War is about to begin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After this book, we are advancing Steamfortress Victory&amp;rsquo;s story arc into the years following the New Century Truce of 1900. The Truce was established to give each of the Five Nations a cease fire, which would allow a slight economic recovery from the Great Steam War.  The world has stabilized since the Truce was signed, but the agreement only was to last one year. No one in the Five Nations is really sure what happens on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day 1901, but it likely that tensions will flare up again as the feud between the Unified States and the Confederation of Free States was never truly resolved.  We are now onto chronicling the years between 1901 and 1905, which bring about new strife in the Five Nations. This brings about a period of history we are calling the Timewelder Schism, where the final fate of the colossal steam fortress named Victory will be decided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, where does this book fit into the Timewelder Schism?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World of Steamfortress Victory is more of a primer for the Timewelder Schism story arc than an actual role-playing game sourcebook. It gives you background on all of the main characters of the Timewelder Schism and explains the settings and societies that they operate in. There are still statistics and mechanics for use in the role-playing game, but this book is where Steamfortress Victory makes its transition from a &amp;lsquo;Steampunk Role-Playing Game&amp;rsquo; to a running &amp;lsquo;Science Fiction Serial&amp;rsquo;.  There will still be several short-format adventures and updated rule sets published for Steamfortress Victory, but we are going put a great deal of focus on telling the story of Silverhorn, Hawkings, and the Victory for the near future. In short, when Josh, Matt, Tyler, and I started this whole thing in 2010, we had a story to tell...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And in the next coming years, we are going to complete the tale!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
