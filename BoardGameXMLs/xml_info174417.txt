							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lost Bible</name>
									
			<description>Lost Bible is a take on the game Lost Legacy with the story and characters from the game Bible Hunter. It contains two sets of 16 cards: The Dead Seas Scrolls and The Last Supper. It also contains a promo card for the latter, Crucified Christ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It plays the same way as the previous games in the Lost Legacy family. However, unlike the other sets, the cards in this game may not be mixed and matched with any of the previous sets as they have a different card back bearing the Lost Bible title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lost Bible is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&amp;ndash;4 players. You start the game with one card in hand from a deck of sixteen cards. On a turn, you do the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Draw: Draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand.&lt;br/&gt;     Play: Choose one of the two cards in hand to play and place it face up in front of you.&lt;br/&gt;     Effect: Carry out the played card's effect, after which the card is considered as discarded.&lt;br/&gt;     End: If there is at least one card left in the deck, the turn goes to the next player; if not, the investigation phase starts. Using the investigation speed indicated on the card each player has in hand, players take turns guessing which player (whether yourself or someone else) holds the &amp;quot;Lost Bible&amp;quot; card; this card might also be in the &amp;quot;Ruins&amp;quot;, a location that holds one card at the start of the game and possibly acquires more cards during play. The player who guesses correctly wins; if no one finds the &amp;quot;Lost Bible&amp;quot; card, then everybody loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
