							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lizzie McGuire Flash Talk Game</name>
									
			<description>The game for girls who like to gab!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here come the categories- do you have the answers? In Lizzie McGuire's Flash Talk Game- you get to talk about fun stuff like cute boys and TV Shows with your friends. Think of an answer quick and shout it out. Then your friends get a shot at it. Listen closely &amp;amp; don't repeat any of the answers your friends gave. And if they think one of your answers is totally of-the-wall, they may challenge you. Majority rules- so if everyone thinks your answer is bogus, sorry girlfriend! The first player to 10 points is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
