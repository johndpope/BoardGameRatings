			<description>From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the first to collect all the pieces to your &amp;quot;create a&amp;quot; Lalaloopsy doll and magically bring your Lalaloopsy doll to life then return home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lalaloopsy: Sew the Last Stitch game is a spin-and-move game where players must move their pieces along a track, landing on a series of spaces where they collect the various parts of their dolls. Along the way, they may encounter &amp;quot;move&amp;quot; spaces that allow them to move to any space on the board, &amp;quot;trade&amp;quot; spaces that allow them to trade places with another player and &amp;quot;skip&amp;quot; spaces that cause loss of a turn. Players may choose to move either forward or backward on each turn. The first player to collect all four doll pieces and return to the home space wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
