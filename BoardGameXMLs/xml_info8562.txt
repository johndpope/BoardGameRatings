			<description>Based on the long-running (1965-69) game show, the object is to convey a long word or short phrase to your teammate using as few letters as possible. Ideally, the teams are two teams of two players each, although there are rules to play with as few as three players or as many as six.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
