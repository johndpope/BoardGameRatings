							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dreams In The Tunnels</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2007. The Olympics will be arriving in the ancient city of Beijing in a year&amp;rsquo;s time. In the meantime there is a legion of administrators, workers, corporations and government officials working to make the city presentable before the flocks of tourists descend. One of the most ambitious projects, spanning the last 6 years, has been the expansion of the oldest subway system in Asia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tower block collapses after a subway tunnel is dug through several danger zones that should never have been approved. All the official connections check out but there are complaints among the workforce of blackouts, strange dreams and migraines. Strange radio frequencies have been recorded throughout the city around the time of the accident. Somewhere in the newly built tunnels an old dreamer has made its nest. Through its subtle influences it aims to  construct a great glyph beneath the city but until then it sleeps. Unlike those whose dreams it visits...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is ideal for 2-5 investigators and is set in modern day Beijing. The scenario is system free, though guidance is provided on running all characters and encounters. The adventure focuses on player interaction and puzzle solving and should be enjoyable for any group looking for an investigative game, especially as a one-shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recommended Systems: Any system designed to emulate a real-world/urban fantasy setting should be able to run this scenario with few issues. Atlas Games' Unknown Armies, White Wolf's World of Darkness and Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu all work well and Pelgrane Press' GUMSHOE system would work to emphasise the investigative elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content Warnings: Due to the nature of Horror games, this product contains discussion of hallucinations and body horror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
