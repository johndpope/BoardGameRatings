			<description>Designer's Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's been a little while since I last posted an adventure. I had a couple of false starts on others. But I'm happy to bring you, Ossuary of a Death God. This is a mid to high level adventure. It deals with a god killer called the adversary and the possibility of reanimation of a death god.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I don't give any background to the adventure. This is one of those sites that the GM can throw at the players to alter their view of the world. I have named the death god Ballor, he is one of nine, but this is easy enough to change for your own campaign. And the adversary becomes is an interesting, powerful thing in your campaign world. I can see him playing a part in many things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Micro Adventure published on Tim Shorts's Patreon page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
