							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Snap Judgment</name>
									
			<description>Based on real life court trials, Snap Judgment has players gaining points for correctly guessing the verdicts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll and move around a stylized board gaining experience and, optionally, trying to guess the verdict of a court case read from a book.  Cases range from simple misdemeanors to murder.  After a player gives his answer, other players may challenge.  Whether a challenge is successful or not, a player may still check with the Court of Appeals for one more attempt to reach his chosen verdict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players gain 'Certificates of Judgement' for a correct answer or challenge.  These certificates may be traded in for additional tokens, to be used in other parts of the game (e.g.-crime investigation, corporate retainers, etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever gains three yellow tokens and five black tokens first, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
