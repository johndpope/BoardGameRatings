			<description>Double Your Money is a board game from the 1950's, produced by Bell games and based on the very successful UK ITV game show of the same name hosted by Hughie Green.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has 4 distinct triangles. Each triangle reflects the player's colour - Green, Red, Blue or Yellow.  Each player place themselves at the start of their chosen colour. No two players can be in the same triangle. Movement is decided by the spinner in the centre of the board. A player moves along each row of their triangle. If a player's piece lands on the same colour square as his colour, he is asked a question. If he is right, he places his marker to the side of his triangle in the first prize money of 1 pound. Next time he gets a question right, he will double his money i.e. a progression of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. (except when the prize money gets to 256 pounds, when it next jumps to 500 pounds so that the prize money could stop at 1,000 pounds.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to gain the prize of 1,000 pounds is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TV show, in its day, was extremely popular. Anyone winning the thousand pound prize was a celebrity (it didn't happen a lot). A thousand pounds, in the austerity of 1950's Britain, was a great deal of money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
