							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orgy</name>
									
			<description>Orgy is an ADULT card game.  This game is set in a furry setting where anthropomorphic foxes, kitties, wolves hoofers and lawyers all are competing to have the best party.  The object of the game is to complete your orgy by building up 7 sequential levels necessary for the fun to commence.  There are also cards that let you interfere with your opponents plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seven levels are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.) An ORGY card, which will define what breeds of furries that will attend your orgy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.) Three or more CHARACTER cards that match your ORGY card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.) Two or more KINK cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.) One or more LUBE cards (may need to be more depending on your character types).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5.) Two or more Toy cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6.) Two or more ACTION cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7.) One LOCATION.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player who plays all seven layers wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
