							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Motor Race Game</name>
									
			<description>A children's game from the 70's I would guess. A curio because this game is just a version of the linen games from Victorian times. Each player spins a spinner, moves the number of squares indicated and follows the instructions if he lands on such a square. The first to complete three laps is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;1 board&lt;br/&gt;Rules (on the box insert)&lt;br/&gt;4 plastic racing cars (in four colours)&lt;br/&gt;i Spinner on box insert (the spinner was broken when I got this game so that is why a dice and dice cup are in one of the images)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
