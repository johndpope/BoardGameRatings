			<description>French 19th century roll-and-move board game, similar to the Game of Goose, with 63 numbered spaces spiraling into the centre of the board. Players roll 2 dice and move that total number of spaces. Bonuses and penalties are incurred on some spaces, as detailed by text in the middle of the board. The theme of the game is a naval expedition. Spaces represent various French admirals, sea battles, and other naval and nautical themes.&lt;br/&gt;Landing one one of three lighthouse spaces (every 9th space) gives you a double move (i.e. if you land on a lighthouse with a move of 5, move on another 5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
