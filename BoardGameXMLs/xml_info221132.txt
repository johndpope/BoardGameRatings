			<description>PoPalotsy is a speedy dice game in which players try to be the first to get rid of all the cards in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are each dealt 5 ring shaped cards - each card depicting a die face on a colored background.  When all players are ready, 5 different colored dice are popped out of the provided popper.  Players then race to encircle the dice with their cards by matching the color of the die or the number on the die. A number match beats a color match and an exact (color AND number) match beats all.  The first player to drop all of their cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;Popper&lt;br/&gt;5 Dice&lt;br/&gt;40 Ring Cards &lt;br/&gt;Rule Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
