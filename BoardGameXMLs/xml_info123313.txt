			<description>Religious Charades in a way although you don't have to mime. Must be played in teams of at least two people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a turn, a player draws a card and tries to get his team-mates to name a Biblical character from his clues. The first team to get a pre-agreed number of characters correctly, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook promises a Family Devotions variant but the rules were missing from my set so I do not know this variant at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
