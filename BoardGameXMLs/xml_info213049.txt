			<description>I Reckon So is a competitive RPG for 4 or more people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of those people will be in charge of running the game and portraying any personality in the game who isn&amp;rsquo;t one of the characters being portrayed by the rest of the players at the table. We&amp;rsquo;ll call them the Buckaroo. Why? Because we can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in rounds. One round is played for each player other than the Buckaroo. So, if there&amp;rsquo;s 5 people at the table, you&amp;rsquo;ll play 4 rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to amass the most points by the end of the final round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round of the game is played out at a wild west saloon, and involves characters created by the Buckaroo and the players. Some of the information determined at the start of each round is meant to be kept a secret until the end of the game, so be sure to follow the setup instructions and refrain from giving away any hidden information!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
