							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Awesome System</name>
									
			<description>Play roleplaying games based on sci-fi, fantasy, spy thrillers and many other genres, using a flavourful and charming ruleset. Our flagship product is, and always will be, The Awesome System, a fast-paced and flexible rpg to play with your friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the publisher website&lt;br/&gt;What Is The Awesome System?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the play testing of the Awesome System, we tackled science fiction, fantasy, spy thrillers, prehistoric cavemen, pirates, ninjas, smugglers, horror, b-movies, rock &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; roll bands and many others. And despite this wide range of genres we tried out and experimented with, the system never lost its flavour. The Awesome System is not a generic system. It&amp;rsquo;s a rules set that can be used for any setting you could ever dream of, but it possesses immense flavour, charisma, wit and grace hard-coded into the very rules themselves. In the Awesome System, having a fun game is inescapable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Want to understand it a bit better? Think of any movie starring Bruce Campbell or Jackie Chan, or Sylvester Stallone. That feeling of fun, adventure and excitement you get from those movies is what we&amp;rsquo;ve captured here in one of the simplest, easiest to use rules sets you&amp;rsquo;ll ever play with. It ensures you can make the kind of character you want to make, rather than your personality being dictated by the rules or, worse, your class role, but thanks to the Stunt System and the clever new combat system we&amp;rsquo;ve included, you can still have fun when getting into the crunchier aspects of the game, regardless of whether your character is optimized for it or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;re you waiting for? Experience every setting you&amp;rsquo;ve ever wanted to, but in a totally new light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
