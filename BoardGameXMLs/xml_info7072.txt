			<description>In this nerve wracking game, collect stocks, build your companies and get ready to look for cheaper property because the rabble is moving in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Slums is a 2 to 6 player game (Ages 13 and up) guaranteed to keep you sweating and wondering, &amp;quot;Who's going to move in next door?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Slums, you will build neighborhoods centered around massive Super Stores and collect Super Store stocks. You and your opponents will devaluate the neighborhoods by building slums and destroying property.  When your stock prices fall because of slums in previously trendy neighborhoods, you must decide whether it is time to sell stock or rebuild the neighborhood. You also have the option of just buying the cheap stock and letting someone else rebuild for you. One of the unique features of the game is that you will not know who is the winner until the very last piece is played. After all, a critically placed Slum can make the difference between thousands and millions of dollars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play mainly falls into three parts. The first half hour is pretty much an all out war to build up as many companies as possible and collect stock. In the middle portion of the game, players hold onto their stock waiting for opportunities to build key buildings in order to tip the tide of the game in their favor. The last portion of the game is a fast paced, white knuckled race to either destroying the biggest company on the board or playing the last piece to end the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
