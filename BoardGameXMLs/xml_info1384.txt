			<description>Despite its fairy tale theme, this is a fairly abstract game for 2-4 players Ages 8 and up. Each player tries to move their 6 gnomes from one side of the board to the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For setup, the trees are placed on the game board, and the gnomes are placed on their starting spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, each player first moves a tree 1 space, then moves a gnome. Gnomes move in a straight line (orthogonally or diagonally) across empty spaces until they encounter an obstacle - a tree or a gnome. The gnome then does a 90 degree turn and keeps moving. If the gnome reaches its target space, and there is another gnome on it, the active player moves that gnome to another space on the board. The first player to move all their gnomes to their target space wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
