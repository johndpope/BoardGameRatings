							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wind Power</name>
									
			<description>Wind Power is a card game with 3 types of cards: wind, directionals, and windmills. Players take turns playing cards to form a communal board. The goal is to end the game with the most wind blowing into your windmills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a hierarchy to the cards. Wind is lowest, directionals are middle, and windmills are highest. Higher cards can be played on top of lower cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wind blows through the windmills and keeps going, but less 1 wind power that it had when it hit the mill. So if the windmill gets 3 wind from one direction, 2 of those wind continue blowing past it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These simple rules generate brain-buzzing complexity for fun and interesting gameplay. Alternative versions with bidding and speed-play are described in the rules as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TO PURCHASE THE GAME or to download the full rules for free, visit thegamecrafter.com link below or right here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/wind-power&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/wind-power&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demo the game online: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://gidbobgames.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://gidbobgames.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
