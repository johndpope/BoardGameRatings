You may pick your character from one of five races (human, elf, dwarf, gnome, or feline)and three professions. (archer, mage, or warrior) each has its own strengths and weaknesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is best played with 1 - 3 players as the game time is generally 1 hour plus 1 hour per player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 - Board with Beginners version of Orgoth printed on it.&lt;br/&gt;6 - 6 sided movement dice (2 green, 2 yellow, 2 Red)&lt;br/&gt;3 &amp;ndash; 10 sided dice&lt;br/&gt;1 _ 6 sided die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;24 Green Quest Cards&lt;br/&gt;24 Yellow Quest Cards&lt;br/&gt;24 Red Quest Cards&lt;br/&gt;72 Green Encounter Cards&lt;br/&gt;72 Yellow Encounter Cards&lt;br/&gt;72 Red Encounter Cards&lt;br/&gt;168 Item Cards&lt;br/&gt;gems counters&lt;br/&gt;health markers&lt;br/&gt;3 dragon markers&lt;br/&gt;3 traveler markers&lt;br/&gt;15 unique character sheets&lt;br/&gt;5 - player pawns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6 &amp;ndash; City Walls&lt;br/&gt;6 - Castles&lt;br/&gt;6 - Temples&lt;br/&gt;6 - Mage Towers&lt;br/&gt;6 - Barracks&lt;br/&gt;6 - Merchants&lt;br/&gt;6 - Weapon Smiths&lt;br/&gt;6 - Armorers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players advance in level by traveling the realm, defeating the enemy creatures, and accepting quests. The farther from the main city players travel the harder the monsters and the quests become, but the rewards are also greater.&lt;br/&gt;There is no set path to follow and only you as a player can direct where your character goes and what he does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel out to the farthest reaches of the game board and build your castle - People will come to your area and as lord of your castle you can collect taxes, taxes help to build your city, and further your cause. Each city expansion you build gives a different bonus to your character and city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be careful not to venture too far into the wilds as you might just wake a Great Dragon who will not stop until you defeat it or it has destroyed every city on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play with or against your friends or even play alone, trade with your opponent any item he needs for one that suits you better, or purchase a curse scroll and use it to cause havoc with the player who are ahead of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have completed all your required quests, built a complete city, and have attained level 10, you become the First King of Orgoth! Long live the King!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
