							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Global War On Terror</name>
									
			<description>Global War On Terror (GWOT) is a low complexity, global geo-political war game for 2-5 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player controls the terrorist mastermind and his / her lieutenants (subordinates); their identity is unknown. The overall goal of the terrorists is to carry out major attacks on population centres, and to inflict maximum terror to achieve their political, religious, or ideological goals. To achieve this, the terrorists will recruit jihadists (to provide manpower), collect funds (to finance plots), and collect materials (e.g. bio-toxins), all of which are required to launch terror attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other players in the game control the opposing counter terrorist agents. Their primary goal is to work cooperatively to disrupt terror plots by collecting plot-specific Intel (intelligence). Counter terrorists may also carry out surveillance, drone strikes, and deploy special forces to eliminate jihadists, terrorist cells, and training camps, thereby impeding the progress of their plots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VICTORY CONDITIONS&lt;br/&gt;The game ends and the winner(s) declared when any of the following apply:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    The Global Terror Track marker reaches 10 (terrorists win).&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    The counter terrorists identify and eliminate the terrorist mastermind (counter terrorists win).&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    If the Global Terror Track marker has not reached space &amp;lsquo;10&amp;rsquo; after ten game turns, the counter terrorists win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has been entered into the 2016-17 war game print and play contest:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1626631/2016-17-wargame-print-and-play-contest&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1626631/2016-17-wargame-pri...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game won 3rd Prize in the Best Strategic Game category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The components and rules in this game are prototypes for play testing, and therefore subject to change.&lt;br/&gt;     The game designer claims no copyright on any of the photographic images appearing in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
