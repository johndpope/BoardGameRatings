							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gin-A-Word</name>
									
			<description>Oklahoma Gin Rummy with words.  The deck has 70 cards, each with a letter and a point value between 1 and 10.  Ten cards are dealt each player, and the top card turned over to start the discard pile.  This is also the &amp;quot;knock&amp;quot; card, and determines the value you must match to knock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a turn a player draws the top of either pile and either goes out or discards one.  If a player can form his hand into a 10- or 11-letter word, he calls &amp;quot;Gin-A-Word&amp;quot; and goes out; if he can make 10 letter into 2 or more words of 3+ letters each, he calls &amp;quot;Gineroo&amp;quot; and goes out; if he can meld all his hand together except cards whose total value is&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
