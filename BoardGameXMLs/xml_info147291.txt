			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A first person adventure game set in 10th century Japan featuring mostly hand drawn graphics. The game is, in part, historical showing some events that actually happened along with people who were there but the game also mixes in Japanese myths and legends with spirits and demons as well as elements of philosophy and religion. You are able to bring up a guide that will explain historic events as you witness them. The game features some conversations where you must type a response and some basic puzzles but most of it is just exploring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the game starts you name yourself and choose how you will look but during the game you will likely die many times, will experience one type of hell, and then be reborn as another person or thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speech is in Japanese with English subtitles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While writing about whether or not he thinks video games can be viewed as art Roger Ebert mentioned that he &amp;quot;enormously enjoyed&amp;quot; Cosmology of Kyoto.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
