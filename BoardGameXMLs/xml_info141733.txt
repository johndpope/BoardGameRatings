			<description>Two sets of 12 stones each are placed in a 5x5 square grid. The first two rows in front of a player, plus the two rightmost pits on the third row contain that player's stones. On his turn, a player must displace one of his stones, performing one of the following legal moves: 1) a stone can be moved orthogonally to an adjacent free field, 2) a stone may jump in a straight line over at least one same-coloured stone, and onto the next free field, 3)a stone can jump over at least one same-coloured stone and into a pit occupied by an opponent's stone which is then captured and removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to capture 10 stones from his opponent or to leave the opponent without legal moves. If both players have only four stones each in play, the game ends in a draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 'Trio Trio' Clemens Gerhards' game set (2010 edition) includes rules and components to play this game, along with two additional Frank Stark's games (Trio Trio and Soli-Bi).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
