			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is it up to you to put and end to the dispotic rule of the warlord and his trained garrison? Is the hillfort under siege by the undead and your party has been broughtin as extra hired muscle? Has the emperor's brother gone into hiding in the secluded watchtower, fearing assassins sent by the mad ruler? Are you there to protect him, or are you the assassin? With D20 Cartographer, the story is in your hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warlord's Watchtower is the sixth in a series of One Dollar Dungeon maps, which represent convenient starting locations or class-specific adventure locals for each traditional RPG character class.
