							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mighty Morphin Power Rangers War of the Zords</name>
									
			<description>This game, featuring a Power Rangers theme, is similar to the card game &amp;quot;War&amp;quot; with a few added twists. The deck is dealt out face down evenly among the players. Cards depict Power Rangers, bad guys, or puzzle pieces. Each player simultaneously turns over their top card and the player with the highest value card wins them all. If there's a tie, the tying players continue turning over cards one at a time until someone turns over a higher value card. The player that wins the trick takes all point cards and places them in a separate pile (to be counted up later). Then the winner collects all puzzle cards and puts them in the center of the table either starting or adding to a puzzle. There are 2 six-piece puzzles: one depicting a Megazord, and one depicting Rita Repulsa. The game ends when either puzzle is completed. If the Megazord puzzle is completed, the point values on Power Ranger cards are added up. If the Rita Repulsa puzzle is completed, the point values on bad guy cards are added up. The player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
