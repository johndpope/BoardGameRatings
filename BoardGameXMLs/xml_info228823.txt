			<description>A One-Round Living City (Procampur) Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mood in Procampur has been unusually excited this past month since the surprise engagement of Rendeth to Lady Constantine Grimm! It has been a well-known fact that the Thultyrl had been seeing Alissa Wyndsong, the famed bardess of Procampur. But Lady Constantine Grimm is well known among the nobles of the city for her social graces, but also her distinct lack of wit, so it is no surprise that she made a play for the Thultyrl&amp;rsquo;s hand in marriage. What is surprising is the fact that he asked for it, for he had never given Constantine a second glance until now! Of course, she is Nobility. Many rumors have spread regarding the cause of this sudden change of heart, ranging from the fantastic to the absurd!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
