							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gravestalker</name>
									
			<description>Part of the Tiger Klix line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A portable, magnetic roll-and-move maze game for two players. The object of the game is to escape the graveyard. To do this, you'll have to navigate the graveyard maze and reach the Gravestalker's house in the center of the board. Once there, you may claim the key that will let you escape. But players will also have a chance to move the Gravestalker, in an effort to block their opponent's path. Also watch out for skull spaces on the board, which can send you further away from your goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have the key, it's a mad dash to the finish. The first player out wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
