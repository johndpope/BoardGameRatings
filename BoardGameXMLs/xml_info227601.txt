			<description>The game of O&amp;rsquo;Grady&amp;rsquo;s Goat consists of a small pamphlet that contains a story with blank lines left in the tale. Also in the box are numerous cards with five phrases written upon them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is chosen to be the main storyteller.  This player will evenly deal out all phrase cards face down in a pile, in front of each player.  &lt;br/&gt;The storyteller will then begin reading the narrative provided in the pamphlet.  &lt;br/&gt;During the story, the reader pauses at each blank line shown in the tale.  On this pause, players take turns quickly filling in the blanks by reading a phrase from their cards.  The game is over when the story is completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
