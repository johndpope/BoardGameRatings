							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fudge Factor (Issue 4 - Jan 2002)</name>
									
			<description>from the website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, we made it three issues before we missed a deadline. Then Real Life decided to interfere. Brett, our Editor in Chief and the driving force behind getting the previous issues published on time, took some severe blows to his life in December and has temporarily left his duties with the 'zine. The rest of us didn't learn about this until after the deadline, and it took us a couple weeks to clear our own schedules and assess the situation. Despite that, we've put together an issue I think you'll like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
