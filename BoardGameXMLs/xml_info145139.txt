							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ilme</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ilme is a Bestiary article.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ilme are a strange race of mere-dragons, among the most unique and mysterious of the intelligent races on H&amp;acirc;rn. The Ilme have an ancient culture with a complex language and a deep mythology. They bear some likeness to their great dragon cousins, and many a reported tale of dragonkind was almost certainly really an Ilme encounter, but there are significant differences. Although they are reptilian, the Ilme have no wings and probably could not fly even if they had; they commonly attain a height of 12 feet and a weight of two tons. The two sexes live apart except when mating. Despite their undisputed strength, male Ilme are somewhat cowardly and are frequently bullied and robbed by local Gargun (orc) bands. They prefer to hunt from ambush or eat carrion. They will rarely attack intruders but will fight with desperation when cornered. Even then, they usually try to negotiate first. Female Ilme are another matter; they will attack and fight intruders with limb-tearing ferocity, especially to protect their young. The Ilme do not breathe fire although their breath is far from sweet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This article describes the history, biology, culture, mythology, and physical abilities of the Ilme. Full H&amp;acirc;rnMaster stats are given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
