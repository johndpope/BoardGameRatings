			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Pocket League Story the player takes control of a soccer team and has eight years to lead them to the top. The player has to generate income and different kind of research or ressource points by assign players to training or different kind of facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These points can then be spent to improve the relations with the fans (and therefore lead to more options), hire new players, find new sponsors, improving the stadium or for special training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In League and Cup matches the team fights for the first place. Those games can't be influenced in a direct way. Only the tactic (offensive, neutral, defensive) can be chosen at the start of each half and some players can start some kind of a soccer spree if they have increased their aura to the maximum (for which they need the support of the fans and brutal enemies who tackle them).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the game is completed the coaches and players' skills are transfered to every new game to ease the experience. After the first playthrough an option is introduced that allows for faster play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since every game has to be watched (which takes about 9 minutes) the game has a lot of downtime in which the player can't act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
