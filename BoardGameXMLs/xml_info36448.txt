			<description>&amp;quot;Two player Card game depicting Napoleonic era warfare.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game used three types of cards - Battalion, Commander, and Tactics. The Tactics deck is composed of maneuvers, formations, weapons, incidents, and terrain types. There is a different composition of Battalion and Commander cards given for each of the five nations represented in the game: France, Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia. Each player forms a Battalion Deck and selects Commander cards based on the country played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are played on the table in battlefield positions representing the Left Flank, Left Center, Center, Right Center, and Right Flank positions. The first player to be routed from three of the five forward positions loses. A player may also lose based on morale considerations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
