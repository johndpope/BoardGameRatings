			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement provides additional armor and shields for play under the Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tables below provide an expanded range of armor and shields for use in the game.  Availability of these additional items is at the discretion of the Game Master, of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unless otherwise specified, a suit of armor takes 10 rounds minus the character's Dexterity bonus to put on or take off. Armor is often made of differing materials, especially shields. Some Plate Armor is made of bronze or possibly some other alloy, though it is most commonly made of steel. Differing materials and their effect on weight, cost and AC is beyond the scope of this document. Game Masters are encouraged to make these adjustments as they see fit while adhering to the simple and basic nature of the Basic Fantasy RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
