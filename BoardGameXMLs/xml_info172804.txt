			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Role Playing Game of Cybernetic Monkeys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cybernetic experiments were supposed to be for the benefit of Mankind. According to the Gene Tech Corporation, the company responsible for the cybernetics project, the experiments were supposed to be the saving grace of the Human race, allowing Man to live a better life through Science. Little did anyone guess that the test subjects, the monkeys, would have evolved. Several thousand monkeys all over the World escaped from Gene Tech Corp. labs...and rebelled. What if you were one of the monkeys that just escaped? What would you do next? That is this tail, er, tale!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monkeys On Juice was created as part of a 30 minute RPG challenge.  It uses the D4Core system as a basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part ofthe  Cyber.net.ica Universe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyber.net.ica is a series of micro cyberpunk role playing games that all share the same universe. They can be played by themselves or can be combined to create a bigger world. Small in stature, big in imagination!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
