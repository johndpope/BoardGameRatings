							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Addams Family: Find Uncle Fester! Card Game</name>
							<name  sortindex="5">The Addams Family: Hitta onkel Fester</name>
									
			<description>The search for Uncle Fester is on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of this card game is to collect all seven members of the Addams Family: Gomez, Morticia, Lurch, Pugsley, Wednesday, Thing, and Uncle Fester. There is only one Uncle Fester card, which makes collection of a complete set difficult. You cannot win if you are holding the Tully Alford card (he's the devious family lawyer).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, there is an action card deck, which instructs the players to ask for, search for, trade, and pass around cards. Recommended for Ages 8 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
