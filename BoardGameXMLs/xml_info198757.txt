			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s not from around here&amp;hellip; Kogar!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 12 Renegade, Kogar is an alien bounty hunter with little concern for local law. Kogar is an iconic character in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kogar&amp;rsquo;s file is designated &amp;quot;Red&amp;quot; to indicate his powers are innate, but alien. Strong, fast, and skilled in battle, Kogar is a tough visitor to any planet. Unfortunately, he&amp;rsquo;s not exactly concerned with obeying local customs or checking in with the local law. In fact, he&amp;rsquo;s not entirely sure what the locals look like, he&amp;rsquo;s only concerned with tracking down his quarry and cashing them in for a bounty before moving on to his next mission! Any hero who gets in his way will find him occasionally reasonable, but no less annoying for it. On the other hand, his space-ship&amp;rsquo;s ability to travel anywhere in the known universe might just make him the ally your heroes never knew they needed. For a price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
