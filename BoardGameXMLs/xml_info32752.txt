			<description>Taken from the Opstelten Speelgoed website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where are the toothbrushes to be found at your house? Do they belong in the kitchen, the bathroom or maybe in both? And what about your toys? Do they belong in the Living room or in your bedroom? In any case not in the bathroom. Then they better be stored in the attic. With the game My House children can playfully tell how things are organized at their home. It&amp;rsquo;s all about telling about their experiences from home. Becoming aware of the arrangement of things at home and thus familiar in their own house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is interesting and fun to hear for the parents, hearing their children talk about how they think about the arrangements at home. The children for their part become very resourceful in substantiating their ideas about the location of the objects. But My House offers even more. The older children can play memory games with it or call forth all their linguistic skills in a game of &amp;ldquo;Linguistic Happy Families&amp;rdquo;. Thus the game co-develops along with the development of the linguistic skills of the child. Ranging from story telling up to in their own words finding synonyms to complete their set of &amp;ldquo;Happy Families&amp;rdquo;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
