			<description>A card game with an ancient Chinese warfare theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck has three suits: Infantry, Archers, and Cavalry. Each contains twenty seven cards numbered from one to nine (three cards with each number). There are also two Honor Suits which are not numbered, Junks and Forts, and two Special Suits, Generals and Tactics. General Cards may be discarded for victory points and Tactics cards are wild cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Be the first player to accumulate 100 Victory Points. Points are scored for each hand when a player goes out. A player goes out by making 4 sets of 3 cards each. Only the player that went out scores points.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
