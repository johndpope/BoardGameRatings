			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood &amp;amp; Bullets: is a role-playing game set in the Wild West. It is based on a set of 'old school' fantasy role playing rules, which itself was based on the first fantasy role playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are free to publish your own adventures, house-rules, and any other sort of materials designed for this game. Guidelines and requirements are at the end of the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood &amp;amp; Bullets isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily intended to be an accurate history lesson; it is designed primarily as an old western game utilizing, and to be more-or-less compatible with, the Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry rule set. Historical accuracy isn't even the secondary goal, which is really to create a game that gives you the feel and trappings of the Old West without having to get too bogged down in the who's, why's, what's and where's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
