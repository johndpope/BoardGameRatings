							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Das Geisterhaus</name>
									
			<description>The game board is three-dimensional and depicts a house with three actual floors (stabilized by some clips that hold the house together). Players walk through the house (according to their die rolls). In each room, there are face-down cards. When a card is reached, it can be turned over (secretly). If it shows the color of the player whose turn it is, he or she can move on to the next room through &amp;quot;secret doors&amp;quot;. When a player flips over the card with the ghost on the top floor, he or she has won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
