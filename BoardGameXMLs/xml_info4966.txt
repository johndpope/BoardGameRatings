							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jamie Swise Mystery Games: Murder by Proxy</name>
									
			<description>Early (predecessor?) parlor/play-acting game of hosting a murder/mystery.  There were at least six games in the Jamie Swise line, some of which were incorporated into the Milton Bradley Life of the Party line of mystery games.  This one...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why did a nice lady like Mary Wrightwood suddenly stop publishing her weekly gossip rag and begin building a virtual empire, producing closet pornography?  We think it is a question which needs answering.  And if that burning question doesn't compel you, you might like to figure out who murdered her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The case of characters is indeed curious: a right-wing megalomaniac, the cold-blooded co-publisher, a pompous author, a flower child, the degenerate son, an immensely virile handy man, the town's mayor and only plumber, and Mary's bible thumping ex-best friend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time is March, 1968.  Feelin' groovy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
