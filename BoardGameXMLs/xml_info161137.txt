			<description>Game Play Variants: There are 2 game play variants of the game, 1 vs 1 and the free-for-all 3 way battle. The Recommended Variant is the 3 player free-for-all game which is the basic setup of the game's gameplay. The game can be played 1 versus 1 which will still use the play mat and will still use the unit positioning area such as the left/right flank unit placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Objective: Reduce all opponents&amp;rsquo; Leader life Points to zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Setup:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Select Race Players choose which race they wish to play and thoroughly shuffle their decks. Pass each deck counter-clockwise to next player for reshuffling until it goes back to the designated player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Place Leader Card Each player must place their leader Card in the field (playmat designated area). A Leader Card starts with 30 Health Points. (If a leader&amp;rsquo;s life points drops to zero, that player is eliminated from the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Determine Play Order    Randomly select which player will go first. After the first player&amp;rsquo;s turn, player turn order will resume in a counter-clockwise direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Draw Hand Cards    All players must draw 6 cards from their chosen deck. Every play turn, players can draw 2 cards in their library. All players can assign up to 2 cards on the mining placement area which will produce 1 gold per card per turn. The more cards assigned to the mining area, the more gold it produces. However, re-assigning the cards/using the cards from the mining area has an additional cost of 4 gold. It is the penalty for the cards being re-assigned as unit in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. First Turn    The first player begins their turn and performs the actions described in the Play Sequence section of these rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play Sequence:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are all the actions a player may perform during their turn. Each action must be completed in the order designated below. In a free-for-all game, the player chosen to go first takes their turn. Next, in a consecutive order (going in a counter-clockwise direction), the other players will fulfill their turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.    Re-draw (Optional) A player can elect to declare a Re-Draw action at the start of their turn. This action is performed in place of any of the regular actions associated with a typical turn. When a player has no useful cards in their hand, they can choose to use the Re-draw action. The Re-Draw action allows a player to discard their hand of cards and draw 6 new cards from their deck. This action ends their turn. The player is not allowed to take any more actions, and will not be able to produce any Gold until their next turn. Note: If you don&amp;rsquo;t need to Re-Draw, skip this action and take a normal turn. Simply begin your turn with the collect Gold action and precede through the subsequent action steps until you wrap up your turn with the Upkeep action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.    Collect Gold Collect the amount of Gold equal to the total Gold on all of the cards placed on the mining area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.    Draw Card Draw 2 cards from your Race deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.    Activate Cards This action lets you establish and activate any type of cards, use    Command cards, and/or assign new units.    During this play sequence, a player may perform all four of these options: - Play 2 Card to the mining field. Note: All cards in the mining field should be placed facedown. - Play any number of Passive and Instant Command Cards.    - Play any unit cards to assign any number of new units on the left/right flank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5.    Re-assign Once the unit is re-assigned from mining area to any of the field flank, it cannot go back to the mining area. However, once a unit is assigned to any flank, you can re-assign it the other flank with a cost of 2 gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information of the game's &amp;quot;How to play&amp;quot;, please download the game's Rule Book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
