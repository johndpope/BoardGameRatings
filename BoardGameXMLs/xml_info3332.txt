			<description>Karmas is a game in which players roll dice to outscore each other.  Each die has its &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; face replaced with a letter, spelling K-A-R-M-A-S when all those faces are rolled.  Players take turns to roll the dice.  Various points are scored for different combinations of letters and pips rolled.  The highest points are gained for rolling all letters, essentially spelling the title of the game.  After a certain number of rounds, the game ends and the player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
