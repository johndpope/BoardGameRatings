			<description>Exploring a newly discovered tomb is so exciting! The hieroglyphs, the architecture, the sarcophagus... And... and the Mummy! Oh no, no no! Run! A brilliant idea, only foiled by the echoing thud of a dozen stone doors slamming shut! Need some keys. Oh man, keys, keys, keys! Quick!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts off with you and your friends in the central chamber of a massive tomb - with the Mummy you just woke up! Oh no! Roll your bones and move as quick as you can because once he gets his bearings, the Mummy will be after you! You'll need to roll a key to pass through the locks and escape, but the mummy takes part of your rolls making those keys even harder to find!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first person out of the tomb wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
