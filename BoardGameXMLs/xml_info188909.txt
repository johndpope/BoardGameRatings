							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Seizer&#039;s Chess</name>
									
			<description>Seizer's Chess is chess variant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first distinction is that the pieces are flat shapes that indicate movement more than rank. The shapes can be stacked in a way that allows players to still tell what pieces are stacked on top of each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second distinction is gameplay. Instead of eliminating a piece from the game when it is captured, the player actually captures, or Seizes, it and adds it to the piece they used to capture it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, if a Rook captures a Knight, the Rook+Knight can now move as a Knight or a Rook, the choice is up to the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If that combination piece is captured, then it transfers its powers on to the next piece - and so on.  This applies to Kings as well, (as the capturing piece).  Player could potentially end up with a King that can move like a Queen and leap like a Knight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creator claims that the game is so volatile that a computer cannot defeat a human player in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
