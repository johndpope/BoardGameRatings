			<description>John Romero's Daikatana (or Daikatana) is a first-person shooter computer game developed by Ion Storm and published by Eidos Interactive. Released on May 23, 2000 for Windows,[1] it was led by John Romero. The game is known as one of the major commercial failures of the computer game industry. Daikatana was later ported to the Nintendo 64. A different version of the game was developed for the Game Boy Color, with a version for the PlayStation cancelled during development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daikatana is composed of twenty-four levels  divided into four episodes. The number of maps per level varies, but is generally about three. Each episode represents a different location and time period: futuristic Japan, ancient Greece, the Dark Ages in Norway and near-future San Francisco. Gameplay tends towards fast-paced combat, although an attempt at introducing problem-solving elements was also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One element that Daikatana stressed was the important role of the protagonist's two &amp;quot;sidekicks&amp;quot;. The death of these sidekicks resulted in the failure of the mission, and their assistance was sometimes required for the completion of puzzles. Due to poor AI implementation, the sidekicks, who were one of the game's selling points, became a focus of criticism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, John Romero%27s Daikatana , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
