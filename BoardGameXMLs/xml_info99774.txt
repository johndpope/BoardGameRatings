			<description>Naruto: Ninja Council 3 is the fourth installment in the Ninja Council series for the Nintendo DS. It was released in Japan as Naruto: Saikyō Ninja Daikesshu 4 DS​ (ＮＡＲＵＴＯ－ナルト- 最強忍者大結集4 DS lit. &amp;quot;Naruto: Great Council of the Strongest Ninja 4 DS&amp;quot;?), though its character-related content such as Kimimaro, the Sound 4's special attacks and their alternate forms themselves are changed or removed in the English versions. The game comes with a Naruto CCG card as an added bonus. It also features a &amp;quot;Movie&amp;quot; mode which allows players to watch secret techniques. It was released in Europe as Naruto: Ninja Council European Edition.&lt;br/&gt; Naruto: Ninja Council 3 has similar gameplay to the last two games in the series. The missions take place on a small map. The touch screen serves as both a map and as a place to perform different jutsu. Animals and ninja are your typical opponents in the game. On certain missions, you have to fight bosses, which are usually the antagonists from the series, including Ino. During missions, the player has to defeat the opponent under various conditions (e.g. having your health cut in half, protecting an ally, use a certain move to K.O., etc.).&lt;br/&gt; Note that in the European version Itachi Uchiha, Kisame Hoshigaki, The Sound Ninja 4 and Tsunade are not available, while in the Japanese version, Kimimaro, Second State Kimimaro, Second State Sakon, Second State Jirobo, Second State Tayuya, Second State Sasuke, Kyuubi Naruto, and the Sound Ninja 4's Secret techniques are not available in the English version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Naruto: Ninja Council (series)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
