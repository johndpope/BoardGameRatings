							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carter&#039;s Quest</name>
									
			<description>Venture deep into the hidden, subterranean passages of Tutankhamen's tomb to locate the four temples devoted to the deities that protect the pharaoh in the Netherworld. Upon entering each of the four temples, the player must defeat the Temple Guardian and return the funerary jars to the King's Treasury &amp;mdash; all before Khepri raises the new sun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carter's Quest is solitaire tile-laying adventure game set in the 1920s. Portraying the world-famous archaeologist Howard Carter, the player lays tiles beginning at the King's Treasury and must find the four funerary jars and return them to the Treasury before the sun rises. Along the way, the player will collect weapons and provisions to help defend himself from the wrath of the deadly, sometimes poisonous, creatures inhabiting Tutankhamen's tomb. Find the jars, return them to the Treasury and save the world. Otherwise, you're devoured by the Pharaoh's curse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carter's Quest is a variant of Zombie in my Pocket, but this game employs a unique, dice-rolling combat system in which the items a player finds are used to modify the combat roll. Players are also at risk of being poisoned by some of the creatures in the game and will need to find the antidote or rest in the Priest's Temple; otherwise they will be consumed by the toxins and lose the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
