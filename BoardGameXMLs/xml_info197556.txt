							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Protocol Primer: A Guide to GMless Gaming</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is many things. It is a toolbox for better gaming. It is an introductory document for people who&amp;rsquo;ve never played a GMless game before. Or who are having trouble making the transition into GMless games. What it cannot be is a replacement for you and your imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GMless &amp;lsquo;story&amp;rsquo; gaming is sometimes referred to as gaming for gamemasters. As ironic as this statement is, understanding how to be a good story gamer or GMless gamer is about knowing that you aren&amp;rsquo;t gaming for just yourself anymore, but that you are putting yourself into the roles of author, storyteller, AND roleplayer at the same time &amp;mdash; skills most gamemasters have had to develop over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;this book is the first of its kind, walking gamers through the logic of gmless play and teaching them how to be good at it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
