			<description>The publisher released several packs of cards in their Top Hat Trivia series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each version has cards with six questions on each one. The form of the questions is that 3 possible answers are read out so even the youngest family member can have a blind guess with a 33% chance of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting player takes a card and rolls the die. The result indicates which question to be asked. He asks the question to the player on his left. If the correct answer is given, the answering player takes the card and now it is his turn to ask a question to the player on his left, and so on. If a question should be answered incorrectly, the player who gave the wrong answer takes the card, rolls the die and asks the player to his left a question. (which could be the same one of course).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to secure four cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
