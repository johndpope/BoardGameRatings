			<description>Wordopoly: the game that won't leave you speechless! Circle the board and encounter foreign words, abbreviations, clich&amp;eacute;s, pithy humor, and vocabulary words from English classes of past.  Does &amp;quot;magnanimous&amp;quot; mean full of spite or generous and noble? Answer correctly and advance towards the spelling bee. The first player to acquire a complete set of word definitions wins the game! This game is a great way to fall in love with language.  The 770 vocabulary words included in the game are historically found with the highest frequency on the verbal portions of standardized tests such as the SAT, adding function to its fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
