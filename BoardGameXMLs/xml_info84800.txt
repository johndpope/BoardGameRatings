			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Asylum: Psychiatric Clinic for Abused Cuddly Toys, you take on the role of the psychiatrist in a mental asylum. Your patients? Abused cuddly toys. Through various therapeutic methods, your goal is to help your patients confront their past traumatic experiences. But understanding and care is necessary for successful treatments, because choosing the wrong options could result in a relapse, psychotic episode, or worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay of The Asylum is simple and straightforward. You see each patient in the examination room. Select a treatment or diagnosis option from your clipboard. As you progress, different options will become available to you. After each selection, you will be treated to a short animated clip. And hopefully your Therapy Progress bar will grow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the cuddly toy theme, this game contains traumatic images and is not suitable for young children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
