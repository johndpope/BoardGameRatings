			<description>This game will allow learners to apply basic mountaineering, first aid, and historical knowledge in a safe, educational setting. The learners will be allowed to make typical real-life choices that will affect the outcome of their progress through the game. The learners will realize that the difference between safe hiking, and even life and death stems from the decisions that are made while hiking on a mountain. Many of the decisions a hiker needs to make are very simple but can yield drastic results given certain circumstances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is simple: be the first to hike up to the summit of Mount Washington and come back down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;    * Game Board&lt;br/&gt;    * 4 Game Pieces&lt;br/&gt;    * Six sided die&lt;br/&gt;    * 1 stack of Event Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
