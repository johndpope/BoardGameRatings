			<description>Overview (by the publisher): At the tournament place, the knights want to prove themselves. The colored symbol dice are thrown into the dice tower, showing new challenges every turn. The various symbols and colors have to be sorted. Which is the largest set? Skill is necessary when flicking the pieces. The more dice match the target space, the further the Knight can move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: The active player throws the six dice and a small wooden cube into the dice tower. The player then flicks a wooden disk. If he hits one of the target spaces, he claims the dice that show the matching result (color or symbol). Then the other players in turn order also flick the disk to try to claim some of the remaining dice. After this, the next player becomes the active player, and continues with throwing all dice into the tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each die collected moves the player's knight one step forward. The first knight reaching to other side of the tower wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also rules for a variant in which the players bet which symbol they will roll, get points for matching symbols, and are able to change their bet by paying dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
