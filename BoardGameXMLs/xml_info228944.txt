							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hermetica</name>
									
			<description>Hermetica is a two-player strategy game set on a dynamic board in which each player must leverage tactical movement and clever combos to outwit their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a hexagonal grid in which each player takes one side and attempts to move their &amp;quot;adept&amp;quot; piece across the board and into the opponent's base. Along with the adept, each player has access to three unique elemental pieces. Each of these four pieces has their own distinct move set that will provide players with a host of options and combos for capturing enemy pieces while vying for board control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to dynamic terrain and control over what pieces will be deployed and when, each game plays differently than the last. Lock down strategic choke points. Restructure obstacles to shut down your opponent or open new paths of your own. Set up devastating combos to take your opponent by surprise. With tons of options available to each player at every turn, the possibilities are endless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
