			<description>Game based on the small town of Vila de Almeida. Short listed in the Boulogne-Billancourt International Competition - Paris. The game rules and play draw their inspiration from the actual history and architecture of Vila de Almeida.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almeida is a small town surrounded by two walls, making it very difficult to conquer. Not even an army is able to penetrate its defenses. The key to the town's defeat is the gunpowder magazine found in the castle. Six spies take advantage of the dark to enter the town undetected. Once inside they hope to conquer the castle. To do so they need to find a key hidden in the town. Will they be able to achieve their goal before sunrise? Will there be a double agent among them who will boycott the mission...?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is for 2 to 6 players, whose object is to enter the town's castle. To do so the player needs to find the key to the castle. For ages 8 and up. 30 minute game time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game box includes detailed information about the actual history which inspired the game. The rule book contains various illustrations to help learn the game and clarify all situations and rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
