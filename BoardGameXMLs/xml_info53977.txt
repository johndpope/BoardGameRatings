							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Web</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the Webs Goals and History chapter in the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Web seeks nothing less than complete subjugation of the entire world. Whether through direct control, intimidation, deception, or other means, the organization plans to master all political, financial, and military power in the world. This goal reflects the personal ambitions of Web's top leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their determination is also reflected by Web's methods. The organization will use whatever means are necessary to accomplish its goals. Sponsoring crime, terrorism, revolution, and political unrest, Web undermines governments, companies, organizations of all kinds, and eliminates anyone who stands in its way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If known, Web's goals and methods would be resisted at every turn. Therefore, an overriding goal-and method-of Web is secrecy. Web's ultimate success depends on its concealment-for now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite being a world-wide organization involving hundreds of thousands of people, Web's very existence, let alone its scope, is known only to a handful of people. These few divide the spoils of Web's rise to dominate the world. The vast majority of Web's operatives, like the innocent victims they prey on, will remain ignorant of the true goals and power of the organization until it is to late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Begin Communication&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To: All TOP SECRET/SI game agents and Administrators &lt;br/&gt;From: Orion Foundation&lt;br/&gt;Re: Classified Information - Utmost Secrecy imperative!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, for the first time ever between one pair of covers, is collected all of the known facts and educated speculation about The Web - the evil, power-hungry organization that is Orion Foundation's nemesis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: All of the information in this book is for the Administrator's eyes only. If you are a player of the TOP SECRET/S.I. game and you discover a copy of this document with the protective plastic wrap removed, do NOT look inside. Doing so could have unsatisfying consequences. Your Administrator will reveal information to you from this book when he or she deems such action appropriate or necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the Administrator:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE WEB Is a comprehensive overview of the criminal group that Orion is dedicated to destroying. It contains a history of the organization, descriptions of Its standard operating procedures, a summary of its present-day status, and dossiers on each of the regional agencies that are scattered around the globe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, you can build up your campaign by using several scenarios that describe missions for Orion agents&amp;mdash;adventures for TOP SECRET/S.I. player characters that strike at the very heart of The Web's structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the players in your campaign have been eager for new worlds to conquer, new obstacles to overcome, THE WEB will more than satisfy that desire, introduce player-character agents to one strand of The Web - then let them follow it and find out where it leads....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End Communication&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
