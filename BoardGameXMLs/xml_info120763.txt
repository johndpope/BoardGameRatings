							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Azamar Core Rules Supplement</name>
									
			<description>from the index page of the PDF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Azamar Players Guide was released as a complete Core book; however there were organizational deficits that did not make it into the final cut.  Chief among these is the Character Feature Index, an integral and extremely useful alphabetized list of every Character Feature in the Azamar Players Guide.  This Gamers Supplement provides not only the Character Feature Index, but also exclusive Character Sheets with new, original art illustrated by Khairul Hisham.&lt;br/&gt; Additionally, the Gamers Supplement includes a quick reference for all the tables throughout the Azamar Players Guide.  At the tail end of the Gamers Supplement is also a rehashing of the mini campaign and adventure, The Road to Azamar.  Take a look, enjoy the content, and explore the amazing world of Azamar.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
