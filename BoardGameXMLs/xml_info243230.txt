			<description>Kwis &amp;lsquo;t! is a quizgame with a twist. You are able to win without answering most questions correct. You win Kwis &amp;lsquo;t! by psychology, knowing your facts and a little luck. Every player answers the same five questions per round. After the correct answers have been given to you, you put your marker on how many questions you&amp;rsquo;ve answered correct. However, you can bluff! You can earn bonus by fooling your opponents and by calling a bluff of an opponent. Use your reputation as a walking encyclopaedia or a notorious braggart. If you outsmart your opponents, you win Kwis &amp;lsquo;t!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kwis &amp;lsquo;t! is Dutch for Quiz it. If you pronounce it fast, it sounds like &amp;lsquo;I knew it&amp;rsquo; (In Dutch). The game has easy game rules and contains lots of verbal and non-verbal interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kwis &amp;lsquo;t! has more than 1.150 original questions in all different kinds of categories. Every set of five questions consists of two open questions, two multiple choice questions (with A, B and C) and one 50/50 question. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know the answer, you can still make an educated guess. You guessed wrong? You can still bluff that you gave the correct answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
