			<description>Manual&lt;br/&gt;VECTOR CHAMPIONSHIP RUN FEATURES FAST FORMULA ONE ACTION, WITH VECTOR GRAPHICS THAT ARE SIMPLY STUNNING!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOUR FINELY TUNED CAR IS CONTROLLED BY A MOUSE OR A JOYSTICK CONNECTED TO THE RELEVANT PORT ON THE 16 BIT MACHINE. THE DESIRED CONTROL METHOD IS SELECTED BY PRESSING  'J' ON THE KEYBOARD, WHICH TOGGLES BETWEEN THE TWO OPTIONS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;USING THE MOUSE CONTROL METHOD, PRESSING THE LEFT HAND BUTTON ACCELERATES THE CAR, AND PRESSING THE RIGHT HAND BUTTON ACTIVATES THE BRAKE. MOVING THE LEFT OR RIGHT WILL MOVE THE CAR IN THAT DIRECTION .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;USING THE JOYSTICK CONTROL METHOD, PUSHING UP ON THE JOYSTICK ACCELERATES THE CAR, AND PULLING BACK ON THE JOYSTICK APPLIES THE BRAKE. MOVING THE JOYSTICK LEFT OR RIGHT WILL MOVE THE CAR IN THAT DIRECTION.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE RACES FEATURE EXACT SCALE REPLICAS OF THE FOLLOWING INTERNATIONAL&lt;br/&gt;CIRCUITS:&lt;br/&gt;SILVERSTONE&lt;br/&gt;IMOLA&lt;br/&gt;MONACO&lt;br/&gt;DETROIT&lt;br/&gt;TRANWELL&lt;br/&gt;SAN MARINO&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ON THE SELECTION SCREEN, CLICKING ON AUTO OR GEARS ALLOWS YOU TO SELECT BETWEEN A MANUAL OR AN AUTOMATIC THREE SPEED GEARBOX.
