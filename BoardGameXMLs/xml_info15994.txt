							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Throw Up</name>
									
			<description>According to the publisher, &amp;quot;It's loud, it's ludicrous, it's brilliant. THROW UP is the appallingly funny NEW game for two or more. Get your wits in gear or suffer the consequences&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THROW UP is usually played as a drinking game (rule 1: &amp;quot;Ensure that you have a ready supply of liquid refreshments&amp;quot;). The game begins as a rhythmic word game. Players tap the table and clap in rhythm. The first player calls out a word and the player to his/her left shouts out a word that begins with the final letter of the first word (e.g., word 1 = &amp;quot;cat&amp;quot;, word 2 = &amp;quot;ten&amp;quot;, word 3 = &amp;quot;naked&amp;quot;...). Players who cannot think of a word, break the rhythm, or who make a mistake must roll a pewter die (it is in the form of a drunk; it reminds me of the pigs in &amp;quot;Pass the Pigs&amp;quot;) to determine a penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The position of the die determines the penalty:&lt;br/&gt;? A choker: take a large swallow.&lt;br/&gt;? A sticky ear (bottle up): you and the player to your left take a large swallow.&lt;br/&gt;? A sticky ear (fish up): you and the player to your right take a large swallow.&lt;br/&gt;? A gutter: choose one of the other players to take a large swallow.&lt;br/&gt;? A dribbler: propose a toast; everyone takes a drink.&lt;br/&gt;? A tumble: Off the table, finish your glass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes:&lt;br/&gt;? 1 Pewter drunk figure&lt;br/&gt;? 1 pen&lt;br/&gt;? 1 forfeit pad&lt;br/&gt;? 1 forfeit summary card&lt;br/&gt;? 1 carry pouch&lt;br/&gt;? 1 set of rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
