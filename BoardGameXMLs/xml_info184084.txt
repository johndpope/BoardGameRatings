			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anarcha Australis is set in Australia...around 2020. After the Total Economic Collapse...[of] 1993...Australia turned into a total anarchy.  Looting and other crimes turned rife as the prices on commercial products skyrocketed; the government attempted to bring back economic order by re-evaluating the economy, and released the $500 coin.  However, it was too late; the entire country collapsed.  In the next five years, crime, disease and famine ruled as families attempted to survive in the total chaos of post-economic collapse.  The government, after its initial attempts of stabilisation, faded away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Released only as an ASCII text file.  The core rules are minimal but nearly complete.  The game often is referred to online as Anarcho Australis (with an &amp;quot;-o&amp;quot;) but the rules consistently use Anarcha Australis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
