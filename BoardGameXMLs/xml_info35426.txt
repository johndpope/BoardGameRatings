			<description>From the game bix:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Purchase leases&lt;br/&gt;     Acquire a rig&lt;br/&gt;     Drill and complete&lt;br/&gt;     Sell oil to create revenue&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The roll of the dice and the luck of the draw combined with the skillful movement of your token and keen Wildcat bidding could make you rich in the game of BLACK GOLD. But watch out for the Patch Problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For ages 8 to adult&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADDITIONAL note:&lt;br/&gt;The game was created in the small town of Rhein, Saskatchewan Canada. No designer name given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Box cover has 4 colour photographs of oil well-related scenes. Good board quality. Has look as though it would play along lines of Monopoly mechanics-wise&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
