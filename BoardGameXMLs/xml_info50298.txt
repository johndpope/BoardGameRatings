			<description>For the second edition of the Legend of the Five Rings (L5R) rpg, they split the core rules into two books: a Player's Guide and a Game Master's Guide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notably, the game is listed as a Wizards of the Coast endorsed product as this arrived during the period when the L5R CCG intellectual property was under WoTC's control. It advances the metaplot to post-Clan War and closer to the first CCG material. It integrates a great deal of material from various supplements for the first edition of the L5R rpg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also worth noting that the ready-to-play adventure presented here is a sequel to the adventure included in the first edition of the L5R GM's screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revised and updated, the Legend of the Five Rings Game Master's Guide contains everything you need to create your own Emerald Empire! Within these pages, you will find everything from monsters to natural disasters; from provinces of the Empire to the dangers of the Imperial Court. Discover your own adventures within the world of the popular Legend of the Five Rings collectible card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game Master's Guide includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Easy to get started: Complete information on provinces, new maps and charts, and easy-to-find information on the length and breadth of the Emerald Empire. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Culture and History: Choose your time period- before or after the Clan War- and prepare to be immersed in one of the richest and most detailed game worlds ever created. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Shadowlands: Complete information on the most dangerous realm in the Empire, including details on the Taint, the creatures of the dark God, and the secrets you will discover beyond its dangerous borders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Extras: Dozens of charts, creatures, statistics, and a ready-to-play introductory adventure: &amp;quot;The Haunting of Usagi Castle.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
