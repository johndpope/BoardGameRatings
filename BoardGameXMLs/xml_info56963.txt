			<description>Endless Quest #22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From back of book:&lt;br/&gt;You are only too well aware of the wizard's curse placed on the dreaded Endless Catacombs. Now the curse is beginning to spread its evil throughout the land. Do you dare accompany the strange band of adventurers into the catacombs to attempt to remove the curse?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are about to enter the exciting world experienced by the players of the popular DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS Game. It is a fantasy world filled with enchanted castles and fearsome monsters. Are YOU brave enough to meet its challenges?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In other ENDLESS QUEST Books, you can combat secret agents skilled in espionage, journey to the corners of the galaxy, or attempt to survive in a future world ravaged by wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each ENDLESS QUEST Book is based on an exciting role-playing game, but you don't need to know the game to enjoy the book. Just make your choices, and accept the consequences!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember! Only your choices lead to success in ENDLESS QUEST Books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
