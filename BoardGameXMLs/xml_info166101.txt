							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dream Collectors</name>
									
			<description>You are a Dream Collector, a broker for one of the Dream Lords, powerful beings that feast on the energy of our unconscious imagination.  Your Dream Lord has tasked you to collect its favorite Dream Energies with the promise of anything you desire as a reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But be careful: there are other Dream Collectors hunting Dream Energies for their own Dream Lords and no Dream Lord likes to be outdone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a Dream Lord that they will represent at the start of play.  That Dream Lord has a favored Dream Energy and two complimentary Dream Energies listed on its card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you and the opposing player have selected your Dream Lords, you each take turns placing the remaining cards orthogonally to build the Dreamscape.  The objective is to build Dreampaths along the Dreamscape, your Dream Lord's favored Dream Energies that connect in a continuous unbroken path up, down, left, or right (but not diagonal).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the Dreamscape has been completely assembled, players score their Dreampaths.  The more preferred Dream Energies in the path, the higher points value it is worth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
