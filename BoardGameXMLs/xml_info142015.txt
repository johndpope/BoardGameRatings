			<description>Pompker is a &amp;quot;push-up poker&amp;quot;. It's a pun in polish language, because it's a combination of words &amp;quot;pompki&amp;quot; (push-ups) and &amp;quot;poker&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entire gameplay is similar to Texas Hold'em but there are some exceptions. The players do not have any starting amount of &amp;quot;money&amp;quot;. Instead of money they bid with push-ups. During the game they can bid how much they want but bidding too much is a risk of losing. After finishing the round there is a winner who does not have to do the push-ups that he bid. All other players have to do the push-up according to how much they bid. The winning player gains as many points as all other players did push-ups in that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each loosing player gains the points too (unless he passes and bids 0). He gains as many points as he did push-ups in that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If any player is not able to do the push-ups that he bid, he is out of the game and he scores minus points for the push-ups that he was supposed to do (e.g. if he bid 50 and he does 40, he gets  -10 points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game end when all players but one are eliminated. The winner is not the last player in the game, but the player who scored the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
