			<description>Be the first to move all your pieces into your target area and detain your opponent. With jumps and clever changes of your track switches you block your opponent and redirect your pieces to the shortest route. If you move into the opponent's target area instead, he then has to change one of his own switches as his next turn.&lt;br/&gt;A neat wooden game with nice components. Several variants (such as possible capture) are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
