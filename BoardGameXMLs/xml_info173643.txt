			<description>WyrmRider is a 2 player microgame in the one page &amp;quot;postcard&amp;quot; style&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: One player places the 3 wyrms anywhere on the 6 spaces on their side of the board. The other player places the 4 riders anywhere on the six spaces on their side. Players may orient the counters in any direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play: Beginning with the wyrm player, each player takes a turn by rotating, moving and combatting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rotating - A player may rotate their counter 60&amp;deg; clockwise or counterclockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving - The player may then move any counter 1 hex in distance in any direction, maintaining the counter&amp;rsquo;s current orientation. If the player chose not to rotate a counter they may instead move a counter 2 hexes in distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combatting - After rotating, and/or moving, a player may attack one adjacent piece of the opposing player with any of their counters. A player may only attack in the directions indicated by the red arrows (arrows must point perpendicular to an adjacent hex side). Players each roll one six-sided die, the attacking player gains a +1 to their roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the attacker&amp;rsquo;s roll is greater than the defender, the defending piece is removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the defender has more than one counter adjacent to the attacking counter and they have lost combat, they may immediately combat once as a new attacker, before the start of their normal turn. The +1 rule applies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win: A player wins by moving one of their counters on to the &lt;br/&gt;opposing player&amp;rsquo;s home space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
