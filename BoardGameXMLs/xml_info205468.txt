			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once upon a time, not too long ago, a handful of scientists, explorers and science-heroes &amp;ndash; let&amp;rsquo;s call them &amp;lsquo;Reality-Nauts&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash;  found a way to access the Multiverse.  They found an alternate Earth, very much like their own, but different in interesting ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These Reality-Nauts soon discovered that this Earth had its own explorers, scientists and science heroes studying the idea of the Multiverse and attempting to open a portal.  However, no-one on this Earth had managed it yet.  Reality-hopping is the one single exceptional piece of technology that the people of this alternate Earth had not yet worked out for themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the greatest surprise was this: just as one team of Reality-Nauts stepped out onto this alternate Earth, so did four other groups of Reality-Nauts from four other worlds!   A small handful of Earths &amp;ndash; independent of each other &amp;ndash; developed their own means of transporting themselves across realities, and had converged on this one reality at the same, exact moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
