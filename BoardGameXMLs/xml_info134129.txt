			<description>Cultures Online is a free-to-play browser-based Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game. After you have registered for the game, you can test your skill against other Vikings and chat with other players in the forum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your hero's adventure starts in his or her village way in the icy north on an island somewhere in the vicinity of Iceland. Hire more Vikings and decide whether you want them to help you expand your village or to accompany your hero on raiding expeditions. Bear in mind, though, that only your heroes will be able to make the other Vikings in the village work. You choose how your village should develop. Are you more the warrior type, a builder, or a great researcher? Your decision will influence the opportunities that become available to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
