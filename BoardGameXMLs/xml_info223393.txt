							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dark Hallway Quick Start Guide</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ancient civilizations that lived in caves, often referred to as &amp;ldquo;cave men&amp;rdquo;, knew this, that all caves were interlinked into a vast underworld. When men started to build pyramids and ziggurats with cave-like tunnels, somehow, always, there was a door to this underground, no matter how hidden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All major ground structures that intersect with the underground, whether through a passage, a basement, a dungeon, or sewer &amp;ndash; all inevitably connect to the Hallway. The Hallway changes, expands, contracts - every time an earthquake shifts the foundations, construction of some great monument or tunnel system commences, and likewise, the Hallway incorporates it and becomes larger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have been to the furthest reaches of space, but not underground of our very planet Earth. Who knows what awaits us down there?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Civilizations may rise and fall, the Hallway will always be there until the end of Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dark Hallway is designed to be used on bulletin boards and forums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
