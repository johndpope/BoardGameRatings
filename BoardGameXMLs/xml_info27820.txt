			<description>Army Brats is a game to be played with a standard piecepack.  The players are in military school, and are trying to get kicked out for excessively poor attendance.  Players can work on getting demerits by getting caught having enough forged absentee passes to skip half or more of a school day (pair through four-of-a-kind), or to dodge homework by missing three or more days in a row of the same class (runs of three or more).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players acquire these forged passes by moving to an adjacent classroom of the desired subject, and then either dealing with the non-player student in that room, or forcing a trade with another player.  The types of trades you can make depend on the sort of pass you have for your current classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player gets herself &amp;quot;caught&amp;quot; with a demerit-worthy set of passes, she receives more demerits for a strongly incriminating set of passes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to 20 demerits wins, and is free from the hard military life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
