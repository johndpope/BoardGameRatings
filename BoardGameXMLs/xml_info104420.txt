			<description>In the city of Kayin, the decision was taken to build a wall to split the city in two due to diverging ideologies. Now is the time to decide where the wall will run.&lt;br/&gt;Each player plays the leader for one side, vying against each other to get the most value to their side. You are using your influence to convince the undecided to join you, have important places on your side and important events in the city&amp;rsquo;s life happen there.&lt;br/&gt;However, you need to find the right ways to exercise your influence. Will you find the inspiration at the right time? You will have to roll the dice to know and choose the ideas (Decktet suits) you keep wisely to take the advantage over your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Wall, players throw a bunch of dice, and then decide to use those for either taking influence counters or paying the influence value of one of three cards available at that time. The card then goes into one of three categories (People, Places, Events) on the player side, to try to take control of that category.&lt;br/&gt;Players also have identical Action-card decks, giving them a random special action every turn.&lt;br/&gt;In the end, whoever controls more categories wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
