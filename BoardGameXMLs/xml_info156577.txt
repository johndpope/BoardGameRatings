			<description>Grandpa Willy&amp;rsquo;s brain might not be the freshest anymore, but he&amp;rsquo;s not ready to surrender it to the zombies anytime soon! If only the brakes would function on his wheelchair&amp;hellip; Brace yourself for crazy puzzle fun and help Willy to safely navigate through the zombie apocalypse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;90 LEVELS FULL OF UNDEAD&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just after waking up in a hospital, Grandpa Willy quickly realizes that there&amp;rsquo;s something fishy going on and that the world has changed. There&amp;rsquo;s no time to ask questions though since the zombies are already pounding on the door.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Grandpa and the Zombies&amp;rdquo; is a fast-paced trip through 90 levels and three different worlds, which shows that you can also survive a zombie invasion in a wheelchair. The levels are filled to the brim with the craziest undead that make Grandpa Willy&amp;rsquo;s escape that much harder including stinky Halitosis Jack or the Forklift of Evil. Some of the undead can even be really helpful if you know how to interact with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE PUZZLE FOR THE FEARLESS FROM 8-88&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cool head, logic and vision are called for in order to reach the saving elevator move-by-move in every level while collecting as many candies as possible. Grandpa Willy is not in the mood for zombies but he loves candy more than anything and is willing to make a detour for this.&lt;br/&gt;Steer Grandpa Willy&amp;rsquo;s wheelchair through the various levels. Grandpa Willy will roll only as far as he can until reaching an obstacle. And this better not be a zombie! Use obstacles, light declines and hazards cleverly and disorient the zombies. This is how you reach the saving elevator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Satisfying gameplay thanks to three different worlds and a total of 90 levels&lt;br/&gt;Horrible zombies &amp;ndash; flee from Halitosis Jack, Bevil and Revil or the Forklift of Death!&lt;br/&gt;A new challenge in every level&lt;br/&gt;The apocalypse has never been this funny: ingenious comic-style for adults and children&lt;br/&gt;The zombie apocalypse! Challenge your friends on Facebook or Twitter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
