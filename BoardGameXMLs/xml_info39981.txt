			<description>This is one of the statistics-based sports simulation games of Lambourne's. It is a replay simulation of English domestic one-day cricket (Refuge Assurance League, Benson &amp;amp; Hedges Cup, National West Bank Trophy). In these leagues play is limited to 40 overs (hence the name) to make sure that the game can be finished in one day, which is in contrast to standard cricket and international matches where a game can take some days to finish.&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a player list. Player statistics are based on real-world players, rated for batting, wicket-keeping and, if appropriate, bowling. Weather and pitch conditions are taken into account, and the events are then determined by rolling dice against the player stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
