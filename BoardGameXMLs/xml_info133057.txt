			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is based on a combination of two ideas I have had tumbling around in my brain for a while. One was to make a game about tv shows &amp;ndash; not a roleplaying game structured as a tv show (such as  N/A), but a game about the actual creation of a tv show. That influence should be quite obvious here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second idea was to invert the usual roleplaying game structure of one GM and multiple players. Some games play around with this in other ways, usually by making all players game masters in some sense, or by having the GM role rotate between the players, but I wanted to do a straight inversion with multiple GM:s and a single player. The obvious way to do this was to split the various tasks that are normally assigned to the GM (creating the world, setting scenes, portraying NPCs etc). To make this work I felt I had to do two things: make sure there was enough for each GM to do, and have a structure that made the divisions clear since there would be no &amp;quot;super-GM&amp;quot; who could say what everyone should do. By using rough approximations of the roles of the people behind the scenes of a tv show I feel I have found at least one way of doing this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I know that some may not consider this game a roleplaying game, which is fine. I am not hung up on terminology, but to me this fulfills the basic requirements of a roleplaying game: a game that has as its main function the collaborative creation of stories. I hope you'll have fun with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
