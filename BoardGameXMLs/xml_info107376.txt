			<description>One player (or team) creates a murder case, by selecting a suspect, place, motive and method. The other player (or team) then has to find out this information by making guesses, also consisting of a suspect, location, motive and method. After each guess, they are told how many items they got correct, but not which.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the guessing player (or team) solves the case within seven attempts, they score points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each round, the roles are reversed. The first player to reach a pre-determined amount of points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the travel edition of Murder Mystery Mansion. It uses magnetic tokens instead of cards. Other than that, the main difference is the size: this travel version has four suspects, three locations, three motives and three methods. The regular version has six of each, and the guessing team gets twelve rounds to solve the crime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
