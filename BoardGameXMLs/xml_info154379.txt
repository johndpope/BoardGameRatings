			<description>In this abstract puzzle game you battle your opponents in an attempt to outwit them before they do the same to you. You do this by picking a random game piece from the bag and placing it on your side of the board in an attempt to make a match of 3 or more like pieces. Once a match has been made you take those matched pieces and place them on your opponent's side of the board trying really hard to mess their day up. The game is over and you are victorious once your opponent can not make any matches whatsoever...even if they tried really really hard or their side of the board is full.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To add some ball'n variation to the game there are different characters to play as; each with their own special ability that is triggered whenever that player makes a match of its color. There are also white game pieces and black game pieces that will help you and hinder your opponent when drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a 2v2 game mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
