							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wargames Rules 1950-2000</name>
									
			<description>A tabletop wargame system for simulating modern engagements. This is the second version of this game and is actually used by several modern armies for training purposes. It is designed for battle group encounters and generally uses played using 1/300th or 1/285th scale white metal miniatures on a one man = one man or one vehicle = one vehicle scale, but a good skirmish game can be had by figures up to 28mm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules cover terrain laying by the players (no need for pre-written scenarios), non-random training morale ratings that affect troop behavior, and scenarios based on player-chosen force postures, such as Encounters, Hasty Attack, Hasty defense, Inert defense, Deliberate Attack and Prepared defense. It allows the simulation of amphibious assaults, helicopter borne troops, precision weapons, modern MBTs and is current till 2010 with the current expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system emphasize tactics and terrain command and control. They pay attention to troop psychology, what is possible to do with the men who control the weapons, and how these men can be efficiently commanded. Infantry are essential and their tactics more varied. With the attached points values, this system can be used in conventions and competitions where players expect to have similarly-capable forces, even though their opponents may never have fought historically. A 1950's army, using the system's clever victory conditions, can take on the latest Western army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
