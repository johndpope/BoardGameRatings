							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Raleigh Burner Freestyle BMX Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Description from the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;BMX is one of the fastest growing sports today. Not everyone can get to race on a BMX track but with care and skill can learn many freestyle &amp;quot;tricks&amp;quot; almost anywhere. You don't even have to own a BMX bike to play this game, but if you do, playing it will show by &amp;quot;stop action&amp;quot; sequence: Wheelies, Endos, Pogos, Buckin' Broncos, Kickturns and lots more. The winner is the player who &amp;quot;performs&amp;quot; by collecting the most sets of freestyle &amp;quot;tricks&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is back by the people who should  know - Raleigh and their BMX Factory Team. Get to know your Pogos from your Endos!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
