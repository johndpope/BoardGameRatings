			<description>From the publisher's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for Fantasy Wargaming!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy wargaming system based on the popular Vis Bellica rules for Ancient &amp;amp; Medieval wargaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Figures based as chunky elements that correctly represent ground scale.  Easy to move round the table and look good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An average game consists of about 120 figures a side, and takes about 2&amp;frac12;-3 hours of play to resolve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A combat system that doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve complicated book-keeping or rolling more than two or three dice at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A command structure where figures are grouped as regular &amp;lsquo;brigades&amp;rsquo; or irregular &amp;lsquo;contingents&amp;rsquo; that report to officers that report to more senior officers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A command system where officers could, on a parade ground, successfully issue a limited set of orders to the figures under their command, but this ability breaks down rapidly as the 'fog of war' descends during a battle.   &lt;br/&gt; Hidden movement possible without the need for a referee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An army list philosophy that allows you to use any figures from any manufacturer:  to use your imagination! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
