							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Worldship</name>
									
			<description>The universe is dying.  You and the other surviving remnants of various alien species have managed to remain alive these past months by pooling all of your resources into a communal Worldship, on which you all live.  The Worldship has arrived in a new system - and each species has sent out a team to scout for information &amp;amp; resources.  If you can work together and repair &amp;amp; refuel the Worldship before it leaves then everyone can continue to survive.  If some tasks prove too difficult, then one or more species will have to be left behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to not be left behind - but whether that means cooperation or competition is up to each individual player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
