			<description>This is a race between 2-4 gangsters and up to 23 policemen. The board depicts a town with 170 hex spaces. 60 of them are specially marked and are filled with turned down &amp;quot;houses&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 player takes the role of the police and the others take the role of the gangsters. The gangsters can enter the houses and take the tiles laying there. Some of them are worth just money, but there are also tiles with several transportation possibilities like cars or planes, which allows faster movement than normal or robbing a bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game proceeds, the police player will get more and more policemen. He must try to eliminate the gangsters by surrounding them completely. The game ends when all gangsters have left the town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A little strange the victory conditions: the gangster with the highest amount of prey is the winner. There is no given victory condition for the police player, but it's suggested to play as many games as there are players, so each player has been the police once!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
