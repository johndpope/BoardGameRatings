			<description>Publisher Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE GAME CONGRESSMEN NEVER STOP PLAYING -- REELECTION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Okay so you've just been elected to Congress. You're young and looking forward to a long and rewarding career. And why shouldn't you be? Everyone loves you, or you wouldn't have been elected in the first place. It should be a snap, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next thing you know, you're seated in the halls of Congress, tossing around billions of dollars like confetti at a ticker tape parade; Department of Defense, 340 billion last year, and looking for 380 billion this year; HEW got 30 billion last year, and say they need 10 billion more. By now. you're beginning to wonder--what about my effect on unemployment? Oh, no!! What about reelection?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just when you're beginning to think that it might pay to keep a lower profile, (at least until you get the hang of it), the agenda moves into roll call voting. Sure you've got all the figures. You know what percentages of your constituency are blue collar workers, unemployed, elderly, farmers, etc., but the word is out that the President wants you to vote &amp;quot;yea&amp;quot; on this issue, and &amp;quot;nay&amp;quot; on that issue, and you wonder ... &amp;quot;Why is he doing this to me?&amp;quot; And the lobbies! Your district is telling you NO on increased Social Security benefits, but the liberal lobby keeps saying YE$, YE$, YE$, and after all ... what about reelection?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's the scenario in this superb simulation from the author of Santa Paravia, 'Round the Horn, Troll's Gold. After you and up to 5 other players have finished your term in the hot seat, comes the moment you've been waiting for as you're up for reelection against such celebrities as Jane Fonda and Milton Schapp. How you fare depends entirely on your ability to be all things to all people at all times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One thing's for sure, your constituency will let you know just how they feel ... are you listening, Richard?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
