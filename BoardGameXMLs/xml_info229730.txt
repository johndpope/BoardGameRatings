							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blackwheel Company: A Few Good Gnolls</name>
									
			<description>A One-Round Faction Adventure Packet for 7th to 10th-Level Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After gathering various fragments of giant history from Ek Tlelnak and using those to help interpret portions of the Caldyn Fragments, Blackwheel scholars discovered the location of a cache of information on one of the giants' long-forgotten armageddon machines. Unfortunately, knowledge of its whereabouts also fell into the hands of the Cabal of Shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of hires recently retrieved two schemas &amp;mdash; of four in total &amp;mdash; that comprised the most important part of the device. The Cabal of Shadows recovered the other two parts. Since then, Arclight has been studying the schemas in a special skunkworks building in Stormreach to determine first whether Blackwheel can use anything from them, and second, how to ensure that the device can&amp;rsquo;t be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, the Cabal of Shadows has a friend within Blackwheel Company. General Mach Ogdin, a slovenly, foul-tempered man has decided that the best way to break free from the Dragonmarked houses is to splinter Blackwheel from within, wrest control from Field Marshal Maceck, and put it all back together under his command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He has provided the Cabal the plans to the skunkworks building, logs and orders for the security details there, and provided them with inside access to the building. For months now, the Cabal have been planning to steal the Arclight Division&amp;rsquo;s research on the Ek Tlelwot Device, bomb the building to destroy any evidence of their involvement, then assemble and set off the device in the Southern city of Ek Tlelwot with the intent to destroy as much of Xen&amp;rsquo;drik as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
