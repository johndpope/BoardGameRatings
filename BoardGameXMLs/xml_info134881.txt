			<description>In-Game Briefing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Orion galaxy is now controlled by the strict rule of an ambitious dictator.

Their goal: to bring back democracy and to make it work!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, as the Rebel Leader, your goal is to defeat the forces of the dictator and help the rebellion gain victory. The duties are not easy! As a warrior,  you must fight and defeat  all 10 capitals to win!  Remember: the rebellion is counting on you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Warning: the Emperor's death fighter squadrons are looking for you and your warship.
