			<description>The monastery of Shewsbridge lies on a small hill that overlooks the countryside. Its Prior has fallen ill and the monks have decided it is time to call for at vote to find out who will be his successor. There are two primary contenders for the title, you and your fellow player. As custom have it you are not allowed to be in the monastery during the three days of voting. You are therefore located in a small camp outside with eight novices to help you. After the election you are going to enter the monastery and receive the monks&amp;rsquo; decision. However, you are both very proud so you&amp;rsquo;ve made a private agreement. During the days of voting you will send in your novices in secret to find out what the general opinion is on some of the 5 major issues in the monastery. Before the voting begins you both write down your opinion on each issue on a scroll and seal it safely away. When the third day arrives you will open the scrolls and compare your scroll with the general opinion in the monastery that you&amp;rsquo;ve gathered from your novices. The one you think will win the election will enter the monastery and win the game. The other will leave the monastery for good to pursue a life elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt; CONTENTS&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 Rulebook &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 Game Board&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 Bag&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 Watch Pawn&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 5 Issuecubes&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 8 Novices&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 10 Issuecards&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 50 Monktokens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
