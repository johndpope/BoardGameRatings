			<description>From the Publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HoopWorld is a 3-on-3 basketball game with an arcade twist: unique characters and beautiful natural locations set the stage, while fighting and random power-ups keep the game fast and rough. Choose your favorite team and basketbrawl across the globe to become the undisputed World Champions. Play on your own or with a friend, and see if you can beat the leaders of the HoopWorld global ranking. Are you ready?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago, a lost civilization called the Elders, who worshipped the magical power of Nature, built a network of sacred temples around the world. Millennia have since passed, and the temples lie in ruins. But their energy still resonates from the land, attracting adventurers from distant lands. Drawn by the unknown force, friends have begun to rebuild the ruins into ball courts, knowing only that they must relive the time-honored test of spirit of the Elders: the game now known as basketball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
