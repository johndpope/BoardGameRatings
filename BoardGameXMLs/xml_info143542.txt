			<description>Publisher's Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Test your mettle as you battle for the favor of the heavens. In Shoku, followers of the Sun and the Moon wage war across a primeval battlefield in order to prove the supremacy of their god. Curry the favor of the gods at your own risk, however, as each boon they grant you will also give spiritual power to your enemy. Shoku is a 2 player strategy board game. The deceptively simple rules give way to deep strategy that rewards a blend of reserved patience and bold maneuvers in game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shoku is a 2 player abstract strategy board game in which players try to capture the enemy city on the opposite side of the board. Players use 4 unit types: Swordsmen, Archers, Shield Bearers, and Horsemen, each with different abilities. The board consists of 5 types of hexes: Fire, Water, Earth, Air, and city, each with different effects on the units. A player may make additional moves one right after the other, but this allows the opponent to make even more additional moves later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shoku board included with the game is only one of many possible maps to play on, creating a great deal of variety from game to game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
