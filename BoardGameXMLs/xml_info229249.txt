			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Rash_3D Road Rash 3D]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays similarly to previous games developed in the Road Rash series, which involves the player racing their motorcycle against other motorcyclists.[1] Gameplay favors an arcade-like style, with little emphasis on realism.[2] While racing, the player has the option of punching, or using weapons to attack other opponents, to slow down their progress.[3] The ultimate goal is to place first in the race in order to earn money to upgrade the player's motorcycle.[4] Conversely, the worst scenario is to finish last, which doesn't earn money, or be stopped by police officers, where the player actually loses money. Despite sharing many characteristics with past games in the series, Road Rash 3D puts a stronger emphasis on the racing aspect of the game, and less on combat.[5]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The individual courses for the game are pieced together from a larger system of interconnected grids of roads.[3] Courses may overlap common segments of other tracks, but often have different start or end points, or have the player turning down alternate routes.[3] While the player can opt to take the wrong route, taking them very far typically results in hitting &amp;quot;invisible walls&amp;quot; that restrict further movement in the given direction.[6]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
