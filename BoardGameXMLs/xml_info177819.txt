							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City of the Lich</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Osgurith, a sun drenched city of sultry warmth and light. Where smoky eyed women with raven hair sing as they harvest oranges from the trees.  Where olive-skinned men are as quick to laugh as they are to challenge you to a drinking match.  Your appearance in this fair city is cause for celebration; its not every day they receive visitors such as yourself! Look around you--no hunger, no illness, no crime--a community where your name is on everyone's lips. Speak with any citizen and you'll see, Osgurith is a little slice of paradise!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or is it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every paradise has its price...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City of the Lich is an expansion to [Ryubix Manor], yet suitable as a Stand-Alone Adventure for characters of all levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written in a system-neutral style, City of the Lich can be used with any Fantasy RPG system. Great attention has been given to creating a setting with internal consistency: its history, NPC personalities, and local flavor. As written, this is a fully realized location for players to interact, explore, potentially exploit, and eventually escape from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
