			<description>New Domains of Adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick up your sword and get ready for adventure as we take GURPS Dungeon Fantasy into totally different realms! This issue of Pyramid - the PDF magazine for roleplayers - offers up meaty new options for your Dungeon Fantasy (or just plain GURPS fantasy) games. Its supplement-length features include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Havens and Hells,&amp;quot; a full campaign setting from Dungeon Fantasy architect Sean Punch. Imagine a world where dying in battle is only a setback, where gold isn't the root of all adventure, and where the Gods themselves have a secret that could disrupt the very foundation of reality. Explore the depths of Hell as you bring back supplies and gear for the idyllic Havens that dot the world. This feature offers details on GURPS traits that are most useful, advice on which magic is likely or impossible (regardless of which GURPS magic system you use), and more!&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;The Titan's House,&amp;quot; this month's Eidetic Memory offering from GURPS Banestorm: Abydos author David L. Pulver. Take on the massive abode of a titan - who may or may not still be alive and in attendance - and turn the notion of scale on its ear, in an adventure suitable for any Dungeon Fantasy campaign. It supplies stats for seven new Dungeon Fantasy monsters plus maps of the gargantuan two-story home and its dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Eastern Adventures,&amp;quot; a guide to new realms of adventure from frequent Pyramid contributor Christopher R. Rice in the vein of the martial artist from GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 1: Adventurers and the master of shadows from GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 12: Ninja. Learn how to make distinctly unique adventures that tap into the vein of the &amp;quot;Mysterious East,&amp;quot; with information on how to translate existing templates, plus a new samurai lens, new races, power-ups, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue also provides a Random Thought Table that puts a twist on the notion of dungeon-crawling, as well as another peek into the new Car Wars universe from Matt Riggsby that shows you five great places to get killed. Dungeon Fantasy is all about exploring the unknown, and that goes doubly for this issue of Pyramid!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Publisher's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
