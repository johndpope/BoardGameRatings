			<description>&amp;ldquo;Card Board&amp;rdquo; is a fun little pocket-sized game. Whatever surface you can find becomes the playing field, and the cards make up the board (tile-fashion) which is different every time. Each player has a hand of card to choose from in building the board. Strive for points, follow the safe routes, build traps for your opponents, and try to stay out of those traps yourself. Some cards allow you to revise the layout and turn traps into a chance to score. A game of 50 points can last about 20 minutes and will get most of the cards in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
