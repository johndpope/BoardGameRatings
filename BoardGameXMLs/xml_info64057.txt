							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beyond the Rift</name>
									
			<description>From the cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some have claimed that beyond the great Motarian rift there are other universes yet to be discovered. Universes with untapped resources waiting to be exploited by the galactic mega-corporations of the Alliance. The mega-corps are keenly aware that discovering the secret to rift travel could ensure their financial prosperity into perpetuity and they are willing to pay handsomely for it. Fortunately for them there are no shortages of Battlelords who are willing to risk it all and enter the rift.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These &amp;quot;rift runners&amp;quot; are paid obscene amounts of money by their corporate sponsors to enter the vortex and make scientific measurements of phenomenon. Not all of them return, but not all of them meet their demise either. The truth is there are other universes beyond the rift and the truth is they have already been discovered. Discovered by those who never return. Trapped on the other side. Trapped beyond the rift.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
