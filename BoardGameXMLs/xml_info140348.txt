His particular obsession was the collection of certain rare and bizarre antiquities, unearthed at great time and personal expense from long-forgotten buried cities where saner men feared to tread.&lt;br/&gt;It was on his final such expedition that Malazar reputedly uncovered a jewel of great value and magical power, the so-called Egg of Desire. In an area of remote hills, he constructed a high tower in which to house his prize &amp;ndash; a tower with neither windows nor doors.&lt;br/&gt;As the years drew on, Malazar began to disdain city life. He withdrew more and more to his strange, windowless tower, conducting his business by emissary. It is now more than a decade since there has been any word from either Malazar or his agents, and persistent rumour among the more knowledgeable circles of thieves and treasure- hunters has it that the mage is dead, and within the tower his jewel lies free for the taking - if only there were some way to get inside...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
