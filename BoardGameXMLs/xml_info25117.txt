The first player to the checkout with one of each item still in their trolley is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple roll-die-and-move game with the added element of items to collect, and the added frustration of sometimes loosing them again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Box Tagline: &amp;quot;Be the first to fill your trolley as you move round the supermarket in this exciting race game&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
