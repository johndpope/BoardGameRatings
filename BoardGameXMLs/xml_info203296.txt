			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A King Defends His People&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ade Mujambe Lisimba, King of Ophar, is his people's protector, and the country's greatest treasure, the Gold Lion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His birthright stolen by interlopers, Ade fought to get it back, don the orichalchum armor and weapons, and defeat the Silverback who killed his father.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A powerful voice in world politics, Ade has slowly opened the borders of his kingdom in order to help improve the collective world of technology.

Because sometimes you a need a character everyone knows, even if they're meeting them for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
