			<description>This is a Swedish card game for two or more players from the 1930's about cross Atlantic flights.&lt;br/&gt;There are four suits each showing an airplane of one nation (Sweden, USA, Germany and Italy) numbered 1-10. The Swedish 8, 9 and 10 show the cities London, Paris and Stockholm. There is also a Catastrophe card.&lt;br/&gt;The The eldest player places chips in three pots representing the three cities and starts the game by playing any card in front of himself. The player who has the next consecutive card plays it and so on. A series can be broken by the Catastrophe card, the player of which starts a new  series as does a player who reaches a 10. Whoever plays one of the city cards takes the corresponding chips unless the catastrophe card has been played in which case the player who first gets rid of all his cards receive one chip from each other player for every card remaining in his hand. The pots remain and added to for the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
