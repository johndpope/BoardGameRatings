			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes rules supplements read like the world-setting bible of frustrated novelists. While solid world- building is a useful skill, you don&amp;rsquo;t always need four paragraphs of flavor text to tell you swords are cool, magic is power, shadows are scary, and orcs are savage. Sometimes a GM doesn&amp;rsquo;t have time to slog through a page of history for every magic weapon. Sometimes all that&amp;rsquo;s needed are a few cool ideas, with just enough information to use them in a game. Sometimes, all you need are bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1 With A Bullet Point is a line of very short, cheap PDFs each of which gives the bare bones of a set of related options. It may be five spells, six feats, eight magic weapon special abilities, or any other short set of related rules we can cram into about a page. Short and simple, these PDFs are for GMs and players who know how to integrate new ideas into their campaigns without any hand-holding, and just need fresh ideas and the rules to support them. No in-character fiction setting the game world. No charts and tables. No sidebars of explanations and optional rules. Just one sentence of explanation for the High Concept of the PDF, then bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The High Concept: Seven feats that allow spellcasters using the classic and venerable shield spell to have as many options as characters who use material shields. This is the latest in a series of products to celebrate the &amp;quot;Summer of Bullets&amp;quot; event!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The feats included are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Covering Shield: You can extend your shield to protect an ally.&lt;br/&gt;    Elemental Shield: You can attune your shield spell to deflect elemental damage.&lt;br/&gt;    Force Shielding: You can layer the force effect of a shield spell onto an ally&amp;rsquo;s shield.&lt;br/&gt;    Reactive Shield: Your shield spell moves itself to block the efforts of foes to put you at a disadvantage.&lt;br/&gt;    Shield Spell Bash: You can hit things with your shield spell.&lt;br/&gt;    Shield Properties: You can add the magic properties of magic shields to your shield spell.&lt;br/&gt;    Tower Shield Spell: You can make your shield spell much larger, at the cost of additional hindrance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
