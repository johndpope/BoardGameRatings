			<description>A Card/Dice Game for us IT Nerds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bug Industries is a game with cards and dice. Each player has an IT project assigned, in which a bunch of little, nasty bugs are hidden. 64 of these ulcer causing monsters must be eliminated for the project to run smoothly. The first bug-free player wins the game. You're not a developer, but are a part of the IT world? Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, Bug Industries has enough bugs and fun for you as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game rules: On the game board &amp;ndash; the headquarters of Bug Industries &amp;ndash; you move your game chip up or down &amp;ndash; depending on whether you can deduct or receive more bugs. You roll two dice: a numbered dice called &amp;ldquo;bug dice&amp;rdquo; and an &amp;ldquo;action dice.&amp;rdquo; The result of the bug dice can be directly deducted from your total bug count. The action dice gives you different options: pause, roll the dice again, draw a bugs card or draw a code card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two kinds of bug cards: The good ones reduce your total bug count and the bad ones increase it. With the second type of cards (code cards) you can influence the whole game. While you have to play the bug cards immediately, you can keep the code cards for yourself without showing them to the other players and then play them when the time is right. Knowing when to drop the code cards on the other players is a key part of the strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
