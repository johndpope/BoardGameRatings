			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A game for three players. Two players are contenders for the Privy Council, and the third is the King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A contender wins a round by gaining five points during the round. A contender is appointed to the Privy Council by winning two rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This simple game has the unusual option of playing &amp;quot;an existing Tunnels &amp; Trolls character&amp;quot; instead of making a new character for the game.  This is a peculiar option as the &amp;quot;T&amp;amp;T&amp;quot; character build has no influence on this game - but does allow benefits (and penalties) to flow back to the character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
