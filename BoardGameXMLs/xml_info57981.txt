							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Challenge of Druid&#039;s Grove</name>
									
			<description>1 on 1 - Challenge of Druid's Grove&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the package:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside are two books for two players. One of you becomes Ar-Kane, a great Wizard. The other is his rival, Renwood, a powerful Druid. The two of you have been sent by your elders to try and gain the wonders, the wealth, and the magical objects that lie hidden in the deadly Lath's Grove!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You enter the terrifying wood without a map to guide you, knowing that evil creatures are waiting to stop you at every turn. As you select your magical spells from your spellbook, you hope you have chosen wisely, for you know your enemies will be powerful. (Your opponent takes the part of all monsters and enemies you fight, just as you take the part of any enemies he faces!) An easy, diceless combat system simulates battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is an exciting game of adventure and magic as you and your rival race to be the first to win through to the center of the Grove. Everything you need to play is provided: two books, magic spells, Combat Table, Character Sheets. No dice required. All you provide is one friend and two pencils!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAY ANYTIME! ANYWHERE! PLAY MANY TIMES! THE GAME IS ALWAYS DIFFERENT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck in your CHALLENGE OF DRUID'S GROVE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
