							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire: Strategic Decision Series</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is another of our historical games of skill - no dice are used.&lt;br/&gt; It covers the period from Julius Caesar through 476 AD, the date most often given for the fall of the Western Empire. That's 536 years, which is a LOT of history! Our system uses 10 year turns for a total of 54 turns. During these turns, the Romans (and Parthians/Sassanids) will create their empire, try to maintain it, and then finally defend it against many incursions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game covers not just the Roman Empire, but the Parthian/Sassanid (Persian) Empire as well, and even one you've probably not heard of: the Kushan Empire. The map covers from Ireland (Hibernia) to India and from Tingis (Morocco) to the lands of the Huns (Kazakhstan) on the 37&amp;quot; by 18.5&amp;quot; vinyl-covered map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units are included for all the peoples of Europe and Asia that were involved in the conflicts: the Celts (over 30 tribes), the Germans (tribes, migratory tribes, and Germanic Kingdoms), and over 35 other native peoples. Not only are the Huns included, but the less well-known Hunae (Hephthalites) that moved against the Sassanid Empire are as well. Two complete Roman armies are included on the four 88-counter sheets: the legions and the reformed Roman Army of the later Empire. There's even a counter for the &amp;quot;Walls of Constantinople&amp;quot; and counters for the numerous Civil Wars that Rome had. Leadership was important, and the best of the Roman Emperors are included, as well as the best of the Parthian and Sassanid &amp;quot;King of Kings.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt; Production is key to success, and the primary economic centers of Europe, Africa, and Asia are shown on the map. Gaining control of these is key to replacing your losses. The Parthians even get a boost for the profits from the Silk Road.&lt;br/&gt; Game Rules will be posted on-line and you can take a look at them before buying!&lt;br/&gt; &amp;quot;Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori.&amp;quot; -Horace&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
