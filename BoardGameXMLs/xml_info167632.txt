			<description>from the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the GagMen&amp;rsquo;s latest adventure, &amp;ldquo;Pigetto&amp;rsquo;s world of pure Transfiguration!&amp;rdquo; This module, like many before it, was created live on the GagMen RPG Podcast, episode 20. We encourage you to go back and give it a listen, and our process may give you some insights (or a headache)! It was designed with Basic Fantasy RPG rules in mind, but you should find the story and the few creatures and stats available easily convertible into just about any system (though we&amp;rsquo;re still getting to know the newest D&amp;amp;D rules!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Summary&lt;br/&gt;The heroes are summoned to a toy factory on the far side of Brattleburg to discover why the workers have disappeared, as they search the abandoned factory, they will discover two forces locked in an epic battle for dominance. In the midst of battle, the heroes must save a trapped toymaker, and fix a broken family! Can the heroes fight their way through enchanted portals, a toy army and family issues with only toy weapons? Or will Playtime end with the ultimate time out?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
