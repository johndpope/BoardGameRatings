							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Throwdown at the North Pole (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops are closed, Santa off on his journey. But there&amp;rsquo;s no rest for the elves.&lt;br/&gt;Santa&amp;rsquo;s mortal enemies, the abominable snowmen, attack each year as soon as the big man is gone. With hearts as cold as ice, they tear apart the gingerbread houses and toss theelves around, hoping to cause enough pain and destruction to ruin Christmas the following year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the North Pole is not defenseless. One person rallies the elves each year. One person trains with them in combat techniques and tactics. One person personally leads them in battle for one night each year to insure her husband can deliver toys to children next Christmas. That&amp;rsquo;s right; the leader of the elves is none other than Mrs. Claus, one of the most formidable holiday warriors on the planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This great module, originally written by Clint Black, has been expertly converted to Pathfinder by Richard Moore and features a great new map from Fabled Enviroments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
