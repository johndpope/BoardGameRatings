			<description>Monsters &amp;amp; Knights is a casually competitive fantasy themed table top card game for 2-6 players. &lt;br/&gt;Players compete to slay the most monsters or eat the most knights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To summarize the game play: There are two ways to play monsters and knights, casual mode, and advanced mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the casual mode of monsters and knights, each round players will play all the cards in their hand, using monsters/knights to eat/slay other monsters and knights already in play. At the end of the round they will add up the points for their slayed monsters, or eaten knights and continue to play rounds until one player or team reaches a set number of points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advanced mode of monsters and knights adds additional game play mechanics enhancing the level of strategy for players looking for a more complex game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
