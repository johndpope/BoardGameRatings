			<description>&amp;quot;Card game for 2+ players. Theme: Migrations/Conquests of Asiatic Nomads. Victory: The first player to accumulate 12 Loot Points is the winner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players all start off as Nomads. The player who wins the card contest in the Invasion Phase becomes the Khan. Only the Khan can score Loot points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In subsequent Invasion Phases, Nomad players attempt to play cards to weaken the Khan's rule. If they are successful, the Khan will become a Nomad again and on the next turn all of the players will have a chance to become the Khan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
