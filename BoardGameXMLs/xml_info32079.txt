			<description>(Summit)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introductory text of the game book (in many languages):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cooperative behavior and mutual assistance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of ramblers is preparing for a mountain-climbing expedition to the summit. In the mountains each is dependant on the help of the others. No one person alone should attempt such a climb. A mountain stream may only be crossed with the help of a second player. On a steep rock-face it is even more difficult. The group members have to rope themselves together, so mutual assistance is also necessary. Shortly before the summit, they are threatened by a belt of rain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
