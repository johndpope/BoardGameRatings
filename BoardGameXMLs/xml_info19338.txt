			<description>From the box and rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you play MIND YOUR LANGUAGE you will speak Swedish, eat spaghetti and see the Eiffel Tower, all from the comfort of your own living room!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who can answer the questions you need to ask?  Using the amazing Spear-o-phone pronunciation system, you can ask for paella in Spanish and moussaka in Greek!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Try and keep track of the answers in this tongue-tied tour of Europe, but watch out - there are tourists about who might give you an answer that you don't expect!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a game that breaks the language barriers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will find the questions that you need to ask in your personalized Travel Warrant.  Can you find out who has the card with the right answer on it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MIND YOUR LANGUAGE is a game about visiting different countries, in other words speaking the language, trying the food and seeing the sights.  You do this by asking the other players questions from your travel wallets, trying to find the right answers - and then remembering which player holds the answers to which country!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
