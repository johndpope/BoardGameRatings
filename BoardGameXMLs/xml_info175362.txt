							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Modern Africa: Rules for modern skirmish battles on the dark continent</name>
									
			<description>Modern Africa is a set of rules to fight/refight battles on the dark continent in the 1960&amp;acute;s through the 1990&amp;acute;s. The majority of these battles were smaller scale fought between warlords or other dictators. The arms were either leftovers from an earlier era, state-sponsor (US or USSR) supplied, or black market purchased. These are not the latest, greatest weaponry and they may not even be welded by trained soldiers, but the goal was always freedom.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with 15mm miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
