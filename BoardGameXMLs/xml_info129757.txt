			<description>From Wikipedia: Lexi-Cross is a 1991 DOS computer game by Interplay Productions. Its premise is a futuristic TV game show, featuring elements similar to Wheel of Fortune, Scrabble, and Battleship. Players can choose to play as human or alien, and computer opponents are robots. Each player has a grid of hidden tiles concealing various hidden words. Players take turns revealing tiles in an attempt to find either letter tiles or bonuses, similarly to Battleship. Players may alternatively spin a wheel to guess a letter as in Wheel of Fortune. The words eventually comprise a theme or quotation, which the player must guess to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Lexi-Cross,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
