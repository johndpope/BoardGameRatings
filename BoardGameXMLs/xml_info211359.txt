							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Archclericy of Veluna</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Veluna is situated in the center of the western lands of the Flanaess. The Velverdyva River marks our northern border with Furyondy. Veluna stretches west to the Fals Gap and east to the Iron Woods. The northern edges of the Lortmil Mountains mark our southern border and protect us from harsher weather seen in the land to the south. Veluna enjoys warm summers and mild winters with a long growing season, making farms common across the central and northern lands. There are only a few stands of forests left inside the boundaries of Veluna. The Asnath Copse is of Veluna and is home to the elven city of the same name. The Iron Woods marks the border between Veluna and Verbobonc, though where the border is in the woods depends on what patrol you run into while in the woods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document served as a concise introduction to the Archclericy of Veluna for players involved in Living Greyhawk convention/tournament play. It includes character design restrictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
