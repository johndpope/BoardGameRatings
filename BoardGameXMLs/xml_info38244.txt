			<description>&amp;quot;Each player controls a Covenant of Wizards. Players try to build up the prestige of their Covenant by Accumulating Victory Points.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played using a custom deck of cards. There are seven types of cards in the deck: Wizards, Spells, Followers, Quests, Events, Items, and Duel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players earn Victory Points for controlling Wizards and Resources. Victory Points are also awarded for completing Quests. The first player to reach 25 Victory Points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
