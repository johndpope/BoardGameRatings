			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fwends Game is as simple of a card game as it gets which makes it great for all ages to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are dealt 7 cards. The first card is flipped over from the top of the deck. Each card has at least one Fwend on it. If the colored dots in the corner match the Fwend card in your hand, you can play it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three types of action cards: Toss 2 (throw away 2 Fwends), Take 2 (the player who plays this card must draw 2 Fwend cards), and Give 2 (give any two Fwend cards to another player).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes turns putting their Fwend cards down. The last person with Fwends in their hand loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
