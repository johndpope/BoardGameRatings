			<description>Rise Again: Honest Brawls Between Folk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Firefly-themed card based fighting game somewhat based on Kung Fu Fighting.&lt;br/&gt;From the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You can&amp;rsquo;t take the sky from me: In RISE AGAIN, 2 to 6 players fight each other Firefly &amp;lsquo;Verse style, trying to beat the gos se (which we politely call &amp;ldquo;GUTS&amp;rdquo;) out of one another with various forms of brawlin&amp;rsquo;. Players can attack each other with Attack cards or by using a Weapon card they have in play. Players can make their attacks even more hi-larious by playing Attack Enhancement cards and by having a Stereotype card in play. Defenders use Block cards to avoid or cancel attacks, and can even play Guts Restoration cards to restore lost Guts.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
