			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Waddington's Cricket Game with batting and bowling. An activity game of real skill and excitement.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can either bat or bowl. Although only two players can participate others can act as onlookers or wait their turn to bat and bowl in teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waddington's Cricket Game recreates a cricket pitch on your table or floor. There is a plastic ramp for the bowler to use to deliver small ball-bearings. Another plastic mechanism holds a bat in tension with an elastic band. The batsman releases a trigger to strike at the ball. Scoring depends on how far the ball ends up from the nearest fielder. Fielders are press out cardboard figures that fold into a 3D shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
