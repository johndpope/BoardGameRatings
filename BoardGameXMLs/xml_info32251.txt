							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Red Square</name>
									
			<description>Red Square is a very rare Monopoly-style board game with a Soviet theme that was marketed in 1990 (with a copyright of 1988).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike Monopoly, Red Square players compete for privileges -- not properties -- to move up the Soviet social ladder through their status in the Soviet Military and Communist Party. Players acquire wealth by buying and selling on the black market and correctly answering trivia questions about Soviet society and other Russian curiosities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first person to weave their way through the three social classes and make it to Red Square. Players exchange their privileges to move to the next social level -- a concept that is known as nomenklatura in Russian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
