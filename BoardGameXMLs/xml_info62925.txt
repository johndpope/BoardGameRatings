			<description>This is a Turkish roll-and-move family board game. The objective appears to be to earn money from answering funny riddles. The board has a track around the edge which players move around with opportunities to earn money or answer riddles. There is an inner track with 24 spaces with riddles on them - there are 24 corresponding key cards which have the answers to the riddles on them. There's also a deck of 'sikirdak' cards, which seem to be like chance cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
