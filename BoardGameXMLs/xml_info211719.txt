			<description>To Honor the Dragon&lt;br/&gt;Some soldiers fight for money, some to spread their version of liberty, still others for a sense of adventure. For the men and women of the Draconis Combine Mustered Soldiery there is only one reason for service: the honor of the Dragon.&lt;br/&gt;From the moment Shiro Kurita raised the Dragon&amp;rsquo;s banner, the soldiers of House Kurita have remained dedicated to the warrior&amp;rsquo;s path above all others. For seven centuries they have spread fear and respect in equal measure, expanding and protecting the Dragon with loyalty and honor tempered by the ancient code of bushido and forged in battles on a hundred worlds.&lt;br/&gt;BattleTech Combat Manual: Kurita contains information on these warriors. This manual examines the combat commands of the Draconis Combine, detailing their histories, tactics, unit crests, paint schemes, and notable personnel. This Alpha Strike expansion includes special rules for unique character abilities, faction-specific rules, force-building, and a mini-Technical Readout&amp;mdash;everything you need to field your favorite Draconis Combine unit on the tabletop, or create your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
