			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do your dreams hold? What nightmares lurk in the growing darkness? What strange and twisted realms exist just beyond your sight? What brooding sorcerers commit unspeakable acts, hidden in dank cells beneath the cracked and steaming streets? What unseen beings dwell all around you, real but untouchable?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find out when you play Mortal Coil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mortal Coil is a supernatural role-playing game. It begins when all of the players create a unique world of fantasy together, with magic powerful or subtle depending on the group's desires. You create characters to explore this world, their magic and passion shaping the stories which spring forth from your mind. You decide if you tell a tale of dark supernatural horror, of wise fools and giants, of the secret wars between sorcerous cabals, or of inhuman politics among beings that can never die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Changes from the original edition per the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I adjusted the conflict rules slightly so that they now conform with how I have been actually running the game. These tweaks are minimal. I also made the examples much better, and clarified a few things that caused a lot of confusion in the first rule set. I also added two new chapters with tips for players and tips for GMs. There is an appendix with seven extended conflict examples from start to finish, from a simple two-person conflict to a six-player free-for-all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
