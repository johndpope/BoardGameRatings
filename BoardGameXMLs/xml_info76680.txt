			<description>&amp;quot;One or two players control chickens  who can be made to run across a ten lane highway filled with traffic in an effort to &amp;quot;get to the other side.&amp;quot; Every time a chicken gets across a point is earned for that player. If hit by a car, a chicken is forced back either slightly, or in some modes, pushed back to the bottom of the screen. The winner of a two player game is the player who has scored the most points in the two minutes, sixteen seconds allotted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chickens are only allowed to move up or down. The chicken sprite has limited animation and a cluck sound is heard when a chicken is struck by a car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comparisons are often made to Frogger, which has different gameplay but also features crossing a street filled with moving vehicles. Both games were developed independently at the same time. Similarities did help sales when Frogger was popular in the arcades and a home version was not yet available.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeway_%28video_game%29,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeway_%28video_game%29,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the [ &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/&lt;/a&gt;  CC-BY-SA License].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
