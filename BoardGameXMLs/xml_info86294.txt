							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spanky&#039;s Quest</name>
									
			<description>Spanky's Quest is a game, published in 1991 by Natsume, for the Super Nintendo. The main character is a monkey named Spanky who attacks by throwing different kinds of balls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with a cutscene where a witch traps Spanky. Spanky attacks by throwing a small purple bubble. He can then bounce the bubble on his head. Every time he bounces the bubble, the bubble grows and changes color. The bubble can then be popped, depending upon the bubble's size and color, different types of sports balls will fly out of the bubble destroying enemies touched by the balls. For example, a purple bubble will release a baseball and the largest orange bubble will release several basketballs. If an enemy is touched by a bubble, he will simply be stunned and unable to move for a moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enemies in the game are generally different types of fruits, with the notable exception of the witch. The soundtrack is characterized by an upbeat jazz-like style of music with creative bass patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Spanky's Quest&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
