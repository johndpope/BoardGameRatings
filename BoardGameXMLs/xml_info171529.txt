							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brandywine</name>
									
			<description>This is a low complexity game of the Battle of Brandywine using the Two Buck games AWI rules but with a little more complexity added. Leaders are featured in this game and the map is twice as large as a normal Two Buck Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set up is quick and plays in under an hour and as a wonderful teaching tool for young gamers but has enough what if options to have a lot of replay value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
