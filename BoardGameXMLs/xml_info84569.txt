			<description>NFL Quarterback Club '99 released in November 1998, for Nintendo 64, is one of the first sports games to work with the Expansion Pak. The game featured all the NFL teams, replay past Super Bowls  and history on the past Super Bowls. NFL Quarterback Club '99 delivers all 31 teams and 3D rendered stadiums. More than 1,500 players are here with over 250 motion-capture animations. Players, along with teams, uniforms, coaches, and playbooks, can also be created. Play-by-play is handled by Randy Cross and Mike Patrick while the artificial intelligence was developed by Charlie Weis, former NFL coach and former head coach of Notre Dame's Fighting Irish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other than that, the graphics are high resolution, with the optional expansion pak and rumble pak. The expansion pak only makes replays longer and slightly improves overall performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;NFL Quarterback Club '99&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
