							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brothers By Blood</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the bay city of Zoa, two deadly thieves' guilds war over territory, striking against each other with threats, competition and swift, brutal acts of violence. You are one such thief &amp;ndash; a young member of the Shadowed Fist guild, and enemy of the Black Blades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately, although you are still a mere cutpurse working your way up the ranks, your brother holds a position of leadership within the Fist, and it is at least partly due to him that you have survived and prospered as well as you have. Suddenly, after completing a routine assignment, you find your brother struck down without warning by an assassin's poisoned blade! As he lies near death, you must seek out the antidote to the poison, restore your brother to health, and revenge yourself upon his attackers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, your brother's survival and the survival of everyone involved, as well as the conclusion of the adventure, rests upon your shoulders! Fortunately, if you take the wrong path, you can always play again. Even after you complete a game, feel free to try again because this book has more than one ending! Some endings are good, and some endings are bad. If you come to a bad end, simply play again from the beginning!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as many different paths for adventure, this book includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Basic and Advanced Rules! Along with the basic play rules, this adventure also includes optional advanced rules for more realistic fun!&lt;br/&gt;     Pregenerated or Custom Characters! Use the standard character in this book, or bring in your own Dungeons and Dragons rogue, or HackMaster thief!&lt;br/&gt;     Dice Tables! Don't have polyhedral dice with you? No problem! SoloQuest works with or without dice, thanks to the special dice tables!&lt;br/&gt;     Quick Reference Tables! Need to look up an advanced or basic rule quickly? Simply turn to the easy-to-use tables and find the answer in seconds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although you need no prior experience with the official Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons campaign setting, the Kingdoms of Kalamar, to enjoy this book, it utilizes this official campaign setting as a base for descriptive text and cultural details. In this realistic, dynamic setting, complex political alliances mix with marauding bands of humanoids, and medieval technology and culture come face to face with magic and the fantastic. Whatever type of adventure you seek, you can find it here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information on the Kingdoms of Kalamar campaign setting can be found in the Kingdoms of Kalamar campaign setting sourcebook, the Kingdoms of Kalamar Player's Primer, or any of our other fine supplements and adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
