			<description>Ghe game is based on the adventure serial produced in the 1950s and 1960s by ABC Television.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outline of the game board is a map of Australia . Players select a casualty on a stretcher to place on a corner of the board. Each corner represents a type of casualty; accident (green), snake bite (blue), appendicitis (yellow) and kangaroo kick (red).&lt;br/&gt;- the accident casualty needs treatment ward A and can be discharged by a surgeon or doctor&lt;br/&gt;- the appendicitis patient needs the operating theatre and is discharged by a surgeon or doctor&lt;br/&gt;- the snake bite casualty needs ward B and is discharged by a Sister or nurse&lt;br/&gt;- the patient with the kangaroo kick needs the surgical ward and is discharged by a Sister or nurse.&lt;br/&gt;Spin a 3, 5 or 8 on the control spinner to bring the flying doctor for transfer to hospital. Subsequently, the casualties move by plane according to numbers spun. Along the way there are instructions eg. electric storm, miss a turn. After a circuit of the board, spin the exact number to land on your landing field. More than this and you must move your plane back by the excess number. Other challenges include: Gain access to hospital; reach the right treatment ward; use a hospital porter in the right place and at the right time; and finally get discharged by the right member of hospital staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 x playing board&lt;br/&gt;1 x hospital area with turntable (in the centre of the playing board)&lt;br/&gt;1 x spinner for controlling moves.&lt;br/&gt;4 x casualties on stretchers in four different colours&lt;br/&gt;4 x planes in four different colours with lugs on the upperside to attach the casualties on stretchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
