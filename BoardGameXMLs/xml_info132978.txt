							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Worth of a Slave</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first chapter of the Ashes of Athas campaign, the PCs are all members or affiliates of the Veiled Alliance (VA) in Tyr. A group known as The True has been working in secret against the Tyrian Veiled Alliance, and has finally secured the edge that they need &amp;ndash; inside information about the members, hideouts, and meeting places of the Alliance. A member of The True named Obadias is leading a brutal attack on the Veiled Alliance, attempting to eradicate their presence in Tyr.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the opening encounter, the adventurers are waiting for a meeting with two high-ranking leaders of the Veiled Alliance, Sartaj and Marama. The safe house where they are to meet is invaded by True soldiers. After dealing with the initial incursion and escaping the safe house, the adventurers learn that Sartaj, Marama, and many other Alliance members have been captured. At this point, they can either join in the fight against the numerous agents of The True, or avoid the devastation and flee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any adventurers that manage to escape can learn that at least of the captured Alliance members, including Sartaj, were sold to a slave caravan due to leave soon. The adventurers will need to find some way to get themselves into Avram&amp;rsquo;s slave caravan. This might include being captured, sneaking in, or even selling themselves into slavery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While they travel with Avram&amp;rsquo;s caravan, they have some opportunities to help their injured leader, and potentially make enemies and allies while planning their escape. Once Sartaj recovers, she offers to arrange a diversion, but she needs the assistance of the adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, the diversion arrives, in the form of an attack on the caravan by a group of giantkin. The adventurers who survive the initial onslaught gather up whatever materials and allies they can manage, and head across the unfriendly desert for sanctuary in the town of Altaruk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
