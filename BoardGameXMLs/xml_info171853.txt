							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Obsession for Murder</name>
									
			<description>You and the other players are patrons at a strange and bizarre open market. You are all are here to indulge in your obsessions, whether they be artifacts, guns, or art. Vendors display their wares of various shapes, sizes, and legality. You wander up and down the aisles, searching for that which strikes your fancy. Suddenly, you hear a scream, and see the body. Somebody has been murdered! There is a killer on the loose, and they will stop at nothing to get their hands on what they want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Obsession for Murder, players have secret identities that determine what types of Items that player wants to collect. One of these identities is The Murderer, who tries to eliminate the other players and be the only player left. The other players, while attempting to collect their chosen items, can also accuse each other of being The Murderer. If they are correct, they win. If they are wrong, the accused is lynched, and play continues until the Murderer wins or is correctly accused.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
