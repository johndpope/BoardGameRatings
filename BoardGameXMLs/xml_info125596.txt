			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;This once, a lack of military intelligence was a good thing&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place on the 19th and 20th of September 1943, during the Markham valley campaign aimed at seizing the important northern coastal town of Lae in Papua New Guinea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commando company was despatched to seize the villages of Kaiapit and renovate the airstrip while the Japanese command had despatched several battalions, primarily from the 78th regiment, to reinforce their small garrison and prepare the area as an advanced base. Fortunately for the commandos, the Japanese retreated after their vanguard&amp;rsquo;s dawn attack failed to scatter them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes the role of Captain Gordon King, commander of the 2/6 Independent Company, an Australian WW2 Commando Company of about 250 men plus various supporting attachments. The commandos Japanese opponents are governed by the system if a second player is not available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
