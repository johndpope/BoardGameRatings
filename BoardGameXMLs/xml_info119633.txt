			<description>The game consists of 31 tiles that will form the oval game board, 6 &amp;quot;memo&amp;quot; tiles with one color per side, 6 pawns and a die with six faces. When the game starts forming a path with 31 tiles oval course that will be different for each game. Tiles &amp;quot;memo&amp;quot;, which have color front / back, are placed in the center of the table so as to show the four possible colors. Each player picks a color pawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turn, the active player rolls the dice. If it's six, he misses a turn. If it's between 1 and 5, it has the choice between:&lt;br/&gt;1: re-roll, but if it's 6 or the same number, it passes.&lt;br/&gt;2: he moves his pawn to a number of dice equal to the tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The course ends with the tile &amp;quot;Peasant Confederation&amp;quot; and the first player to reach this tile is declared &amp;quot;Grand Winner&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
