							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Universal Adventures Adventure Module #3: Death Knell Delve, Part I</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Screams echo through the night. You hasten to a window and look out upon a horrific scene. In the flickering light of torches and the wan moonlight monstrous forms shamble, lurch and skitter through the streets attacking citizens and bursting into shops and homes. Many of the unarmed citizens run, some take up arms and turn to fight, too many die. What new evil has risen from the depths to plague the town of Ravenor? Are you brave enough to face the Death Knell Delve?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third in the Adventure Module series set in Ravenor, Death Knell Delve is the biggest, baddest Adventure Module released to date. In fact, this adventure is so large we&amp;rsquo;ve had to break it into two parts! This new Adventure Module is packed with all new material, including new monsters to menace the characters, new tricks and traps to test your players and, of course, new treasures! Death Knell Delve includes 18 Encounter cards, 18 Event cards, 18 Search cards, 18 Treasure cards, and 9 additional Shadow Hall cards. That&amp;rsquo;s twice as many Encounter, Event and Search cards than any Adventure Module before!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitable for use with any fantasy role playing game, and playable solo or with a group, with or without a GM, Death Knell Delve, Part I, brings you a fun and exciting adventure you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to play again and again. Death Knell Delve does require the use of Assault on the Underworld and Scourge of the Scurvlings. In addition, depending on how events unfold, or if you get creative, you can connect this adventure to DK1 Death Fog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death Knell Delve is a huge adventure and one you won&amp;rsquo;t want to miss. Gather your heroes, for glory and vengeance, and prepare to undertake the Death Knell Delve!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
