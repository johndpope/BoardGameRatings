			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn to fly without wings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introducing the 3-D Helicopter Simulator, a red hot combination of computerized flight training with realistic action! Find yourself strapped in the pilot's seat of an authentic helicopter. Feel the rush as you zoom in from of or behind 3-Dimensional skyscrapers, towers and mountains. Get a bird's eye view from the cockpit as you soar above sailing ships in the harbor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 3-D Helicopter Simulator is an exciting step forward in bringing the &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; feel of flight into your home or office! Take hold of the cyclic joystick and feel the smoothness of the operating controls as you bank into a 30 degree turn. Test its flexibility by dodging incoming missiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now experience head-to-head combat! Through optional modem support!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've seen head-to-head sports simulations and head-to-head simulations. But never before has a computer program permitted head-to-head flight simulation competition...until now! Warm up against a computer-controlled opponent, then prepare to fly in tandem with a real-life partner or engage an opponent in air-to-air warfare. Your 3-D helicopter can duel another 3-D helicopter from across the room or across the world through the hook-up of a modem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
