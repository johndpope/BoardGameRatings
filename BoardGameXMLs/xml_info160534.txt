			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beau-Jolly made their name in the music business by selling compilations. In the mid 1980s they were looking to do the same thing with video games. One of the companies they approached was Imagine. After their spectacular and public collapse, Beau-Jolly ended up owning Imagine's back-catalogue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Value Pack compilations released by Beau-Jolly contained mostly Imagine games (the Commodore versions also included two Livewire games each). Some games were duplicated across different platforms, but no two compilations were the same, though they shared the same artwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Commodore 64 version consisted of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcadia - A Gorf / Galaxians style shoot 'em up.&lt;br/&gt;Pedro - An arcade maze game where a Mexican gardener is fighting to protect his plants against various animals.&lt;br/&gt;Cosmic Cruiser - A shooter where you use a cannon to attack an alien spacecraft and save the crewmen released.&lt;br/&gt;B.C. Bill - An arcade game where the aim is for a caveman to use his club to hunt food, defend against predators and 'collect' wives!&lt;br/&gt;Invaders - A Space Invaders clone.&lt;br/&gt;3D Jumpin Jack - A Frogger clone presented in a pseudo-3D isometric perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
