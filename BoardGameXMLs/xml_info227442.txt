			<description>Materials&lt;br/&gt;8x8 checkerboard&lt;br/&gt;56 bi-color pieces&lt;br/&gt;A supply of plastic rings&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object&lt;br/&gt;The game ends with victory for the first player that makes a four in a row; consisting of friendly ringed or non-ringed pieces that are orthogonally or diagonally adjacent. Otherwise, the player last to move is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;Place the 56 pieces on the border spaces of the board stacked in an alternating pattern of black and white. There should be a stacked black sided piece and a white-sided piece per space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play&lt;br/&gt;One player plays black the other white, both share the plastic rings.&lt;br/&gt;Decide who goes first in any convenient manner, turns then alternate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can move a &amp;quot;naked&amp;quot; friendly piece in a straight orthogonal line, moving over no more than one piece and no further than the empty square behind that jumped piece. The moving piece must end up with at least one orthogonal or diagonal neighbor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optionally you may flip the piece just moved to your opponent&amp;rsquo;s color and place a plastic ring over the piece, making it permanent. Once this happens, any orthogonally or diagonally adjacent &amp;quot;naked&amp;quot; pieces are also flipped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Restrictions&lt;br/&gt;A player may not repeat the board position of the previous turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
