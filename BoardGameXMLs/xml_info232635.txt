			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and the other players are castaways on an uncharted island. A gang of motley monkeys has stripped all your shipwrecks of vital parts. The goal of the game is simple: collect the plunder and monkeys that you&amp;rsquo;ll need to repair your ship and sail home. In order to get those items, you&amp;rsquo;ll need you&amp;rsquo;ll need to outbid and outsmart the other castaways in auctions run by Captain Coconuts, the wily monkey leader who controls the island &amp;mdash; and your fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shipwrecked is a classic auction game with a twist: Instead of bidding with your bananas, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a hand of six tokens that you&amp;rsquo;ll use to make your bid in a series of secret auctions. Each token interacts with those placed by the other players - but no one knows who has played what until the bids are revealed. Once a round of the auction round is won, the other players can spend their bananas (cash) in order to push the auction to the next level. If they do, more plunder and monkey cards are added, and the auction continues!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During every round, the cost of winning increases by one banana, as does the cost of pushing the auction forward. Your bid tokens all have unique effects, but once they&amp;rsquo;ve been played in an auction they stay on the board. That means you&amp;rsquo;ll want to save your most powerful bid tokens for the moment when they count the most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to learn, but the more you play, the more you&amp;rsquo;ll discover the layers of depth and strategy in the bid and push gameplay. The order that you use your tokens not only determines the outcome of the current auction round but your ability to effectively bid in upcoming rounds as well. Winning auctions will give you the plunder and monkeys you need to win, but you&amp;rsquo;ll be tempted to trade in your hard-won booty for short term gain: plunder cards can be traded in for extra bananas, while the monkey cards have special powers that can shift the outcome of the auctions &amp;mdash; and the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
