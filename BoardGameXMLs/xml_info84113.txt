							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dead Fire (Revised)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dead Fire is a challenging adventure for characters levels 1-3 with a total average party level of no more than 12 and serves as an excellent introduction to the 3rd edition rules. The party should consist of 4-6 characters and it would be a good idea, but not absolutely necessary to include a wizard and a ranger in the group. Most of the adventure takes place in the wilderness surrounding the small village of Foresthall, where an unnatural forest fire grows larger by the minute. The blaze threatens the survival of both Foresthall and Valmirindi, a nearby elven community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep in mind that this adventure is written mainly for first or second level characters, but it is designed to be a challenge. It is very likely that a party of four or five 1st level adventurers will advance in level over the course of the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
