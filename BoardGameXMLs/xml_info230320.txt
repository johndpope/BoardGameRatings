							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Curse of Fire Mountain</name>
									
			<description>A Living Jungle Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many, many generations ago a group of Korobokuru who lived on the Rayanna savanna were driven from their homeland by a series of firestorms.  There were five in one season, thus was born the legend of the Season of Five Fires.  The korobokuru tribe, called the Morta, took the fires as a call from the god of fire mountain.  So the tribe journeyed to the top of fire mountain to see the great god, not just the leaders, as is tradition, but the entire tribe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
