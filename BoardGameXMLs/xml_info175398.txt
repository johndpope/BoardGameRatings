			<description>This game is based on a German TV game show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in 2 teams.&lt;br/&gt;On teams turn one member is chosen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He looks on a card what he has to draw. His team members try to name the Thing as fast as possible. If this is right the drawer takes the next card and starts drawing this.&lt;br/&gt;This continues till the time has gone (hourglass finished).&lt;br/&gt;Each card gives 1 Point and the other team, makes the same with new cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after each Player was the drawer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
