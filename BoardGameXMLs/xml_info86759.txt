							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bible Caravan New Testament</name>
									
			<description>Bible Caravan is a travel game that takes players on an imaginary trip through the Holy Land for the purpose of learning the location and significance of 30 places described in the Bible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a map board of the Holy Land depicting a caravan route.  Players then select text filled tiles that match their caravan route cities, and play the tiles upon their board, matching the city tiles with Bible verses printed on the right side of the map board. Scoring is determined by locations filled and correct verse identifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
