			<description>From Wikipedia: Nine Princes in Amber is an interactive fiction computer game with graphics. The game was published by Telarium (formerly known as Trillium), a subsidiary of Spinnaker Software, in the year 1985. The game is based upon the fantasy novels Nine Princes in Amber and The Guns of Avalon by Roger Zelazny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The single-player adventure is controlled via typed keyboard commands. Words and sentences are entered in a text parser. The player uses action commands (e.g. take, sit) and communication commands (e.g. ask, demand, hug) for the interaction with non-player characters. There are 40 different possible solutions to end the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plot takes place in a fictional fantasy world. The player prince Corwin is the son of king Oberon, who rules the kingdom Amber. Corwin wants to become king but but his eight brothers, especially his brother Eric, are also interested in the reign of Amber. Prince Corwin must escape assassination attempts and intrigues. He has to confederate with some of his siblings to be king of Amber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure has static 2d graphics, a theme song and sound effects. It was developed by a group of 20 people at Spinnaker Software and published by Telarium (1985).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Nine Princes in Amber (video game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
