							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Marketplace Race</name>
									
			<description>The Marketplace Race is a promotional game designed to sell the virtues of Digital Equipment Corporation's new (at the time) J-11 microprocessor, introduced in 1983.  While the purpose of the game is marketing, it is theoretically a playable game.  It's a basic spin-and-move game, with the spinner built into the board, but with interrupts along the path which all speed the player with the J-11 along while slowing down the player with the &amp;quot;Brand X&amp;quot; chip.  The first player to the Market Place wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
