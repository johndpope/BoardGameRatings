			<description>Deep in the center of an island lies the Yoshiwara pleasure district. &lt;br/&gt;Never does its beauty, nor bustling activity, wane in the slightest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No men are born on this island.&lt;br/&gt;Therefore it is a custom that when women born on the island reach the appropriate age,&lt;br/&gt;they pay a visit to Yoshiwara.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The daughter of a prosperous merchant, you are no except to this tradition.&lt;br/&gt;Guided by your bodyguard Musashi Takenouchi,&lt;br/&gt;you enter Yoshiwara to fulfill your duty as a woman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tonight is the first visit.&lt;br/&gt;Invited to a luxurious feast, men of unworldly beauty are lined up before you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From among these men, you will choose one,&lt;br/&gt;and for a single evening become a false married couple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your heart flutters at the thought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seamless, perfect conduct and eyes that enchant everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So these are the charms of men of the pleasure district...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full of doubt and wonder,&lt;br/&gt;which courtesan will you have chosen by the end of a seemingly endless night?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
