							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Assassin X</name>
									
			<description>Nobody knows who or when, but one player is going to be the killer! Discretion and assassination attempt on one side, and vigileance stalking each other. Suspense guaranteed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assassin X is based on a user specific trading card (55 originals cards) through which you build your game and influence your opponents. It is a game of strategy and psychology in which deception and bluff you will need to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is the first player to have 5 pts.  You gains points if &lt;br/&gt;1) Successful murder = 2 points&lt;br/&gt;2) Countering murder = 1 point&lt;br/&gt;3) Discover an assassin = 1 point&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives 5 cards that they keep secret.&lt;br/&gt;The rest is the deck face down. A sense of play is defined for a turn. It will be inverted at each new turn.&lt;br/&gt;Each round takes place in two stages:&lt;br/&gt;- A phase of trading between 2 players.&lt;br/&gt;- A phase of action for any player&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you receive the card or draw Assassin&lt;br/&gt;you become a murderer. Unless you try to get rid of it, you should prepare your murder by collecting maximum points with maps of Crime Guns, Approaches,and Masters. However, be careful not to be detect because it may well be another player sends you the Police and there, it would be over.&lt;br/&gt;Assassinate when you're ready!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
