			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Lost Souls adventure is designed for a group of spirits and one female medium, whose last name is Torres. The medium is the central character, around whom the story is based. The referee may make the medium an NPC, though this will reduce the player&amp;rsquo;s personal involvement in the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The medium PC is bewildered and disorientated. She can remember nothing about her trip to Limbo or anything about her life except her name, her supernatural powers, and the fact that she if she stays here any longer, she&amp;rsquo;ll be late to meet someone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The medium assumes she used her Astral Projection power to escape her body, but whenever she tries to return to her flesh, an icy coldness blocks her. She must find her body and remove whatever is blocking her, or else remain a lost soul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before returning to earth, the PCs must make ghostly vows. The obvious choice is: &amp;ldquo;I will not return until the medium rejoins her body.&amp;rdquo; After the vows are taken, a tunnel of light forms to whisk the PCs back to earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
