			<description>Rambo is based on the film Rambo: First Blood Part II. It was produced by Platinum Productions and published by Ocean Software for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and Commodore 64.  The Commodore 64 version's music is by Martin Galway, incorporating melodies from the film's score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is viewed from a semi-top down perspective, and follows the movies story. You, controlling Rambo, have to find your lost equipment, locate the POW camp, rescue the hostages and make it back to the extraction point, all while being pursued by constantly respawning enemies. You start off with just your Bowie knife and grenades (both of which have an unlimited supply, as with all the weapons), and gain points for killing the enemy, and for collecting Rambo's following equipment: Rocket Launcher, M16 Rifle, and your Bow &amp;amp; Arrows (Explosive &amp;amp; Non Explosive)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was one of the first to feature controllable vehicles (a helicopter), and also one of the first to feature stealth elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum versions of the game was included on the 1986 compilation They Sold a Million 3,[9][10] along with Fighter Pilot, Ghostbusters, and Kung-Fu Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As of 2008, there is a remake available for the PC, with enhanced graphics, sound and music taken from the films theatrical score. Gameplay remains unchanged. Another difference is, that the enemies are more plentiful than the original.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Rambo (1985 video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.ocean&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
