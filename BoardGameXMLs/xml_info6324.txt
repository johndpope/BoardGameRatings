							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horror Hunter</name>
									
			<description>Players play the role of horror hunters, attempting to defeat monsters both magical (like vampires) and mundane (like psycho killers). The game has a light-hearted feel, with (unlicensed) use of many horror characters such as Jason, Freddy, and the girl from &amp;quot;The Exorcist.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are rated with attack strength and spiritual strength values. Monsters have strength ratings, terror points, and value ratings for when they're defeated. Events can lower your spiritual strength, and various insanities can afflict your character. Visits to a psychologist can restore your spiritual strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
