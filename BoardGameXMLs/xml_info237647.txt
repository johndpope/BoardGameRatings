			<description>Order comes out of Chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or Khaos since It sounds more Metal with a pretentious K, plus it has some old time mythology behind the name. Look it up, it&amp;rsquo;s some interesting stuff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the Khaos it taken up keeping the world spinning and not dissolving into grey ooze, it already shaped into order and luckily we can&amp;rsquo;t touch it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But we used to be able to work with the residuals. Rituals, abracadabra, mandalas, and all those other things. They used to work, not like some fantasy novel wizard, just make it more likely the tribes hunters will return with meat from the hunt, and not die while doing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And every one could do it, believe in the ritual, gather up some raw Khaos and shape it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kind of hard to make people do what you want them to, when they don&amp;rsquo;t need your bullshit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, you tell them you need a shaman to do real magic, then that the chief is in charge because he&amp;rsquo;s special, then priests and kings, celebrities and presidents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rituals to keep power out of the hands of the little people, and to shape Khaos into a form of order that keeps the people in power, forever in power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But no one believes in priests and politicians any more, the only thing we believe in now is money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little pieces of metal and paper, worth nothing but what worth we believe they have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old rituals that made the system that controls things are breaking down, people find themselves in power with no clue how they got it, or what to do with it. A reality TV host becoming president for instance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ancient chains are loosened. Khaos can now be coxed free and shaped by ritual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three coins in the air, sheer chance to waken the Khaos, symbols of the land to pull to your, and your will to shape it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
