			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Search for the legendary Hammer of Karakus within the Dungeons of Karas Karn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last wielded by the human paladin, Talon Darkbane, the legendary Hammer of Karakus was thought forever lost. Then you discovered the remains of a journal kept by a cleric that traveled with Talon and clues to the weapon's final resting place were revealed &amp;ndash; Karakus went home. The famed paladin and the legendary hammer had entered the fallen dwarf hold, Karas Karn. Neither were seen again. Now you and your comrades, armed with the pages from the cleric&amp;rsquo;s journal, can trace the paladin&amp;rsquo;s steps and discover what lay within The Dungeons of Karas Karn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeons of Karas Karn is the first in a new series of dungeon adventures from New Realms Publishing. The adventure takes the characters into the depths of a fallen dwarf hold in search of a legendary magic hammer. But beware, for it is unlikely that the hold is uninhabited and if Darkbane met his end there, whatever finished him may still be about. Delve into the dark depths, battle the deadly inhabitants, overcome the dangerous traps and seek a legendary weapon within The Dungeons of Karas Karn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adventure Module includes a new Adventure Record, 9 Adventure cards, 9 Encounter cards, 9 Event cards, 9 Search cards and 18 Treasure cards. In addition, to capture the old school dungeon feel we&amp;rsquo;ve included several areas that are detailed in Custom Encounters and Custom Encounters II. If you want to add more variety, strange events and encounters, you can expand on these adventure areas with cards from Custom Encounters and Custom Encounters II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeons of Karas Karn takes the characters on an old school, dark and deadly dungeon delve, full of dangerous foes, strange sites and fabulous treasure. Suitable for use with any fantasy role playing game, The Dungeons of Karas Karn can be played solo or with a group, with or without a GM. The adventure is highly re-playable and compatible with other Universal Adventures cards. In addition, you can combine the cards with other cards from the series, or cards from other Universal Adventures products, to create your own adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adventure Module is a new, simple way to play fantasy adventures. The organization and presentation of the adventures allows for quick setup, quick play and gives you the ability to focus on the action and &amp;ldquo;story&amp;rdquo; while leaving you the option to include tactical action and combat if you desire. Enter a new and exciting world of adventure, full of wonder and surprises. Enter The Dungeons of Karas Karn, if you dare!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
