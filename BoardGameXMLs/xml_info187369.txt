							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Front Nine: The Municipal Golf Club</name>
									
			<description>The Royal Golfing Association were heavily criticised after the 'Augustus' campaign for promoting golf as an elitist sport. Many argued that golf should be available to all, not just those who could afford top flight membership fees. Bowing to this pressure the RGA have launched the 'Municipal Golf Club' initiative and challenge local authorities and councils to redevelop their suburban and brown field sites in a competition to design and build  the best golf course that will be accessible to all members of the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Chairman of your local council parks and recreation department, you must do all you can to secure this coveted prize for your borough. However with your neighbouring districts equally driven to win, you might have to resort to underhand tactics to sabotage the opposition's plans. Perhaps by the construction of a disruptive by pass through their course or even funding a sewage treatment facility a bit too close to a fairway. Perhaps the winner may not be decided by which course is the best, but which is the least worst!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eighteen new 'urban' course cards to be spliced into the original deck. New Market and Club House cards along with special cards focused on making the design of your opponents courses as difficult as possible. Not to mention those dastardly fly tippers dumping rubbish all over your lovely fairways! This second expansion for The Front Nine requires a more ruthless  attitude for the prospective golf course designer. Not for the faint hearted!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
