			<description>Rumble Racing is a PlayStation 2 racing video game from Electronic Arts. It is based on EA's NASCAR Rumble, developed by the same team at EA's Redwood Shores location, which was released for the Sony PlayStation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each car has three styles: rookie, pro and elite. To unlock Pro and Elite the player has to win championship races. It gets harder as play progresses, but new cars can be unlocked along the way. To unlock cars, the player must have a score of first place. Higher points are awarded for first, second or third place. Placement also determines where the player is placed in subsequent races. Power-ups help the player win. There are 15 tracks in the game with beach, country, stunt track, desert, airport, and mountain themes, as well as special tracks such as a small colosseum-esque oval track and a bizarre track named Outer Limits with weird elements like caverns and road bumps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game the player come across different weapons that can be used. These vary based on the player's current position in the race. Being in last place gives the player a greater chance of getting Twister, which summons a tornado to fling their opponents into mid-air. If the player is in first, he or she might get a speed boost, or an oil slick, or any of various other weaker power-ups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Rumble Racing&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
