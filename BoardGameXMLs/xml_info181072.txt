			<description>From the box: &amp;quot;Bilby Buddies is a matching game designed to teach animal recognition to children between the ages of 18 months-6 years.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two ways to play Bilby Buddies, both takeoffs on classic games. In &amp;quot;Bingo Style,&amp;quot; each player has a board marked with 12 animals. Players in turn choose a tile from a face-down stack and call out the name of the animal. The player who has the animal on his or her card claims the tile. The first player to fill the boar wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;Memory Style,&amp;quot; each player gets a game board. The 48 animal tiles are spread out face-down. Each player in turn takes a tile, tries to match it to their card, and if it doesn't match, puts it back face-down. Other players may gain an advantage by remembering which tiles are where. The first player to fill his or her card wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
