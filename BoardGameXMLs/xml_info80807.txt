			<description>Michigan: Report from Hell, released as Michigan in Japan, is a survival horror game developed by Grasshopper Manufacture and published by Spike. Directed by Akira Ueda, and planned by Goichi Suda  the game focuses on a news crew for the fictional Zaka TV, dedicated to covering strange phenomena. The game is unique in the sense that it is played almost entirely though the viewfinder of a camera; and the game is lost if the player runs out of film before solving the mysteries in a mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the word Michigan by itself usually refers to the State of Michigan or less commonly the University of Michigan, the game takes place in Chicago, Illinois, and is named because the game's phenomena centers around Lake Michigan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Michigan: Report from Hell&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
