			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE WORLD OF CRIME FIGHTER RPG&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the superheroic world of Crime Fighter RPG, there are no super powers. Instead, all crime fighters and criminals are highly skilled human beings armed with advanced technological gadgetry. Technology and science are at modern day levels, with some breakthroughs being made by a few. Despite the lack of super powers, many individuals exist that are quite formidable due to great physical prowess, genius level IQ, and advanced weaponry. Because of this, many 'super' criminals exist which the normal authorities cannot handle, so the law has been taken into the hands of a select group of 'super' heroes known as crime fighters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
