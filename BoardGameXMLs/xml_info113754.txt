							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Computer Trivia</name>
									
			<description>Computer Trivia is a standard trivia game where the object is to be the first player or team to reach the WINNER key.  Along the way players will encounter category, choice, opponents choice, P.C. glitch, and category headquarters keys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you roll the die, move, try your luck on a trivia question and if you somehow answer the question correctly you get to roll again.  There is a special star-dot-star side on the die, and if rolled the player gets to ask a question (of their choice of categories) to the &amp;quot;opposing&amp;quot; players.  If the players answer correctly they stay on their current location; if they answer the question incorrectly, they each roll the die and move back the indicated number of spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Category Headquarter keys must be landed on with an exact roll and cannot be passed until you answer the question correctly.  The Winner space must also be landed on with an exact roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trivia categories are Hardware, Software, People &amp;amp; Companies, History, and Potpourri (miscellaneous).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 - Computer Trivia fold out playing board&lt;br/&gt;2 - Volumes of trivia questions &amp;amp; answers&lt;br/&gt;2 - Computer Trivia book marks&lt;br/&gt;4 - Playing pieces&lt;br/&gt;1 - Computer Trivia die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
