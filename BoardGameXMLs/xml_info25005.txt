							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Walter Johnson Base Ball Game</name>
									
			<description>An early baseball game featuring Washington Senator Walter &amp;quot;Big Train&amp;quot; Johnson.  Interaction is at a low point here, as defense is played on offense.  The player who is at bat, spins a teetotum with various play results engraved on each side.  Whatever the result on the spinner, is the result on the field.  Play nine innings and rack up the score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The teetotum has 20 sides, with the following results:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 Home Run, 1 Triple, 1 Double, 2 Singles, 3 Infield Outs, 2 Fly Outs, 1 Sacrifice Fly Out, 1 Double Play, 1 Error, 1 Stolen Base, 3 Balls, 2 Strikes and 1 Foul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Walter Johnson (1887 - 1946)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
