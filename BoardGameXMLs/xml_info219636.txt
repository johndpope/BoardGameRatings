			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A FULL-COLOR 45 PAGE LABYRINTH LORD/MUTANT FUTURE CAMPAIGN FOR 5 CHARACTERS OF FIRST LEVEL &amp;ndash; THREADS is a post-nuclear apocalyptic campaign for Mutants &amp;amp; Mazes (Labyrinth Lord and Mutant Future) It puts forth a post-Armageddon global scenario where a catastrophic atomic exchange known only as &amp;lsquo;The Social Wars&amp;rsquo; has taken place sometime in the 2020s AD. The campaign&amp;rsquo;s beginning date is what is suspected to be (and has been ordained by the surviving elites) the 1st of January, 2080 AD. A shattered civilization reels on its knees to regain its balance. A world thrust inexplicably into a technological Dark Ages of the 600s-1200s AD. MIRVed ballistic missiles replaced with wooden and stone clubs. Electricity: a mystical wonder of the perhaps-magical elite. Mutation and desolation. A neo-feudalism descends on Earth&amp;hellip; Details are sketchy in the physical remnants of libraries and media outlets hit hard in the prolonged nuclear exchange now referred to as &amp;lsquo;The Social Wars&amp;rsquo;. These occurred around 2020 AD though no one now is even exactly sure of what is the correct date. The correct date as per the now-operational UKBC is set at January 1st, 2080 AD (United Kingdom Broadcasting Center which is again kept broadcasting constantly in the prospect should any of the now-lost ex-British N-sub flotilla ever re-crew, reactivate, find no signal, loose its missiles and restart a limited nuclear exchange with &amp;ldquo;The Combine&amp;rdquo;). &amp;lsquo;Yew-Kay-Bee-See&amp;rsquo; (actually UKBC - the transmissions and bunker area of the UKBC, the United Kingdom&amp;rsquo;s Broadcasting Centre, 60 miles north of Old London) - cult among Commoners and primitives with radio access. The monotone broadcaster voice (computer-generated) for the radio network that can reach most of the UK with a signal is regarded as god-like to some in the UK and is manipulated by UNIT and the remnant State. Contains the adventures The Fury of the Danes and The Risen City of Atlantis. Also contains suitable sample First Level characters for the campaign ready for play. Contains rules for technology, weapon proficiencies and a chronology of Armageddon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
