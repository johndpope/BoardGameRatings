			<description>A child-friendly adaptation of Jok R Ummy. In this version, the deck of playing cards has replaced the four suits with animals (parrot, penguin, tiger, and zebra).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round players receive nine playing cards and one mission card. Each mission card is unique and lists a series of cards needed to complete the mission (for example: 5 tiger cards in ascending order). On their turn, each player must draw a card and then discard a card. When a player has the cards required on their personal mission card, they reveal their mission card to the other players and layers the corresponding playing cards on the table. Players acquire a new mission card every round, or they can keep an old mission card if they did not manage to complete it in the previous round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player completes four mission cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
