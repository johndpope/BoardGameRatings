							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jewels of the Sultan</name>
									
			<description>The goal of this game is to acquire the color jewels that will score in the present round, as well as in future rounds until all jewels have been dispersed and the game ends after the final round. However, you don't want any of the white colored jewels, as they are worthless and will never score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Setup) From Box Top:&lt;br/&gt;Put all of the jewels into a global stash to one side of the playing area. Give each player a Persian Rug. Choose one player to be the first Sultan. Give that player the Sultan pawn, the Sultan cards, and the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Play) Summarized From the Box Top:&lt;br/&gt;The Sultan, using the dice, adds 10 jewels of the rolled color into a single pile for that round. The Sultan then divides the pile in any manner they choose among each of the players, so long as each player pile contains at least one item. Finally the sultan secretly determines which color will score at the end of the given round using the Sultan cards. The position of the Sultan then passes to the next player, and play continues until all jewels have been dispersed and final scoring occurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
