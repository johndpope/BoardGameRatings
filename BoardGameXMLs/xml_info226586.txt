			<description>Greenest is the third game of the Green-Greener-Greenest set. Green, Greener and Greenest are three games that use the same set of components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greenest is a game for 1 player with the same mechanism as Green.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the set, you&amp;rsquo;d have:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic: a 6&amp;times;6 board, 15 black pyramids, 20 green pyramids, 15 white pyramids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced: a 6&amp;times;9 &amp;ndash; 9&amp;times;9 board (using one or both pads), 30 black pyramids, 45 green pyramids, 30 white pyramids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board starts full of pyramids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Black can only capture Green&lt;br/&gt;- Green can only capture White&lt;br/&gt;- White can only capture Black&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to end up with a single stack, by making captures also as in Green (Black can only capture Green and so on), but in any order. This is, you can capture several times with the same colour, or reverse the order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether all initial configurations are solvable or not still remains an open question. Your feedback on this will be greatly appreciated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please refer to the rulebook for detailed rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
