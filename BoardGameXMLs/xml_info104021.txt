							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Nightmarket: Games of Chance</name>
									
			<description>From the product listing:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Deep in the heart of the Kaiser's Bazaar runs the Nightmarket. A disconnected bunch of cut-throats, thieves, burglars, muggers, bandits, boosters, gamblers, embezzlers, pirates, and swindlers that deal in the businesses everyone knows about, but no one wants to talk about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gambling is one of those businesses, and business is booming. Nightmarket - Games of Chance contains three gambling houses that operate inside the Kaiser's Bazaar (or anywhere in your game world) among the legal shops. Each one is of varying levels of prestige and safety to accommodate your style of play and to add variety to your cities.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
