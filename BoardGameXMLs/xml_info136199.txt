			<description>Road Trip: The Arcade Edition, known as Gadget Racers in Europe and Choro Q! in Japan, is a racing video game released in 2002 by Takara. This 3D game is only available for the Nintendo GameCube. Road Trip: The Arcade Edition is based mainly upon Road Trip Adventure, a predecessor, however was only sold for the Gamecube. Allowing this, weapons were added to a more racing perspective to make it an arcade version. It involves tiny little toy cars known in real life as Choro-Q or Penny Racers. There are many different modes in this game. The game also include weapons such as machine guns and shot guns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose which of the 10 cars they will be driving. Some modes are: Challenge Race, Drag Racing, and Grand Prix. Players must complete tracks in Challenge Race and Grand Prix in order to play additional cars in any given game. The tracks for the races are called: Road Trip Circuit, Road Trip Park, After School, Kid's Room, Road Trip Highway, and Silver Village. The tracks will be short, middle, long, short reversed, middle reversed, and long reversed. Successful players may work up to 100 cars and many more parts including the legendary Devil Magnimum engine and the Road Trip Hurtle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Road Trip: The Arcade Edition&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
