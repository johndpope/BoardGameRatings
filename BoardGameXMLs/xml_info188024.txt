			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Spy-Fi characters have Attributes that are divided into Skills and Statistics.  Skills are trained abilities; Statistics are natural or innate abilities.  All Attributes have a value between 1 and 6 (low is better).  During character build, players distribute twenty-four points among seven Basic Skills (Action, Brawl, Charisma, Detective, Espionage, Firearms, and Gaming).  Characters may take an eighth Skill of their own creation by incurring an additional eight points in the pool.  Skill scores can then be &amp;quot;min/maxed&amp;quot; so one score might be made a zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters then receive five of the ten Statistics, distributing seventeen points among the five so they have values of 1-6.  The remaining five Statistics then are assigned a value of six each.  During each session, characters receive Gambit Points and Penalty Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To resolve attempted actions, characters roll dice and try to &amp;quot;roll under&amp;quot; the relevant Attribute.  Gambit Points can be spent to alter dice rolls.  Penalty Points can be of several types:  Bimbo, Uncool, Hazard, Stumble, Backstab, Wimp, Accident, Faux, Weenie, or Guilt.  Generally, these points are adverse in action and must somehow be played out to be discarded.  The game includes a rudimentary experience and advancement system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
