			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:                     &lt;br/&gt;20&amp;quot;x30&amp;quot; Board&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;40 Pick Pile Cards&lt;br/&gt;200 Player Cards With Stats&lt;br/&gt;Roster&lt;br/&gt;122 Punch Out Tokens&lt;br/&gt;6 Double Sided Score Cards            &lt;br/&gt;                                     &lt;br/&gt;You begin by drafting your team, then you roll dice to advance around the board. Each time around the board equals one week in the season. There are 200 player cards with stats on the back broken down into 17 weeks. The stats are their actual performance last year, with a column for their fantasy points each week. There are also 16 rookie cards with newly drafted rookies and their projected stats for 2005. At the end of each week, you add up the points for the players on your team and compete against a different player each time around the board.&lt;br/&gt;                                     &lt;br/&gt;Several things can happen while playing the game as you advance around the board. You can be forced to trade with another person, you can pick up free agents, your players can get injured or suspended,you can get plus or minus points for the week,etc.&lt;br/&gt;                                     &lt;br/&gt;You accumulate season points, as well as wins and losses. The 2 or 4 teams with the most wins advance to a playoff round, and a champion is determined.                               &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
