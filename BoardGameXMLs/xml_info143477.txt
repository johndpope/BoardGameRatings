							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cat Lady</name>
									
			<description>Susan Ashworth, known in her neighbourhood as the crazy Cat Lady, is a lonely 40- year old on the verge of suicide. She has no family, no friends and no hope for a better future.One day she discovers that five strangers will come along and change everything.But those five, &amp;quot;The Parasites&amp;quot;, are also the most ruthless, deranged and cold-blooded bunch of psychopaths the city has ever known. They will stop at nothing to hurt Susan. Unless, she hurts them first...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Susan's few weeks journey doesn't take her across the world and won't turn her into a hero. She has little faith in others and hardly even cares about herself. She can't fight and has never fired a gun in her life. But she's hanging onto that thin thread of hope, that in the end, as promised, there's an elusive reward waiting for her. Something worth trying for. Something that'll help her find an unlikely friend. Something that'll give her life a purpose. Susan's journey takes her on a roller-coaster ride between the world of the living and the world of the dead, where the only way to survive is to overcome her biggest weakness: her own self.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cat Lady is a new, critically acclaimed horror adventure game by designer Remigiusz Michalski (author of Downfall, 2009). A gripping story, pumping soundtrack, high-resolution artwork, and motivational voice acting will engross you on your journey through the strange and often terrifying world of The Cat Lady.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
