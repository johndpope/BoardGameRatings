			<description>This is an early baseball card game, remarkably complex and well-accessorized for its time. The box includes a deck of 100 cards, a 12&amp;quot; square green felt mat printed with a baseball field, and 18 ceramic chips (9 ivory and 9 rust-colored).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck has 22 Ball cards, 21 Strikes, 10 Fouls, 21 Outs, 4 Double Plays, 1 Triple Play, 4 Pick-offs, 3 Safe on Error, 1 Safe on Bunt, 1 Hit by Pitch, 6 Singles, 3 Doubles, 2 Triples and 1 Home Run. Many of the Ball, Strike and Out cards have contingent results depending on location of any baserunners: safe or out on steals, sacrifices, tag-up on flies, fielders choice, and even a passed ball. And one Ball card has &amp;quot;Game called on account of rain&amp;quot; (only if players have agreed in advance to include this result).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This highly detailed deck creates a deep narrative for each game, even if the play itself is simple, involving luck rather than strategy. The deck is shuffled, and the batting player turns over cards one at a time until a third out. Highest score after nine innings of three outs each wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
