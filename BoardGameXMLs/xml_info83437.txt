			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;V for Victory: Gold-Juno-Sword, takes the series back to the Normandy beaches. As the Commonwealth commander, you must take and hold a beach head large enough to secure a foothold in Europe, and open a second front against Germany. As the German commander, you must destroy the Commonwealth Divisions, and force them to withdraw from the continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lead your forces against the computer or another player. Test your skills as a WWII combat commander in seven scenarios of increasing difficulty:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Orne Bridges: Elements of the British 6th Airborne Division defend the bridges over the Orne against strong German attacks.&lt;br/&gt;     Attack of the 12th SS: The Elite 12th SS &amp;amp;quot;Hitler Youth&amp;amp;quot; Division attacks elements of the British Third &amp;quot;London&amp;quot; Infantry Division as it advances to Caen.&lt;br/&gt;     Off the Beaches: The Commonwealth forces of the 1st and 30th Corps must advance to Caen, enlarge the beachhead against strong German resistance, and link up with the Americans west of Bayeux.&lt;br/&gt;     The End Run: The British 7th and 50th Divisions must seize and then defend Villers-Bocage and turn the left flank of the German defense of Caen, the ancient capital of William the Conqueror.&lt;br/&gt;     To the Sea: The Hypothetical German counter-attack to isolate the British beaches from a linkup with the Americans on Omaha beach.&lt;br/&gt;     Charge of the Bull: The powerful 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions launch a counterattack against the British 11th Armoured Division in its advance across the Odon River.&lt;br/&gt;     Campaign Game: The complete Gold-Juno-Sword Campaign Game, the all-encompassing scenario, gives the player ample opportunities to maneuver, attack, and defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;V for Victory: Gold-Juno-Sword also includes numerous options and historical variants. Select one or more of them in combination for dozens of different scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
