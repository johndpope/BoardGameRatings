			<description>In Streck dich, Mieze!, the players play cats who are fishing in the river.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, the river is created by marking the riverbanks with two cords. Cards depicting fish worth 1-3 points are scattered in this river.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the players take turn fishing. At the start of a player's turn, a cat card is drawn, which shows the position the player must take at the riverbank, and what body part(s) he may use to get a fish (left hand, right hand, left foot, right foot, nose).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When he has taken up position, the player tries to move one of the fish cards to the riverbank. If he succeeds in doing so, he gets to keep the card. If he falls over or uses the wrong body part for fishing, his turn ends without gaining a fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each player has made five fishing attempts, the game ends, and the player with the highest total value of fishes caught wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
