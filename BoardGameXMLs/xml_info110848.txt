							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Inception, the Roleplaying Game</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inception: The Roleplaying Game takes a free-form stand on equipment, stats, and the players requests. In essence it is a generic system which allows players to say what they wish to do in the world without having to say, &amp;ldquo;No, I don't know how to calculate the stats&lt;br/&gt;for you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to be a manual for both the player and The Architect (the GM), every person involved in a game run with this system should at least skim its contents, The Architect needing to read them very thoroughly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
