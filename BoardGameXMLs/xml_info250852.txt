							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Let Them Eat Shrimp: Fish Friends</name>
									
			<description>The Let Them Eat Shrimp: Fish Friends promotional pack adds a splash of variety to the original Let Them Eat Shrimp. The pack has 1 instructional card plus 5 fish friend cards. At the start of a player's turn, he or she uses one of the friends' special powers and then turns the card over. After all 5 friends' powers have been used, the cards are turned face-up again, and players may then use the powers again. The choice of powers, all of which provide the player with a unique ability, adds a new and interesting decision to each turn: should I use the Orca to help me combat the shark, the Jellyfish to place the tile point-to-point, the Dolphin to switch one of my tiles, the Clam to place an additional tile, or the Octopus to place a tile anywhere on the board?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
