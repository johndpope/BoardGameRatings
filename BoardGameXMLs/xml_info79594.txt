			<description>[From the official website of the game]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fatale is an interactive vignette in realtime 3D inspired by the story of Salome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore a living tableau filled with references to the legendary tale and enjoy the moonlit serenity of a fatal night in the orient. Fatale offers an experimental play experience that stimulates the imagination and encourages multiple interpretations and personal associations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salome is a first century Judean princess mentioned in the Christian Bible by Matthew and by Mark. But it is Oscar Wilde's 19th century play &amp;quot;Salome&amp;quot; that really inspired Fatale. In the Bible, Salome is a child who dances for King Herod and asks the head of John the Baptist as a reward. In Wilde's version, Salome falls in love with the prophet. He rejects her and she has him executed. The play ends with her kissing the lips of his decapitated head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of Fatale takes place in the aftermath of this event, when all has turned quiet and the moon brings comfort to troubled hearts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
