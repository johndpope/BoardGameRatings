			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an adventure for the RPG Operation:Fallen Reich, for 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an adventure suitable for a 4-5 hour game, starting October 9, 1939.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot Excerpt:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Germans are very keen on keeping the good business deals they have with American companies like the big three from Detroit, Standard Oil and US Steel. They all bring valuable supplied to the Wehrmacht, and the three motor vehicle companies from Detroit all have built modern fast assembly factories using the latest in modern mass production technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plan came up by a coincidence, when the American organisation The Black Legion contacted the German cultural attach&amp;eacute; with a request to bring over some high quality European circus artists to spice up a carnival fair that was to be organised in the Detroit area by The Black Legion as part of a recruitment campaign. Not only one, but four Carnivals with European performers soon travelled around the rural United States. The performers were not only just great, among them hid a few hand picked Fallens with special mind controlling powers. The fear that daunting acts impose on the audience makes them easy targets for mind control, and the control is just adjusting the mind to think and follow the ways of The Black Legion. --&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
