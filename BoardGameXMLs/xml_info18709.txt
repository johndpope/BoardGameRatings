							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Piquet: Din of Battle</name>
									
			<description>Din of Battle covers the conflicts between the colonial powers of the 19th century and the native peoples of their intended colonies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules plead no cause - most of the causes for which these past warriors fought are long ago gone. In many cases the &amp;quot;winners&amp;quot; would be surprised if they returned today to view modern South Africa, Egypt, China, or Morocco. So what these rules celebrate is the honor and bravery of men who fought for lost reasons in remote and alien lands and the courage of men who attempted to save a doomed and, in some cases, brutish way of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also commemorates some of the kindest, meanest, most charitable, most selfish, bravest, most craven, brightest and most incorrigibly ignorant people that have ever walked the earth: the Victorian on a mission, the Calif with murder in his heart, the merciless Zulu, the totally mad Gordon confronting the equally mad Mahdi. What color! What excitement! This is the era of the mysteries of the Nile's source, or the hidden interior of Peking's Imperial City!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Piquet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
