			<description>The first version (Lampre edition) in 1999 was made for the Italian Lampre cycling outfit and only distributed amongst their customers. The 2nd edition from 2000 was commercialized and is known as the Lotto edition. The only difference is the cover of the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyclo is a cycling game where each player controls a team of 5 cyclists, each team in a different color. The gameboard consists of 5 double strokes that can be used to form different tracks. There are 3 dice, downhill all 3 may be used, during climbing only 1 die may be rolled. Cyclists can slipstream when staying behind another cyclist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this is a dice controlled game (which means luck involved) Cyclo still manages to simulate the cycling board quite well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
