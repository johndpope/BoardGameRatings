							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DICE Football</name>
									
			<description>DICE Football uses 4 10-sided dice and can be played with 1 or 2 players. Each player chooses a team and the two players decide who will be the home team and who will be the away team. DICE Football combines team match ups and individual match ups to give you the authentic feel of real football. In DICE Football you will get to choose how much control over play calling you want or how little. DICE Football offers three unique different gaming experiences. You can jump right in with the basic version of the game, you can use all of the additional advance rules, or you can pick and choose which optional rules you would like to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
