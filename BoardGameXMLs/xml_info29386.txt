			<description>Maori Wars is a light treatment of the principal uprisings that took place during 1845-1872.&lt;br/&gt;The game has 7 scenarios:&lt;br/&gt;1) Hone Heke's Challenge (1844-46)&lt;br/&gt;2) Hutt Valley Uprising (1846)&lt;br/&gt;3) Wanganui Uprising (1847-48)&lt;br/&gt;4) Taranaki &amp;quot;Kingite&amp;quot; War (1860-61)&lt;br/&gt;5) Waikato &amp;quot;Hau-Hau&amp;quot; War (1863-64)&lt;br/&gt;6) Tauranga (1864)&lt;br/&gt;7) Lame Seagull's March (1864)&lt;br/&gt;and 3 campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;One 22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; map, over 300 double sided, die-cut counters, and a 12 page color rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between 1845 and 1872 the British Army, the newly formed New Zealand Armed Constabulary and the first Australian expeditionary force fought the fiercely independent tribes of New Zealand to expand western culture into the interior of Maori occupied New Zealand. A series of distinct uprisings occurred through which the British came to respect the Maori warrior as brave, ferocious and exceedingly clever. Defeat of the Maori was due as much to infighting as it was British numbers, weaponry and tactics. Maori tribes were hardly united. Like American Indian tribes, many recognized the opportunity to settle old scores and attain dominance by treating with the Pakeha (foreigners) against their traditional Maori enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maori Wars was once under development by Khyberpass Games, after KPG disbanded, Legion Wargames undertook many of KPG's prior gaming commitments including the production of MAORI WARS.  Since then, world class designer, Nils Johansson took a liking to the game and undertook a beautiful revamping of the map (See below). Maori Wars has now exceeded its preorder goal and it is currently in the production queue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
