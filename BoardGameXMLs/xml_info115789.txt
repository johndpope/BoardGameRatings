			<description>A great tournament has begun in Wystern to determine who will become the next seven Craftlords of Wystern and act as the guardians and councilors of the city. But the tournament features an unusual rule that has everyone in Wystern abuzz: only Craftknight apprentices under the age of 18 are allowed to enter! One of the tournament contestants is the child of Shintetsu, a legendary Craftlord who met a mysterious fate three years earlier. The child wants nothing more than to win the tournament and uphold the Shintetsu legacy, but the tournament is only the beginning of a saga that will lead to the uncovering of the darkest secret of all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
