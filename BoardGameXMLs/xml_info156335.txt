			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ages gone a thousand spells were known to sorcery, and the wizards effected their wills. Today, as Earth dies, a hundred spell remain to man&amp;rsquo;s knowledge, and these have come to us through the ancient books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-The Dying Earth, Chapter 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vancomancer is a variant of the wizard that is more in line with what you would expect from Jack Vance's The Dying Earth; there is no daily limitation on magic, you can cast spells right out of your book (if you have enough time), and the spells do not have levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those are not the only ways in which it differs from the standard wizard, though: aside from kind of one, the new advanced moves let you do stuff like grow minions in flesh vats, improve upon your manse, impress people with your magic, summon and bind sandestins, create magic items, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, there are 25 spells--18 simple and 7 complex--to get you started, including The Excellent Prismatic Spray, The Omnipotent Sphere, and Felojun's 2nd Hypnotic Spell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
