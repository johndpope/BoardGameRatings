			<description>A memory game based on the children's book and animated TV series &amp;quot;Charlie and Lola&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board shows a bedroom on one side and a living room on the other side. The players decide which side they want to use. There is also a smaller board that is divided into four sections (blue, red, green and yellow). Each of these sections shows 4 different objects - mostly toys but also a hairbrush, pencils and a telephone. There are 16 cardboard chips that show the same 16 objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into two phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 1: Players take turns &amp;quot;hiding&amp;quot; the objects on the board: they take a chip, say where they are hiding it (e.g. &amp;quot;I'm hiding the football under the bed) and place it in the corresponding section of the board. Once all objects have been placed on the board, the players try to memorise which object is where. Then the chips are turned face-down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 2: Players then take turns rolling the colour die. If you roll red, you have to find one of the four objects from the red section of the smaller board. If you find a correct object, you get to keep the chip.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all objects have been found. The player with the most chips wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
