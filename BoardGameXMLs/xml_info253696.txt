			<description>&amp;ldquo;FITNA (Schism in Arabic), The global war in the Middle East&amp;ldquo; is a two to six-player grand strategic level card driven wargame depicting the military confrontations in the Middle East since 2012, up to the near future. Among 10 historical and hypothetical scenarios, players can simulate the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the Kurdish Rebellion, the Sunni versus Shia confrontation as well as Russian, Turkish, Israeli and Western intervention in the region. ISIS troops are activated through Event cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This wargame allows you to have a clearer view of the local protagonists' goals and a real understanding of what is going on in this chaotic area. This is why it is used by experts and analysts of the French Ministry of Defence to test prospective scenarios, as the iconic &amp;ldquo;Gulf Strike&amp;rdquo; used to be by US experts to plan the Gulf War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
