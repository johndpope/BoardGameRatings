			<description>This game has not been released separately, but can be found in Twin Stars: Adventure Series I.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two cosmic adventurers are in a tricky scenario and must work together. By rolling and manipulating dice for special abilities and combos, you can be the one that guides them to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from the card:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four planets of the Tetran System light up the display as your ship drops out of hyperspace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Remember, the mark came here for a reason. Every misstep we make is an opportunity for him to get ready for our arrival.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, should we split up, or stick together?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bounty has been tracked to the risky Tetran Sector. Use resources to capture the bounty to win. Lose if either character loses all health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
