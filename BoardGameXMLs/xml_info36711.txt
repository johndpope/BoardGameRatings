							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Night at the Chill</name>
									
			<description>As the box proudly proclaims: &amp;quot;It's Not Your Common Game!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;This game was a promotional item for the Columbus Chill of the East Coast Hockey League.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intro from the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Your group of three Chill Fans are at the Chill game. They were so excited to get to the Coliseum that they rushed out of the house and forgot to eat dinner. Object of the game is to move your three Chill fans from the start section of their color around the arena - through the FOOD STAND, to get all of their food cards, to the SOUVENIR STAND to get all of their souvenirs and get up to their proper seats before anyone else. At the same time, there's a hockey game going on!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
