			<description>CASTLE UNDER SIEGE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Castle under Siege is an 18-card - 1 or 2-player Dexterity Medieval Castle Siege game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player-1 controls the Catapult and tries to loft &amp;quot;boulder, fireball, and disease&amp;quot; towards a castle. You use one of the cards as an actual catapult; tossing ammunition at the castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player-2 maintains the castle and must use his forces to put out fires, repair boulder damage, and take card of the injured soldiers. To do this you must move around the castle trying to reach and resolve each situation before it gets out of control. All the while trying to stay alive because if a boulder lands in an area where your forces are they are either killed or injured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have a limited supply of ammunition and once you run out the game is over. You tally your score to see if you breached the castle wall or tower. Or see how many forces you were able to kill!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player of the castle wins by preventing a wall or tower breach and trying to save as many soldiers as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
