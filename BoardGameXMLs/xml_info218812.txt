							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Van Gogh Walks into a Bar</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the XIX century and famous Vincent Willem Van Gogh is up to party. Players will define his movement from bar to bar and will try to make him pass through their food stands to earn points. A game created in M&amp;eacute;xico during the Global Game Jam 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the set up, each player will place 6 food stands on the map, which is compounded by 3 sectors of 5 tiles x 6 tiles. Then, players will take turns to define 15 of Van Gogh's erratic movements. Each round, one of the players will play secretly so the other players won't know for sure where Van Gogh is located.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can get points if Van Gogh passes through one of their Food Stands or if Van Gogh wavelike movement matches one of the Path Cards that the players have. If Van Gogh would leave the table, players may lose points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after each player had the chance to play secretly during a round. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
