			<description>Dark Fall: Lost Souls is a British first-person horror-adventure game. It is a sequel to the first Dark Fall game. It was released as a digital download on 4 December 2009 and as a boxed version on 11 December 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game revisits the Dowerton Train Station and Hotel first introduced in Dark Fall: The Journal. The game is set a few years after the events of the first game and the station and hotel are in an advanced state of disrepair. You play as &amp;quot;The Inspector&amp;quot;, a disgraced police officer who was dismissed from the force after tampering with evidence in the case of a missing child, Amy. The case never left his mind however and his search for the missing child eventually leads him to the Dowerton Station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lost Souls uses a simple point-and-click interface to move the player around and manipulate the environment. Contrary to a lot of modern adventure games but similar to the first two installments, Lost Souls does not keep note of any information or clues to puzzles that the player comes across during the game, effectively forcing the player to keep track of every puzzle or detail themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dark Fall: Lost Souls,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
