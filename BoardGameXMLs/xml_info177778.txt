			<description>From the product description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The need to hunt burns in your heart and in your soul. To chase down prey with your blood pumping fire through your body. Yesterday you didn&amp;rsquo;t know what that felt like, but today you&amp;rsquo;re sitting in a room with the bodies of your family and you need to hunt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a human, a wolf, a killer, a monster. The ultimate predator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must hold the balance between the moon and the wolf. Between the flesh and the spirit. Between the pack and the prey. Your blood rises. The wolf must hunt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are you going to do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a hunter now, one of the Uratha who inherit the blessings of Moon and Wolf. You conduct your sacred hunts in the shadows of the ordinary world, trying to maintain the boundaries. Driven by the need to hunt, you must keep the forces that would sway you in harmony rather than giving in to your instincts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the hunt isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. Your werewolves think they can hunt any prey, but they now face the return of the idigam &amp;mdash; incomprehensible spirits of things that never existed, imprisoned at the dawn of time. Now they&amp;rsquo;re back, and they want to kill their jailers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They hate you, and they&amp;rsquo;re coming for you. Time to show them that your senses &amp;mdash; and your teeth &amp;mdash; are as sharp as ever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The complete guide to playing a werewolf in the World of Darkness.&lt;br/&gt;- Reimagined tribes, auspices, and spirit magic to create the ultimate predator and her pack.&lt;br/&gt;- A brand new look at werewolf hunting grounds around the world, from Basra to Tokyo.&lt;br/&gt;- Rules for the werewolves&amp;rsquo; prey, and five examples of the idigam.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
