							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ruined Town, The Lone Orc Sighting Tower</name>
									
			<description>he Blueprints product line offers you old-fashioned blue printed maps for using in your adventures and campaigns. For each map you get a blueprint version and a standard black and white version. The maps are all vector-based so you will get maximum print resolution. Despite their old fashioned appearance each map offers you a degree of customization, using the pdf technology at its best. A button (which will not be printed) on each map allows you to turn on and off the grid, eliminate the room numbers, get the walls filled, don&amp;rsquo;t show doors and furniture and many other options, depending on the kind of map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each product features a classic fantasy adventure location: a dungeon, a keep, a temple complex, a thieves guild and so on. You can use these map as reference to build your own adventures or simply take them at hand in case your players go in an unexpected direction during the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to the Sixth expansion for The Ruined Town adventure location.  The Lone Orc Sighting Tower presents a detailed location you can easily insert in your own campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An occasional daytime traveler passing near the Lone Orc Sighting Tower sees no more than a crumbling old sighting tower sitting on the top of an hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tower appears burned, scarred and mostly destroyed, even if the two floors still stand up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exploring the ruin, during daytime, provides no significative experience since all that can be found are burned stones and rest of blackened furniture. If you are lucky enough you could find a secondary entrance to the dungeon of Garak the Unconquered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the night something wondrous happens. A ghostly one replaces the whole tower. Just before the ghostly tower&amp;rsquo;s entrance a lone, ghostly orc, stands. Adventurers report that the orc halts everyone approaching the tower and shouts: &amp;ldquo;What the secret of Garak the Unconquered is? Giving a right answer provides access for the ghostly tower. That is, the adventurers can navigate the spectral tower as it was real.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set of maps provides floorplans for the crumbling tower as well as for the ghostly one.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Rule the Dungeon feature.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Enhanced customization (doors and furniture are separate, for example)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Alternative hexagonal grid available&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; &amp;quot;North&amp;quot; mark orientable&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Master control panel allows you to control all the maps at once&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Buttons for printing only blue maps or black and white maps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
