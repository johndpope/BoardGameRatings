			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tourist Trophy: The Real Riding Simulator is a motorcycle racing game. It was designed by Polyphony Digital, the same team that makes the popular Gran Turismo auto racing series. Tourist Trophy is one of only two titles for the PlayStation 2 that is capable of 1080i output, the other being Gran Turismo 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tourist Trophy was first released in China on January 26, 2006 then in Japan on February 2, 2006 and rated 32/40 (Silver rank) by Famitsu, a Japanese video game magazine.[citation needed] The North American edition was officially released on April 4, 2006 with seven extra motorcycles, new riding gear, seven bonus background music (BGM) tracks, enhanced visual effects, an exclusive &amp;quot;Semi-Pro Mode&amp;quot; and bike profiles. The PAL edition was launched on May 29, 2006 in Europe and June 1, 2006 in Oceania. The PAL version offers two additional motorcycles and five new BGM tracks performed by European artists Infadels, Vitalic and Hystereo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Modes&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Riding Form&amp;quot; option is available in both Arcade Mode (AM) and TT Mode (TTM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcade mode&lt;br/&gt;Before the race, the user can choose among four Riding Form presets: &amp;quot;Lean Body&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Neutral&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Lean Bike&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Motard/Dirt&amp;quot;. Lean Body focuses on quick cornering, Neutral focuses on handling, and Lean Bike is about slow cornering. The particular Motard form with the leg off is the Dirt position dedicated to Enduro and Naked bike riding; however, the user is free to use it on all bikes. This mode is named after the mode in related series Gran Turismo of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TT mode&lt;br/&gt;The user can enter the Garage Riding Form settings with up to four fully customizable forms to record. They are saved as &amp;quot;Form A&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Form B&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Form C&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Motard/Dirt&amp;quot;. Each one has eleven unique parameters and four presets: &amp;quot;Neutral&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Lean Body&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Lean Bike&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Motard/Dirt&amp;quot; from which to choose. Fully adjustable parameters are &amp;quot;Head Roll Angle&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Head Pitch Angle&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Torso Roll Angle&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Torso Yaw Angle&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Body Lean (Full Bank)&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Arm Angle&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Seat Position (Forward/Back)&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Lateral Slide&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Vertical Slide&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Leg Angle&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Body Lean (Upright)&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tourist Trophy's default setting is &amp;quot;Normal. Using the Normal setting, the player can perform maneuvers such as the &amp;quot;wheelie&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;stoppie&amp;quot; on powerful bikes. These possibilities are disabled with the &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot; setting. Enabling the Professional feature will enhance the simulation aspect as well as the difficulty level, over the arcade-oriented Normal. Professional riding is supposed to allow a more realistic experience with autonomous upper body control (as the &amp;quot;Tuck&amp;quot; manual function is enabled), and a separated front/rear brake control is added over the rear+front brake default system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Semi-pro mode&lt;br/&gt;The Semi-Pro Mode is an exclusive feature of the North American edition. Other options enhancing difficulty are the &amp;quot;Strict Judgment&amp;quot; a 10 second slow down penalty as seen in Gran Turismo 4 and the famous &amp;quot;Best Line&amp;quot; optional display.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other features&lt;br/&gt;Photo mode/best shot&lt;br/&gt;Unedited screenshots can be taken from a race replay and saved on a memory card or connected USB flash drives, like in Gran Turismo 4. This function is known in the game as &amp;quot;Best Shot&amp;quot;. Using various replay angles as a digital camera, the game is able to produce a selection of screenshots with variable compression rate (Normal/Fine/SuperFine) and size (up to 1280x960/72 dpi). The user can choose to save or print with an Epson compatible USB printer, or display it on TV using the Musical Diaporama feature. Saved game screenshots can be exchanged with friends or made public on the Internet. Unlike Best Shot, the &amp;quot;Photo Mode&amp;quot;'s parameters are fully adjustable and it gives the user the opportunity to entirely set photographs. The user can tune various parameters such as camera angle or course section. Formatting the USB device in Photo Mode/Best Shot will create the &amp;quot;DCIM/100PDITT&amp;quot; folder/subfolder allowing Tourist Trophy to store, upload and download game picture files generated under the form &amp;quot;IMG_00X.JPG&amp;quot;. Standard USB 2.0 flash drives (including MP3 players, mobile phones and pendrives) can be used to manage game JPEG files instead of the official I-O Data model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Replay/ghost&lt;br/&gt;The USB flash drive can host Tourist Trophy Replay/Ghost files downloaded from either the official game website or a fan site. It can also be used to exchange files with a friend's USB device. Once the files are in the flash drive, the user can upload them from within the game in order to compete with a Ghost (&amp;quot;Time Attack&amp;quot;) or to watch a Replay (&amp;quot;Theater&amp;quot;). Each file can be used as Replay or as Ghost. The first Replay/Ghost files released on the Japanese site featured a Famitsu journalist,[who?] Japanese pro rider and Tourist Trophy test rider Satoshi Tsujimoto, and Tourist Trophy producer Kazunori Yamauchi.[citation needed] Formatting the USB device from Theater Mode will create the &amp;quot;PDI&amp;quot; folder allowing Tourist Trophy to store, upload and download files generated under the form &amp;quot;replay.dat&amp;quot;. Standard third-party USB devices are also compatible with &amp;quot;REPLAY.DAT&amp;quot; files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenge mode/race event&lt;br/&gt;Unlike Gran Turismo games, Tourist Trophy doesn't contain any money system. The player has to obtain licenses (&amp;quot;License School&amp;quot;) in order to complete various missions (&amp;quot;Challenge Mode&amp;quot;) and obtain bikes that will be used and tuned to compete in the Championships series (&amp;quot;Race Event&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tourist Trophy's &amp;quot;Race Event&amp;quot; (TTM) core mode requires a license gained after completing riding lessons on a 250cc Yamaha TW225 off-road bike. Being successful on License School will unlock upper class &amp;quot;License Cards&amp;quot; (TTM), new bikes (AM/TTM), extra &amp;quot;Riding Gear&amp;quot; items (TTM), new tracks (AM), and extra makers (AM/TTM). Winning Challenge Mode will make new bikes available in the Garage (TTM). Beating Race Events will unlock a bonus 23rd Race Event, extra bikes (AM/TTM), new tracks (AM/TTM) and a classic bike (TTM). Completing the game will unlock the &amp;quot;Ending Movie&amp;quot; and add the &amp;quot;Clover Crown&amp;quot; ending theme in the &amp;quot;Music Theater&amp;quot; (AM/TTM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
