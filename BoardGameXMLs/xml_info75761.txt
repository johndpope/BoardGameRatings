			<description>Cacomo is a team game (two versus two) which aims at introducing beginners to Go. The aim is to enclose the pieces of the opponents' side, then take them off the board. Unlike in Go, players are not free to decide where to put their pieces, instead this is determined by cards with coordinates (one can always choose between five cards in one's hand). &lt;br/&gt;The team which captures most of the other teams' pieces is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
