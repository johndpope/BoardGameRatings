							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Medal of Honor: Vanguard</name>
									
			<description>Players take on the role of Sgt. Frank Keegan, a member of the 82nd Airborne Division, taking part in Operation Husky, Operation Neptune and Operation Market Garden. Keegan is later transferred to the 17th Airborne Division after Market Garden and participates in Operation Varsity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are able to customize their weapons, such as adding a telescopic sight to a M1 Garand rifle and a drum magazine for a Thompson submachine gun, although these upgrades are only available on certain levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of each of the operations, players parachute onto a battlefield (with the exception of a glider insertion at the start of the Invasion of Normandy) and can roughly designate where they land. Players who land at certain points in a level will be able to pick up weapon upgrades and ammunition. Missions can be played out in different ways depending on where the player lands and which weapons he or she obtains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Medal of Honor: Vanguard, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
