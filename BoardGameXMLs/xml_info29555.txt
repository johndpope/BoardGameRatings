			<description>Miss Spider's Board Game is a simple matching game based on the characters from David Kirk's &amp;quot;Miss Spider&amp;quot; children's books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules includes instructions for three different matching games. In all games, a set of 25 colored discs are placed on the board. The backs of the discs show either guests and items Miss Spider needs for her tea party, a picture of Miss Spider herself, simple instructions, or nothing at all. There are also four strips showing four guests or items needed for the party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first game is a cooperative matching game in which all players try to match all the items on all four strips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second game is a simple &amp;quot;concentration-style&amp;quot; memory game where players take turns trying to match a pair of pictures on the bottom of the disc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the third game, players each take one of the four strips and attempt to be the first to find all four items displayed on their strip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
