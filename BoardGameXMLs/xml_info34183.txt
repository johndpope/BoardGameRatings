			<description>Rules of play - from the back of the box, are as follows -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY SPACE 1999 - A game for 2 or more players&lt;br/&gt;Deal all the cards face down to the players. The dealer puts down any card in front of him and the next player has to put down a card with the same symbol (the symbols are stars, moons, chequers and planets) or the same picture. If he cannot go play passes to the next player. However, if he holds a switch card he can play that, and he may then switch play to any symbol he chooses. The next player must then play a card with the symbol he has called. The winner is the first player to put down all his cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
