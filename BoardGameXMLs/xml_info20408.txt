							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sam&#039;s Hooligan</name>
									
			<description>From the rulebook: &amp;quot;A dice game to please everyone; the crapshooter, the cardplayer...even ardent gamblers. Sam's Hooligan has the excitement of a crap game and the tension of poker, combined with a scoring system that changes the odds with each roll of the dice.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Sam's Hooligan is a dice game with terrific action and changing odds.  It's a challenging game developed during the 30's by a disreputable crapshooter from Chicago.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is another variation of the traditional game Yacht (like Yahtzee and Yum) but this uses 2-color card images on the dice, adds flushes as possible &amp;quot;hands&amp;quot;, lowers the value of a hand for each re-roll you use, and includes 2 jokers on the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
