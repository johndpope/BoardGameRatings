			<description>Vice: Project Doom, released in Japan as GUN-DEC​ (ガンデック), is a multi-genre action game developed by Aicom and published by Sammy for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991. It is a side-scrolling platform game similarly to the Ninja Gaiden series for the NES, with the addition of gun shooting and driving segments as well. The player takes control of a secret agent who must uncover a conspiracy involving a new kind of alien substance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the distant future, the B.E.D.A. Corporation, a company involved in the development of electronic equipment and military weapons, is actually a front operated by a race of alien beings who have been living on the Earth for centuries in secrecy. The aliens have developed a substance named &amp;quot;Gel&amp;quot;, which was initially intended to be used as food for their species, but also functions as an addictive substance to humans that results in terrible side-effects and is now being sold as an illegal drug within the underworld. The player takes the role of Detective Quinn Hart, a member of the Vice unit who is assigned to investigate the B.E.D.A. Corporation following the disappearance of his partner Reese during a previous case. During his mission, Hart is assisted by his lover and fellow Vice agent Christy, and Sophia, an acquaintance of the two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Vice: Project Doom,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
