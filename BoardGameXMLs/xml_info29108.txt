							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Johnny and the Toe-Sap Fungus</name>
									
			<description>Long ago on a small island lived a tribe with a problem.  For as long as they could remember each member of the tribe had been infected with the dreaded toe-sap fungus.  With every step taken, a small droplet of toe-sap would ooze from each toe.  This, of course, was a constant source of shame to the tribe members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then one day a young man named Johnny discovered two important facts that would change the island forever -- the toe-sap was actually quite delicious and each tribe member produced a different flavor.  Johnny was hailed as a hero and soon toe-sap became the island's number one export.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tribe members spent long days gathering toe-sap, however it soon became apparent that the tribal leaders could influence the toe-sap market, making some varieties more valuable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As members of the tribe, players take turns collecting varieties of toe-sap.  They can also offer cows to the tiny sea-going Cownivores in order to collect toe-sap more quickly.  At the end of the game, the players influence the tribal leaders using shells and their remaining cows to dictate the price of each variety of toe-sap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
