			<description>Space Fleet - Warp One is a tactical starship combat boardgame. The tactical level uses counters or miniatures to represent individual starships in combat. The playing area is a hex sheet that you supply. Players design starships on paper then take these designs into combat. Once in the tactical simulator the players take turns moving and firing their starships. Combat is resolved quickly and simply with two six sided dice. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download PDF at : Space Fleet - Warp One&lt;br/&gt;Rules available at: Space Fleet - Warp One&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple tactical space combat game, with a small set of ship design rules included.  Almost like a minimalist Starfire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
