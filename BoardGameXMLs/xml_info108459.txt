							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strat-O-Matic Baseball Express</name>
									
			<description>The Strat-o-matic line of games simulates sports games with dice and cards for the individual players.  The player cards have the odds of events that happen during the course of the game.  The dice are used to determine the outcomes of events according to odds on the cards of the players involved.  For example, in baseball, a plate appearance involves a pitcher and batter and the outcome determined by the dice can range from an out to a home run.  The game can be played head to head or solo.  Games can be simulated or even entire seasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 42 cards that represent various Major League Baseball players during the peak of their careers. Players must use their managing abilities to gain an edge in a game that uses cards to represent both pitcher and batter, charts to represent fielders, and dice to represent the bat and pitches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baseball express is a slimmed down version of Strat-o-matic Baseball (both in play and size).  This set includes 43 All Star player cards, 4 dice (3d6 and 1d20), 4 game markers, instructions, and playing tray.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
