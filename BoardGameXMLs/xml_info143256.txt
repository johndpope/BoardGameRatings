			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNLICENSED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game represents an unlicensed use of elements of the Star Wars franchise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Death Star Space Station, under the command of Darth Vader, is the most powerful weapon the universe has ever known. A frontal attack by any other craft would be absolute suicide. However, intelligence delivered to Republic headquarters by the androids R2D2 and C3PO gives a faint hope of a successful attack by a small 1- or 2-passenger X-wing fighter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a small unshielded exhaust port on the surface of the Death Star that leads directly to the main reactor. Since it is an emergency thermal port in case the reactor overheats, it could not be shielded. If you can slip your small fighter past the Death Star's defenses and make a direct hit on the thermal exhaust port with a torpedo, there is a chance the torpedo will penetrate the main reactor and start a chain reaction, destroying the Death Star. It is a slim chance, but it is the only one the Republic has. Obi-Wan Kenobi gave his life to get the message here; so he considered it very important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The X-wing fighter is a small 1- or 2-passenger rocket that is, quite frankly, obsolete. It is armed only with a laser cannon and 3 torpedoes. Use the laser cannon to fight off any imperial fighters, and save the torpedoes for the Death Star. The target acquisition radar can detect targets in excess of 100,000 km away but can only display targets within 20,000 km. Therefore, you will be warned of approaching targets on the right side of your control panel before they are displayed in the radar screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
