			<description>The Elder Scrolls Online: Thieves Guild is an official DLC game pack for The Elder Scrolls Online. This DLC game pack includes two brand-new dungeons, each with their own unique challenges and rewards: Scalecaller Peak and Fang Lair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Scalecaller Peak, the burial site of a long-dead Dragon Priest is now overrun with diseased cultists harboring an evil agenda: to unleash the deadliest plague Tamriel has ever known. You and your team must journey to Scalecaller Peak, battle your way through the cultists and their followers, and put an end to this threat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep within the belly of Fang Lair, an ancient Dwarven ruin, a master of necromancy works a dark ritual in an effort to reanimate the bones of a once-living dragon. It's up to you and your companions to enter the dungeon, face the necromancers, and stop the ritual before this undead monstrosity can be unleashed on Tamriel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These new dungeons pit you and your team against new and returning enemies, including plague-ridden ogres, powerful sorcerers and their undead creations, and the reanimated bones of an ancient dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both Scalecaller Peak and Fang Lair will be available in normal and veteran modes, and they will include a veteran Hard Mode for the final boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
