			<description>Last Ranker​ (ラストランカー, Rasuto Rankā) is a role-playing game from imageepoch and Capcom that was released in Japan on July 15, 2010 for the PlayStation Portable. In Last Ranker warriors are ranked by how they perform in battle by a combat organization called Bazalta, which is headquartered in the city of Ghandoar. The protagonist of the game is a man named Zig who is part of a group of wanderers called Cantalera and decides to leave his group and head to Ghandoar, join Bazalta, and make his way to the top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In combat the player will only use Zig to fight in real-time, however they will not have direct control over Zig's movement. As attacks are chosen from the menu they use up SP and the gauge takes a few seconds to recharge when depleted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Last Ranker&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
