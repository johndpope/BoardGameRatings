							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Ready for Battle Game</name>
									
			<description>This game is a simplistic &amp;quot;spin-and-move&amp;quot; for kids based on Eastman and Laird's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic/tv/movie franchise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Production quality for the TMNT Ready for Battle game ranges from good (quality of the illustrations and a good, functional spinner) to poor (lots of poor die-cutting on the cheap-feeling cardboard pieces, and an even cheaper-feeling box).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to collect two each of pizza and weapons tokens, and then reach the finish space to get your designated &amp;quot;bad guy&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts as either Michaelangelo, Donatello, Raphael or Leonardo, and chooses the matching Battle Card.  Each Battle Card has two spaces each for pizza and weapons tokens, and a designated bad guy.  The bad guys actually are just decoration, as they all wait together in the &amp;quot;hideout&amp;quot;, which is part of the finish space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play proceeds with each player spinning the spinner, advancing to the next space on single, linear path from start to finish that has the same color as the one just spun, and collecting either the pizza or weapon token found there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The linear path is on a a nicely illustrated 15&amp;quot; x 15&amp;quot; board, with clearly labeled &amp;quot;Start&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Finish&amp;quot; spaces.  There are 12 pizza spaces, 11 weapons spaces and two special &amp;quot;Splinter&amp;quot; spaces (Splinter is the benevolent rat master from the comics/tv/movies.)  The Splinter spaces allow for a &amp;quot;redo&amp;quot; if a player has yet to collect the needed tokens before advancing to the finish space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In summary, a very, very simplistic roll-and-move style game for die-hard fans of the game.  The box states &amp;quot;4 and up&amp;quot;, but I imagine beyond 6 years a child would bore of the gameplay itself.  Nice theme presentation, but very little game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
