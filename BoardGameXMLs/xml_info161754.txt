							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tomb of the Damned Pharaoh</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those that slumber must eventually wake&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A colleague of yours sent you a disturbing note, which ended with the words:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;There is no safety for me while I reside beneath the shadow of the pyramids. I pray that you soon meet me in person after receiving this letter. Otherwise you shall not see me again.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You rushed to his dig in the middle of the Egyptian desert, but you find his camp ransacked and empty. Clutching to the hope that survivors may have fled into the opened tomb nearby, you enter with your band only to become trapped by sandstorms. But you hear sounds coming from somewhere within the dark corridors of men long dead. Is it your colleague or something far worse? And can you eventually find your way back to the Entry Slab, slide it open with the Crowbar, and escape the Tomb of the Damned Pharaoh into Calm Skies once more?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a 10 Die Survival Game, the players run through as a group, trying to survive the cards that remove their pile of Dice. If you are out of Dice, you are dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion introduces new card types - Anxiety and Tool cards - while adding more abilities that pit players against each other in the hopes that they will be the ones to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game for 1 or more players. You need 10 six-sided dice per player to play, or if 10 dice per player is too much, you will need some way to track the dice that they have remaining &amp;ndash; a pad of paper, some counters, etc. &amp;ndash; and 10 dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also requires a deck of 10 Die Survival cards. This deck should normally be comprised of 3 Salvation cards, and at least half of the total deck should have Encounters (see below). A standard size for a deck is 30 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player should begin the game with 10 six-sided dice; this represents their life/sanity/etc &amp;ndash; when you have 0 dice remaining, you are out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all 3 Salvation cards are found, then the game ends. All players that still have dice remaining can pat themselves on the back, while all dead players shouldn't feel too bad for dying to the difficult circumstances that they were thrust into.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
