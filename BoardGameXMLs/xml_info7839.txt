							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Danger Island</name>
									
			<description>A Clue like game where players take on the role of explorers trying to find Blackbeard's treasure on Danger Island.  The game uses three pieces of information that you need to deduce to find the treasure; the nearest landmark, the direction from that landmark, and the # of paces from that landmark. To hinder the players, killer apes inhabit the island.  The game also makes use of an card driven event system to add flavor.  The Games Journal has a brief tidbit of the game where it is described as follows; &amp;quot;DANGER ISLAND is from a one-shot publisher which is Clue crossed with Talisman (and not very well, frankly.) &amp;quot;.  &lt;br/&gt;(&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/DeductionGames.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/DeductionGames.shtml&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
