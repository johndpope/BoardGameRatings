			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inertie (inertia) is a French action-adventure game. The player's task is to pilot a ship through subterranean caverns to rescue stranded astronauts. The ship has a lot of inertia and require skillful piloting in order to land without crashing on the landing platforms. Once landed near an astronaut, the player takes control of the pilot and must bring him back on board before running out of oxygen. An added twist is that some astronauts are spies, and if they are picked up, the game inverts the controls. There are computers spread throughout the levels that give the names of real astronauts and spies. Once a level is cleared, the game gives a code to access the next level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inertie was programmed by Christophe Le Bouil, with graphics by Patrick Daher and sounds and music by Xavier Talgorn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
