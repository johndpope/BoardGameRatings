							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Penguin Puzzle</name>
									
			<description>Penguin Puzzle is a lovingly crafted puzzle game with great gameplay and a unique look and sound. The game is set on the North Pole, where a freezing blizzard has caused lots of creatures to be frozen in ice cubes. Your goal is to release them. With a cast of penguins, polar bears, seals, birds, Eskimos and others, there's never a dull moment. Penguin Puzzle is one of those games that are easy to pick up, but hard to put down. It's got excellent graphics, sound and music. The bonus levels are lots of fun, they're like an extra game within the game! Everyone has a different playing style, so Penguin Puzzle lets you play a relaxed puzzle game without pressure, or a challenging brain-cruncher - or something in-between.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
