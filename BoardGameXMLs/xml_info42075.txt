			<description>Setup:&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes two of the tumbler tiles and places them one at a time on the table. The tiles may be oriented any way but they must be placed next to each other in a horizontal line. (My example is vertical, but it works the same)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sides that touch are considered to be locked. The players start with a tile on the farthest left. They each takes turns dropping their dice on the tile from no less than two inches up. Any dice that fall or roll more than half off the tile are removed and are not re-rolled. Leave all dice on the tile until both players have finished rolling as they can be knocked off as more dice are rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now compare the results to the locked side (the side touching the next time), there are three numbers on this side. The player that has the most dice still on the tile with these numbers has successfully 'picked that tumbler' and takes the tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the case of a tie, both players begin rolling one die at a time, the first player to roll one of the locked side numbers wins the tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning the Game:&lt;br/&gt;First player to win three tiles wins. If both players win two tiles each player takes one of their tiles and 'locks' it to the other players on a side of their choice. Players roll one die at a time, dice that roll of the tile are not counted. The first player to roll all three numbers on the 'locked' side of their tile wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the 4 Tile Contest:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/383408&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/383408&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freely available: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3166518#3166518&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3166518#3166518&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
