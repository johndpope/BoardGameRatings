							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Blind Path</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though called by some a monastic order, the Blind Path is really a simple-yet-deep philosophy teaching its followers to see beyond the visible, beyond the obvious, in order to experience a new and transcendental reality. Developed by a woman who, through the machinations of fate, found herself in need of a new &amp;quot;vision&amp;quot; in life, the Blind Path hides within its ideals secrets that allow the blind to go beyond their physical limitations and become one of the Unsighted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blind Path comes with the Campaign Planner's Secret Society/Organization forms already filled for this organization, giving you all the important facts in one handy sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blind Path details a drop-in organization for your d20 Fantasy game, complete with history, tenets, ways of joining, iconic and generic NPCs. It also includes a new prestige class, the Unsighted, which allows blind characters a chance to discover a whole new range of abilities, as well as a new feat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
