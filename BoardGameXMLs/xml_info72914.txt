							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">For Whom The Bridge Tolls</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encounter Level 6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This increasingly popular series of fantasy encounters has been created to be dropped into an existing campaign or played as a single evening's entertainment. Critical Hits provide DM and player alike with unusual and interesting, sometimes comical but always memorable encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In For Whom the Bridge Tolls, the characters' long trek through the wilderness is broken by a wide, fast-flowing river of lava. The only way across is an ingenious enchanted bridge, designed by the renowned inventor mage Azar Gideon. Created with the sole purpose of extracting coinage from travelers, the bridge is a strange and interesting diversion for any party and is a test of character as much as of prowess or might. A series of tricky traps and protective charms protects the bridge and extorts the toll fee from travelers crossing the lethal stream. Will the party be able to make it across the impasse with the shirts on their backs, or will Gideon's magical toll bridge take them for every penny?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
