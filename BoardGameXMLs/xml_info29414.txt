			<description>One of many local variations on the boardgame Monopoly, Sonopoly is based on Sonoma County, California.  Produced by Santa Rosa-based Trinity Productions in 1985, it was assembled by Rapid Mounting and Finishing Co. of Burlingame, California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics, most rules, board, and themes are mostly the same as Monopoly, but there are some significant differences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Board and Properties: The properties are all businesses in Sonoma County; there are no railroads or utilities; there are no jail, free-parking, or go-to-jail spaces; there are chance cards, but no community chest or equivalent; all four corners are properties which players can buy and on which they must pay rent; the purchase prices and rent are all different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules: There are coloured monopolies essentially the same as in Monopoly, but in addition, the four corners together make up one monopoly just like properties of one colour.  Players build &amp;quot;investments&amp;quot; instead of houses and can build up to 2 on each property.  The few non-coloured properties not at the corners are stand-alone properties on which one can build an investment without owning any other properties.  Finally, players collect $2,000 not for passing &amp;quot;go&amp;quot; but for passing the West America Bank space (at the location of the go-to-jail space in Monopoly).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces:  Money is in demoninations of $20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 5000.  Each amount has a different business and picture on it.  The player pieces are coloured plastic pawns. The investment pieces are not houses and hotels, but coloured wooden cylinders called &amp;quot;barrels&amp;quot; in the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
