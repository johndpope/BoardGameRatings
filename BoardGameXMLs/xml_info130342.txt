							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">From Log Cabin To White House</name>
									
			<description>Each player takes one piece, and puts it on the Log Cabin. At the beginning of the game each player must spin a one to advance to the first square. All plays are made in turn, moving the number of squares spun with the dial. Each square represents an office, and a progress to the White House. If a player stops on a square indicating a promotion or a setback, the player moves forward or backward to the square named. If sent to the Log Cabin, the player must begin over again. If sent to Court the player removes his or her piece to the Jury corner, and spins in turn the Jury dial to get the verdict of the Jury. The player must abide by this verdict, doing as the dial directs. The player first reaching the White House at the centre, moving there exactly for his or her spin, will be President, and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
