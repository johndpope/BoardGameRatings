			<description>Card game published by a German private health care company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal out all the cards. You must play a card to the middle of the table if you can. A legal card to play is any card to a sport if that sport has never been played before. Or a legal play is to play the next card to a card already on the table but the card played must be the number above the sport card you want to play or the one under:&lt;br/&gt;For example:&lt;br/&gt;Let us say that on the table is No. 4 Watersport. A legal play to this card would be the Watersport card numbered 5 or 3. If one of these is played, the next player could play a Watersport card if he chose, provided it was numbered one below or one up again. There is one Champion card which serves as a Joker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a card is played by any player, score the points for that player on the card (same as the number) and record this on a score-sheet. The cards rank from 1 to 6 and there are 5 different sports possible in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first to use all their cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
