							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Highland Clearances</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highland Clearances is a story roleplaying game about the displacement of family, the dissolution of culture, and the end to a way of life. Set in the Highlands of Scotland during the 18th and 19th centuries, the Highland Clearances were a series of evictions that lead to the wide-spread use of crofting. Characters are members of a family displaced by the changing economic climate, as the rural world is replaced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
