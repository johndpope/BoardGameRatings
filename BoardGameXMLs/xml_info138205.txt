			<description> &lt;br/&gt;CONTROL A FACTION&lt;br/&gt;DESTROY YOUR ENEMIES&lt;br/&gt;EMERGE VICTORIOUS&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt; Skirmish Tactics Apocalypse (STA) is a two player dice-based skirmish-level tabletop game set in a post-apocalyptic near future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two ways to play STA: skirmishes and campaigns.  Skirmishes are standalone games played for a single victory, with no lasting repercussions.  Campaigns are a series of skirmishes. In campaigns, players begin with a squad of recruit characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board for STA is built from modular tiles which are themed to represent different environments.  The default game board is a destroyed urban setting.  Players build the game board with nine modular tiles, each of which are divided into a 7x7 grid.  Characters use the grids for movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STA is a scenario driven game.  Each scenario typically has multiple objectives, and combat between factions is usually a secondary or tertiary objective.  Players win skirmishes in STA by gaining victory points through accomplishing these objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character in STA is represented by a token and has a corresponding character card.  During campaign play, characters improve their attributes and develop new abilities as they progress from Recruit to Veteran and then Elite status.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control characters from one of the game&amp;rsquo;s six factions.  The Combine and Marauders are part of the core game; the other four factions can be integrated seamlessly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Combine: The Combine is the military arm of the government that rules over much of what is left of the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Echo: Echo is a faction lead by a secretive cabal of humans with psychic powers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Erthen: Erthen are a biologically developed race formed from a mixture of human, mineral, and organic matter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Marauders: The Marauders are a loose-knit band of human rebels who specialize in guerrilla warfare. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Order of the New Dawn: The Order of the New Dawn are creatures from the strange subterranean realm known as the Basement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Soldiers of Light: The Soldiers of Light are humans who believe the fall of mankind was brought about due to a dependance on technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
