			<description>Vinarius - the &amp;quot;Sommelier&amp;quot; game, a board game for having fun with friends around the table, maybe with a glass of good wine. It is an invite to learn while playing and is targeted to everyone who has curiosity on the world of wine. For winning you don't need a specific competence. It is a game not based on trivia : it tries to activate the memory and the observation spirit. Composed by 110 illustrated cards containing useful information on the world of wine, it may be considered an invite to socialization, in a simple and solar way.&lt;br/&gt;Vinarius can be found in many wine shops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
