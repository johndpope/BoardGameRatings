			<description>This original game has you playing cards to move to the top of a building created about 1981.  Following handheld version is the one created 1986 also an Arcade game is the created right after.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is the peril that people seem to drop just about anything out there windows at random times. Each card allows you to move to a particular postion relative to where you currenty are (for example, a chocie of straight up two squares or up two squares and left or right one). However, there must be an open window that is not occupied by another player for it to be a legal move. Whenever a player passes certain checkpoints, the spinner is spun to see if anything falls from the windows. If you're hit on the head, you drop down to the next open window. There is also a gorilla that knocks you all the way down if you're unfortunate enough to be hit by him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First one to get to the top of the building and escape on the helicopter wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
