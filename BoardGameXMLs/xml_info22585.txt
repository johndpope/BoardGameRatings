			<description>In Starting Lineup Talking Baseball, one or two players take on the role(s) of Major League Baseball managers.  Each player tries to out manage his opponent using teams made of up of actual MLB players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On defense, the manager can choose the pitch type and location.  He can also choose to intentionally walk a player or to bring his infielders in to increase the chances of getting a runner out at home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On offense, the manager must choose the type of swing (bunt vs. power, for example).  He can also increase the chances for a hit if he can guess the location of the pitch.  The manager may also choose when to attempt a stolen base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both managers may, of course, make substitutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game came with All-Star Teams comprised of American League and National League players.  Additional cartridges that contained all 26 MLB teams (as of 1988) were available so that you could play a game between any two teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
