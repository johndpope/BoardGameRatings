			<description>Story &amp;ndash; There&amp;rsquo;s no I in EVL&lt;br/&gt;The world vanquished the very concept of evil along with evil itself long ago. Unfortunately, boredom took its place. If that gives cause for concern, fear not! A small ray of hope exists for the late forces of darkness. The Library of Evil has been rediscovered. As these massive underground ruins are excavated, newfound epic tales of good versus evil regularly send waves of excitement to droves of EVL* fans all across the world. The entire world is drowning in an EVL craze as it yearns for the eradication of boredom. Team EVL believes bringing evil back from the ancient past will do just that. If only they could find a way how. . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Social media has deemed the modern spelling of evil to be EVL in an effort to avoid the use of the selfish letter &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;. Any instance of selfishness, though not inherently evil, is viewed as a lesser good since evil forms of selfishness do not exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;'Evl' is an UN-cooperative card game where memory, deception, and deduction are key. Join your friends to cure boredom, and release evil back into the world. CAUTION: As you play, evil whispers destroy your once noble thoughts. You will seek the ruin of your friends and to rule the world through the absolute power of evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With only one action per turn (Play, Peek, Draw, &amp;hellip;), you must manipulate the state of a ritual circle in an effort to control the most information on the board. All cards are played face down, so carefully observe your opponent&amp;rsquo;s expressions and moves. When you believe the ritual to be in its correct state, declare it complete! If you are right, claim victory as you release evil back into the world! If not, take a seat while the remaining players continue to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evl is designed and illustrated by Ethan Weber. Evl is for 1-5 players and meant for multiple short play sessions at 10-40 minutes each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
