			<description>Soccer: The Board Game is a fast-paced 2-player sports board game that captures the thrill and excitement of soccer.  You, the Coach, can lead your team to victory by using real soccer practice and strategies that give your team more chances to score. This board game is pure competitive soccer fun.  Challenge someone to a friendly match or start a tournament and take your team to the top!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, each player controls opposing teams.  Movement is determined by rolling a die and moving the plans and ball a total number of spaces as determined by the die roll, all within 30 seconds.  When a player can attempt a goal, the players determine if it is successful by having a roll off.  Penalties are resolved with cards.  The game has an included timer so the turns can be kept to 30 seconds and the game to 30 minutes overall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
