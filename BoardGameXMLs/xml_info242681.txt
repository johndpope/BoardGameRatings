			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Garou Nature&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Garou are warriors of Gaia. Part human, part wolf, and part spirit they look like what humans think of as werewolves but are so much more. Though most come into the world as humans or wolves, that state does not last. Wolf-born gain a spark of human intelligence after their Change, while those born to humans must cope with the instincts of a hunter, and the burning need to be part of a pack. Those poor wretches born to two werewolves grow up never knowing any different, and that leaves them with a unique outlook on the world. Beyond their fluid bodies and warrior&amp;rsquo;s minds, each Garou has the blessings of the spirit world that empowers their fight for Gaia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red in Tooth and Claw&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Changing Ways is an in-depth look at what it means to be a werewolf, both on a personal level and as part of a pack. It digs deep into what it feels like to have bones re-knit after breaking, the range of senses available across all forms, and the sudden heady rush of the Gifts and Rites bestowed by spirits. It also provides a look at what life is like for lupus and metis werewolves, characters who have had experiences alien to any person. It shows the many ways that werewolves organize in packs, and how those packs are designed as groups of warriors, rather than aligned to the behavior of wolves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Changing Ways contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A detailed look at what it means to grow up as a lupus or metis werewolf, and how that colors a character&amp;rsquo;s perspective.&lt;br/&gt;    More information on what it feels like to be a werewolf, a creature that changes in both body and mind.&lt;br/&gt;    Frameworks and organizations for packs, along with new tactics and systems for forging the pack as part of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
