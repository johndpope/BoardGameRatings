			<description>&amp;ldquo;Millennium &amp;ndash; the millennium game&amp;rdquo; (as it would be literally - and rather silly - translated into English) is a memory game with a twist meets a historical trivia game. The game board shows an event, an important person or anything characteristic for each decade from 10 to 2000 (with the exception of 500, 1000 and 1500) represented in nice comic art as well as text and arranged in a huge spiral covering almost the complete board.&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, the players cover 10 of the decades one by one with cardboard disks numbered from 1 to 10, while reading out the year and the accompanying text. E.g. &amp;ldquo;10 Emperor Augustus&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;1060 William the Conqueror&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;1190 The third Crusade&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;1770 The USA&amp;rdquo;. &lt;br/&gt;Each player then gets ten transparent plastic chips. The goal of the game is to get rid of these chips by correctly remembering the events etc. under the numbered cardboard disks. In each turn, initially the player rolls a d12. Then he has to repeat the decade and the text under the corresponding disk. Only if he succeeds, he may return one chip to the box and replace the disk on a new decade; in any case, the next player gets to roll the die. The 11 and 12 on the die have special functions:&lt;br/&gt;When rolling 11, the player may place one of his chips on a cardboard disk of his choice. The next player who rolls the corresponding number has to take this chip before trying to remember what is underneath.&lt;br/&gt;When rolling 12, the player asks the player with the most chips left to remember what is under a disk of his choice. If the other player succeeds, he may place one of his chips on the disk and replace the disk, otherwise, the first player has to solve the task. If he does not succeed either, the player with the most chips may give him one of his chips.&lt;br/&gt;Apart from the material described, Millennium contains a small almanac (30 pg.) with a short description of each decades event, person etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
