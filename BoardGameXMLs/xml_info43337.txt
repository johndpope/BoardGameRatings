			<description>BIG FIVE CAPTURE - THE ULTIMATE AFRICAN ADVENTURE !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game involving five animals which rank among the most important and internationally recognized on our planet today. These animals, the Lion, Leopard, Elephant, Rhino and Buffalo have become well known throughout the world as the &amp;ldquo;Big Five&amp;rdquo; and are prized animals to spot when visiting a Game Reserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your aim is to go on Safari and capture the Big Five to place them in your Game Reserve so that you can help conserve them for future generations and show them to the rest of the world. The first player to fully stock their Game Reserve is the Winner... But beware, to successfully tackle an African Safari, you need to be well prepared with the necessary Resources. You will need to negotiate the Safari Hazards, know when to call for a Game Auction and how much to bid. Pit your skills against your fellow players and strategise your game &amp;ndash; both skill and luck play a part! And each game works out differently!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
