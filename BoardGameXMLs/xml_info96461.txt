			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a badass Barbarian, you heft your mighty battle ax and cut down your enemies while trying to contain your rage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a badass Noble, you use your social position to scheme your way to power while trying to overcome your madness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a badass Sorcerer, you use blood to summon vile demons to do your bidding while trying to hide your deformity and maintain control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Krone is a sword and sorcery game centered on a corrupt and decaying city in the middle of a poisonous swampland. Players have a choice of three classes - a raging Barbarian, scheming Noble, or corrupt Sorcerer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Krone provides just enough of a setting to run with and a very simple system that focuses on speed of play and encouraging slaughter and mayhem. This is a perfect game to run on short notice when you don't have enough players show up for your regular session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is available as a free download from 1km1kt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
