The Zika virus is also caused by the same transmitter of dengue and Chikungunya, which is the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Mosquito combat this is an efficient way to end these diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Placing the Zica Virus in the game is a good way to put on the table an issue of great importance to all! For those who played Todos contra a Dengue there are few changes to the rules as described in the basic game. Only a disease that is Zica is added. The Zica virus comes into play only in one city and different from the other cities where there is a Dice D6 scroll to determine the number of people with disease, this town with Zica virus already has 12 people diseases that need to be addressed.
