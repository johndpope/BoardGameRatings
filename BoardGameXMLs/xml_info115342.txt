							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Scribe</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scribes are keepers of ancient knowledge and arcane secrets. They use their magic as a tool to bolster their peers with supportive glyphs while keeping enemies at bay with baleful ones. Scribes may have been trained in ivory towers, but on the battlefield they can be devastatingly effective allies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your ability to cast these runes can come from a variety of backgrounds and sources. You could be a pious cleric of a monastery just now exploring the world, an educated noble using his knowledge for his subjects&amp;rsquo; benefit, an explorer who&amp;rsquo;s stumbled across ancient words of power, or a chieftain who has inherited the arcane symbols passed down through his tribe. Regardless of how you learned them, your mastery has made you a force to be reckoned with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You wave your wand not to cast, but to write. You speak words not of prayer, but of potency. For you, knowledge truly is power, and you are eager to teach your enemies just how powerful it can be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A playtest of the The Scribe class covering the heroic tier (levels 1-10).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
