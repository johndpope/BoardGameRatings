							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Gunner</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A full new class for The Frontier RPG!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wars are not won by big armies, they're won by big guns. And those guns must be handled by people with the training, the skill and the courage to make the most out of them in the battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gunner is an expert in using heavy weapons to beat the opposition into submission. His abilities don't just focus on consistent damage output, but also on pinning the enemy down with autofire and making effective use of heavy armor to protect himself from retribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is an array of heavy weapons to arm your Gunner with, such as frag cannons, miniguns and sabot cannons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
