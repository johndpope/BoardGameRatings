							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">18 giugno 1815: Waterloo</name>
									
			<description>The game is a hex and counter simulation of the battle of Waterloo, for two opponents and two possible difficulty levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The counters represent all the units that actually took part into the battle. A unit is normally at regimental level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game length is between 10 and 12 turns. Each turn corresponds to 60 minutes of real time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory is calculated according to points gained for fulfilled objectives minus points lost following the elimination of the gamer's own units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
