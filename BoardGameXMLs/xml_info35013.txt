							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Missile Command</name>
									
			<description>Each player secretly chooses 24 &amp;ldquo;Missiles&amp;rdquo; (pyramids), eight of each size, and combines them into a Battery of eight &amp;ldquo;Missile Silos&amp;rdquo; (stacks of pyramids).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player also secretly conceals their President and Vice President tokens under one or two of the Missile Silos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns launching one Missile (removing one pyramid from one stack) at one specific exposed Missile in an enemy Battery. Both pyramids are discarded exposing whatever is underneath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, the Silo protecting the President is exhausted and the President herself is exposed. Once exposed, the President can be struck by an enemy Missile, eliminating the owning player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until only one President remains (one player winner) &amp;ndash; OR &amp;ndash; all remaining Presidents are exposed at the same time (a draw).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Icehouse Pieces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Design Competitions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Ice Game Design Competition - Entry in 1st Competition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
