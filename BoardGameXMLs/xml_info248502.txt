			<description>Sussed! is a personality quiz game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your aim is to score the most points by answering questions about other players' likes and dislikes, reactions to things, wishes and opinions. To start, all you need is something for each player to write with. It only takes a few minutes to learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take it in turns to read a question on their card and the three possible answers out loud. They then secretly choose the answer that best suits them and other players attempt to guess which they chose for points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the most points after everyone has asked all 5 questions on their cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
