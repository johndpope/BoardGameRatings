			<description>Subtitle: A Sorcerous M&amp;amp;M Superlink Supplement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The M&amp;amp;M rulebook describes only one version of magic: Sorcery. This is an exceptionally potent power, both flexible and useful. It reflects most comic-book magic relatively well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, most magic systems portrayed in fantasy novels and in folklore (or modern religions) are quite different from comic-book magic. They are not always fast, not always reliable, and typically have a lot more &amp;quot;flavor&amp;quot; to them. Sorcery might be a great power, but it&amp;rsquo;s a little bland. What we hoped to do here is make magic a little more... well, a little more magical and mystical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To this end, we&amp;rsquo;ve created four new systems of magic suitable for use in M&amp;amp;M games which concentrate more on fantasy settings, or for when you just want a different take on a sorcerous character. These magic systems can be used on their own, or as inspiration for how to alter your own game&amp;rsquo;s Sorcery power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also a few new extras and flaws which were created in the process of making these magic powers; we think of them as &amp;quot;tools to make the tools.&amp;quot; Perhaps you might find a use for these on other powers as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
