							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conclave</name>
									
			<description>Conclave&amp;reg; is a cooperative browser-based RPG that captures the spirit of tabletop gaming with friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Play with your friends. And we mean play - not just send each other gifts! Work together to defeat foes in combat and determine the course of the story.&lt;br/&gt;     Play at your own pace. Play in realtime, or take a turn anytime it's convenient: at lunch, during a break, whenever.&lt;br/&gt;     Play on any browser. Are you online? Good: you're playing Conclave. Desktop, laptop, iPhone, iPad, Android, and so on. Nothing to download either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cooperative Tactical Combat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Fight alongside your friends on the field of battle as you work together to reverse the Age of Retreat. Plan your tactics and bring your character's unique martial and magical abilities to bear. Persevere in your quests, and the Conclave may yet endure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Party Decisions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Face critical decisions and trials as you adventure. Your characters' skills and traits determine the choices available to you; it's then up to your party to vote on a course of action, for good or for ill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synchronous and Asynchronous Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Combat, voting, and chat update in realtime when you're online so that you can see other players' actions and their effects on the game. But you don't have to stay online: Conclave will notify you when there's new action to see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unique Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Create characters from an original set of races and archetypes. Customize your characters' skills and abilities as you level up. Increase your Renown to unlock more equipment options in the Vault of Arms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure in an Epic Fantasy World&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Choose from a variety of quests that reveal themselves as you adventure. You determine the course of your party's story - and the fate of the lands of the Conclave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
