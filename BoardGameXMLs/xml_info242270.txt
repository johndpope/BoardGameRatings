			<description>In Shoudo, two players face off across the battlefield of the Sengoku Jidai - the Japanese civil war. The players assume control of one of four great clans - Uesugi, Mori, Tokugawa, or Shimazu - and attempt to defeat their opponent to become the Shogun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shoudo is a terrain-based strategy game. The board, which consists of 40 cards, is shuffled and laid out in a random 5x8 configuration at the start of each game. Each player controls 3 armies which they may use to &amp;quot;burn&amp;quot; enemy lands and attack enemy armies and castles. The first player to destroy their opponent's Daimyo castle wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, players must engage in combat. When attacking an enemy army or castle, combat is fought over 3 rounds. Each round, both players roll a 6-sided combat die and add the strength of their unit and its terrain bonus - the higher roll wins the round, and the first player to win 2 rounds wins the combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special clan abilities, inspired by the traditional clans, affect gameplay, giving each clan a unique advantage. These abilities can give tactical advantage or greater sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
