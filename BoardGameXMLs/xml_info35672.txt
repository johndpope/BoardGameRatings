			<description>The object of each player is to obtain the remaining cards of the families of which he happens to hold a part.  When a player receives a card he must instantly say &amp;quot;Thank you&amp;quot; otherwise some one will immediately call &amp;quot;Pepper&amp;quot; and take all his cards.  The fun of the game consists in securing and completing the various families, and even more particularly in the constant capturing of cards by calling &amp;quot;Pepper&amp;quot; and in the efforts of those who have lost their cards to again get into the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pack is made up a number of Families, each family consisting of five cards:  the MAN, his WIFE, SON, DAUGHTER and a fifth card showing an ARTICLE indicating the family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, in Sir Peter's family the 5th card is a servant.  Thus:  The Sir Peter Peppercorn Family consists of Sir Peter, his wife, son, daughter and servant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 9 sets of families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
