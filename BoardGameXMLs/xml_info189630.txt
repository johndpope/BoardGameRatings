			<description>Description: In this print &amp;amp; play game, players become paratroopers under the command of General Stanisław &amp;bdquo;Sosab&amp;rdquo; Sosabowski. &amp;bdquo;Sosab&amp;rdquo; and his commandos participate in his operations: from creating the 1st Independent Parachute Brigade in Scotland, through participation in Operation Market-Garden, to the post-war period and efforts to raise awareness of the general&amp;rsquo;s achievements. Taking part in historical events appearing on cards, players shape their character and develop the four cardinal virtues: courage, justice, prudence, and temperance. The winner is the player who gains the most from the historical experiences on the cards and emerges from the turbulent times with the strongest character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to build the character of our paratrooper. Players take part in events which let them develop their virtues: courage, justice, prudence, and temperance (C, J, P, T). Players collect appropriate sets of events and earn points for them, moving their markers on their individual virtue tracks (C, J, P, T). It is important that none of your markers falls too far behind. At the end of the game, a player&amp;rsquo;s marker with the lowest value (the least developed character trait) is that player&amp;rsquo;s score. The player with the best score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME COMPONENTS &lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; 1 game board&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; 1 paratrooper card&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; 52 event cards&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; 4 player boards, representing military service books&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; 20 coins or other markers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
