			<description>&amp;quot;International Cricket Captain 2009 is the 2009 edition of the International Cricket Captain series, and the 12th game in the series so far. It contains all current cricket players from first class cricket, Test cricket, List-A and One Day International teams, and can be played in a career mode indefinitely, with repeating domestic and international fixtures generated for each year, along with youth players continually added and other players retiring to enable an open-ended career as coach of a national or domestic side. There have been many improvements in the game from the previous instalment International Cricket Captain 2008. It was first released on 2 July as a download only from the Childish Things website, and the box version was released on 17 July 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Features&lt;br/&gt;-Coaching of the players before matches&lt;br/&gt;-The most accurate statistical database of world cricketers currently available in any video game&lt;br/&gt;-Updated online offering with brand new T20 game mode &lt;br/&gt;-New high resolution interface allows greater access to captaincy-crucial information and enhances your cricket viewing experience &lt;br/&gt;-Integrated field-setting editor to allow you to take even more charge as captain of your favourite county or country &lt;br/&gt;-Wider camera angle in highlights with improved shot selection and fielding &lt;br/&gt;-New game modes include: 2009 and historic Ashes series and the T20 World Cup &lt;br/&gt;-Greatly improved match screen with detailed graphics for more on-the-fly captaincy decisions &lt;br/&gt;-Improved AI and match engine realism for twenty over matches ensures higher scoring, more aggressive games &lt;br/&gt;-Log of training days allocated to a player to help you keep track of your development &lt;br/&gt;-Text information on player improvements from technique training &lt;br/&gt;-More statistics than ever, with the last 2 years now saved and available to view at any time &lt;br/&gt;-More accurate player names with common names used &lt;br/&gt;-Improved player ability generation ensures more longevity than any previous ICC game &lt;br/&gt;-Improved team selection, including the AI making more use of spinners &lt;br/&gt;-Long term test and ODI AI picks improved &lt;br/&gt;-AI bidding improvement to create more balanced teams and more competition for top players &lt;br/&gt;-Ability to declare during intervals &lt;br/&gt;-AI for close finishes and twenty over matches improved for more nail-biters &lt;br/&gt;-Batting aggression realism improved, to reflect real matches &lt;br/&gt;-Fielding engine enhanced to give greater accuracy and boost highlights watching &lt;br/&gt;-New in-game tips to help you master the game &lt;br/&gt;-Auto-simulation removes the need for clicking next over sit back and relax as the cricket unfolds in front of your eye. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cricket_Captain_09,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
