							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">London Blitz</name>
									
			<description>From the package of the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During World War II, German bombs turned daily existence in London into a nightmare. Hoping to undermine the strong spirit of the British, every night the Germans dropped bombs on the citizens of London. Mast bombs exploded on impact, but some would sit minutes, hours, or days before detonating. It was up to the British Army Royal Engineers to find and defuse these unexploded bombs (UXBs). Although there were many types of UXBs, they all required sharp thinking, delicate treatment, and split-second timing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DUTY CALLS! You are drafted. You are now a Lance Corporal in the Royal Engineers and are tasked to keep your sector of London free of bombs. There are several types of bombs, each requiring special skills which you had better learn. Can you protect your sector of London from the UXBs and live to tell your grandchildren about it? Excellent performance will be rewarded by promotions, but damaged property may get you 'busted.' There are three ways for you to get out of this nasty business:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Be removed from the service for incompetence (busted below Lance Corporal).&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Receive a posthumously awarded Victoria Cross, or&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Be promoted to the rank of Captain where you can turn your attention to administrative details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;London Blitz is a video game for those who want something other than another shoot'em up, dot chaser or frog and monkey game. You will be challenged to remember, deduce, weigh consequences and plan strategies while maneuvering throughnthe streets of London and dedicately defusing bombs. London Blitz is a &amp;quot;real time&amp;quot; video game with the flavor of a microcomputer video game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
