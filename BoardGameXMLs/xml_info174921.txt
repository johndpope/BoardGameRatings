			<description>Todos los Hombres del Reino (All the Kingdom's Men) is a Decktet playable game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players must ride around all the kingdom's regions.&lt;br/&gt;The player who gains the favor of all the Lords wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is playable with Decktet but it has been redesigned for an easier game experience. It  adds four new Decktet cards for an advanced game. You will also need several tokens and the Decktet chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To gain the favor of the region Lords, player must pay resources according to their travel cost. Then the region cards are activated and executed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If no region can be activated, player must pass. Optionally, on his turn, player can ride, paying the cost of travel (one resource, with different types for each round).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To indicate that a region has been activated, it should be marked with a token; when a player has placed all his tokens in all the regions, he has won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
