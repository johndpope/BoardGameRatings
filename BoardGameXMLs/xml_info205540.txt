							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mouse in the House</name>
									
			<description>Mouse in the House is a fun and simple game of hide 'n seek.&lt;br/&gt;Players begin by giving the house a SHAKE. The mystery mouse will run and hide in a room inside the house. The excitement builds as players take turns looking for the mystery mouse. LOOK OUT! There he goes! Did you see him run across the room? When you do find him, he'll SQUEEEK!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shake up the box to hide the mouse! Then the first player spins the spinner and counts out that many rooms. The last room the player counts, they get to check for a mouse. Use the cat to poke inside the hole in that room and if you hear a squeak, you found the mouse! You win! Otherwise play continues to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
