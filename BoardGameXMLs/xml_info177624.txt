			<description>Reclaim Neverland is a strategy game that takes place in Peter Pan's Neverland that is under siege by four pirate captains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reclaim Neverland is unlike other deckbuilding games because of the combination of PvP elements and a limitation to the size of each players built deck. Similar to its predecessor, Reclaim Oz, It is a unique tabletop experience that has the play differently than any other games in the same genre. We have added items to the game as well, these will work as multipliers and bonuses for specific characters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in Neverland, home to famous characters such as Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, and Tiger Lily, but at a time when a new band of pirates, including Captain James Hook, are mounting a siege on the inhabitants. All the great Heroes of Neverland have disappeared, and four Pirates from the Mainland have taken over. While J. M. Barrie may have written a much happier world, this is still the same place, with all the characters and places you know and love&amp;mdash;but in a time of great terror. The game has several animals, beasts, and mythos from the original book Peter and Wendy including characters from Little White Bird&amp;mdash;it is your task to get the World back to the way it once was, with the characters you collect along the way. If you are able to compile the best deck filling each of the categories (HERO, BRAVE, LOST), you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
