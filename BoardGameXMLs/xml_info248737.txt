							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pacific Rim: Extinction</name>
									
			<description>Pacific Rim: Extinction is a scenario driven, tabletop miniatures strategy game of city-wide destruction and chaos of epic proportions. With fantastically detailed and painted 75mm scale miniatures of the iconic Jaegers &amp;ndash; mechanical guardians of humanity &amp;ndash; and Kaiju &amp;ndash; monsters the size of mountains sent from beyond our world &amp;ndash; it captures the spectacular conflict of the Pacific Rim universe and places it in the palm of your hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will be able to jump right into the action as either the PPDC Jaegers or the Kaiju, either in a quick play match of intense combat, or a more constructed battle with both Jaegers and Kaiju using all their skills and abilities to achieve an objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is different depending on which side you choose to fight with. As a Kaiju player, you&amp;rsquo;ll uncover a secret objective at the start of the game. To win, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to meet this objective, ideally without revealing what it is to the Jaeger player too early. As a Jaeger player, your goal is to fulfill the PPDC&amp;rsquo;s task: the protection of humanity. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to defend cities as Kaiju trample them, and take down the immense invaders&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jaegers and Kaiju each have their own abilities and customisation options. Using the 'Jaeger Conn-Pod&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Upgrades&amp;rsquo; can be applied to improve the machine&amp;rsquo;s weapons or other capabilities, while each 'Kaiju Signature&amp;rsquo; can be altered with &amp;lsquo;Mutations&amp;rsquo;, making the monsters even more dangerous and unpredictable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a game round, players control either Jaegers or Kaiju on their turn by playing &amp;lsquo;Action Cards&amp;rsquo;. These represent all-out attacks, cunning tricks, solid defences, secret weapons, and everything else the machines and monsters can do!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Jaegers or Kaiju take damage, the player who dealt the damage takes an action card at random from their opponent and reads the Damage section of the card to find out what happens. There's a chance that a critical part of Jaeger machinery, or Kaiju biology, will be struck with massive consequences. The Action Card that was drawn as Damage is then discarded, and cannot be used for the rest of the game. In this way, dealing damage to an enemy not only brings them closer to destruction but can also render weapons or abilities useless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a Jaeger or Kaiju has taken Damage equal to their Structure Points total, they are destroyed! If either the Jaegers or Kaiju are all destroyed, the surviving side will have claimed victory, but winning isn't always that simple. If the Kaiju meet their objective before they are all killed, they win the battle and the PPDC will be forced to retreat. Every Scenario and Objective Card will change the way the battle must be fought and won, often drastically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using these tools, the Jaeger and Kaiju must outwit, outmatch, and overcome their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
