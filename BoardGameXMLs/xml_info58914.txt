							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slaine: RuneQuest</name>
									
			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tir Nan Og &amp;ndash; The Land of the Young &amp;ndash; is a place of myth and legend, where the warring tribes of Celts fight one another constantly, except when joining forces to combat invaders. It is here that Slaine mac Roth built his legend in the pages of the comic 2000AD and now you can also adventure in his world, with the new RuneQuest rules system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this new RuneQuest setting your character can learn many new skills unique to the world of Slaine (such as the Salmon Leap and Shield Biting), have immense warp spasms that can lay waste to his foes and use the power of the earth to cast magical spells to defeat your enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Creation &lt;br/&gt;Not only can your character come from Tir Nan Og, where each of the four tribes all have their own unique abilities, but he can also hail from Midgard or the Tribes of the Drune Lords, be a dwarf or even be descended from the inhabitants of drowned Atlantis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Skills and Legendary Abilities&lt;br/&gt;The varied tribes in Slaine all have access to their own unique skills. An Atlantean might have knowledge of the forbidden Serpent Staff weapons, a Midgard berserker may be able to pilot a sky chariot or a member of the Sessair tribe could throw the dreaded Gae Bolga whilst upon the ground by using his foot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic&lt;br/&gt;Most characters have access to minor spells to fight their foes but there are powerful sorcerers amongst the druids and Drune lords that can call upon far more power than these feeble enchantments, able to raise entire armies from the other planes or strike down their foes with a single gesture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bestiary&lt;br/&gt;The creatures unique to Slaine&amp;rsquo;s world are detailed within. With Shoggey Beasts, Titans, the Half-Dead and many more all presenting dangerous challenges to overcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Slaine you will have the opportunity to adventure in a world rich in Celtic myths battling terrible foes at the behest of your tribe and gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: The RuneQuest main rulebook is required to use Slaine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
