							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Art of Literary Conversation</name>
									
			<description>Now there's a new way for readers to discuss their passions, with the release of The Art of Conversation: Literary Edition, a new game from the makers of The Art of Conversation.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;Following the success of their original games, creators Louise Howland and Keith Lamb have adapted the concept to offer new angles and avenues to think, and talk, about books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;● TAOC&amp;reg; comes with 300 starter questions plus a 32-page guidebook that includes informative and comprehensive endnotes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;● Carefully developed and researched by the creators, with the assistance of well-respected literature teacher Leila Bryant, there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of scope to come up with your own questions. Like all TAOC editions, it&amp;rsquo;s not a quiz &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s not about who knows the most. It&amp;rsquo;s a communication tool that draws on your own experiences, thoughts and reactions to facilitate fascinating discussions.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;● Even reluctant readers will be drawn in! Readers of all stages and ages will find themselves being educated, all in the name of fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;● Ideal for book clubs, but can also be adapted to friends, family, workmates, students or even solitary readers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;● Covers all genres &amp;ndash; fiction, poetry, drama, biography, autobiography, science fiction, fantasy, crime, romance, historical writing - essentially, the whole bookshop!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
