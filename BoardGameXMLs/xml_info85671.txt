							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Himrak War Party</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the north of Kalendia, the Contested Lands veil the location of an orcish strike force standing by for their dark lord's commands.  Mogor the Retributor, Master War Chief of the orc nation, is responding to his most favorite calling &amp;ndash; revenge. The Himrak, Mogor's elite commando clans, are poised to carry out specific missions to cause anguish and chaos in West Wood. One such mission involves the search for and seizure of an orc traitor and the securing of an ancient orc outpost. The adventurers have the misfortune to intercept the Himrak War Party!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Himrak War Party is a fantasy role-playing adventure for the D20 System and requires the use of the Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition Player's Handbook, published by Wizards of the Coast. The adventure is designed for four 4th- to 6th -level characters, but can easily be modified to present a challenge to larger groups or more powerful/weaker characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure takes place in the farmlands north of the town of Weston, near the border of what is called the Contested Lands. Even though the geography and current events of the region play a part in this adventure, Himrak War Party can be easily  modified to fit a Game Master's personal requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
