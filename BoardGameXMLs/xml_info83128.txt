			<description>Naval Combat in the Napoleonic Age&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Naval warfare in the late eighteenth century was the apotheosis of the ships of the line and frigates. Throughout the eighteenth century, Britain, Spain and France were perfecting the designs of their vessels in order to achieve perfect sailing and gunnery platforms, combining good sailing characteristics with artillery power. During this time, three main types of vessels were highlighted:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The great ships of the line: They were called three-deckers, having three decks with a number of guns varying between 98 and 114, and were the true battleships of the era. Although their sailing and manoeuvering capacity was very limited, they could inflict and endure great punishment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The  vessels&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The base of Master &amp;amp; Commander are the  vessels, each of them has his own Ship Data Card.  The 100 vessels in M&amp;amp;C and the  have its own characteristics and differences between the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will find 30 English Ships, 30 Spanish Ships, 30 French Ships &amp;amp; 10 US Ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M&amp;amp;C (Master &amp;amp; Commander) can be played with miniatures of scale 1/1200 or  1/2400, or with the ship counters included in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
