			<description>BOOM! is a quick playing cooperative card game. You and a few friends are joining forces to disarm a bomb. Follow the set up rules and a numbered card will be designated as the bomb. The game is spent trying to learn what number that card is. &lt;br/&gt;Guess right and you disarm the bomb and win! Guess wrong... well you know. (BOOM!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn a player must choose one of three actions.  You can either draw a red card, draw a blue card, or guess the number of the card in the case.  The red cards are numbered 1-10 and one of these has secretly been designated as the &amp;quot;bomb.&amp;quot;  The game is spent revealing the red cards to narrow down the possibilities of the &amp;quot;bomb&amp;quot; card.  However, the numbered card that was removed has been replaced by a detonation card which has been shuffled in.  If this card is drawn from the red deck, the bomb goes off and the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The blue deck is made up of tools that help you navigate through the red deck without blowing up.  There are three special powers that come from the blue deck that let you look ahead and even disarm a detonation.  These are meant to help you reveal cards from the red deck because ultimately you can only win by revealing the red cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most games end in defeat, but you'll have a blast losing and want to play &amp;quot;just one more game&amp;quot; each time. When you and your team do win you feel like a million bucks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
