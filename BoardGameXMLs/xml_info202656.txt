			<description>English translation of item description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of young people are celebrating the grand opening of their new dot.com business, enjoying a peaceful vacation on board a sailing ship off the coast of Galicia. In search of supplies, they put into shore at the poor fishing town of Imboca, which appears to be deserted. The inhabitants, however, are not pleased with these annoying, noisy interlopers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are chased throughout the night by the strange inhabitants of the town, getting isolated from one another, kidnapped and imprisoned by Deep Ones that look like fish. Those that are able to escape quickly discover the dark secret of Imboca: they all worship Dagon, a monstrous god of the sea, to whom all the strangers are offered in a dark ritual...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Spanish language playset and is not available in English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
