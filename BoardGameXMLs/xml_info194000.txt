							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crashlands</name>
									
			<description>Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as Flux Dabes, a galactic delivery truck driver whose latest shipment gets interrupted by a megalomaniacal alien named &amp;quot;Hewgodooko&amp;quot; who tears her ship to pieces looking for useful tech. Crashlanded on Woanope, you must fight, tame, craft, quest, bossfight, and adventure your way to domination of all the things so that you and JuiceBox, your trusty sidekick/supervisor/robotic cargo palette, can send a message to the Bureau of Shipping and get those packages delivered!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Never again suffer from such existential crises as &amp;quot;Who am I?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;What am I doing here?&amp;quot; Crashlands is an adventure-crafting RPG driven by an epic story arc. From the moment gameplay begins you'll be thrust PELVIS-FIRST into an insane tale complete with a cast of personality-bloated characters. And what good would those characters be if they could do things for themselves? The Crashlands cast is totally helpless, thus providing you with endless questing opportunities!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Craft:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make tools and stations to break down the resources of the planet, discover new recipes in the process, and then BUILD ALL THE THINGS as you explore the world. Craftables get ever more elaborate and ridiculous, and include HARVEST BOMBS and LASER LEASHES!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And you know what crafting means: INVENTORY MANAGEMENT! OH YEAH! Easily everyone's favorite part of crafting games: spending countless hours organizing countless chests each filled with countless and mostly-useless items. WHAT FUN! If you were looking for yet another inventory management game... TOO BAD FOR YOU. There is NO inventory management in Crashlands. Inventory is handled contextually, you&amp;rsquo;ll have the things you want when you want them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sure, you can create armor and weaponry. DUH. Is there a crafting game that DOESN'T have that? But you can also ENHANCE your bad-assery with a host of gadgets that shoot fire, pull lightning from the aether, poison the crap out of everything, make you fly, and even MODIFY THE VERY FLOW OF SPACETIME.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How fast can you click your mouse/tap your finger to DEFEAT YOUR ENEMIES? Turns out it doesn't matter. It's about skill, not speed. Every creature in Crashlands has a unique attack combo you'll need to learn so that you can defeat it in battle. Do the ol&amp;rsquo; Crashlands DANCE OF DEATH to win battles and get those hard-won creature-parts for your crafting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tame:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only can you harvest crafting components from creatures, you can also find creature eggs. Take that egg back to your base, give it some time to incubate, and hatch your very own baby death machine. Use your new pet as arm candy, a sidekick in battle, or even as a crafting station!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crashlands consists of three infinitely(ish)-large, procedurally-generated biomes: the Savannah, Bawg, and Tundra. Each has its own cast of creatures, resources, and sentient beings for you to dominate. Okay, we lied about it being infinite. But seriously, Crashlands is really, really big. It would take decades to fully explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll obviously want an epic base to hold your massive collection of tamed beasts, crafting stations, and decorative pillows. AW YEAH, BASEBUILDING, where you slowly plod around, repeatedly open-and-close and dig through your enormous inventory, and ever-so-painstakingly assemble your masterpiece. OH WAIT. Base-building in Crashlands doesn&amp;rsquo;t suck. It's more like finger painting. Just pop open Build Mode, enjoy the soothing muzak, and INSTANTLY build your living quarters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, Crashlands is a crafting game with no inventory, a delightful build mode, an epic story, tameable pets, and a glorious combat system. IS THAT NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU!? Then cram some other features down your pipe hole!&lt;br/&gt;Make your own campaigns! We're building a BscotchID-powered modding tool that lets you create your own stories, use mutators to change the core mechanics of the game, and generally take what we've made and do horrible, wonderful things to it. The Creator already works, but will need some more testing before it goes public; we'll make it part of the first post-launch content patch.&lt;br/&gt;Platform agnosticism! Crashlands is just as fun on desktop as on mobile, and with the power of BscotchID you can move your saves between all your devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
