			<description>A simple, luck-based racing game for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of one island tile, 4 wooden turtles, 43 cards and one six-sided number die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The island tile is the target space that all the turtles (= wooden player pieces) want to reach as fast as possible. The cards, which show either one of several sea creatures or a smaller island, are used to create a path towards the target island tile. They are placed face down.&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling the die. The die roll determines how far the player may move his/her turtle. The card it lands on is turned over and depending on the type of card, the turtle is moved several spaces forwards or backwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player whose turtle is first to reach the main island wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
