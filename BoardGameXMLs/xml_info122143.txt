			<description>Pushee is a finite and drawless race game for two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is on a 5x5 board, with both players pushing in opposite directions. Each player has 5 pieces, numbered 1 through 5, which all start on their back row. It is suggested that the initial arrangement of pieces on the back row be selected randomly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns pushing pieces forwards. A 'push' consists of pushing a piece one space forward, onto the space immediately ahead or the ones onto the left or right of that. A player may either push just the 1 piece forwards, or push forwards a piece and pull back the piece one size less onto any of the three squares behind it. For example, they may push forwards the 4 and pull back the 3, but not push forwards the 4 and pull back the 2, or just push forwards the 4 without pulling anything back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A piece may not be pushed or pulled onto an occupied square, but a piece may push back a smaller opposing piece onto any of the three squares behind it. The person doing the pushing decides which square the opposing piece gets pushed onto.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces moved on a single turn are considered to move simultaneously, so for example it's possible for the 2 and 1 to swap positions if the 1 is in front of the 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to not have a legal move wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
