			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The column of energy began twisting uncontrollably, taking on a much darker hue of green and orange, shooting bolts of lightning in all directions.  It was then that the tonic must have affected my vision for I could see a tranformation of the fire column.  It must have been the tonic, I keep telling myself now, but there was something erupting from the column, snaking around men and pulling them, screaming, into the flames.  The thousands of mouths filled with teeth, surrounded by flailing tentacles. . . clouds of foul smoke in the air, choking and vile. . . no, it must have been a vision. . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A skirmish campaign for the ShadowSea miniatures game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
