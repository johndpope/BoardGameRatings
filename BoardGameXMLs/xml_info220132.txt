			<description>The main point of this game is to level up fast through game experience. In this fantasy-themed game, your Hero can go up 21 levels in a single game session!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players customize the powers of their heroes though rapid leveling up &amp;mdash; with every passing round, their heroes gain experience and grow in power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes use abilities, tons of items, skills, and spells against enemy units in order to defend the Realm and find the Ancient Artifact before it's too late!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will develop their own Hero during the game. .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     There are also extra cards for a Players VS Player version of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game:&lt;br/&gt;Players may recruit new characters, take control of mines (which produce gold and resources for the Cities), and most importantly, defeat the enemy units which occupy the map and Dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play:&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, your Hero (Attack) rolls one dice (or more in higher Level) AND additional black dice for each enemy in your Location. If the number of your Hero rolled dice matches the number of a Item, Skill, Spell Card that your Hero owns, he gets the effect of that Card.&lt;br/&gt;If the number of enemy rolled dice (black) matches the number on enemy Card, it deals damage to your Hero and gets the effect of own Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the most of the time your Hero rolled die will trigger other Players Cards. Yes, a lot of cards may be activated by other Players rolls and the owner of the Card gains the effect.&lt;br/&gt;After combat roll, your Hero may spend Experience points to get new Skill and Spell Cards, and spending gold for new Items (weapons, armors, items, scrolls).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;END OF THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;Lose: lost one of the main City OR lost all magic towers/mines OR  then Dungeon population reached the max.&lt;br/&gt;Win:  find the ancient artifact in the Dungeon AND clear the main 3 Cities from the enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dice (36x): &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     d4 x15,&lt;br/&gt;     d6 x10,&lt;br/&gt;     d8 x5,&lt;br/&gt;     d10 x3,&lt;br/&gt;     d12 x2,&lt;br/&gt;     d20&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards (486x)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Different Hero Cards: 16x&lt;br/&gt;     Different Item cards: 82x + enemy Units rewards 148x&lt;br/&gt;     Different Skill Cards: 156x&lt;br/&gt;     Different Spell Cards: 74x&lt;br/&gt;     Different Attachments Cards: 32x&lt;br/&gt;     Different Enemy Units Cards: 114x &lt;br/&gt;     Different Locations Cards: 54x&lt;br/&gt;     Different Event Cards: 46x&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large spell books Cards: 20x&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
