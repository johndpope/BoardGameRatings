			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Iridis Alpha is a action game for the commodore 64 by Jeff Minter. The game is close to a clone of Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (from 1982), but with a twist. In this side scrolling game there is two worlds seen at the same time, a mirror world (the opposite side of the planet) and the player can go between the two worlds trying to make progress. The players ship is also mirrored in the other world, and the ship explodes if the player doesn't switch between the two ships often. The aim is to destroy 20 waves of enemies on all parts of the planet. There are 5x2 planet-parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
