			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why be human?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why not choose the agility and feral grace of the wolf instead? The sensuality of the cat or the strength and ferocity of the warthog? The airborne agility of the hawk, or the impenetrable exoskeleton of the rhino beetle? Anthropomorphic heroes and villains are nothing new to gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons has included animal species from its inception: jackal-like gnolls, warthog faced orcs and ogres, a myraid of cat, spider and birdlike species, and shapeshifting druids that blend human and animal traits.&lt;br/&gt;Whitewolf's Werewolf the Apocalypse put a supernatural spin on eco-terrorism and furry/otherkin culture, pawning a whole generation of lycanthrope heroes and vigilantes. Sci-fi games from Wing Commander to Robotech include a cat-like race in homage to the Kzin, one of the most recognizable species in science fiction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamers of my generation grew up watching anthropomorphic great-cats battle evil on the Thundercats, watched the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles battle the Foot Clan every afternoon. From the camp of Biker Mice from Mars to the exactingly researched samurai epic, Usagi Yojimbo, gamers looking to play anthropomorphic heroes have a wide source of inspiration to draw from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Freeform Anthropomorphica system can quickly generate new alien species, demi-human or metahuman races for fantasy gaming, uplifted animals, genetically engineered mutants and animalistic superheroes, as well as magical beasts: magical crossbreeds, even unfortunates like Arachnae, who are cursed with animalistic form by the gods.or metahuman races for fantasy gaming, uplifted animals, genetically engineered mutants and animalistic superheroes, as well as magical beasts: magical crossbreeds, even unfortunates like Arachnae, who are cursed with animalistic form by the gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No matter their origin, Freeform Anthropomorphica is designed to produce a fully customizable anthropomorphic character suitable for use as a PC in both fantasy and future campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anthropomorphic characters are invariably bipedal, roughly human-scale and humanoid, and are intelligent enough to communicate with other characters and interact meaningfully with other players. The Freeform Anthropomorphica system produces characters without any Level Adjustment or ECL modifier, making them suitable for easy inclusion in most games. Build an animalistic humanoid superhuman inspired by reality's unparalleled bio-diversity or inspired by your favorite anthropomorphic heroes and villains. Quickly cobble together new player races or alien species before tonight's game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With over 43,300,000 possible combinations of Orders, Racial Traits and Templates, you can build exactly the creature you've always wanted to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creating an anthropomorphic character is simply an extended version of the character creation process already familiar to gamers. Rather than choosing a starting race, an anthropomorph's player selects an Order, or generic category of animals. An Anthropomorph's Order determines racial ability score modifiers, racial skill bonuses, and the creature's favored class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once an Order is chosen, the Anthropomorph begins to take shape. The creature can be further customized by adding a variety of advantages and drawbacks. Some advantages are more common in some Orders than others, and this diversity is reflected in the &amp;quot;Favored Racial Traits&amp;quot; mechanic described within the product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume is fully compatible with the Pathfinder Role Playing Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add some non-human fun to your game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
