			<description>Speq is a game for two or three players for the Shibumi set. It is an entry in the Shibumi Challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns adding a ball of any colour to any empty board hole, or on any 2x2 platform provided that the tricolour triangle rule* is obeyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the pyramid is full or no player can make any more moves, and is won by the player with the greatest number of balls of their colour in play (buried balls are counted).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Tricolour Triangle Rule: A ball can only be placed on a 2x2 platform if at least one side of the pyramid thus created forms an equilateral triangle with a ball of each colour at its tips. That is, at least one side of the pyramid must have a white, a black and a red ball at its corners. This must be true for every level down to the board level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
