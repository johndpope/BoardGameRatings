							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Final Matrix</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An arcade adventure game in which you must explore prisons in order to free hostages. You'll have to fight guards, collect weapons and solve puzzles along the way. The back of the box says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Poor Nimrod, a plucky little Biopton, has been sent on a dangerous and seemingly endless mission to rescue innumerable other Bioptons taken captive and closely guarded by the hostile cratons on their sinister Matrix prison network. The task is a challenging one as nobody knows how many hostages there are to rescue and their location is unknown. Nimrod must land on each Matrix individually to rescue each Biopton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will he ever reach the Final Matrix?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
