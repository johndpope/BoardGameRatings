							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Atticus Scroll: Journey of the Pharaoh</name>
									
			<description>In 1837, British Egyptologist, John Atticus discovers a clay jar in the Egyptian desert. When he opens the jar, he finds an ancient scroll written in hieroglyphs. He translates the scroll which contains the one true way for a Pharaoh to navigate from this world to the afterlife. It was the Journey of the Pharaoh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the Game&lt;br/&gt;You are the designated Vizier and must help your Pharaoh navigate successfully the journey from this world to the afterlife.  Beware of the many challenges and pitfalls that may impede your Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s path.  Acquire amulets along the way for protection and avoid the deadly clutches of the Ammit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As players progress around the game board, they will pass the Scarab Sun.  Once a player passes the Scarab Sun, he/she should take a card and follow the instructions of the card.  If a player retreats or trades places with another, then do not draw a card.  Replace the card on the bottom of the deck when done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each icon on the game board has an associated action to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game, a player must roll the die and advance the exact number of spaces needed to reach the Ra (sun) symbol.  If the exact number is not rolled, then the player stays in the same position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
