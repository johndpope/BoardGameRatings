			<description>In teams, or one on one, you are trying to make your side victorious in the Qu&amp;eacute;bec referendum.&lt;br/&gt;By moving from region to region, you're collecting cards that will give you votes (points) at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When pawns meet in the same region, a trivia question is asked to the player who has just landed. If the player fails, the other team can try to answer the question, and gain the votes for the end game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once in the game, each player has to collect at least one card from the media event deck, which can make you gain or lose vote.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game, and the cards, are all written in french.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
