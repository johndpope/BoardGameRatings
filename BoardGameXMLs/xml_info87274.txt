							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sojourn: The City and The Desert</name>
									
			<description>User Summary: Game Chef 2010 Design Competition Submission&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;In Sojourn: The City and The Desert, players will tell the tale of a region of natural splendor which is under invasion by a City, the only City to exist. This City, Sojourn, sweeps through the region, literally moving across the earth in some way, whether it is pulled by titanic worms made of brass and gears, or whether it rolls upon wheels which leave deep trenches in the dirt. As it moves, it consumes everything, eating all in its path and everything around it, digesting the food into resources. It leaves in its wake an entirely lifeless desert, a wasteland horrible and terrifying to a people who know only a world with so much life. The fate of the entire region falls upon the shoulders of a select group of individuals who have been called to Sojourn because it offers them the ability to fulfill their darkest desires. If they should choose to serve the city, to help in its quest to consume the land and everything, everyone, on it, then they may be rewarded. But if they want to save their homes, their friends, their family, then these individuals will have to shun the help of Sojourn and stand against it, forever giving up their darkest desires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
