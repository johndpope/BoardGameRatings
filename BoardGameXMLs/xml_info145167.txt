							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Victoriana 3rd Edition Core Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Victoriana &amp;ndash; a world of high adventure and intrigue in an age of sorcery and steam!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1856 and the world roils in the unseen conflict between Order and Entropy. As technology marches forward the Celestial Engine moves ever faster, and all our fates grow more precarious. Now is the time to act decisively and boldly, to seize control of your destiny and impose your will upon the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your adventures will take you into an alternate history infused with fantasy and esoteric steam technology. Aerostats float across the sky as noble Eldren chat with industrial Dwarfs. The Age of Magic may be long gone, but the Guild keeps its embers alive while technologists create extraordinary mechanical marvels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel with the British East India Company to make your fortune in competition with Dutch merchants for control of the tea trade. Join the petty conjurers that support social revolution while the government calls on gentleman hermeticists to counter them. Explore uncharted lands and uncover relics and evils buried since the Great Flood. Follow your conscience and help the poor and powerless against those that would prey upon them. Wage war against the demons that have seduced the aristocracy and threaten to tear the Empire apart!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victoriana offers an enormous and diverse game world deeply imbued with Victorian period feel, gothic fantasy magic and steampunk engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victoriana 3rd Edition is backwards-compatible with the previous edition &amp;ndash; your 2nd Edition supplements can be used with the third edition rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
