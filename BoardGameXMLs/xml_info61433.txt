							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zinia&#039;s Spa</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are the PC&amp;rsquo;s worn out from adventuring? Perhaps it is time to visit Zinia&amp;rsquo;s Spa for a relaxing massage or a healing mudbath!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located on the edge of town near some natural steam vents, Zinia&amp;rsquo;s Spa caters to those wealthy enough to afford its specialized treatments and massages. While Zinia might staff her spa with former prostitutes and other young women from the streets, this is a true spa designed to help clients relax and recover from a hard journey. The spa&amp;rsquo;s reputation for luxury grows with each passing year as more and more customers come to visit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether or not the PCs decide to use the spa for what it is, the PC descriptions and adventure hooks provided here can help any GM make use of the spa in their own way. This location also provides alternative ideas for adventures in high fantasy/high magic campaigns involving demons, angels or other extraplanar creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
