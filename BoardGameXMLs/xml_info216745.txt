							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lotus Game</name>
									
			<description>A humorous Parscheesi-like game produced by the Lotus Development Corporation in 1987, with a tongue-in-cheek nod to tech office life and many behind-the-scenes happenings during the company's heyday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the Lotus Game is to ship and sell product around the world by obtaining approval from the 4 corresponding departments of manufacturing, finance, research and development, and marketing/sales.  Along the way, you will encounter everything from Lotus celebrations to Lotus mishaps.  You may find yourself phone-mailed or e-emailed away to meetings.  And beware of reorgs that can change everyone's status in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
