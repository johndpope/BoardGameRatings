							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Broken Knight</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broken Knight is a science fiction adventure taking place on a damaged space station. This adventure is designed to be used in a space opera setting and it uses the Fate Core system by default, but it should be easy to adopt it to other settings and popular RPG systems. There are some ideas and notes for rules and setting conversions at the end of the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Synopsis&lt;br/&gt;The adventure takes place in a wrecked space station that is designated as Setha Station. The station was recently boarded by an imperial automated patrol craft and the situation escalated. The station crew was not able to fend off the boarding party, but they managed to send an emergency message before they died either defending the station or in an attempted escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A handful of station crew members tried to flee in a spacecraft, but their escape was cut short by the imperial patrol craft and their ship was critically damaged. As their desperate last effort they sacrificed their lives by ramming their ship into the imperial patrol craft. This resulted in serious damage to the station, but not its complete destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the assault on the station both, the Empire and the Alliance has sent their teams to the station. An imperial cruiser is en route to the station ready to seize the control of the station and Alliance has sent the closest team they could find to quickly recover the Setha station&amp;rsquo;s most valuable asset &amp;ndash; a holostack storing a digital personality and all the critical data on the research done at the Setha Station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
