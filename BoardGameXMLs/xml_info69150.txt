			<description>A promotional game with a somewhat contrived theme. A friend of the players' has been locked up in a seedy warehouse for unclear reasons. The players race across town using various means of transportation. Before reaching the warehouse each player must also acquire a cell phone with a Telia subscription (guess none of them thought that was worth having for any other reason) so they can receive an access code (from whom?). Once the friend has been sprung from captivity he must be brought back home, and during this stage players try to &amp;quot;steal&amp;quot; him from each other (can't they all just get along?).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
