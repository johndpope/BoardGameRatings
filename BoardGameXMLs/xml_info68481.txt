							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Pirate and Traders of the West Indies</name>
									
			<description>The gameboard consists of 8 sections mounted on linen and showing a map of the Caribbean. The title is at the top and the publisher's details at the lower left. It shows a map of the Caribbean islands together with shipping and latitude and longitude lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE TRADERS are supposed to be trading between the West India Islands and other countries, and are about to start on their voyage from certain places on the coast of Mexico and in the Caribbean sea. These places are indicated by the four letters A,B,C,D, and each trader has a mark corresponding with one of these letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIRATE, who is to attack or capture the traders on their voyage, has his retreat marked on the coast near to New Orleans, and from this spot he starts at the beginning of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
