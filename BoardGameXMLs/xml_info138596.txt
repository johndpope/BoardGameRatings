			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the d20 Guide to Casino Action!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is just something about the floor of a casino, a feeling of electricity in the air. Cheers at the craps table, the clink of coins dropping from slot machines, the scream of cheaters having their hands broken ... yes, there&amp;rsquo;s something for everyone inside a casino.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a guide to the most popular modern casino games to spice up your d20 campaign, whether you are playing in the fantasy genre or contemporary times. The rules are broken into two sets: abstract and detailed, depending on how detailed you would like to roleplay character time at the tables. The abstract rules are meant for simulating long stretches of casino game play, such as a character spending an evening at a poker table. The detailed rules are for when you want to play out every play &amp;ndash; or at least the ones that matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book is rounded out with a few extra casino tidbits, such as how casinos deal with cheaters in a magical world and new feats for dedicated character gamblers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
