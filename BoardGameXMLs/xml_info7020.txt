			<description>Battle Stations: An Operational Game of Modern Seapower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle Stations is a low complexity board game of naval conflict concentrating on the operational level. The game depicts the various areas of potential conflict on a series of maps scaled to about 24 miles to a hex. The interactions of surface, subsurface, and naval air forces are depicted by silhouette style counters. The data base of Seapower &amp;amp; the State, our strategic modern naval game, is used for the unit&lt;br/&gt;values, thus providing a degree of mateability between the games. The operational nature of the game is emphasized by five-hour turns and a simple but effective combat system that&lt;br/&gt;reflects the lethality of modern weapons systems. A number of scenarios are provided for likely conflict areas as well as a system to use Seapower &amp;amp; the State as a campaign game scenario generator.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
