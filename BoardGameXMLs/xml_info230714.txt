			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Be Not Afraid!&amp;rdquo; &lt;br/&gt;Show why the angels of the lord open every conversation with mankind that way in the new game from Morningstar Productions. Become a foot soldier of Heaven or Hell as Wormwood falls and the Apocalypse begins! Hunt down the enemy, raise a following among mankind and prepare for Judgement Day, because when the wrath of the Lord comes down, only the cunning will survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative roleplaying and dice-less mechanics that use the Seven Deadly Sins and the Seven Heavenly Virtues to naturally incorporate the inevitable fall from grace attendant with walking among mortals make Wormwood a game to remember, whether you use it for just one night or a whole campaign! Use your divine grace wisely, because if you fall here and now, there is no-one to catch you &amp;ndash; but whole hosts will be waiting to shoot you down...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wormwood, A Game of Angels is a printer-friendly, dice-less, GM-less game that fits on just two sides of A4, so no need to flick through a rulebook during play &amp;ndash; just get straight on with the story! Designed for groups of 3-6 players and equally suited to one-shot and campaign play, Wormwood is great for new and experience roleplayers alike.
