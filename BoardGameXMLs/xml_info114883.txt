			<description>Help a little bee clear the honeycombs in Bubble Bee, a free shooting game made for the whole family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The little bee needs to gather honey from the honeycombs but they aren't cooperating. Instead, they are making it more difficult. See what you can do to help out the bee so it can collect the yummy honey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Move and shoot your way around eight wonderful levels as the honeycombs move in many strange ways. Be careful not to get hit by the honey drips, or else you'll lose one of your lives, and once all three of them are gone, the game is over. See how long you can last, or try to make it to the very end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
