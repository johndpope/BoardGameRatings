			<description>FlashNics is a uniquely crafted deck of cards that can be used for serious and casual gaming, as well as educational purposes. Players will also be able to design their own &amp;quot;game sanctioned&amp;quot; cards at the FlashNics.com website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FlashNics allows you to recruit mercenaries from across the galaxy to battle for you against other competing entities. Mercenaries will compete against one another in one of four arenas that appeal to differing skill-sets. Winning across all four arenas and the ability to secure them (or winning in extreme fashion) is necessary to defeat your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of four starting arenas is chosen. Each player starts with 6 mercenary cards (not shared) drawn randomly from the game deck. The first player chooses a card combination he/she will use to attempt to defend the arena depending on the attributes of the mercenary. The second player responds with a valid card combination (depending on the first combinations, others aren't allowed). Play then resumes until one player submits the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player that wins the round can then decide to defend an arena with the mercenary used in the winning combination, or can choose to run protection with the mercenary. Each player then draws up to 6 cards again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hand maintenance is critical, as values accumulated depend on the strength of the victorious card (the least powerful cards score higher) and cards strength in each of the 4 arenas varies.  Once the original deck is near depletion, being aware of cards still in play is a valuable tactic.  Various modifier and action cards can also modify gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;40 points are necessary to win the game (the sum of the mercenary protection values; double the value of this number if all four arenas are defended).  Advanced players can create exclusive mercenaries with unique actions at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://FlashNics.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://FlashNics.com&lt;/a&gt; and use them directly in gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
