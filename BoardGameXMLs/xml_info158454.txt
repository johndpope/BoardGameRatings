							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cartomancer: A Deckbuilding Diviner</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Half the fun of a con is the chance of getting caught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fate is the both the lawmaker and the policeman of the universe. Responsible for developing simplifying assumptions about each individual under its jurisdiction, Fate defines the beginning, middle, and end of the existence of everything simply because it allows the universe to be more efficient as a whole. Still, in order to maintain this efficiency, Fate has forced itself to be exceptionally literal and open to... creative interpretation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A select few take the concept of confidence artist and point the con at the universe itself. Their favored word? &amp;quot;Technically...&amp;quot; Their favorite expression? A disarming smile. Their name? Cartomancers. Masters of reading into the web that Fate has woven and pulling out dozens of possible scenarios that technically fulfill its requirements, cartomancers are both wise, for they must know how Fate works, as well as charismatic, for they must be able to get away with the half-lies that they spout. Cartomancers walk the razor's edge, constantly prodding at and manipulating Fate, forcing the cards to fall the way they wish. Does Fate respond? All the time. Cartomancers are used to the backlash, and some of their colleagues have fallen to Fate's particularly vindictive mood swings; most cartomancers simply smile and explain that it's all part of the rush. Half the fun of a con is the chance of getting caught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ninth class in Interjection Games' constantly-growing stable of the strange, unusual, and just plain fun, the cartomancer is a deckbuilding base class that is compatible with poker cards, tarot cards, or the print-and-play deck that just so happens to be the last thirteen pages of the book. Each day, cartomancers build an active deck of spells, or portents, from a collection of cards. Based on the concept of breaking luck and effectively rigging the game, the cartomancer's greatest enemy is the luck of the draw. As their hand of cards defines how they can manipulate fate, sometimes they have precisely what is needed to turn a fight their way - more often they don't. As luck is something they are all too familiar with, savvy cartomancers are known to learn seals, or generic manifestations of Fate that are always within arm's reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Product Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Deckbuilding base class with 54 unique portents faithfully based on the major and minor arcana of tarot&lt;br/&gt;     Compatible with poker cards and tarot cards&lt;br/&gt;     Comes with a complete print-and-play deck, plus a cheat sheet card!&lt;br/&gt;     Approximately 25 of the best feats ever put into an Interjection Games class&lt;br/&gt;     12 seals, generic manifestations of Fate that allow a cartomancer to use a specific ability regardless of what's in her hand&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for fortunetelling and being slapped around by Fate when it's pushed too far&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
