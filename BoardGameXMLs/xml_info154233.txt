							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Cast of Thousands</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;At long last a game that enables you to use all the figures in your collection at once. From Cavemen to the Far Flung Future, Hollywood encompasses it all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Promote your stars, hire your extras, shoot your films and try to make it the movie business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;A Cast of Thousands is an unusual miniatures game in that its &amp;quot;combat&amp;quot; represents psychological confrontations, like &amp;quot;shouting matches&amp;quot;. Losses cause cast members to quit and leave the movie set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players maneuver their director and whatever cast they can to film on a chosen set, possibly chasing off rival crews. Each successful film improves the director's and the star actor's rating (i.e., power). A player wins by getting their director to a five-star rating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The authors' similarly named 2008 title, Cast of Thousands, is explicitly credited on the publisher's website as inspiration, but the games are substantially different from each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
