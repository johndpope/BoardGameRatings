			<description>From the game instructions: The MISSION: The time is the future. You are all members of Grimaldi Moon Base staff, who manage instruments and observatories around the lunar surface. A swarm of meteoroids has hit the Moon, and the remote sensors report damage to some of the instruments. Your team must go out from Grimaldi Moon Base and retrieve the damaged instruments before the Sun sets. You've got more time than you think. On the Moon's surface it is light for 15 days and then dark for 15 days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the instruments are damaged more badly than others and will require 2 or more rovers to meet at the instrument to retrieve it. Only by working together -- sharing resources and making joint plans -- can you succeed in your mission to get back as many damaged instruments as possible before the long lunar night falls. As you make plans, remember that your number one goal is the safety of your team. Be sure to get everyone back before dark or you lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
