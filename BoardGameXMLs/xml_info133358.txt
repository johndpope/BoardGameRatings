			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A one-by-one-keep-dying-themed card game. Players are detectives in a mansion where the inhabitants are getting killed one by one. The goal of the game is to have scored 10 points before anyone else, or be the player with most points when there is just one suspect left. Points are scored by pre-setting certain cards from hand. These cards will, when the murder happens, score points if the conditions on the cards are fulfilled &amp;ndash; conditions including people dead, people still alive, and other set cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players use cards in hand to construct a common deck of suspects from which one cards is drawn every round. This deck also decided who is actually killed when the murder happens. So, in fact, the &amp;quot;detectives&amp;quot; are also influencing who will be killed. All to fit the theories they have laid forth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
