			<description>From the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Biblical Buddies draws both child and adult alike into a land where 20th century meets biblical history. Experience the exciting journey from the Garden of Eden to the Promised Land. Meet Adam and Eve, Noah, Moses, David and Goliath and all the Biblical Buddies characters. Players begin in the Garden of Eden and embark upon an adventure through major events of biblical history including Noah's Ark, David and Goliath, the Parting of the Red Sea and many more. This journey includes both setbacks and rewards with the ultimate goal of reaching the Promised Land.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biblical Buddies is a roll-and-move game, with each player working towards reaching the end of the track first.  Many spaces on the board have instructions to either help you move forward faster or to go back, lose a turn, etc. As players traverse the board they will read about many different biblical characters. A provided information booklet allows the player to find out more about each character and the role they played in the biblical stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
