			<description>Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An exciting hybrid title, Pacific Storm mixes the strategic elements of RTS titles with the action of an arcade title. RTS fans will enjoy classic strategy elements including resource management, unit and building construction and unit deployment, while action fans will be happy to take to the skies or seas as they directly control units in intense combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your fleet in Pacific Storm includes battleships, aircraft carriers, destroyers, cruisers, missile cruisers, submarines and torpedo boats as well as tankers and transports. The aerial war is conducted using fighters, (at first piston-powered and in later stages jet fighters), attack aircraft, torpedo bombers and strategic bombers. There are different types of units, all carefully modeled from WWII-era aircraft and ships, in the game. Also, you can develop new technologies and create new weapons systems, which may almost instantly overturn the global balance of power. About 100 technological improvements, (upgrades), enhancing combat effectiveness of warships and military aircraft are available. In addition to the strategic mode with its 127 different Pacific zones and 40 naval bases, you can play 20 historical battles, including the Battle of Midway, the attack on the Japanese admiral Yamamoto's plane, and the battle for Guadalcanal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pacific Storm is all about battleships and aircraft carriers &amp;quot;the giants of naval warfare during WWII&amp;quot;, about captains and admirals, as well as rank-and-file soldiers and sailors of the two great military powers locked in a life-and-death conflict. In Pacific Storm you can become the Commander-in-Chief responsible for the lives of thousands of servicemen and the destiny of his country; or the commanding officer of a small squadron; or even an ordinary military pilot fighting in the sky over the Pacific. Gradually, as you play, from all these separate bits and pieces will emerge one impressive picture of the great and fierce battles fought in the Pacific during WWII.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
