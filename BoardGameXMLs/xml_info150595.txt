							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ScottComics Character Roster Book</name>
									
			<description>Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;You hold in your hands the roster book for the shared ScottComics universe. If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, chances are very good that you are a regular reader of Raymond Hardcase, Our Super Mom, or have read the novels The Paragon of Animals and To Thine Own Self Be True.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you may not have realized is that all of these works share a universe. The story of Liza begins in the novel, which  ntroduces us to the heroic world, the role of the hero Paragon, and the Defense Force that manages the gifted people in world. We later see the Defense Force&amp;rsquo;s Alpha Team in action in the pages of Raymond Hardcase, and then Liza&amp;rsquo;s story is continued in the comic pages of Our Super Mom, which takes place after she has left the Defense Force to raise her family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This roster book is designed to show you some of how those different books interconnect and provide you additional background into this world. Additionally, the ScottComics Character Roster Book is designed to let you play your own role-playing game adventures set in that world by using the characters and their stats from this book and using Green Ronin&amp;rsquo;s Mutants and Masterminds, Third Edition rules to run the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mutants and Masterminds Hero&amp;rsquo;s Handbook provides you the rules you need to play the game. This book gives you a wide selection of heroes and villains to populate your game with the characters from ScottComics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
