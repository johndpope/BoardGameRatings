			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A team of space explorers are on a common, dangerous mission. You set up the mission. As in real space. each person has an important part to fulfill and must return safely to Earth. Each must use the craft, equipment &amp;amp;amp; fuel wisely. Keep an alert mind on the controls. Lives are at stake. We have to look after one another, performing daring rescues. A special feature is that players are not static, but grow in wisdom and knowledge. This personal growth affects how well you perform during the mission. A quick moving game with plenty of strategy decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
