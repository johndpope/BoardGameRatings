			<description>Super-sized tabletop golf game.&lt;br/&gt;Play real golf shots with your miniature metal golf clubs. The greens are represented by green card with holes in the centre. The ball must go constantly onto the floor I would think (out of bounds?).&lt;br/&gt;The box says:&lt;br/&gt;An exact counterpart, in miniature, of the popular outdoor pastimeComplete with Golf Clubs, Balls, Putting Greens, Bunkers and full instructions. This game of skill entrances the Golf enthusiast as well as the learner.A really scientific Game of Golf can be played indoors with the appliances without any risk of injury to furniture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I love that last line of the box text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
