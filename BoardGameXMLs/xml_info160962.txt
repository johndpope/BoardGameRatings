							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dust Tactics: SSU Battlegroup Koshka Starter Set</name>
									
			<description>The year is 1947. The war that started a decade  ago has now spread worldwide. The discovery of a crashed alien spacecraft in the Antarctic has led to the development of revolutionary combat walkers that surpass the most advanced tank technology. Old alliances have fragmented and new ones arisen as three major blocs, the Allies, the Axis and the Sino-Soviet Union (SSU) fight the world over for VK, a valuable new resource that power their new fighting machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dust Tactics is a miniatures board game for 2 or more players. The SSU Battlegroup Koshka starter set contains everything you need to start playing Dust Tactics, including 10 highly-detailed plastic miniatures, unit cards, terrain elements, special Dust dice, and the Dust rulebook. Enter the world of Dust and lead your SSU Battlegroup into battle against Axis or Allied Battlegroups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: The rules and cards in this box are based on the version 2 rules, but are slightly different from and not completely compatible with the full Dust Tactics version 2 rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
