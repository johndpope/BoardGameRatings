			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Star Soccer 2010 is a soccer career simulation with you playing as a footballer trying to make his way up from the lower leagues to compete on the world stage.  Along with playing in the actual matches, you must decide how to spend your energy between games.  You can improve your skill stats via training challenges such as dribbling through cones, and you must manage your various personal and professional relationships.  There is also a casino subgame allowing you to risk your wages.  The game is an evolution of New Star Soccer 4 featuring a graphical overhaul and improved AI behaviour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
