							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vanilla ORC</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vanilla ORC is the basic ruleset which all Vajra RPGs are based on. It is made up of two parts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter One is the basic character creation system. Each RPG that uses ORC will have its own character classes, skills, equipment, advantages and disadvantages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter Two is the Organic Rule Components rules of play. ORC was designed specifically:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     To have every rule work from the same basic mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;     For dramatic, character-centered, ultra-realistic play.&lt;br/&gt;     To allow character classes that are realistically flexible.&lt;br/&gt;     To allow scaled complexity (so if a PC wants to cook something it takes a simple roll, but if a PC is hacking a computer he or she has several strategies and possible modifiers).&lt;br/&gt;     To have combat be realistically lethal and give players many real-life strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a more playable version of the ORC rules, see Modern-ORC, the ORC rules plus modern world careers, skills, equipment and bonus characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
