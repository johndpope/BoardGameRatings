							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mohray House</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something strange is happening in the Mohray House. About four months ago old Lady Mohray passed on, though nobody knows exactly when since she had obviously been dead for some time when her body was found. Father Kamryn, of the Shrine of Selinay, buried the old eccentric in the wild remnants of the garden behind her manor-house and, since she had no relatives closer than Waterford, the dilapidated old house has stood empty since. Now though, strange noises have been heard from the house and the people of Lamber's Market have started saying that the house is haunted but nobody has quite had the nerve to investigate... until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF typically is distributed in a ZIP archive that also includes a one-page JPG file presenting a map of the entire structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
