			<description>Middle-Earth Role Playing also is known as MERP is a role-playing system that was published by Iron Crown Enterprises between 1984 and 1999 when the company was under license from Tolkien Enterprises to publish such material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was a simplified version of their earlier fantasy role-playing system called Rolemaster.  Unlike Rolemaster &lt;br/&gt;the weapon and critical damage charts were greatly simplified, and there were only two spell realms instead of three.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game system only had six character classes: warrior, scout, mage, animist, ranger, and bard.  However, unlike Rolemaster this system provided 15 different types of human races: Beornings, Black Numenoreans, Corsairs, Dorwinrim, Dunedain, Dunlendings, Easterlings, Haradrim, Lossoth, Rohirrim, Rural-men, Urban-man, Variags, Woodmen, and Woses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything needed to play the game was included in this one book including all spell lists, equipment lists, monster and animal charts, encounter charts, background information about Middle Earth including a list of languages, and even a sample adventure in the Trollshaws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MERP and Rolemaster adventures were usually compatible to both systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
