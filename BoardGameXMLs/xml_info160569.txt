							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Three Card Monte</name>
									
			<description>A quickfire card game based on the classic confidence trick. Keep your ACE hidden while you knock out opponents by guessing theirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has three cards on the table placed face down. One ACE card and two DECOY cards. If your ACE card is taken by an opponent you are eliminated. If your opponent guesses a DECOY card then they are eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has three cards in their hand. Everyone starts with a LOOK and a GUESS card as well as a third card drawn from the deck. Each turn you play only one card. If you choose to LOOK at an opponent's card this turn you will have to wait until your next turn to make a GUESS. Maybe they will use their next turn to try and knock you out, or play a SHUFFLE or BLOCK card to keep their ACE safe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
