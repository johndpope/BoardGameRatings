			<description>The Ultimate Beer Game is a board game in which players travel their pawn across the board, encountering &amp;ldquo;obstacles&amp;rdquo; in a battle to get to the finish line first. Obstacles include things like The Bridge of Doom, Potato's House, The Beach, etc. Along the way, players will be instructed to drink, pick cards, and answer slightly humorous questionnaires out loud to the other players. It is designed to be interactive, socially and physically, within the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game boasts 8 pawns in a range of colors, and one blue die, all neatly packed into a drawstring canvas bag to withstand the tests of time longer than the typical heat-sealed plastic bag most games include. This means your pawns and die won&amp;rsquo;t be rolling around aimlessly inside the box once you open them. (Our pawns are made in the U.S.A. They are eco-friendly, filled with postindustrial wood trim.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game includes 52 Beer Cards and Bong Cards collectively, which are packed into a playing card box. Our cards are water-resistant and should clean off pretty easily if wet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can be played while easily substituting alcohol with any beverage, using alcohol is an OPTIONAL part of this game.&lt;br/&gt;This game is meant to be played by those of legal drinking age, and is prohibited to be played by any minor. Some tiles include curse words, obscene ideas, and some offensive language and graphics in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
