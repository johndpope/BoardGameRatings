			<description>Each player is dealt five white Feelings Cards. The Judge (non-active player) draws a pink Situation Card and reads it. Players who have a Feeling card that matches how they would feel shout out the name of the feeling and lay the card down on the matching area on the board. The Judge adjudicates who was first and whether the feeling was a good match. Once a single card is accepted (players may argue the correctness of their card with the Judge), the Judge passes the Situation cards to the next player to the left, who becomes the new Judge, and play resumes. First player to get rid of all their Feelings cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
