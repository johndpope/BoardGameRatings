			<description>Ludusfidelis is inspired by artifacts from the Museu Municipal de Penafiel.  It is a game for two played an a rectangular board with a 2 x 5 grid of squares.  One row of squares is empty, the other marked with &amp;quot;coins.&amp;quot;  Players have three pieces each of their own color or shape, and take turns rolling a die to determine how to move their pieces around the board in a counter-clockwise direction.  The six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, and 5 on it.  The squares of the board are marked with roman numerals one through ten.  The goal is for a player to land all of their pieces on the squares marked with a coin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
