							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lemmings: The Migration</name>
									
			<description>Lemmings come and go through Dangers and Population Events, but once the Mass Migration hits, save your lemmings from certain doom with Safeties and the last minute Population increase.  The last player with Lemmings wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a simple, fast-paced &amp;quot;Take That!&amp;quot; style card game.  Players start with a certain population of Lemmings, and play cards which directly reduce the population of their opponents, or raise their own population.  The last player with lemmings still alive wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an inexpensive game, whose components are what you would expect for its low price tag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
