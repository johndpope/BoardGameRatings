			<description>Publisher Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demon Venture #1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Step into the fantastic -- into a magical, mystical domain populated by gallant warriors and nightmarish vermin. Experience first-hand the ecstasy of a near-impossible quest successfully completed or the crushing despair of a hideous death at the slavering jaws of some denizen from the netherworld. REIGN OF THE RED DRAGON is the frist of an exciting new fantasy series that gives you complete control over the design and outfitting of characters of your OWN creation! Select your character types -- Human, dwarf, elf, warrior, cleric, magician or thief; purchase your supplies, weapons and magics, then brace yourself for entry into the dark, sorcerous realms that are the sole domain of the horror that is known as THE RED DRAGON! Fantasy role-playing at its finest!
