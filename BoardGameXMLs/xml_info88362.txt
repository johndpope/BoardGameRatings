			<description>WWF WrestleMania: Steel Cage Challenge is a professional wrestling video game based on the World Wrestling Federation, released in 1992 by Acclaim Entertainment for the NES and Sega Master System gaming systems, and the Sega Game Gear handheld console. Modes include One-on-One (regular match and steel cage match variations), Tag Team, WWF Championship (choose one wrestler and defeat all the others to become WWF Champion), and Tag Team Championship (choose two wrestlers and defeat combinations of the rest in a series of tag team matches to become WWF Tag Team Champions).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NES version features ten wrestlers: Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, I.R.S., Ted DiBiase, Jake Roberts, Roddy Piper, Bret Hart, Sid Justice, The Undertaker, and The Mountie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sega versions also feature ten wrestlers: Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, I.R.S., Ted DiBiase, Ric Flair, Tatanka, Bret Hart, Papa Shango, The Undertaker, and Shawn Michaels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All wrestlers share the same moveset, consisting of standard punches and kicks, grapples (body slam, throw, headbutt), running attacks (flying clothesline, dropkick), a powerslam to a running opponent, ground attacks (stomp, elbow drop) and a move off the turnbuckle. There are no finishing moves. However, this was the first console-based WWF game to feature a steel cage match (cage matches had previously been seen in the arcade game WWF WrestleFest).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.wikipedia.com/WWF_WrestleMania&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.wikipedia.com/WWF_WrestleMania&lt;/a&gt;:_Steel_Cage_Challenge,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
