			<description>To Je Fotbal (This Is Football) is a true simulation of a football match, a strategic board game that brings football action to your table by combining football rules and game strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Je Fotbal is a game for two football managers. Each team consists of the basic eleven players and five substitutes. The players are marked with a colored base corresponding to their role on the pitch. The forwards, midfielders, defenders, goalkeeper and captain all perform different functions. The basic skills can be enhanced by using special cards according to the manager's chosen strategy. During one turn, the manager can move three players in any direction according to their attributes and kick the ball if it is in possession of the team. Playing time is 2 x 45 turns (and maybe extra time).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic rules make it easy to get into the game for those aged 10 and up, and they cover situations such as passing, shooting, goal kick, saves, offside, posts, tacking for ball and position, extra time, substitutions and (of course) goals. The extended rules contain special situations such as corner kick, throw-in, free kicks and penalty kicks, fouls, yellow and red cards and even diving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game pieces are miniatures of football players in team jerseys with names, numbers and even sponsors' logos. The atmosphere of a football stadium is completed not only by a full-colored 82x55 cm game board with goals, flags and advertising panels, but also by an imitation of a scoreboard. All components (special cards, scoreboard) are in English, with the printed rules in the box coming in six languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first edition, &amp;quot;10th Czech vs Slovakia derby&amp;quot;, is supported by the Czech and Slovak national teams. You will find such football greats as Petr Cech, Tomas Rosicky, Marek Hamsik and Martin Skrtel in the teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
