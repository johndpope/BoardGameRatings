			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This title contains five fully-stat'ed characters for the BASH superhero roleplaying game that players can use as characters or which Game Masters can use individually or in conjunction with one another as villains! It is fully illustrated with custom images by game industry artist William T. Thrasher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The five children described below were designed for use as Player Characters. Each has a Datafile as a hero, including a &amp;ldquo;Cheat Sheet&amp;rdquo; that gives more info on the character&amp;rsquo;s powers and abilities, and a character description with a few roleplaying tips. The Forgotten Children would make a fine beginning super team in an ongoing campaign afterward as well, with the Orphanage as their Base of Operations and their secret identities as residents there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chiron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keirin, age 10-14, delivered as a ward of the state to St. Nicolas Orphanage, when his parents were killed and Keirin crippled in a car crash. All Keirin had with him was a centaur action figure, which he still treasures above all else. He is friendly and very bright, and reads constantly, pretty much anything he can get his hands, or the outdated Orphanage computer, on. His greatest fear is also his secret hope &amp;mdash; that the worlds of fantasy and miracle that he envisions might actually be real. Keirin&amp;rsquo;s escapism manifests in his powers, where he actually creates a physical representation of himself embodied as Chiron the Centaur, his favorite character. His own body remains behind, unconscious and vulnerable. Generally Keiron will try to be in bed, so it appears that he is asleep, when he &amp;ldquo;transforms.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kindle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kendall, age 12-16, knowitall eldest of the Children, Kendall is also keenly aware of the responsibility this places on her. Her greatest fear is that one of the other Children will become hurt or, even worse, on her watch. Kindle&amp;rsquo;s fire and heat powers are strong, but untapped. She is never sure exactly what will happen when she uses them, but is also creative in suiting them to the situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terryn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tara, age 11-15, a quiet kid just arrived at the Orphanage. Her mother recently died and Tara is hurt, confused and terrified of what her life has become. Her greatest fear &amp;mdash; That it can still get worse. Tara also has great capacity for compassion &amp;mdash; She is deeply conscious of ecological issues, animal rights, etc. and she is the most likely to reach out to someone else having a bad day. Terra&amp;rsquo;s abilities arise from her concern over the fate of the earth and manifest as transformative and earth control powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peril&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perry, age 11-15, Perry is a tough street kid, housed at St. Nicholas by the last act of a social system that has failed him time and again. Think tween Wolverine in mentality and you will not be far off. His greatest fear &amp;mdash; that his toughness of mind and body will be revealed for the fa&amp;ccedil;ade that it is. Yet there is a terrific core of will, and capacity for loyalty in Perry as well. Peril&amp;rsquo;s powers are dangerous and indiscriminate, especially when he is angry. Unfortunately not everybody is a durable as he is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Shift&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rae-Anne, age 11-15, Rae-Anne is nearly as old as Kendal, but small for her age, such that everyone thinks she is younger. Rae-Anne is not inclined to correct them, using her pretty red curls and diminutive statue to get what she wants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These characters originally appeared in the bestselling Skirmisher Publishing adventure “Krampusnacht: Night of the Krampus” and are provided here on their own with the addition of illustrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
