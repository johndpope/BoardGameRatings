							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Marvel Super Heroes 3D</name>
									
			<description>The super villain, Grandmaster, is on the Earth and he has decided to have some fun at the expense of the five most powerful superheroes of the Marvel universe: Wolverine, Captain America, Thor, Spiderman, and Iron Man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He has cooked up a despicable plan. He has imprisoned them into an intergalactic dome where he manipulates them like pawns! In order to get away, our heroes will have to face many challenges.&lt;br/&gt;With 1 to 4 players, play this fun mix between a board game and an action game as one of these 5 super heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the board game phase, move through the Grandmaster&amp;rsquo;s secret base, and join forces to destroy the dome and get away.&lt;br/&gt;During the action phases, play as your hero with a first-person view; swing from one skyscraper to another with Spiderman and spin your web to stop your enemies, protect yourself with Captain America&amp;rsquo;s shield, call down thunder using Thor&amp;rsquo;s hammer, pilot Iron Man&amp;rsquo;s suit in a canyon while destroying sentinels with your lasers, and let Wolverine&amp;rsquo;s knives do all the talking using your Wii Remote and Nunchuk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
