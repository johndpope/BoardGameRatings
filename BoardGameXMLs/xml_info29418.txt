							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">KHJ Disc Jockey Derby Game</name>
									
			<description>The game board folds out from a double LP put out by 93 / KHJ, a radio station.  The name of the album is &amp;quot;Sound of the Sixties&amp;quot;.  Instructions are printed on the inside of the record sleeve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a basic roll and move game, utilizing a spinner, along with &amp;quot;Blooper&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Ad Lib&amp;quot; cards that are drawn after landing on certain spaces of the board.  The theme centers around the particular DJs of that era and station, and each player chooses their favorite DJ token to represent them while moving around the board. The goal is to become Disc Jockey of the Year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in California, with locations like Malibu and Disneyland, and the spaces allude to various radio station activities, such as &amp;quot;Commercial Break&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;On the Air&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;You Get Beatles Exclusive&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
