			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;We would become the gods of our own fantasy world. We would raise it up from the meager foundations of stone and water. We would raise up great civilizations, set them at war, guide them in science and magic, and give them leaders. And we would do it in about six hours. From this singular idea arose the game which you now see before you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the guidelines of Dawn of Worlds are the tools and the advice by which a few ordinary people can set themselves up with ultimate power for an evening and leave you with a complete, detailed fantasy world. It will, if you make use of it, give you a world with complete landscapes, history, cultures, and characters. And it will be fun, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
