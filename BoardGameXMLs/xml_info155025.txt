			<description>The MAGNATES: A Game of Power, a.k.a. Boże Igrzysko: MAGNACI, presents the history of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, from its heyday during the Union of Lublin (XVI century) until the collapse of the state (XVIII century). Players take on the roles of the magnates, who seek to develop the power of their families in the favorable time: the peak of the Polish and Lithuanian Union.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a deck of cards that depicts celebrities of his family. Some of them are capable of great deeds and some will spoil any project with which they are entrusted &amp;mdash; but with a good player's decisions, even those small souls could do a lot for his family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players manage the deck of their characters to achieve, in competition with others, as much as possible on each of the planes of life of the Republic. The fate of the country results from the sum of the activities of the most powerful aristocratic families. If the players fall into a mutual fight for titles and advantages, the Republic will fall under the pressure of neighboring powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game for 2-5 players with a game time not exceeding 90 minutes reimplements Martin Wallace's Boże Igrzysko from 2010, using the same principal title in Polish edition under an agreement with the author.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MAGNATES: A Game of Power is a strategic board game for 2-5 players which is fast and full of historical atmosphere and rich interactions. It takes you into the world of aristocratic intrigues and struggles for power which tore the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from its heyday during the Union of Lublin, until the Targowica Confederation and the fall of the Polish-Lithuanian state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the roles of magnates who seek to develop their own family's power in a moment favorable to fortune: the prime of the Union of Poland and Lithuania. The most eminent families fight for prestige and landed estates: the Lubomirski, the Potocki, the Radziwiłł, the Sapieha and the Zamoyski.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a deck of cards depicting well-known personages from a given family. Some of these characters are outstanding people, capable of great deeds. But there are also less useful people, able to spoil any undertaking entrusted them... unless, thanks to the player's decisions, even those lesser ones will do much for the family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players will manage their deck of characters so that, in competition with others, they can achieve as much as possible on each of the planes of life of the Commonwealth. Players will clash during the creation of the state's internal policy, as well as in response to external threats and opportunities arising from the international situation. And so, as it happened in reality, the fate of the country will be the result of the sum of actions of the most powerful aristocratic families. If the players lose themselves in a mutual fight for titles and advantage, the Commonwealth will collapse under the pressure of the neighboring powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In MAGNATES, players will face many dilemmas. The most prominent members of the family will ensure beneficial rights in the Sejm and prestigious positions in the Senate. Moreover, they comply with the Monarch's will easily, and thanks to them the family will gain estates and power. But how will a player handle the remaining challenges? Who will undertake an expedition to Livonia? Will the troops protecting the country against enemy invasion, in the absence of other candidates, be again led by incompetents (like &amp;quot;peryna, latyna and dytyna&amp;rdquo;)? Will there be enough determination to hasten to the relief of Vienna? Will the players succeed in saving the Homeland from partitioning?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is your Family ready for a Game of Power?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
