			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome Duellist,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a time traveller and you've been in a fight with your adversary for years in a row. It's a fight with no rules and it will only end when one of you will be dead. But even if you're down on the floor you can't give up. You are too proud and maybe in a different time you will get the advantage. It's time to do a time jump and prepare for a next battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Time Duellist you (The Duellist) and another player (The Adversary) will fight and live through the ages. You will begin battles against each other but you can live with your life in relative safety and hope you will not be found. Through time jumps you will go to a different year and try to get an advantage there to put your adversary under the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
