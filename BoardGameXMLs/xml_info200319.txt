							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Crow Funeral</name>
									
			<description>Winner, Best Incorporation of Touch, 2015 Golden Cobra Challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Golden Cobra Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever wanted to be part of a murder? Of crows, that is! In A Crow Funeral, players take on the roles of a community of crows that have discovered the body of one of their own. As they crowd around in a mournful-yet-raucous circle, the crows must determine how their friend expired. In the opening explanation of the game, Timothy Hutchings states &amp;ldquo;there is no conflict resolution mechanic.&amp;rdquo; This statement is three things: true, untrue, and sneaky. This game&amp;rsquo;s deployment of touch is both simple and entertaining, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find that conflict most definitely gets sorted out. This game is fun, light, and great to play in public spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
