							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Election</name>
									
			<description>Election is a game of campaign strategy for the whole family. Plan your campaign, win votes and battle for victory in each State. Win enough Electoral College votes to become the next President of the United States. Careful campaign planning and management of campaign funds is required to defeat your opponent. Conduct polls to discover which candidate each state favors. Be sure to read the Daily News card and watch out for the &amp;quot;Dark Horse&amp;quot; candidate that can steal your Volunteers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play Election, players first decide on how many &amp;ldquo;days&amp;rdquo; there are to the election, with each round of play being one turn.  On each turn players can either Fundraise or Campaign. When campaigning, players can spend money to recruit volunteers, hire consultants, buy ads, travel, or conduct a poll.  Volunteers, consultants and ads can be traded in for Votes, which are then placed on individual states.  Each state also has a &amp;ldquo;poll&amp;rdquo;, which determines which party the state favors (e.g. Republicans +3). Players can pay to conduct polls to see the polling information. On Election Day, the outcome in each state is determined by the votes placed on the state plus the polling. The winner of each state is awarded all of the Electoral College Votes for that state. The winner of the election is the player with the most Electoral College Votes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Election is fun for the whole family and will have your children jumping up and down thrilled to have just become the next President of the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
