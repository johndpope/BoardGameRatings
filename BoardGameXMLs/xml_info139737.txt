			<description>(Excerpt from the Introduction): These rules have been formulated with the period 1793-1815 (French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars) in mind, although such was the progress of Naval Warfare at the time, they could, with the preparation of suitable Ship Definitions, be used for any period during the eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ground scale is 1:2400. Ship scale is 1:1200, although the rules may be modified for other scales. Measurements are in mm. Time scale is 1 move=1 minute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are data for a number of different types of ships ranging from frigates to the vaunted ships-of-the-line. Players use scale models to recreate historical or hypothetical naval engagements. The concise rules cover wind direction, movement, and gunnery. Dice rolls are used to generate random amounts of damage and gunfire accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules were published by Navwar in the United Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
