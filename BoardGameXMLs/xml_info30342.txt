							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pinky Lee and the Runaway Frankfurters</name>
									
			<description>A frankfurter is placed on each one of the designated spaces along the track on the gameboard. In turn, each player rolls the die and advances one's own wagon along the track. The first to land on each frankfurter captures it and loads it on one's own wagon. Landing on an opponent forces the opponent to surrender all the owned frankfurters to the frankfurter hiding place at the finish line. The first to arrive at the finish line captures all the frankfurters that are there. The player with the most frankfurters after all have finished is the weiner (pun intended).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pinky Lee was a Vaudeville comedian who achieved fame as the host of nationally televised children's show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
