							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orville the Octopus</name>
									
			<description>Take a dive for sunken treasure and then try to escape the clutches of ORVILLE THE OCTOPUS.  The game was made by the  Eberhard Faber Company in 1962. Orville is an 8 inch wide metal Octopus with flasher eyes. He balances on a center post in his seascape background. Danny Diver a metallic deep sea diver with a magnet embedded in his feet is suspended on a rubber string connected to a rubber ball. Treasure pieces in the form of gold balls, coins and anchors are scattered on the sea floor. The object is to pick up as much plunder as you can but if you get too close to Orville he spins around and, with a sickening metallic ping sound,  he grabs Danny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
