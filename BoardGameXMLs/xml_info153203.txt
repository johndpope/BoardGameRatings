							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Clock Mage: A Dungeon World Playbook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An eternity passes in the blink of an eye. A moment lasts as long as you need it to. Time is something for other people to deal with. You are the Clock, and time is your tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Clock Mage is a playbook for the Dungeon World roleplaying game, and the first of my Mage Revised series. The Mage is one of the most popular playbooks I have ever written, but it has its flaws - the class is too open ended, and is generally capable of solving problems on a larger scope than any other class can really confront. My solution was to pare down the class into multiple different classes, each built around a single Spell Focus. This class is a reimagining of a Mage with Spell Focus: The Clock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Clock Mage is built around time control. You have no magic but the ability to move differently, see differently. While others operate in three dimensions, you operate in four - time is just another direction for you to travel in. The Clock Mage uses an innovative Tick-Tock mechanic to limit her access to what moves she can do at any given time, by flipping her &amp;quot;mana&amp;quot; between two separate stat pools - one for speeding up, and one for slowing down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
