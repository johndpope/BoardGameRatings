			<description>&amp;quot;Chimera is an arcade adventure developed by Shahid Ahmad in 1985.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Chimera, the player walks through an isometric maze of 8 x 8 screens, trying to find out with which item he may disable the obstacles preventing him from the access of further areas of the ship. When the player has disabled the respective obstacles, he may create with his item a warhead and carry that to a blue room. On activation of all four warheads he must reach the green room in order to complete the quest. The player must also look out for his water and food reserves, which run out faster while he carries something resp. while he is in a hot room. Both can be found once in a while in the maze. If the reserves run out or if he tried to disable an obstacle with a wrong item, he died and has lost the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Chimera_(video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits:&lt;br/&gt;Shahid Ahmad: design&lt;br/&gt;Rob Hubbard: music (C74)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
