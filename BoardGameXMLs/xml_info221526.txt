			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future.

Hunger, Thirst, Sleep and Exposure all wear down on you in a battle of attrition with the unstoppable Dead. Find the answer to the question &amp;quot;just how long would I survive&amp;quot; as you and your friends attempt to do just that. What makes Z-Land unique is we take the survival aspect of survival-horror very seriously. You will see your character weaken as sleep deprivation, hunger &amp;amp; thirst slowly whittle them down. But that is where the choice comes in, will you just take it? Or will you do anything &amp;amp; everything necessary to survive? How much of yourself can you retain in your battle to survive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
