			<description>Acting as a Commander in the Space Voyage fleet, players construct, crew and kit out a ship to voyage amongst the stars, seeking out rare minerals, avoiding alien races and trying to return to Earth as the richest Commander of the Fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start by trying to complete your ship, which is mostly a luck-driven process, before launching the ship into the void.  Once launched, players try to land on mineral rich planets, but there are many hazards to avoid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when at least two ships have returned to Earth.  At this point there is a final semi-random determination of each player's holdings.  All loans are settled and the winner of the game is the player with the most money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
