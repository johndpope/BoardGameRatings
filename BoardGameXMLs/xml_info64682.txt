			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is often said that a lot can be learned about an individual race, by the level of hospitality they offer to others. The Lurker&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Starports provides gamers with a unique insight into the facilities boasted as the pride and joy of each major race. Some starports are designed to provide comfort and shelter to the weary traveller, whereas others are simply designed for commerce; some even cater for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lurker&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Starports is the first publication to provide in depth descriptions of varied space stations in the Babylon 5 universe. From the Abbai&amp;rsquo;s welcoming haven that is the Qui&amp;rsquo;Tain, to the corrupt, corporation run Vhros Plateau of the Brakiri, The Lurkers Guide to Starports is an essential survival guide for any space faring character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever a character is looking for, from a relaxing stop over to an easy way to smuggle goods, they will find all the information they need in this comprehensive guide, along with details of interesting characters they may encounter along the way, who could prove to be useful allies or potentially difficult enemies. Contained within is not only a guide to travelling in space but also valuable information for surviving it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
