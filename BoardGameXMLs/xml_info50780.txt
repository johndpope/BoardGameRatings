			<description>From the author's Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geiger Counter was designed to do two things: &lt;br/&gt;1) emulate movies in which most of the main characters eventually die and &lt;br/&gt;2) perform really well in single-session play, such as a pick-up or convention game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I originally aimed to replicate the fun of watching movies like Alien and Scream, but Geiger Counter can also create play that feels like Jurassic Park, Dawn of the Dead, Twister, Nightmare on Elm Street, Vertical Limit, Jaws, or even sobering fare such as Black Hawk Down or Saving Private Ryan. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m most excited about playing out movies that are too interesting to ever actually be made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
