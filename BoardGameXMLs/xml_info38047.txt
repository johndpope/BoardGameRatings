							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Battle of Brunete</name>
									
			<description>The Battle of Brunete (Spanish Civil War)&lt;br/&gt;5 &amp;ndash; 25th OF JULY 1937&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Brunete Campaign was the first Republican offensive in the Spanish Civil War after the failure of the Nationalist forces to conquer Madrid. An attack in the Brunete area, west of Madrid, was intended to relieve the capital from its siege under the Nationalists. However the campaign turned out to be a debacle with little success after initial breakthrough. &lt;br/&gt;The Battle of Brunete is a war game system simulating the Brunete battle, which was one of the crucial battles between the Nationalist and Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War. The Battle of Brunete simulation was designed for two players, one controlling the Republican units, representing the Loyalists, Anarchists, Communists, Liberals, and various International Brigades which were supported by the Soviet Union and the other player controlling the Nationalists, mainly Franco&amp;rsquo;s army, supported by German and Italian Fascists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game set consists of one &amp;ldquo;17 x 22&amp;rdquo; inch map sheet and one counter sheet of 90 counters (units and markers). Additionally players will need a 6 sided die for combat resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
