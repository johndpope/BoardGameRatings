							<name  sortindex="5">The Game of Phantom&#039;s Treasure</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spelet Om Fantomen-Skatten</name>
									
			<description>This game appears to have come as an insert in a Swedish comic book devoted to the superhero The Phantom.  The game map shows the Phantom's Island with four bases in each corner of the map representing the bad guys' lairs (Hydra, Scorpion, Vrakarna, and Singh Pirates).  I do not have an English translation of the rules.  From what I can surmise, the four criminal gangs are trying to steal the Phantom's treasures from the island.  The hex-shaped counters are printed on the same insert as the mapsheet, and must be cut out and mounted prior to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
