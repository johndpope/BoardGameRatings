			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 24 x 20 inch Floor Plan of a Street Ball Court, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play. The map suits Modern rpg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ain&amp;rsquo;t no fouls, ain&amp;rsquo;t no illegal moves. Only rules are no weapons on the court except the ball, out of bounds, three-point line for threes. The team with the highest points wins or the team with five men left standing at the end.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Street ball is a single map of an urban basketball half court (One basket only).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Street ball is intended for use in modern or near future science fiction settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hooks for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat Basketball: A local gang is running a combat basketball league. Punches, kicks, even hitting opponents with the basketball are all allowed. Whoever can endure the punishment the best can win the game through sheer toughness or with skill by scoring enough points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group ends up in this gang&amp;rsquo;s territory. The gang gives them the choice of a brutal beating for trespassing or being drafted into a combat basketball game. If they can win the game, the gang will respect them and let them enter and leave their territory freely, considering them honorary members of their gang. If they lose, they are thrown out of the gang&amp;rsquo;s territory and told to never return or they&amp;rsquo;ll finish the job next time. The group is given a few of the weakest gang members, enough to get their team up to a minimum of eight players (Starting five, plus a reserve guard, forward, and center). The Game Master can run this as either a critical skill resolution or as an actual combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
