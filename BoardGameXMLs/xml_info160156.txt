			<description>Magna Carta is a casual two-player card game with a medieval theme sporting easy to learn and play rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take turns drawing cards from a common draw pile, deploying troop cards, supporters cards and resources cards from their hand to the table in front of them and then attacking the opponent cards with the cards on the table. &lt;br/&gt;Each attack determines the number of cards the attacker draws from the draw pile as victory spoils. &lt;br/&gt;When the draw pile is exhausted, the game ends and the player with the most victory spoils wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 90 cards with various units like Infantry, Cavaly e t c, support cards like Fortress, Blacksmith e t c. Resources are the same cards but played face down.&lt;br/&gt;Several special units and supporters exist with special abilities which affects game play.&lt;br/&gt;Each troop/supporter card has deployment requirements, meaning that you need to deploy them in the right order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
