							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dwarven Glory: Looking Stones</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Days before Days there were many Dwarven Kingdoms, and they prospered. Their bastions sprawled across the wide world, above it and below it. They built roads across mountains and tunnels beneath them. The Rhodope Mountains, west of Kayomar, were no different. Here the Folk of Grausumhart came and they built mansions of stone, roads, bath houses and the like. They waxed powerful and grew wealthy on the fruit of their labors and the yield of the mountain's wealth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But in time war, plagues and other devestations left the Dwarven Glory in ruin and they vanished from their mansions and bound themselves in deep holes of halls of stone and iron. What remained fell into ruin, forgotten by all but the wandering monsters that haunt distant locales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dwarven Glory: Looking Stones is the first of a series of fast play adventure stories. Each of the adventures are playable as one shot scenarios. Some are loosely linked. Dwarven Glory takes place in the world of Aihrde (Erde, Earth, etc), in the southern Rhodope Mountains, the Smoking Giants. These mountains lie on the far western edge of the map as presented in the Codex by Troll Lord Games. Usage of Dwarven Glory in other settings or transplanted elsewhere in Aihrde is as easy as finding an old mountain chain on your map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an adventure for a smattering of characters of levels 4-6. It contains overland travel to a small dungeon. It is designed for the Castles &amp;amp; Crusades Role Playing Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
