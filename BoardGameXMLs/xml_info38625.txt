			<description>&amp;ldquo;The first English Civil War (1642 - 1645) was a power struggle between King Charles I and his Royalist supporters on the one hand, and Parliament and its supporters on the other. At the battle of Naseby (1645) the Parliamentarian New Model Army scored a major victory, thanks in large part to the exploits of Oliver Cromwell's cavalry. With his army on the brink of defeat King Charles was prepared to personally lead his reserves into battle. A subordinate asked the King &amp;lsquo;Will you go upon your death?&amp;rsquo; The King decided to retreat instead of continue the fight. This defeat effectively ended the hopes of the Royalists.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures mounted two per stand. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units portrayed in the game include commanders, musketeers, and pikemen. Players are also given the option to include cannons in the game, but these units are not included in the standard setup given that they failed to have a significant impact in the actual battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
