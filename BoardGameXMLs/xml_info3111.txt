			<description>Thumb On It, the bluffing game with bite! A sort of trick taking game with a trick. The 54 cards have 3 colors and values 1-9, but show snakes, each with or without fangs. Instead of chucking their cards on the table, players hold their chosen card out with their thumb covering the snake's head, disguising if the card is poisonous or not. Fang cards count as minus 1 point, toothless cards are plus 1point at the final score. Curiously, after the first trick, joining in the following tricks is optional, and players seem to need to play cards of increasing value to take part. The game includes a small blank notepad for scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 12 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
