							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SCRIOS: A Tabletop 3D Space Combat RPG</name>
									
			<description>From the Author:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In SCRIOS, players assume the roles of single-seat space craft pilots. Leveraging modern tablets and 3D-print-on-demand for custom game pieces helps create a unique tabletop game perspective.  SCRIOS still reaches for an old-school RPG feel&amp;ndash;no special equipment beyond a paper, pencil, and polyhedral dice are needed to enjoy&amp;ndash;in fact, anyone who&amp;rsquo;s played RPGs likely would never have to buy anything new to play. Even the core rulebook is distributed for free.  The game focuses on simple to follow rules in what is a traditionally complex genre&amp;ndash;ultimately, anyone who has played a traditional RPG should be able to sit down with a single sheet of quickstart rules and feel comfortable playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rule book is intended to be a living document, providing regular updates as new content is released, including additional space ships, equipment, character skills and design options, and tools for game masters (&amp;quot;Space Marshals&amp;quot;). The iBooks edition includes an interactive character sheet, and introductory mission, Trouble in Tango.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
