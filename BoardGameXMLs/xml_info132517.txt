			<description>Mirror, mirror, on the wall &amp;ndash; who has the most beautiful city of them all? It&amp;rsquo;s not an easy&lt;br/&gt;question &amp;ndash; in Remanum, twenty ancient cities compete for economic and political supremacy. The player takes on the role of a simple merchant whose family name has fallen into disrepute. The player&amp;rsquo;s mission is to return the family name to the fame and glory it deserves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player starts off with a modest estate that produces goods for sale at the highest possible price on the market. You can develop complex product chains to get better prices for your goods. For example, trees are cut into planks at a sawmill. These, in turn, are made into furniture than can be sold to generate enough money to buy more, top-quality raw materials. The player exchanges are filled with over a hundred wares of different quality and price. This is one of Remanum&amp;rsquo;s great strengths &amp;ndash; the game runs a fully-fledged commerce system in the background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is constantly calculating demand and supply for the entire game world &amp;ndash; something that is truly unique in the browser game genre. While most browser game publishers would be happy with this little gem just as it is, Remanum goes one, all-important step further. When players have enough money, they end up spending huge quantities to gain political influence. They can organize magnificent feasts on their estates, donate to the city treasury, or work together with other players to develop trading houses and temples. It is the interaction that Remanum players love. They can work together to make their city grander and more important. Convince enough of your fellow players of your qualities and they will vote you into office. You can then determine the fate of your city &amp;ndash; until the next vote. Up to 10,000 players compete in 6-month long rounds for the top places in city-wide and worldwide ranking lists. In Remanum, there is no need for negative activities such as raiding, robbing or discrediting other players. The only rules are those of the free market and&lt;br/&gt;the world of politics &amp;ndash; those can be tough enough!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creators of Remanum have achieved something that very few browser games manage &amp;ndash; to keep the game wonderfully simple despite its great complexity. Your success isn&amp;rsquo;t reflected by boring columns of statistics &amp;ndash; instead, you can see your city growing more magnificent and detailed. Despite its top quality gameplay and graphics, Remanum is free to play. Players who want an even better overview can invest a few dollars to access premium services with improved statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
