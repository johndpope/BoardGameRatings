							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Faerie Mysteries (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An innovative system for bringing the magic of the fey realms home to your campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the realms of mortal folk and immortal fey cross paths, strange and weirdling wonders appear! Sometimes dangerous, sometimes delightful, sometimes both intertwined in a passionate embrace. At least, that is what we want to happen when we bring the fey into a campaign: to create an atmosphere of absolute wonder and mystery. All too often, however, that magical vision in our minds just doesn't come through, and the fey end up as just another monster with a veneer of pretension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faerie Mysteries changes all of that with an innovative system of crossing over the warped reality where the influence of the fey makes itself known in the world. These fey impulses vary from rumors that are mostly atmospheric and sensory effects to ripples that disrupt and disturb creatures and objects to full-fledged ruptures that bring rapid and radical change both beautiful and bizarre. This system does for the fey what haunts do for undead, showing how their influence is not limited to simple encounters. That said, Faerie Mysteries also provides a wealth of sample encounters and events focused on the fey and the strange circumstances that may surround a meeting with them or may follow in their wake, and also deals with making subtle variations of existing non-fey creatures to provide unexpected challenges for creatures who think they know it all when it comes to fighting the fey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brought to you from the magical minds at Legendary Games, Faerie Mysteries also serves as a sequel to Faerie Passions, providing a rich mechanical supplement to the role-playing concepts and player options presented there. If you're running a campaign where the fey play a significant role, or even if you just want to inject a bit of magical mystery into your game, download this 29-page supplement today and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
