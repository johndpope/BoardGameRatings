			<description>Published in issue #4 of Dork Tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are at a game convention where they are being pursued by a monster.  The board represents the convention area of a hotel, composed of 25 rooms separated by 42 doorways. You need to provide a pawn for each, some pennies, 1D6 and a 'Master Pawn' to represent the monster. The object is to not be caught by the monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pennies represent tables blocking doorways. The board is set up with pennies in certain doorways, the monster in the middle space (the ballroom) and the players in certain rooms. Players take turns. On your turn, you roll the die and take that many steps from room to room. After each step you take, you may move a table from any doorway in that room to any other doorway in the room if you wish. Also after each step you take, the monster takes a step towards you via the shortest path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may not move through a blocked doorway nor into an occupied room, and you must take a step if you can. The monster can't move through blocked doorways and always takes the shortest unblocked path in pursuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player caught is the loser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
