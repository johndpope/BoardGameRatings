							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Geek Toys to Find in a Geek&#039;s Space</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is modern list of items, often electronic in nature, that could be found in a geek's lair, whether home, office or lab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These can be used to flesh out a location, or could be looted following an apocalypse. Many of the items are quite useful in nature, being powered or having cameras. Others are more decorative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some sample results are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;55. Phone Gloves (USB-rechargeable Bluetooth gloves with a built in microphone, speaker and touchscreen capabilities)&lt;br/&gt;56. Plushies (Plush toys in the shape of superheroes and characters from franchises such as Star Wars and Star Trek, possibly battery powered and talking)&lt;br/&gt;57. Power Bank (Smartphone-sized USB-rechargeable battery pack that will hold enough power to recharge a smartphone several times, can be turned off when not used)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first page of the supplement is the cover and most of the second the front matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
