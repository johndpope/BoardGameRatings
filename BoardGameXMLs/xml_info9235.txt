			<description>Gambo is played with a pack of 105 cards (4 sets of 1-26) and a joker). The object of the game is to get rid of one's cards by making or adding to combinations of cards on the table and forming sets and runs of cards. The player who first gets rid of all his ten cards wins the hand and is paid by each of the other players 3 chips for each card they have left in their hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
