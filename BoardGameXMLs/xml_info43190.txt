			<description>This auto racing simulation replay game comes with two versions, one for Indy Cars and one for NASCAR.  2009 edition comes with real-life drivers and stats based on 2008 season.  Game is available in print and play version and also via e-book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Downey Games website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Fast Lane Racing is the culmination of two years worth of design and testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Fast Lane Racing, we&amp;rsquo;ve covered all of the bases.  Every element of open wheel racing is covered from qualifying right down to the checkered flag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Fast Lane racing, drivers are rated separately for qualifying and racing, giving you an extremely accurate picture of each and every driver to get behind the wheel in the 2008 season.  To further enhance the realism, each driver is rated for the various track types run in the open wheel series.  Drivers are also rated for their ability to lead laps, how they perform during pit stops, and tendency to avoid mechanical failures.  You truly get an accurate representation of each driver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All tracks are individually rated as well.  Each track is rated for Pole Position Speed, number of caution flags, Racing Speed, and weather.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speaking of weather; how many times have you watched a race and heard the drivers and commentators talk about how the track has changed due to weather?  In Fast Lane Racing, we&amp;rsquo;ve replicated this most important facet of racing.  You&amp;rsquo;ll see the effects of a green track following heavy rains.  You&amp;rsquo;ll see drivers run faster laps at Indianapolis as the track closes and the track cools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And speaking of Indianapolis, we have replicated EVERY facet of the unique qualifying format of the world&amp;rsquo;s most famous race, right down to the bumping into the field!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast Lane Racing is not a quick play game.  However, we&amp;rsquo;ve compressed the racing into the most exciting elements, giving you a game that plays quickly.  With Fast Lane Racing, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to realistically complete an entire season.  A typical race and qualifying session takes approximately 40 to 60 minutes total.  If you use actual qualifiers and only run the races, you&amp;rsquo;ll consistently finish within 20 minutes.  And while we have compressed the racing, we have not cut corners.  You&amp;rsquo;ll &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; every detail of the race unfold right on your tabletop!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Fast Lane Racing Year Book contains everything you need to play.  There are no external &amp;ldquo;game parts&amp;rdquo; to buy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The printed games feature individual, die-cut driver and track cards, with everything packed in a sturdy game box.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
