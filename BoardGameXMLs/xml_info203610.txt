			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Karus, the Prophet King has ruled now, unopposed, for a century, using his strange powers to sustain and empower his failing body. As the practice of magic has spread, magic itself seems to have steadily grown in power. Likewise, the formerly legendary and now factual magical creatures have become common place despite the Church hunting them with tireless fanaticism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the Church is mighty, and its reach is far, every year, more and more of these mages are slipping through the cracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is only a matter of time before the rising tide of chaos and war threatens to drown the world of Purgatory. The question becomes, what then will be the aftermath&amp;hellip; heaven, or hell?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
