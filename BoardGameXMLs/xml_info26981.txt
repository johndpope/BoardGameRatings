							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tour de france</name>
									
			<description>Yet another very simple TdF game, with a (more-or-less) 3D-board. No date provided, but must be somewhere in the sixties (after the Dutch Jan Janssen won the Tour in '68?). Distributed by a large Dutch warehouse chain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use the spinner to determine the number of spots to move forward. Landing on 20 is (for some reason) mandatory to proceed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was released in the Netherlands by Hema and in Germany by Multiplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
