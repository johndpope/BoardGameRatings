			<description>This is a spin and move game by J. W. Spear &amp;amp; Sons.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a piece that is used to make your way around the board. The inside box cover which has the rules for the game calls the game &amp;quot;A trip on the continent&amp;quot;. By rolling dice players land on different spaces that cause either good or bad things to happen. Spot 13 says  &amp;quot; after hurrying to the wrong station you lose a turn&amp;quot;. Spot 25 says &amp;quot;sees the sights and lose a turn&amp;quot;. #40 says &amp;quot;on the right road, advance to space 46&amp;quot;. Many other things can happen while on your trip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to get to the finish line (#75) first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was manufactured at the SPEAR WORKS in Bavaria&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
