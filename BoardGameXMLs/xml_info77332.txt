			<description>Multiwinia follows its predecessor Darwinia, in which a computer scientist, Dr Sepulveda, created a digital world that existed within a computer network. This world, Darwinia, was inhabited by a two-dimensional digital life-form called Darwinians and was to become &amp;quot;the world's first digital theme park&amp;quot;. In Darwinia, the player eradicated a computer virus that infected the world and threatened the life of the Darwinians. After this, Dr Sepulveda deemed the world safe again. However, the virus had changed something in the Darwinians, and over time they became more aggressive, dividing into factions and fighting. Now labelled Multiwinians, the tribes continue to fight each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiwinia is a real-time strategy game with six different modes.[1] Each mode is designed to support between one and four players (human or CPU) and up to 50 unique maps of varying difficulties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Multiwinia,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
