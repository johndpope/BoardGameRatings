			<description>This 1931 title from All-Fair is a spin-and-move game with a twist. The 16-space spinner includes moves from 7 forward to 2 back. In addition, the players may move either the total of the two numbers at the pointer and base ends of the spinner, or the difference between them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is the usual-looking twisting track for movement, with some squares that have specific instructions. But the winner is not the player to get to the end of the track. Rather, the winner is the last glider to land, the one who can keep his playing piece up in the air the longest by avoiding either end of the track or a forced landing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
