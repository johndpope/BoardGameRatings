			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powers and Worlds is a bit of an anecdotal behind-the-scenes documentary mixed in with a &amp;quot;how to&amp;quot; guidebook. We'd been asked by the fans to give some help in designing Pulse-wielding powers in various settings, and it was something we really wanted to help out with. But wow! What a tall order! Of all the magic in all the worlds - how could we tackle such a huge task?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While creating the Weapons and Worlds list, the answer came to us; we'd do it the same way - by example. And that's how Powers and Worlds came about. Over the years of play testing different settings with the second edition Suzerain rules, we'd designed over a thousand feats, many of them Pulse powers. By taking some of those examples and talking about them, we hope you get a feel for the ways in which you can develop your own. We only scratch the surface in these pages - the rest is up to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
