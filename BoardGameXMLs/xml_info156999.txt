							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mayhem: Volume 1, Core Content</name>
									
			<description>from What is The Mayhem Game?:&lt;br/&gt;...In comparison to other role-playing games, Mayhem has been designed to stretch the tactical and creative capacities of the players as they pit their characters against the world at large, granting great creative freedom without losing the strategic combat that many players also enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Mayhem game stands on its own in both rules and content, but is designed to be both modular and flexible. Conversion tools are provided for adapting outside content, such as characters, monsters, adventures and abilities from d20 open gaming system, so that with a few tweaks, players and storytellers alike can tap into the wealth of content that has been created for these other games, while still keeping the rules and concepts that make the Mayhem game shine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book, Volume I, Core Content, is designed to walk a player through the Mayhem game, explain all of the core rules needed to run a game, and enough character content to keep players busy for some time. Further books will add to this content, giving players and storytellers more tools to use in writing their own stories, but this manual is where the game starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope you enjoy playing the game as much as we have enjoyed building it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user note:&lt;br/&gt;The black and white demo contains the same rules as the color version of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
