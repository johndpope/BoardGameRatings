			<description>From the cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This module includes floor plans of various buildings in the seven Harnic cities. While owning Cities of Harn is helpful, the floor plans in this module can be plugged into any fantasy town. ALEATH: Floor plans of the Palace of Aeldele, the town hall and royal mint of Kanday. Also includes the Guild of Arcane Lore, the beleaguered Aleathian Thieves' Guild, and a selection of businesses. CHERAFIR: Plans of the Alienage, Cherafir's &amp;quot;Foreigners' Quarter&amp;quot;. Also includes the Enclave of the Golden Orb, the primary Harnic college of Heralds. CORANAN: Plans of the Palace of Pentacles, one of the most powerful chapters of the Mangai on Harn. The plans of the House of Usel, one of Harn's better known gladiatorial schools are also provided. GOLOTHA: Plans of the temple of Morgath, perhaps the most evil place on Harn. Also includes plans of the dangerous &amp;quot;floating town&amp;quot; beneath Northaven Wharf. SHIRAN: Two of the &amp;quot;City of Sins&amp;quot; better known attractions are shown; the primary Harnic temple of Halea, and the Crimson Palace, Harn's most famous house of courtesans. TASHAL: Plans of the temple of Peoni, and a selection of four Tashalan inns. THAY: Plans of the Laranian temple, and seat of the Harnic primate of that church. Also includes plans of the ruined temple of Peoni.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
