							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fourth Horse</name>
									
			<description>The 4th Horse is a card game that combines the excitement of a fight to the finish with the intense strategy of chess. Two, three or four players may compete. Certain card combinations can be used to win bidding rounds or as special powers. The illustrations of cards are of a medieval style. There are 4 Horse Cards that can act as wild cards in their suits or if all 4 are played then the game can be won. Winning is also achieved by having 4 sequential royal cards of a suite and as the only player at the end of the turn to do so. Number cards can be played to attack when 4 cards in sequential order are played. Knives can remove cards of one suite from the play area, Thieves can steal all of a players cards, Swords can discard cards, Moon cards replicate other powers and also can eliminate a player. When playing cards, at least 2 cards in sequential order must be played. The challenge is deciding on whether to use the cards for their bidding value, save them to build sets or play them on  the table to show people what you are collecting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
