							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Article: Vehicles and Constructs</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules cover the description and use of vehicles within the game. Also covered are buildings and other non-living things. The generic term used is Construct. Also covered are the use of large vehicle mounted and infantry support weapons. Most characters will never need to worry about these, even in modern campaigns, but the occassional scenario will call for their use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This article describes the uses and abilities of various vehicles in the Yags Modern world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
