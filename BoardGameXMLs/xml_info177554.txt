			<description>War of Wonders is a skirmish miniature game set in an alternate, grim World War II fought by superhuman beings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Details:&lt;br/&gt;War of Wonders Miniature Game is a fast paced 30mm strategic skirmish game based on the deeply immersive setting of Project H.O.P.E. RPG by authors Simone Fini and Riccardo Giuliani, published by Limana Press.&lt;br/&gt;In War of Wonders extraordinary human beings with powers beyond imagination fight on WW II battlefields alongside regular troops and iconic heavy tanks to change History. National heroes, monsters born in laboratories and mysterious beings with their own secret goals: every and each of them will add new tactics, game options and strategies to your games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting:&lt;br/&gt;Nazi Germany declares war on Europe, and its army is unstoppable. Prodigious beings appear on the battlefields to support the Wehrmacht's efforts: flying men shower flames upon the enemy; women wearing iron masks punch through tank armour; bloodthirsty beasts devour entire regiments. The world is about to succumb to the might of the Third Reich. Aaron Spiegelmann, a Jewish scientist who escaped from the Mauthausen concentration camp, is the only hope for the Allied Forces to stop the Nazis. Spiegelmann is the genius who created the Wunderkammer, a new technology that allowed the Germans to create real superheroes with extraordinary powers. With his guidance, the US Army launches Project H.O.P.E. in order to produce their own genetically modified humans to be deployed on the battlefields. As the war rages on and every army creates its own Meta-Humans and war machines, Natural Prodigies, unscrupulous Adventurers and even secretive groups of Warlocks step into battle. From the European battlefields to the Pacific Islands, a conflict like never before is unleashed and spreads with no boundaries: humanity will forever remember it as the first War of Wonders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
