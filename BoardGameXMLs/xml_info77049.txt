							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Progress Quest</name>
									
			<description>Progress Quest is an application created as a parody of EverQuest and other massively multiplayer online role-playing games. It is loosely considered a zero-player game, in the sense that once the player has set up his artificial character, there is no user interaction at all; the game &amp;quot;plays&amp;quot; itself, with the human player as spectator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Progress Quest parodies the stat-gathering aspect of computer role-playing games, whereby the player advances his character by accumulating arbitrary statistic points. [...] Progress Quest also pokes fun at traditional RPG races, classes, stories, quests, items, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Progress Quest,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
