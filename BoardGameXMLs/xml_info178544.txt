			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All throughout the galaxy lazy people make robots do stuff, especially the dangerous stuff. Politicians find it easier to make robots kill people and break things, because robots won&amp;rsquo;t have conscientious objections when the politician wants it to do something nasty. Corporations would rather buy a robot for laborious work than deal with galactic worker treatment laws or injury compensation. Heck &amp;ndash; a robot doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to take cigarette breaks or even sleep. It&amp;rsquo;s honestly a wonder why there are any jobs left for us flesh &amp;amp; blood types in the galaxy at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within these pages are eleven detailed robot &amp;ldquo;creatures.&amp;rdquo; Each represents a model of robot your characters might come into contact with during their adventures. From security robots to war bots and just about everything in between, these stat blocks come complete with XP award values and even how much it costs to buy the robot yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These robot models are not intended to replace the robot character class. Indeed, players should certainly use that class if they want the challenge of role-playing a robot. But for those times when you just need a quick stat block for an astro-tech bot, service bot, or protocol bot, this supplement is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hyperspace Messenger is a series of short supplements designed for use with the White Star role-playing game, though it uses simple concepts which can easily be integrated into any OSR-style science fiction game. The goal is to deliver quality supplements exploring a single concept all within the span of only six-to-twelve pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
