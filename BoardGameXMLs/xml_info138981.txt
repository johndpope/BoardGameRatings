			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fix-It Felix, Jr. is a platform game in the style of early 80s arcade games - indeed the title screen claims &amp;quot;Tobikomo co. 1982&amp;quot;. In fact, the game was released in 2012 as part of Disney's promotion of &amp;quot;Wreck-It Ralph&amp;quot;, a film which ostensibly takes place inside this arcade game and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fix-It Felix, Jr. most closely resembles the classic Donkey Kong (released in 1981) with a small protagonist making his way up a building in pursuit of a much larger character. However the gameplay is very different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set on the outside of a large residential building in &amp;quot;Niceland&amp;quot;, the game starts with Wreck-It Ralph climbing the building and pounding it with his fists such that many of the windows break. The distressed residents cry &amp;quot;Fix It Felix!&amp;quot;. At this point the user gains control of the eponymous Felix. Felix can move in four directions, jumping from window-ledge to window-ledge. Using his magic hammer he can repair a pane of glass. In the arcade and browser versions, three stories of the building are in play at any one time. When Felix has repaired each of the windows of those three stories, the game moves up to the next three stories and the game repeats. After completing a number of screens (two in the arcade version, three or more depending on level in the browser / mobile versions) Felix and Ralph reach the top of the building. The residents pick up Ralph and throw him off the roof. The game starts again at the bottom of a new building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Felix's job is made more difficult by Ralph continuing to pound the building, causing bricks to fall which must be avoided. Birds fly across the building which must also be avoided. In later levels drainpipes, etc. block Felix's path between different windowledges, forcing him to find alternative routes. Felix can pick up pies provided by the building residents which grants him temporary invulnerability and in some versions allows his hammer to fix entire windows at once rather than one pane at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fix-It Felix was available as a browser game on the Disney website and as an app on a number of platforms - either standalone, or as part of a compilation with three other games also featured in the Wreck-It Ralph film. It was also released as a full-size arcade cabinet to promote the film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
