							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Table Bowls</name>
									
			<description>Played seriously in parts of Northern England and Australia, Table Bowls gives Snooker and Pool players something new and fun. The game is played just like bowls on a lawn except each wood is carefully aimed using a special wooden chute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A skillful game for two players, table bowls is designed to be played on a billiards table or other flat surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two different sizes of table bowls - 5.1cm (2 inch) and 5.7cm (2 1/4 inch) in diameter and two corresponding sets. Each set consists of a hardwood chute, an unbiased jack and 4 pairs of table bowls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2 inch set features 4 pairs of bowls, each pair with a different bias. Jack is 1.25 inches diameter. &lt;br/&gt;The bowls in the 2 1/4 inch set all have the same bias. Jack is 1.5 inches diameter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
