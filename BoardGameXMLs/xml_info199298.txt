							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Grimoire (Issue 5 - Mar 2007)</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A look at the nobility class and knighthood as they apply to Durine, as well as an examination of the heraldry and its prestigious colleges found throughout Durine. Also includes background and options for creating noble, knightly and herald characters. This issue also takes a look at Listerham, a modest keep known for its great fair and tournament as much as for it's inn built in the branches of a gigantic oak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
