			<description>Simple luck-based children's game. There are 7 carrots of different lengths which are put into a central &amp;quot;device&amp;quot; in the middle of the table. A rabbit is put on top, resting on the carrot tips. Everything is spun around to let the players forget which carrot is where. The players then roll dice to determine how far to pull out an individual carrot. When a carrot comes out completely, the player can keep it. The game ends when the rabbit falls (when it is no longer supported by enough carrot tips). The player with most carrot is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
