							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Capes Lite</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capes is a radical departure from many roleplaying games. For many groups, it provides the tools to create better stories and&lt;br/&gt;enjoy the process more. But it's genuinely not right for every group. This document should help you get some idea of what it's&lt;br/&gt;about, and run your group through a quick session of the game.&lt;br/&gt;This document assumes that you're familiar with more traditional forms of roleplaying already. If you've somehow happened upon&lt;br/&gt;this document without ever having played another game then what follows may sound a bit nonsensical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;Capes Lite presents the fundamentals of the Capes game, and makes it available as a free download.  In Capes, there is no GM and D6 dice are used fairly sparingly to determine success of opposed actions.  Character building is very rapid using pre-generated &amp;quot;click together&amp;quot; modules; the Lite version of the game does not have rules for creating your own modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
