			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wield power unimaginable as an Erkunae- the Favored Sons of Chaos!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New race for the amazingly popular Dungeon Crawl Classics' RPG game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the ancient mists of time the ancestors of the erkunae, neither elf nor man, made sorcerous and dire pacts with the Beast Elders of long ago, and promised their souls and the souls of the race, down through the eons to the capricious Lords of Chaos, unknowable beings of mercurial whim. With innate spells of summoning and controlling beasts and monsters, and gaining power through beseeching the Chaos Lords themselves, the erkunae ruled their sphere of influence for millennia.  Their influence has waned over the centuries, and today they mostly brood and squabble in their fantastic and warped Misty City of G&amp;rsquo;sho&amp;rsquo;laa&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;rr, which sprawls over an entire island.  But under the strength of a new Opal Throne Emperor, they could be great again!  The dragon-riders could fly once more to dominate the world&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Races of Porphyra: Erkunae by Purple Duck Games has everything you need to introduce this mystical race of Chaos worshippers into your DCC game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Statistics for creating erkunae characters, 0-level and up&lt;br/&gt;    Realms of Summoning for the erkunae- or for other wizards who want ready stats for the spells animal summoning or monster summoning&lt;br/&gt;    A new spell, pledge to chaos- ritual of worship for the erkunae, and doorway to power granted from the Lords of Chaos!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The erkunae are unlike any other race in the DCC world, thralls to the whim of Chaos, which can lead them to great power or lay them low to grovel at the feet of entropy.
