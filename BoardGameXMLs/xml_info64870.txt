			<description>Taken from the official website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golf Board Game: GolfEgo&amp;trade;&lt;br/&gt;...... a great way to play the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GolfEgo is fun! It's easy to understand and play, whether you're a regular golfer or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now everyone can play a round of golf, young and old and right at home. And just as exciting as the real game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GolfEgo&amp;trade; is an innovative board game based on golf. Like when you are playing outside on the green, this board game is a challenge to your Ego. Play 9, 18 or just a few holes. Create your own rules, or play one of the available games like stroke play, match play, skins or fun golf, a kind of Ludo...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 4 pawns represent the players and have been designed just for this game, and so are the 4 dices which are the virtual clubs in your bag. So with GolfEgo&amp;trade; you can decide which one to use. Playing safe or taking a risk, just like the real thing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself:&lt;br/&gt;Much attention has been given to detail. Inside the colourful box there is a nicely designed board which covers 18 holes (9 holes each side). The board features ponds, bunkers and greens. It even has a clubhouse! Of course the box is delivered to you with dices, pawns and a notebook for writing down the scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
