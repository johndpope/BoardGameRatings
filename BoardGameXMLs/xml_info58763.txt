			<description>From the Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Road Rebels is the first role playing game designed with the serious role player in mind.  In this very complete basic game are 16 pages of weapons of all technology levels, 30 pages of cars, trucks, buses, tractor trailers, and motorcycles, several creatures, poisons, acid, diseases and special equipment.  An entire chapter is devoted to advanced combat rules that include fighting underwater, strangling, back stabbing, street fighting, and various other ways to thrash an opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vehicles can be highly modified with weapons, armor, handling modifications and engine modifications such as nitrous oxide, turbo chargers, or super chargers.  Characters may drive their vehicles on or off road, in smow or in mud, up or down hills, run over buildings, cars, cats, or pedestrians that are in the way.  Forget speed limits, road signs, and slow drivers.  In Road Rebels when someone cuts you off you can cut him out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters can become highly skilled in combat, in driving, stealth, perception or other obtainable skills.  Characters may use any type of weapon including flame throwers, acid spraying guns, explosives, explosive ammo, swords, axes, clubs, knives, baseball bats, pool sticks, whips, chains, crossbows, pistols, rifles, shotguns, broken weapons or whatever else a character can get a hold of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To survive in the world of Road Rebels one should be 12 years or older, be armed with a six and ten sided die, and be ready to take on the challenge of the exciting new world of Road Rebels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
