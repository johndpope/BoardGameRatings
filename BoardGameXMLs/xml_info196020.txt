			<description>The world is covered in fog. Most who enter the fog disappear, and those who survive say it brings their nightmares to life.&lt;br/&gt;No-one knows where it came from, but they all have ideas. Some say it's an experiment gone wrong, others say it's divine judgement. And you? All you know is that the Sun is rumored to shine just over the horizon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are The Engineer. You have designed the perfect system: a train, sealed off from the fog, ready to rescue survivors and take them to salvation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If only they'd listen...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manage up to 150 passengers, build defenses, upgrade the train, and optimize the engine's power, fuel and speed.  Monitor your passengers' dream logs to discover what kind of horrors will attack the train.  Send passengers out into the fog to investigate locations, find survivors and bring back supplies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
