			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What This Game is About: This is a freeform game about injury, privilege, and the social effects on those with injures. The subject material is serious, and should be handled with sensitivity. It is meant to model experiences of the loss of mobility, and how this is treated socially. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t pretend to address the physical and emotional aspects of dealing with injury &amp;ndash; while some attempt has been made to model fatigue, anything else is too big to have under one umbrella.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
