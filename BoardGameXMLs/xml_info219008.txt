			<description>From cassette inlay&lt;br/&gt;Punch and Judy is based on the popular traditional seaside show in which you take the role of Mr. Punch. Your task involves constructing the show booth, finding the rest of the cast and finally taking part in the show itself. (A thrill a minute task).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy, eh? Not so because the eight parts needed to to build the the booths are scattered around the town and must be found and taken one by one to the beach. However certain pieces are too large to be carried through narrow doorways and the tide is slowly coming in. (Oh no; behind you! Behind you!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the booth has been build, you must scour the town for the other cast members, hit them (that's the way to do it!) and lead them to the beach. Unfortunately Punch's progress may be hindered by the presence of a snap-happy crocodile or a patrolling policeman (ello, ello, ello) If you are bitten by the crocodile the tide will come in further. If you on the other hand are arrested, you will be taken to the police station and any object or person youu have with you will be taken elsewhere. There are ways to avoiding these hazards! Can you find them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the booth and cast are assembled at the beach, the show will commence... (That's the way to do it!)...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
