							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spill the Beans</name>
									
			<description>This undated dexterity game consists of a pistol that shoots wooden darts, a wooden pot and post containing 8 round wooden beads (the beans), and a target area, with 13 holes valued 5 to 25, inset in the box bottom. The pot is filled with the beans and placed on top of the post, which is inserted in a hole at the front of the target area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules say players should shoot from a distance of 8-10 feet, and get three shots each. When they hit the pot, it spills the beans onto the target area. Any that fall into holes count that many points. Any that remain loose are replaced in the pot for the next shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner is the first player to accumulate 250 points. Since the maximum possible score from a single round is 100, a game will last at least three rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
