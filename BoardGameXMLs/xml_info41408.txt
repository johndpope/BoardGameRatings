							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slam Word Solitaire</name>
									
			<description>A privately-produced word card game that has the rare attribute of only having rules for solitaire play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 88 letter cards in the deck.  They are dealt into 3 rows of 4 cards each.  At each &amp;quot;turn&amp;quot;, make a word from the cards in one row only -- each word must have at least 3 letters, but they don't have to be used in the order they are placed in their row.  Remove the word just made from the layout, then replace the cards used with new cards from the deck, and add an extra card at the end of the two rows not used for the word.  After the whole deck is dealt out, you may make words from the entire layout, not just from one row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If at any point you cannot make a word when you need to, you lose.  If you use up the entire deck with words, you achieve a Baby Slam.  If you use up the deck while always making words from one row only, you achieve a Grand Slam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
