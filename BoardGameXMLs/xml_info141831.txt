			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tired of dungeons lacking in verisimilitude? Want to add cool little features of interest to your creations but don't have the time to come up with nonessential details? Want to make your dungeons feel more realistic?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then Dungeon Dressing is for you! Each instalment in the line focuses on a different common dungeon fixture such as stairs, pillars or pools and gives the harried GM the tools to bring such features to life with interesting and cool noteworthy features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This instalment of Dungeon Dressing presents three clever trap encounters to add to your dungeon. Designed to be used both during preparation or actual play, Dungeon Dressing: Fiendish Traps I is an invaluable addition to any GM's armoury!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Dressing: Fiendish Traps I presents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Die (EL 3): Trapped in a locked chamber blasted by elemental energies, the PCs must find the correct pass code to escape!&lt;br/&gt;    Optional Extras (EL 9): Deep in the dungeon, the PCs come across a Shoppe of the Arkane, but the proprietor is less than honest and tries to cheat them of their hard-won gold!&lt;br/&gt;    Unbalanced Morality (EL 6): The PCs&amp;rsquo; morality - not their weight - determines if they manage to traverse this finely balanced corridor of if they tumble into the pit below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
