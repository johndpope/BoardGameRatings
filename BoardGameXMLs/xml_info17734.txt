			<description>The publishers call this collectible card game &amp;quot;da first and only game for the hip-hop generation.&amp;quot; The unrated version of the game contains references to profanity, violence and drug use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player builds a deck of fifty cards. No more than two of the same type of card in each deck. The decks are shuffled separately and each player (excuse me, playa) maintains a hand of five cards. Players alternate taking turns by drawing a card from one's own deck and playing cards on one's self or on the opponent where determined advantageous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory points are gained and loss through card play. (Go to jail: gain six points, read a book: lose three points.) If your score drops below negative ten points you have automatically lost. If your score gets to twenty you have automatically won. The player with the most points when both players have gone through their decks is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
