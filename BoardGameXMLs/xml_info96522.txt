			<description>From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Curse of the Land of Rolan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evil curse of Rolan was not to be stopped by the two knights who managed to vanquish Barius. For years, he dwelled in darkness, seething over his defeat, and vowing to one day return...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terror ripped through the countryside as monsters of old arose to threaten the people of Rolan. Quickly, they advanced to destroy castles, ruin crops, and strike fear in the villages. Few remembered the curse that forever lingered over the land...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They were about to pay for their ignorance...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;King Barius is back, with a vengeance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
