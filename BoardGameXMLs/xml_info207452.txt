			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wasteland Crafting is a rules supplement inspired by popular TV-shows, movies and video games and is made for use with the Cypher System Rulebook by Monte Cook Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is intended to replace the crafting rules presented in the Cypher System Rulebook to simplify crafting and further empower characters, in particular in post-apocalyptic and survival settings that feature somewhat crude and simplistic technology. These rules uses abstract, general materials along with refined systems to simplify crafting during your role-playing sessions. Also included are rules for quick repairs, modifications for home-made guns and vehicles, as well as an equipment list to get you started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
