							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">From The Files Of Matthews Gentech</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am recording this testament to my genius for future generations.  I, Samuel Andrew Matthews, Greatest Thinker of this Age, am about to launch Project Dies Irae- The Day of Wrath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have spent the last three years collating and analysing the myriad data pertaining to the superpowered murderers tthat roam Empire City.  Especially the Guard- my most hated foes- whose very existence makes my blood burn.  Soon they, along with their allies, will be hunted down and destroyed mercilessly.  God is said to have created the world in seven days.  I have a more modest goal:  in seven weeks I will be ready to wipe out the metahuman abomination from my city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To avoid interruptions and distractions, I have sealed myself away int he secret labs beneath my skyscraper.  My only companioun will be my loyal ursine pet, Montgomery.  I will need to discipline him, though, for shattering the Thulian chemical vials during his battle with Slipstream and Caliburn., and spilling the liquid samples on himself. . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
