			<description>Crazy Mix is a card game about shapes with four different properties: shape, size, colour and fill. Each game is a race to determine the correct set of properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with two sets of cards. There is a set of twenty target cards, that each show two shapes. These cards are aranged in a square. Then, four cards from the code deck are drawn. Each of these cards show a single shape. The players must now find the card that has the same shape as the first card, the same colour as the second card, the same fill as the third card and the same size as the fourth card. If a player thinks he has found the right card, he puts his finger down on the matching target card. If his guess is correct, he gains a number of the code cards as a reward. If his guess is wrong, he loses a card he has gained before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Halfway through the game, things will get a bit more complex. The target cards are flipped over, and now show shapes in secondary colours. From now on, in order to determine the colour for the target card, the players must mix the colour of the shape on the code card with the background colour of the code card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there are too few code cards left to create a new assignment. The player that has gained the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
