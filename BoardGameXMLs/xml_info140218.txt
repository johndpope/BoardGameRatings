							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fairy Mischief</name>
									
			<description>Designed by Jay and Susie Hernishin for their daughter, Fairy Mischief is a light game designed to help younger gamers transition into more advanced gaming with the goal of making more girl analog gamers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the roles of fairies competing in displays of magic. The fairies will duel one another over colorful gem pieces that are randomly drawn from a satchel (watch out for the powerful black stones that grant special abilities). When one fairy has won a gem of each of the five colors, they win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic game uses the classic game of War (players win duels by flipping over the top three cards of their deck and comparing who has the highest cards in a best-of-three fashion) combined with other elements to introduce the players to &amp;quot;gamery&amp;quot; skills (collection, special powers, and randomness).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also more advanced ways to play, so the game can grow with or adapt to kids. New concepts include (push-your-luck, hand ranks, informed guessing, discard pile awareness, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
