							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vinland</name>
									
			<description>In the darkness of the winternight the young men gathered around the fire, listening to the old man's tale. He claimed to be one of the men, who once discovered the fabled lands of Vinland. But was it true? Even as the old man left, his stories remained, took root in the dreams and desires of men. Most of them kept dreaming but some brave or foolish enought were ready to leave their lifes behind and become legends, or die trying. &lt;br/&gt;This is their Story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Vinland, the Players take the role of two of four characters from the Vinland Saga, the merchant brothers Helgi and Finnbogi, the fierce shieldmaiden Freyd&amp;iacute;s and her brother Leif Eir&amp;iacute;ksson, children of Erik the Red and in their shadow, Eyiolf Thorgestsson seeking revenge for a blood depth. Adventures and fame will welcome the brave, if they survive the sea of storms and blood, entangled in a net of betrayal and ambition. &lt;br/&gt;The first version of Vinland will follow the characters on their travel across Greenland, past the frozen island of bears and beyond the deep forests of Markland. The Game can be either played as a racing game, to reach Vinland first, or as a co-op game on a shared expedition. Vinland will be a 18 Cards game and tries to merge the dense historical references with a light encountersystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coop Game:&lt;br/&gt;The theme resolves around the fabled Continent of Vinland (America) discovered by Vikings way ahead of Columbus. The player have to play two members of an expedition into the unknown West. Its a coop game in which they have to survive Weather on land and sea, encounter Wild Animals and rediscover lost settlements, ruins and gravesides of former expeditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game ends, when they cross the last of the seven sea(card)s and may reach Vinland. Its not about the arrival in Vinland, but about the Journey of the Vikings to that fabled place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
