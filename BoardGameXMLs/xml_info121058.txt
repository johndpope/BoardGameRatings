			<description>Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: Azer casts Magic Missile at the carnivorous plant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: The plant uses his Tremorsense to find your location and launches two tentacles at you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: You can&amp;rsquo;t use Tremorsense to find me - I didn&amp;rsquo;t move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. Casting the spell counts as physical activity. Here, let me find the rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a familiar scene. A simple, logical progression of combat leads to the game grinding to a halt as books are opened and rules are referenced. This is particularly true when dealing with all the unique abilities monsters possess in combat. All those seemingly conflicting rules and minor variations can lead to a major headache and a stoppage of game play. Well, have no fear; your friends at Healing Fireball Publications have the answer to this problem in the form of the Combat Cards. The Combat Cards: Monstrous Tactics are a collection of index card-sized cards with a quick reference to some of the most common monstrous combat rules. From Improved Grab, to Tremorsense, to Breath weapons, all the most common monstrous combat abilities are right here. Never stop to search through a book again - with Combat Cards the rules are at your fingertips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set of cards contains both a set of the color cards and the printer-friendly black and white set of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Publisher Blurb]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
