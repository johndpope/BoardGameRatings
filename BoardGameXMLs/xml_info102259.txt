			<description>The beautifully handcrafted, handfinished 17&amp;quot; wood board is laser-engraved on both sides, with handpainted accents. The larger grid accommodates 8 pieces each, numbered 1 through 8, for the two-player game and comes with 4 octahedral dice that let you roll up to the number 8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the other side of the board there is a 3-player version accommodating a simultaneous 3 player game with the original 6 pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MANOOVER PLUS FOR THREE PLAYERS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the three-player game, use the side of the Manoover Plus board that has three goals. The players are known as &amp;ldquo;Red,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Blue,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Green,&amp;rdquo; and each has six pieces of his color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start a game, each player throws one die, and the one throwing the highest number goes first. If two or more players tie with the same high number, then those who tie throw again. After the first player takes his turn, the turn proceeds clockwise around the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three-player game is generally the same as the game for two players. Each player&amp;rsquo;s turn consists of a control phase where one player rolls the dice that corresponds to the numbers on each of their pieces. For each number rolled they are allowed to move the piece in the direction it is facing or turn the piece one to the right or left. If a piece has been pushed/moved off the board or has already been scored the player gets one chance to re-roll that die. This is then followed by an automatic phase where all of the player's pieces move once in the direction it is facing regardless of consequence. Each player tries to get pieces (of any color) to enter his hexagonal goal near the center of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MANOOVER PLUS FOR TWO PLAYERS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the game Kate Jones created on the suggestion of a customer who liked the standard version but wanted something more complex. Each player has eight pieces instead of six, and the players throw four 8-sided dice to determine which four pieces to move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
