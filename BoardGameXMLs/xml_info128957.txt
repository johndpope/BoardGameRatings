			<description>Children's card game that calls for bluffing to win. 44 cards provided: 6 of each Ingredient card, 6 Pepper cards, 6 Broomstick cards and 2 reminder cards of the order that must be followed when announcing Ingredients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a hand of cards and must play them all first to win. The ingedients are;&lt;br/&gt;1. Citrouille (Pumpkin)&lt;br/&gt;2. Crapauds (Frogs)&lt;br/&gt;3. Asticots (Worms&lt;br/&gt;4. Araignees (Spiders&lt;br/&gt;5. Champignons (Mushrooms)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game mechanic relies on the popular playing card game Cheat. The first player chooses a card and announces &amp;quot;Citrouille&amp;quot; (in a high voice the rules says!). If he does not have such a card, he must choose one anyway and announce it as if it was the correct card. If not challenged, he can discard the card on to the discard pile. If challenged and it is correct or incorrect, the offending player (either the player or the challenger) must draw extra cards as a penalty. Then it is the next player's turn and he must announce &amp;quot;Crapauds&amp;quot; and choose a card, and follow the same rules. The next player announces &amp;quot;Asticots&amp;quot;, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poivre cards and Balai cards add to the fun. A Poivre (Pepper) card played means that your turn passes to the next player. And if a Balai (Broom) card is played and challenged, the challenger tales all the cards in the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get rid of all their cards, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
