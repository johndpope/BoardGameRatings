							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great Library (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kazzak the Impure, a recently matured dark naga, has recently been banished from the intrigues and horrors of his mother&amp;rsquo;s nest. Like the rest of his foul reptilian race, Kazzak is paranoid, covetous and domineering. However, unlike the rest of his nest, a vile contamination within Kazzak&amp;rsquo;s bloodline has recently surfaced; Kazzak is struggling with the earliest stages of his burgeoning sorcerous powers and is naturally drawn to the dark powers of necromancy. However, his skills are weak and untried; the dark naga has not yet developed sufficiently to gain any levels in sorcerer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, fortune has favoured Kazzak. Having easily dominated or bound a small number of followers to his side, his group have helped him locate and enter an ancient library deep beneath a set of scorched ruins. He has successfully defended his new home against a number of treasure hunters and interlopers, whilst steadily reading the many tomes and librams that surround him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
