			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;A Roleplaying Game of Horrors, Secrets, and Legends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You would give anything to be normal. What is normal? Normal is not having to live on the streets because you can't keep a job and your family can no longer get along with you. Normal is not knowing the truth about reality - that it is engineered by creatures of Darkness. Normal is not having to cope with strange powers which afflict you. No, none of this is normal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unbidden is a game of modern horror - both psychological and real. It presents a world where evil terrorizes the weak and a handful of desperate men and women, cast out of normal society, are mankind's only hope. This unique game focuses on the character's journey from mortal to strangely powered outcast, struggling to survive with the help of others like him, for living beside mortals drives them mad. Will you join the fight against the Darkness, accepting your role in destiny or fight who you have become and struggle to rejoin society?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
