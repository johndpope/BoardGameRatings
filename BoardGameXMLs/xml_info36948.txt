			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tricky quest for shiny seashells&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compete against other players in search for the most valuable seashells. Build a path that leads to the longest rows of shells to get massive points. Use your branches and curves, build over other cards to cut-off the others path. With the right card you can even dig-out other cards. Place your pawn wisely to get double score. If you manage to connect to paths together, you may even get the other player's score. With three cards on hand you can plan your path carefully, but still the other players may manipulate your path. Also take care not to concentrate on certain kinds of shells only, since the lower scored-shells also count at the end. The war goes off at the middle of the gameboard, it's getting crowded there! Will you stay cool?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shellz is a tricky building-game. You sometimes have to &amp;quot;think around the corner&amp;quot;. Don't let the beautiful shells distract you - it's a tough game for big brains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2 to 4 players Ages 10 and up, 30 - 45 minutes playing time. English instructions included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
