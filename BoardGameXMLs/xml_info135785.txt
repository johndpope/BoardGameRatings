			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My fascination with Burning Wheel started when I was looking for a different system to run my fantasy games under. I stumbled across BW on the Forge. Ever since I read my first article and received the books in the mail I've been chained to the Wheel in a very good way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I wondered how to introduce my players to the system. We ran the Sword (available at the BW website) and another short adventure. My players and I were excited but still didn't quite have the feel for the system. I pondered &amp;ldquo;Can you run an old school dungeon crawl using BW.&amp;rdquo; I hit up the BW forums at and found many discussion on how to do this very thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You hold before you (or are reading on the screen) a book done with kind permission from many people who are very passionate about BW. What follows is a compilation of discussion from the BW forums about running old school dungeon crawls in the BW system. I hope this is useful to others and it brings back that old school feeling but with a very new vision about how things should be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
