			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uroboros is an ancient symbol depicting a serpent eating its own tail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uroboros is a 2 player area enclosure game played on the spaces of a 7&amp;times;9 board and a supply of black and white stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with an empty board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose a color: White or Black.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting with White, a player&amp;rsquo;s first stone is placed on any empty space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player&amp;rsquo;s second stone is placed adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to their first stone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* This determines a &amp;ldquo;movement direction&amp;rdquo;, e.g. east. A player will typically continue placing stones in the same direction, creating a long snake-like group as play progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each later stone, a  player may  place a new stone adjacent to the previous stone in the same direction as the previous stone was placed (e.g. also east), or changes direction, skipping one space (occupied or empty) and placing the new stone in the space (which must be empty) immediately after the skipped space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues in this fashion until the last player able to place a stone wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
