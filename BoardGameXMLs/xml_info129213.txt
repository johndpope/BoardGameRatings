			<description>Shareware Version Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[The Land] is based on the trilogy  &amp;quot;The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant&amp;quot;  written by Stephen R. Donaldson.  If you like fantasy type  reading  I strongly recomend you read this series of books.&lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;OBJECT: This game belongs to the Rogue genre of games.  You  create  a character,  travel  the  lands  and dungeons in search of treasure and magic.  There is a main goal to this game that you will discover while you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SERVICE: All characters have some vow or oath to follow,  This is followed by giving  a certain amount of time to their cause.  This service must be rendered, for if it is not  then  the  characters  abilities  will  be reduced.   The amount of service changes from class to class and level to level.  Basicly start with 6 months of service per year and  add  1 month  every  five  levels.   The actual schedule of service is in the full documentation for the program.  The only class that does not have to  perform any service are the giants.  This service must be given at the players starting point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
