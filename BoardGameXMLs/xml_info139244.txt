			<description>F-16 MRF is a flight simulation which is focused on the F-16 Fighting Falcon. It was released by Novalogic in 1998.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;F-16 MRF is a reasonably accurate simulation, especially when compared to most console arcade-style games such as Namco's Ace Combat series and Konami's Airforce Delta series. Features modeled in the game include limited ammunition quantities (important to consider when playing through campaigns), fuel levels, and flight characteristics; the player must also learn to deal with things like engine flame-outs, flat spins, redouts and blackouts (affected by the g-forces) so the player must quickly learn to compensate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Campaigns in F-16 MRF vary and take place across the globe; featuring locations such as: Serbia, Burma, Liberia, Somalia and Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;F-16 Multirole Fighter&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
