			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the height of the cold war and the top secret plans to the &amp;ldquo;MX Program&amp;rdquo; have been safely deposited at an undisclosed location. Only you and every other spy in the city knows this. Find the plans and get them back to CIA headquarters and look out for the enemy agents, They're everywhere!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Russki Duck is an action game with a top-down perspective of the city and building interiors. The single city screen has stores facing two one-way streets with a park in the middle. Enemy Agents (Purple dots) will not bother you (White dot) while on the streets, But once you go inside a building they'll recognize your smiling face and try to kill you. Each building holds different items that the enemy agents will steal and move to another building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
