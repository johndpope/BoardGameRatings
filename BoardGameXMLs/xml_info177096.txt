			<description>The Free Besieged is a card-driven wargame set during the Greek War of Independence. It simulates the 3rd siege of the city of Messolongi with one player controlling the Turkish-Egyptian forces coming to take over the city and the other player controlling its citizens, trying to withstand the attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battle takes place in two maps - one showing the actual city and the forces involved in the siege and one with the surrounding areas, highlighting the support that each of them provides to both players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features assymetrical play for the two sides. The goal of the invading forces is to manage to get inside the city of Messolonghi before the end of the game or force the citizens to abandon the cause by dropping their morale to zero. The defenders on the other hand try to withstand the siege and protect the city, long enough for the invaders to abandon their attempt either by deciding to leave on their own or by having their morale dropped to zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The actions of the players are driven by the cards in their hands which highlight actual events and personalities of that time, while the combat is dice-driven to allow for quick and exciting gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name of the game is taken from the very famous poem by Dionysios Solomos which was written inspired by this particular siege.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
