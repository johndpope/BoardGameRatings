			<description>Donald Duck's Party Game for Young Folks is a &amp;quot;spin&amp;quot; and move game for young children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to collect three prize tokens. The first player to do this is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prizes are collected by moving the player pawns (four versions of Donald Duck) around the board by spinning a movement spinner until one player has landed on three &amp;quot;prize&amp;quot; spaces. The spinner is divided in to 4 quadrants numbered 1 to 4 with each one containing one square for each colored pawn that will determine the color of pawn to be moved and the number of spaces to move. While moving the player must read aloud what is written on the spaces as they pass them and perform any action that is in the space. For example &amp;quot;Stand up and take a bow&amp;quot; Once a player has landed on three prize spaces they are the winner. The winner must then do what the three prize tokens say.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
