			<description>A game in the range of 'minis' by Ravensburger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five tiles and each tile has a different assortment of five colours along each edge. Spongebob likes yellow and Patrick likes pink, so those are the two colours used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five tiles are laid out in a neat row. In his turn, a player may rearrange the tiles as much as he likes, even turn them over (the tiles are double-sided but not identical. When the player is ready, the five tiles will feature Spongebob or Patrick in the centre. Remember which colour the character likes. Example. If the five tiles are Spongebob, Patrick, Patrick, Patrick and Spongebob. This would be a pattern of Yellow, Pink, Pink, Pink, Yellow. All the other players (not the player who arranged the tiles) now look for that pattern around one side of the five tiles. The first to spot it puts their finger on it and the other players check to see if he is correct. If he is, he gets a juicy hamburger tile. If not correct, the others continue to look.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get 4 Hamburger tiles, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
