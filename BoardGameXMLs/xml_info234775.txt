The convenant which decreed that the gods would respect the free will of mortals was broken by the powerful sun god Ra, who consumed a mortal mind to serve him as champion, leading his armies into war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That champion is you; the game begins when you shrug off the mental bondage of Ra, an act so cataclysmic that reality broke and Mount Olympus, with all of the gods she bore, fell to the Earth. Desperate to restore their immortality and regain their place at the zenith of the world, only you possess the strength of will powerful enough to stop history repeating and end their tyranny once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you make your own miracle and kill the gods?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fleshing out the hack and slash of combat are various side-quests and sandbox options, including collecting resources to create and maintain your equipment, and of course beating down the fake champions the gods send against you in PvP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
