							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rod of Wonder</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The envy of the mischievous, the destructive, and the deranged, the rod of wonder is one of the most chaotic magic items known to exist. From the fact that it cannot be made to function as the wielder wishes to the distinct probability that it could do something nasty and downright humiliating to anyone around it, it is a wonder that such an item even continues to be created. But, as in many cases, the rod of wonder has found a home with those who crave a little chaos in their lives and those of their enemies. The story of the origin of the first rod of wonder started as many tales do: in the dreamscape world of a child&amp;rsquo;s mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement has includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Creator Of the Rod of Wonder&lt;br/&gt;     History Of the Rod of Wonder&lt;br/&gt;     New Magic Item: The Rod Of Chaos&lt;br/&gt;     New Feat: Touched By Chaos&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
