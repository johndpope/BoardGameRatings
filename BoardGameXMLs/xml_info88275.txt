							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fantasy Sagas: Player&#039;s Guidebook</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fantasy Sagas is the first of a series of guidebooks created for the E-RPG system; an epic character driven, story-focused RPG. While many games exist that offer immersive and exciting worlds to play in, the creators of the E-RPG system believe that the stories always should have a focus on the driving characters in the drama. These are the characters created by the players of the game.  The first of three separate rulebooks for players The Fantasy Sagas is only the first genre to be released. Each of the subsequent books (Modern and Sci-Fi Sagas) will use the same rule-set and so are completely compatible with each other, allowing game styles to be mixed and matched in any way a player or Game Master can imagine. Players can play in worlds that use any of the special features of one game type with another without making any special adjustments. Imagine playing in a world of computers, guns, and magic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
