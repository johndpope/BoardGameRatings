			<description>Clash Fighter translates fighting game mechanics into a fast-paced card game where two players compete to build combos in real time!  The Tournament Edition features six playable characters across 12 card decks, allowing for tournaments of up to 12 players.  The Tournament Edition allows players to have a mirror match: two players can use the same character against each other with alternate costumes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first person to play a Clash card ends real time play, initiating a short turn based phase where damage is calculated.  The goal is to deplete your opponent's lifebar while defending your own with strategic combos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 6-player Standard Edition is here: Clash Fighter: The Real Time Fighting Card Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
