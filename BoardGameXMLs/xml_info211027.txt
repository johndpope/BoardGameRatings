							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sublime Flickering Light</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are all beings trapped in a cave. Who knows how you got there. You talk to each other about your feelings and tell stories when the lights are on. When the lights are out, you stay silent and orient yourself toward the Sublime Flickering Light projecting from one end of the wall to the other end. Your character will reflect on their situation. You will go through no less than 3 and no greater than 5 cycles of lights being on and off, and then we will end the game. During play, you will be generous to your fellow players in supporting their play, you will work to keep things interesting for yourself, and you will help keep everyone safe from physical and emotional harm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a few custom cards, provided as print-and-play components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
