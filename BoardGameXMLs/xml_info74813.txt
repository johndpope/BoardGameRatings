			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Upgrade! is a jeepform scenario by Vi &amp;aring;ker jeep (We go by Jeep) that works much like a showcase for jeepform techniques. It uses telegraphing, contextualisation, monologues, insides and outsides, supporting characters, dissolves character ownership, repetition, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Upgrade! was first concieved, in a quite different format, during the Swedish con Halmicon in Halmstad, 2004 by Thorbi&amp;ouml;rn Fritzon and Tobias Wrigstad. It was then revised completely adding a third author, Olle Jonsson, to the credits roll, for Knutpunkt 2005 in Norway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is about our prejudice for participants in reality shows and reality shows. In particular, Temptation Island and the like. Couples sign up to be in the show, are broken up and used to form new couples that date with cameras present and live together in the luxurious Upgrade! resort on some exotic location as far from everyday life as possible. In the end, there is a closed vote by all participants whether they would like to STAY in their old relationships, or UPGRADE to the new one. New relationsships where both partners independently votes UPGRADE get to stay together for another week at the UPGRADE luxury resort. The audience may also vote for the &amp;ldquo;couple of the week&amp;rdquo;, or by popular demand force two people into a couple if enough people believe that they would it each other. Couples that Upgrade! are rewarded in the spirit of creating good television. Couples that survive the show end up in the &amp;quot;Hall of Faith&amp;quot;. Sometimes, they will get a reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The layout was made by Frederik Berg Olsen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        6-8 players, 1-3 game masters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duration:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        2-5 hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capsule definition:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Massive use of jeepform techniques&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Premier:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        v.1 at Halmicon in 2004, v.2 at Knutepunkt, Oslo in 2005&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
