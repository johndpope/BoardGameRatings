			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some heroes are quiet loners who act only for their ideals. To them, the only thing that matters is that the job gets done. They don&amp;rsquo;t need any credit. Show Offs is not a game about those kind of heroes. The heroes in this game are showboats. They have the opposite of performance anxiety. They love the spotlight, and the bigger the audience the better they perform. Give them an audience big enough and they could accomplish almost anything. Their anxieties occur when they don&amp;rsquo;t have an audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leave them to do a job alone, and they will most likely fail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
