			<description>Het spel van de Eeuw (The Game of the Century) is a trivia game with questions regarding persons, events and developments from the 20th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions are arranged in five categories. The game is played on a board depicting 60 fields, arranged in a circle. Each field has a colour corresponding to a category; every sixth field is a large scoring field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, he rolls the die and moves his pawn as many spaces in the direction he chooses. He is then asked a question from the category of the field he landed on. If he answers the question correctly, he gets to move again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player lands on a scoring field and manages to answer the question correctly, he not only gets to move again, but he also receives a century chip of the correct colour (if he doesn't have one in that colour yet). The first player to collect century chips of all colours wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be expanded by adding questions from the various editions of Spel van het Jaar (Game of the Year).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
