			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I wouldn't do that if I were you,&amp;quot; warned the stranger in an oddly irritated tone of voice, but the street thugs only laughed and struck at him harder. He fell to the ground and curled into a ball... and then the ball began to bulge and the stranger's clothing began to rip at the seams, revealing the bristle of swiftly growing, shaggy hair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Children of the Night: Werebeasts is the third book in a series that brings to unlife the creature types detailed in the best-selling Van Richten's Guides. Each of the creatures depicted herein carries its own history, its own special curse, and its own mini-adventure that will test the mettle and wits of novice and experienced adventurers alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the monsters that heroes will confront include the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Meeka, a cat that became almost, but not quite, human.&lt;br/&gt; - Professor Arcanus, a collector of rather strange curiosities and artifacts.&lt;br/&gt; - Mother Fury, a woman who loves what she is and wants to share her &amp;quot;gift.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt; - Henri Milton, an artist who isn't sure if art imitates life or vice versa.&lt;br/&gt; - Dr. Horstman, a scientist with a unique perception of &amp;quot;progress.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are the Children of the Night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product was designed for use with the RAVENLOFT campaign setting, but it can easily be adapted for use in any AD&amp;amp;D game world, or it can be used by itself for an evening of terror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For all character levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
