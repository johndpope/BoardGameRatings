							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Klik-Ball</name>
									
			<description>A simple dexterity game where players hit their ball up one of three inclined tracks with a small cue. Along each track are stops that &amp;quot;klik&amp;quot; when the ball passes it, stopping the ball from going backwards from that point. Each track has eight stops, breaking it into eight scoring sections worth from 0 to 50 points depending on where the ball comes to rest along the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After players have hit their ball up the track, the score is noted and players return their ball to the bottom of the track and begin again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Klik-Ball may be played to a certain score (the first player reaching or exceeding a set score is the winner) or for a set time period (the player with the highest score at the end of the time period is the winner).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Klik-Ball may also be played solo, with a single player hitting each ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
