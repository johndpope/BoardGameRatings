							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Red Oz Episode 1</name>
									
			<description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been away for a while, but I want to try to reconnect with my players again. I MISS you guys! I don&amp;rsquo;t have as much time as I used to, but I still want to make games and keep in touch! Please shoot me a message if you want to say hi! :D&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is my take on the classic Wizard of Oz tale. I take a lot of liberties but I also try to reference some of the lesser known parts of the original books. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to avoid touching the movies, and stick with the source content as inspiration, also the setting will fully tie into my other games! Please follow my on youtube for some other behind the scenes facts and videos about my titles!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
