			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nazatir! This island nation was founded by refugees fleeing the encroaching armies of the Kal-A-Nar Empire. Originally settled by humans, a number of dregordians and brinchie have emigrated and are full citizens.  The people are passionate and live life to its fullest measure. Quick to anger, they settle disputes quickly and usually without too much bloodshed - but do not think to take advantage or you'll end up skewered like a fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ship builders found the timber on the island perfect for ship making and others mined granite and other stone for their homes and the capital city of Hazul took shape around a beautiful natural harbor. The first to sail the seas may have started out as privateers but the island thrived and the ships began to learn that commerce and trade were a better use of their time. Many ships on the seas today desire Nazatiran navigators and seacasters in their company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this book, you'll find a history of Nazatir - with loads of details on ships, the ruling houses and much much more. You'll also find new edges, hindrances, magic and gear to help create people from this lovely island. You'll also find some story threads to help set a story if you're a GM with players looking to travel as each of the six main cities are discussed and there's even some info on a few hidden locations as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
