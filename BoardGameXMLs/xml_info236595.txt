			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city has a secret food chain, a hidden game of predator and prey playing out in every alley, every shadowy corner, and bangin&amp;rsquo; nightclub. The Kindred - vampires, werewolves, and a hundred others - hunt humans for food and pleasure.&lt;br/&gt;They have ruled the night for centuries, but the game is about to change. There&amp;rsquo;s a new predator in town, and it feeds on jerks.&lt;br/&gt;Hybrids, born of mixed Kindred lineages, but stronger than any of them, and twice as cool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of Their Strengths is an action-packed role-playing game of tinted sunglasses, silver-lined swords, and ultra-violet bullets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take on the role of the Hybrids waging a secret war on the Kindred. Play as a werewolf-witch, a ghost-mummy, or the always classic half-human, half-vampire.&lt;br/&gt;Grab your throwing stars, put on your PVC long-coat, and touch up your sweet tribal tats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The War of Shadows is waiting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
