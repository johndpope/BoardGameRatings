			<description>Peddling and trust (行商と信頼) is a Japanese home-made board game based on the novel series &amp;quot;Wolf and spice&amp;quot; (a.k.a. Merchant meats spicy wolf). Players move around the board, from town to town, picking up (buying) and delivering (selling) mechandise to earn trust points. Each town in which a player has sold merchandise provides the player with a special ability, and players each turn also draw one-use character cards that will allow for special actions. The wolf-god Holo generally accompanies and helps the weakest player. The first player to have earned trust in a certain number of towns wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a &amp;quot;dojin&amp;quot; (home made) production and was released first on Comics Market 78 (august 2010).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
