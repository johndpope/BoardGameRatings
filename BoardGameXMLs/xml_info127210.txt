							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster of the Week</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are monsters out there. Most people don't believe in them, but they're real. Mostly, when someone finds out that monsters are real, that's just before they die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But some people are mean enough, smart enough, crazy enough, or hurt enough, that they live. And some of those people go and hunt down more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's who you are &amp;ndash; someone who decided to go on a crusade against the evil critters that are scurrying around out there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It could be that you make a stand and defend your hometown from everything evil that comes there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It could be you take to the road and go find them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It could be you have magic powers that help out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It could be that your name came up in prophecies thousands of years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The one sure thing is you aren't gonna go back to your old, safe life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
