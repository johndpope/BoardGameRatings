			<description>Breakthrough is played on a 5x9 board. Each player has ten pieces which start in the rows nearest them. The object is to get a piece to the row farthest away from you. On a turn a piece can move any distance diagonally as long as it does not pass over any piece or land on an opponent's piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fourth and seventh rows of the board are &amp;quot;wall&amp;quot; rows, and pieces which reach the opposing wall cannot move forward. The only way to get a piece across the wall (necessary to win) is via explosion. Each space has a maximum capacity (depending on which column it is in), and when you get that many of your pieces in a space it explodes, sending the pieces to orthogonally adjacent spaces. Opposing pieces can be captured this way, and chain reactions can occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in the January 1984 issue of GAMES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
