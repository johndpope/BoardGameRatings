			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DragonSpawn has a single document that is subtitled The Game Player's Guidebook.  It was distributed freely on the internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DragonSpawn is a system that attempts to balance game mechanics with speed of play.  The game uses standard characters but uses an &amp;quot;upside down&amp;quot; character creation process that attempts to generate the character prior to assigning numeric values to Attributes.  Characters have twelve Attributes divided into three categories:  Physical (Brawn, Stamina, Agility, and Manual Dexterity); Mental (Willpower, Knowledge, Thought, and Wisdom); and Social (Beauty, Leadership, Socialization, and Character).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attribute values range from 1-30.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters also learn a variety of Skills that allow for special actions.  There are numerous categories of Skill, each with various Skills.  Characters note down each and every use of a Skill and at the end of each session use a formula and die roll to determine whether their Skill rank increases by one.  Increases occur quickly at lower Skill levels and quite slowly at higher levels--levels range from 1-8.  Combat, psionics, and magic use are all Skills.  Note the system does not have a monolithic Skill resolution system--each Skill is treated individually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
