							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lindisfarne</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the year 635 Scottish monks founded an abbey on an island before the north coast of England, and gave it the same name as the island: Lindisfarne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the leadership of Aidan, the monastery flourished and became a center of Christian art and culture. In 651 Aidan died - and the struggle for his succession begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game Lindisfarne 2 - 4 players try to become the new abbot of the monastery Lindisfarne. To this end, they have to win not only the support of their fellow-monks, but must also gain the favor of the king in order to expel the fellow-competitors.&lt;br/&gt;At the same time, the players plan their actions and the order in which they are executed. Pray, read the mass for a nobleman, support the expansion of the monastery, or let another monk work for you - with each of the actions the players get closer to their goal. It may also be helpful to slander the other players or hinder them in other ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In principle, each player has the same actions - but the acquisition and playing of cards results in additional possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;Lindisfarne is a game that combines a high degree of interaction and tactical consideration, and is therefore aimed at players, who play regularly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
