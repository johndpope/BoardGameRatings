							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wilderness Bestiary</name>
									
			<description>From the Back Cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The wilderness is dangerous.  Don't ever enter it alone during the day, and don't even think of doing this at night.&amp;quot;  You've heard this before? No doubt you have - and very often at that.  Let me explain: In our &amp;quot;Creature&amp;quot; books, we will give you forty different reasons to fear the wilderness.  To counterbalance this negativity, we will also provide you with twenty veggies &amp;amp; beasties that will give you reasons to be less afraid of the wilderness.  All in all there's a good chance you'll die there, but glory (or at least riches) awaits those who know how to avoid death in their explorations of the forests of Ka&amp;iuml;nas.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will thus be introduced to forty creatures, as well as to several plants and animals that adorn the forest and that constitute the most vital yet inferior parts of its ecosystem.  In addition, at the end of these works we will inform you of each of the creatures' &amp;quot;usable items&amp;quot; (i.e. the reasons they are hunted or feared).  Keep in mind that these creatures can also create weapons and armor, poisons and counter-poisons, as well as tools and precious objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And on top of all this, for the first time these works will be in full-color.  As usual, they will be illustrated by our illustrious illustrators, Yann, Donald, and Jean-Francois.  So open a book and enter into our world as you discover the first volume of our &amp;quot;Creatures&amp;quot; series...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A short novel,&lt;br/&gt;- The history of the Wilderness,&lt;br/&gt;- 3 new Jobs, including new skills, abilities and items.&lt;br/&gt;- 40 creatures within their ecosystem, from the most common to the most bizarre.&lt;br/&gt;- Several beasts, animals and plants that can be found in the Wilderness,&lt;br/&gt;- And, in conclusion, and AJ section with new items and resources for survival in the wilderness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
