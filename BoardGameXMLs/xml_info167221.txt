			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dark World&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is much more to this world than what we see on the surface. Beneath it all, there are mysteries that lurk in the corners of what we perceive, secrets that may reveal profound truths about life...or beyond. But religion has made us dismissive, denying such things lest we lose our faith in their doctrines. Science has made us complacent, confident that everything will have a rational and measurable explanation. Hollywood has made us fearless, feeding on distorted tropes that leaves us with a false sense of security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You, however, are an investigator of the unknown, seeking out myths, sightings, and anomalies. You may do this for fame, power, knowledge, or even a sense of duty, but there is something deeper in your motives that draws you to the paranormal. Perhaps you suffered a childhood trauma, the loss&lt;br/&gt;of a dear loved one, or an encounter with something that defied explanation. Whatever your reasons, whatever your goals, whatever your methodology, this is the path you&amp;rsquo;ve chosen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
