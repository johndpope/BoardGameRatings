			<description>Listed in American Games, #4175.  1976, Military, Board Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A typical move-and-capture game, such as Draugths or Checkers. The board represents a castle and a perimeter. Players move along paths that connect spaces together. Capture is by jumping over an adjacent piece to any vacant space beyond and is mandatory. Both players have the same pieces - one King, four Knights and eight pawns. The pieces have a hierarchy where a piece may not capture a more important piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is the Defender and the other the Attacker. The Defender starts his pieces from the middle of the board whilst the attacker starts on the perimeter. The object is to make the other player resign by eliminating enough pieces that there is no point in continuing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are extensive with many elaborations, hints and examples of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
