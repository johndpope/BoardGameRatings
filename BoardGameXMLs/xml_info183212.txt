							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">18Dixie with 18MS and 18GA</name>
									
			<description>Note: These games come together in one box, and have shared components. The smaller maps for 18MS and 18GA are both on the back of the big map for 18Dixie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;18Dixie is an 18xx game set in the Southeast region of the United States. Players invest in railroad companies in an effort to have the greatest net worth at the end of the game. This is determined by adding the cash holdings of the players to the value of the stocks each owns. The money in the actual companies, though, are separate from the individual player's money. During the game, there are alternating stock rounds, where players buy and sell stock in the various railroad companies, and operating rounds, where the various companies operate. When operating, the companies lay tracks, place stations, and buy and run trains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;18MS is an 18xx game set in Mississippi and Alabama, together with portions of adjoining states.  Players invest in railroad companies in an effort to have the greatest net worth at the end of the game.  This is determined by adding the cash holdings of the players to the value of the stocks each owns.  The game consists of five Stock Rounds, where players buy and sell stock in the various companies, each of which is followed by two Operating Rounds, where the various companies operate by laying tracks, placing stations, and buying and running trains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;18MS is a separate mini game using some of the components from 18Dixie together with some additional components specific to 18MS.  18MS aims to be a smaller, shorter game that may be useful for teaching the 18xx system to newer players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
