			<description>Count your chickens and out-fox your friends!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chicken Out! is the egg-citing, feather ruffling card game for 2-6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presented in a bright and quirky tuck box, Chicken Out! encourages players to take it in turns to play the cards from their hand with the aim of reaching 21.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player in turn plays the top card of their pile, adding the value to the previous player's total and announces the new count. If a Chicken card with a black number is played, the number must be added to the running total. If a Chicken card with a red number is played and it brings the total to higher than 21, players can subtract the value from the previous total to avoid them going bust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But watch out! Hidden among the flock are 10 cheeky foxes that will either help or hinder each player's chances of winning. The first player to run out of cards rules the roost and wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
