							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tell It To My Axe</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Order! Peace! Justice! &lt;br/&gt;Since the time of Sir Redic Pynchar, the humans of Terrakal have strived for these ideals by any means necessary. In the years that followed, the Order of the Axe has proven to be a potent force for change in the lands of the Diamond Throne, as powerful as it is enigmatic. The knights of the order will do what they must to bring their vision of a free world to fruition. To any who would stand in their way, the reply is simple: &amp;ldquo;Tell it to my axe!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tell It To My Axe! is the third entry in the AEvolutions line of sourcebooks, providing exciting, original material for Monte Cook&amp;rsquo;s Arcana Evolved. It is scribed by the Keepers of the Oath, a dedicated and talented enclave of AE scholars, who brought you the critically acclaimed Akashic Nodes: The Home of Memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A heightened prestidigitation spell was required to fit so much information into the book&amp;rsquo;s 126 pages, which include: A full history of the Order and the Knights, a fully-fleshed out and mapped chapterhouse, a full-length adventure, 50 fully statted NPCs, 39 adventure seeds, 29 new feats, 10 rebellious spells, 8 knightly prestige classes, 4 new creatures and templates, 17 new magical and mundane items, and 16 rituals, rites, and ceremonies. Not just exhausting detail about the Order or tons of new crunch, chapters include advice and mechanics for introducing a system of honor, creating exciting mounted combat encounters, and running a rebellion-based campaign. In fact, Tell It To My Axe! contains 25% more material than Akashic Nodes at the same, low price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the time for rebellion is at hand, will you be ready?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
