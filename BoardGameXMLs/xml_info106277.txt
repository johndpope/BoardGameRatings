			<description>Black Lamp is a 1988 platform game, published by Firebird Software and available for the Amiga, Atari 8-bit, Atari ST, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game casts the player as Jack The Jester, in the fictional kingdom of Allegoria. According to the story, Jack has fallen in love with the Princess Grizelda, but knows the king would never allow his daughter to marry a lowly court jester. Unless, of course, he were to perform some kind of noble and heroic act. That chance comes for Jack the day a gang of dragons attack the kingdom, stealing the magical black lamp which protects the kingdom from harm. Without the lamp's protection the kingdom is soon overrun by monsters, so Jack sets off to recover the black lamp, save the kingdom, and hopefully win the hand of the fair princess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is viewed from the side-on perspective typical of platform games. Jack, under the player's control, has to run, jump, climb and shoot his way through the kingdom of Allegoria in search of nine different coloured lamps, while under constant assault by all manner of creatures. Eight of the nine lamps may be found randomly scattered around the kingdom (in locations which change with each new game), but the ninth lamp, the black lamp, is guarded by a dragon which must be defeated before the lamp can be recovered. Each lamp must be returned to one of several lamp racks in the kingdom. As the player can only carry a single lamp at a time, this can mean a lot of traveling back and forth. Once all the lamps have been returned to the rack, the level is complete, and the player advances to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lamp_%28game%29,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lamp_%28game%29,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
