			<description>Holy Rollers is a dice game where your group of saints tries to race your opponent's group of saints to the front of the church to find out who's holiest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are represented by 3 dice &amp;quot;pawns&amp;quot; portraying the different sides of the characters' face so you can tell which way they're facing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 direction dice and an action die, all of the directions must be used by one character die per turn, and the action die will give special directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a countdown die for placing NPC saints in the front pew and 2 placement dice for saints and Bibles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must land on a space with a Bible token to be allowed to sit in the front pew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get 3 character dice with Bibles in the front pew of the church wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was designed to utilize all the copies of Yahtzee Jr. I had found thrifitng. You will need 3 indented dice for each player and 8 for the game, 10 tokens, and one play board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
