							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Stuff of Nightmares</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a level 18 party!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party find all of the inhabitants of the city Nolann Cobb have mysteriously fallen into a horrid, wake-less slumber. These sleepers writhe and recoil, plagued by haunting dreams, and no disturbance is strong enough to rouse them from this state. What&amp;rsquo;s more, a shrouded black tower has inexplicably erected itself in the middle of the city, its walls seem to warp and distort as the party approaches!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes will need to unravel the mystery within the foreboding tower if they&amp;rsquo;re to save the city and wake its residents, but such a task is easier said than done. Within its black walls they will have to confront their deepest fears, for the stuff of nightmares await all who enter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stuff of Nightmares includes PLAYER SAFE MAPS - maps you can show your players for each encounter area that does not reveal important details like the locations of traps, treasure, or hostile creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
