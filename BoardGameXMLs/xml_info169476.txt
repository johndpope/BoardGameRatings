							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Panzer General Forever</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was built by a Panzer General fan, who not only wanted to port it from DOS to Windows, but also wanted to improve the game. It was (is?) distributed for free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game basically consists of Panzer General and Allied General. But it is not a compilation!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New features: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Huge view on map using entire screen (old DOS game was based on the 640x480 monitors)&lt;br/&gt;     Playable (scalable) over multiple monitors&lt;br/&gt;     Multiplayer (vFtF) added&lt;br/&gt;     AI greatly improved&lt;br/&gt;     UI improved; new commands, new views, new menus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A later version included also Kaiser General and K.u.k. General, two WW-I games. It's unclear if those two were ever released separately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
