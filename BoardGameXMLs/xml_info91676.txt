			<description>Mr. Driller: Drill Land, also known as Mr. Driller 5, is a puzzle video game released in 2002 by Namco. The game was released only in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new theme park is being opened and Susumu and his friends are invited for the opening ceremony. However, they don't know that the owner of the theme park is actually Dr. Manhole, the mad scientist. Together with the Ankoku Drillers, he is trying to stop Susumu and his friends, so he can destroy the earth with gigantic drillers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like other games in the Mr. Driller series, Mr. Driller: Drill Land is a puzzle game. The objective of the game is to drill through square blocks in order to reach the bottom of a stage. Blocks have different colors: drilling a block of a certain color will also break all adjacent blocks with the same color. This can cause blocks above to fall down and crush your driller. Combined with slowly decreasing oxygen, this calls for strategic actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mr. Driller: Drill Land&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
