			<description>Welcome to the Veggie Mall! Hold your shopping lists tight, Keep your eyes wide opened, get ready for the crazy daily sales and the veggie high! Veggie Sales is a simultaneous action game where players try to fulfill, as quickly as possible, their shopping cards with a variety of vegetables. The player, who collects the most vegetables in order to fulfill their shopping cards, becomes the happiest veggie shopper and wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;Players start the game with a certain number of Shopping Cards in hands and share a basket of random Vegetable Tokens in the center of the table. The youngest player shouts out &amp;ldquo;Veggie Sales!&amp;rdquo; and everyone tries to manipulate the Vegetable Tokens in the Shopping Basket so as to match the compositions on their Shopping Cards. There are three things players can do: &lt;br/&gt;(1) put ONE Vegetable Token into the basket, &lt;br/&gt;(2) remove ONE Vegetable Token from the basket, or &lt;br/&gt;(3) swap exactly TWO Vegetable Tokens in and out of the basket.&lt;br/&gt;If a player thinks that they can fulfill one of their Shopping Cards in hand, they immediately play the card in front of them, grab the Shopping Basket, and perform exactly one of the three possible actions to fulfill the card they have just played. If it successfully matches the card, they place the Shopping Card, face-up, beside them as their scores, and return the basket to the center of the table. After that they give exactly one Shopping Card in hand to any one player next to them. However, if they fail to match the card, they must turn over one of their scored card (if any), face-down, and return the basket to the center of the table, and other players may try to play cards and grab the basket for themselves.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends immediately when one player has got rid of all their cards in hand. All players count the total vegetable icons shown on their scored Shopping Cards. Whoever collects the most vegetable icons wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
