							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ferret Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Ferret is a fun, energetic, card game. The object of the game is to find the elusive Ferret and then give, take and trade your way down to one card. If you've managed to hold onto the Ferret, you win!&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 animals in the game: The Ferret, The Fox, The Hound and the Weasel. These little rascals love to chase each other. The other cards are number cards (0-6) and action cards (Give Left, Take Right, Trade Anyone, etc).&lt;br/&gt;The cards are shuffled into an Number card pile and an Action card pile. The Animals are considered Action cards. Players draw cards and perform the actions on the cards. Play shifts to the left and the next player does the same. Play continues until someone finds the Ferret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
