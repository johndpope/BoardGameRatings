			<description>&amp;quot;The Game of Circular, Spiral, and Straight Manneuvers&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star*Chess is a chess derivative that features a board of tesselated quadrilaterals surrounding a ten-pointed star. Each player has a general, two brigadier generals, colonels, majors, captains, 1st lieutenants and three 2nd lieutenants. The first five types move like kings, queens, rooks, bishops and knights, respectively. Of the last two, the 1st lieutenant moves like a pawn but moves two spaces throughout the game while the second lieutenant moves only one space. The game is won by either getting your general to the center star or by capturing the other player's general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
