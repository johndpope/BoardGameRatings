			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panolpy is a role playing wargame in which you and your friends play the great generals of warring nations in a distant future. The Earth has seen the rise and fall of countless civilizations, each leaving layers of history, artifacts, and bones. In the world of Panoply, a few great iron age kingdoms are just now discovering the wealth and power left by those that came before, and fierce skirmishes over control of buried ruins hint at the portent of all out war. But in a neighboring land, beyond a wall of mountains, something beneath the surface is clawing to get out...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play Panoply, you will require at least one other player, the rules, a dry erase hexagonal mat, a good selection of miniatures (you can use any form of counter you like to represent your army as long as you can tell them apart) and a large selection of six sided dice (d6). One of you will take the roll of setting the scene, telling the story, and playing the enemy armies, and being the arbiter of the rules. This person is the game master (GM), and the rest of you will play as the generals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
