			<description>This game is game #27 in the Games on Half a Checkerboard Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sight Reduction challenges players to remove their own pieces that can trace a line of sight to another one of their own pieces.  When players remove certain pieces is critical, as there is a timing element which can result in a player winning or losing a game, based on when they remove pieces.  In the normal version of the game, the board is set up randomly.  There is also a variant rules for more deterministic play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also also includes a solitaire variant, which is very similar to the regular 2 player version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
