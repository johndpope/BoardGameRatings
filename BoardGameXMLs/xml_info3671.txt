			<description>We like to dig, we want to dig,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those gems all a gleaming&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rubies, sapphires, emeralds and gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amethysts, garnets and diamonds too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of these we like to dig,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For we are the Dwarves and digging is the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dwarves is a game about mining different kinds of gems from the board, your aim is to collect one gem in particular, as your scoring will increase when you have more. Knowing which gem to collect and keeping hold of the gems you have acquired is all part of the strategy of playing Dwarves. But the worst if not the most important is the card play, for if you run out of cards or leave yourself with little choice you will not accomplish your task or win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
