			<description>Thrones and Bones is a board game published in the book Frostborn by Lou Anders. It is based on the classic Viking board game Hnefatafl. Thrones and Bones is played on a 9x9 board, and shares the layout of the King's Table version of Hnefatafl. In general, movement and captures are handled as they are in Hnefatafl. However, this game adds a few new elements.  The attackers, known as the Draug, have a special &amp;quot;leader&amp;quot; piece known as The Black Draug, who has special movement powers.  Also, the starting squares of the attackers, known as the barrow mounds, are impassible to the Jarl and his defenders and also impassible to the Draug minions once they leave the barrow mounds. Only the Black Draug can move to any space on the board with no restrictions.  However, the Black Draug is also vulnerable. If he is captured, all his minions are released and Jarl and his defenders win. The Jarl may also win by reaching any edge square other than those in the barrow mounds. As in Hnefatafl, the Draug win by capturing the Jarl by surrounding him on all four sides with Draug pieces or barrow mound squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
