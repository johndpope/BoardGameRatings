			<description>1-4 player co-operative card game that lets players take control of a post-apocalyptic, retro-future, caravan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It feels like Race for the Galaxy Vs. Magic the Gathering with a splash of euro gaming with a nuclear fallout post apocalyptic setting.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why are you in a nuclear desert?&lt;br/&gt;Players control a rag-tag caravan that contains elements of how society was before the bombs dropped. Everything from road-converted steam engines to solar harvesters staffed by inviting female engineers, and it's your job to get these guys the-hell-outta-here.&lt;br/&gt;AtomPunk makes use of some inventive new puzzle-mechanics and loots the best ones from elsewhere. It steals the best bits of card interactions but dispenses with the &amp;quot;Spend loads of money to play with our new cards&amp;quot; CCG crap - it is one game. It uses resource tokens like some of our favorite euros, but keeps them in an elegant card format. Its core puzzle mechanic means that players will have to use your mind to work out the best path in this treacherous dystopian backdrop&lt;br/&gt;You and your buddies are alone against the harsh wastelands. The riding is tough. Horrific mutants, shady merchants, hardened outriders, religious tech zealots and crazed robo-emus. BUT on your side you have have speed, cunning, all the guns you can handle, and transformer-like laser beam trains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are the mechanics?&lt;br/&gt;1. You control 5 caravan elements in a horizontal line that give each card to its left and right static bonuses. These bonuses activate special abilities on the elements. You will constantly need to be thinking about getting these in the best configuration.&lt;br/&gt;2. An event deck throws everything at you from crazy cleaning robots, twisted mutants, resource giving oasis, and caravan weaponry upgrades&lt;br/&gt;3. Each turn pits you in a certain land. This land card tells you what resources you need to move on to the next land. After 5 of these you will come up against the 6th and final hard-as-nails boss land which will tell you the final quest you need to complete.&lt;br/&gt;4. Not only do you need to conquer these 6 lands, but each player has a secret achievement goal card that they MUST complete in order to be allowed into the winning team. Will you tell your team mates yours?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do we win?&lt;br/&gt;Once you fulfill the requirements to bear the 6th and final quest land the &amp;quot;players&amp;quot; team will be successful. But only if you have succeeded your secret mission goal will you truly win, otherwise you have not won or lost, but you are cast back into the wastes, to win another day...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
