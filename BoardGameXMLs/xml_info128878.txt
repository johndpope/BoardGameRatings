			<description>Jack Attack is a platform action video game for the Commodore 16, Commodore Plus/4, and Commodore 64. It was published in 1983 by Commodore International for the North American and European markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This video game is simple to play and comes with 64 levels. Each level is laid out in a rectangular grid. The levels contain the player character, eight enemies, and a varying arrangement of bricks. The player's goal is to kill all the enemies without being killed by them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player character is able to push and pull bricks, which the player must use to kill the enemies. An enemy can be killed by being crushed either by the player character or a brick falling down on it or horizontally between two bricks. On the other hand, the player character dies if a brick or an enemy falls on top of it. Enemies are unable to push or pull bricks. Some levels include water, which is fatal to the player character, but safe to enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Jack Attack&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online play (jave emulator): &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.vizzed.com/play/jack-attack-c64-online-commodore-64-25862-game&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.vizzed.com/play/jack-attack-c64-online-commodore-...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
