			<description>From the box: This game combines features of both chess and word games. The objective is to move markers to different squares that contain letters, in order to connect letters, in order to form words - thereby scoring points. The markers move like chessmen, though their moves are simpler than chess. The formation of words is simpler than in other board games or cross word puzzles. Special rules and handicaps allow for persons of different age and skill levels to compete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
