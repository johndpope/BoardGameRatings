			<description>A Plantagenet Family Drama LARP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Christmas 1183: King Henry of England, the most powerful king in Christendom, has summoned his family together at Chinon to celebrate Christmas. The King of France will be in attendance, and the Queen has been released from prison for the occasion. But behind the celebration, Henry's empire is in crisis. The death of his eldest son has placed the succession in doubt, the Queen has been imprisoned for the last decade, his children war incessantly among themselves, and France waits greedily to regain what it has lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Devil&amp;rsquo;s Brood is a discourse-based political larp for nine players.  Expected play time is two to three hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is available for download as a ZIP archive containing multiple PDF files, totaling thirty-seven pages, a DOC file with name tags for print-and-play use, and a JPG map file.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
