							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wyrm of Regret</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All over the multiverse, on many different planes of existence, psychic crystals develop in small colonies, in seemingly random location. Practitioners of the psionic arts from one end of creation to the other covet them in order to enhance their special abilities, for there are few enough methods to do so, and none as safe and sure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harvesters do their best to keep up with the high demand, but they have problems of their own, for there is also another predator on the hunt for these clusters of mental energy in crystalline form. Rare enough that no one is actually sure how many there are &amp;mdash; or if there are even more than one &amp;mdash; the Wyrm of Regret lives up to its name, for there is no one happy to have encountered it, even though they escaped with their lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It roams the jagged burnlands when the stars are right, under a night sky filled with tiny pinpricks of twinkling light, a strange, bestial creature from beyond time and space &amp;mdash; so they say &amp;mdash; that swallows people whole. Inside it&amp;rsquo;s bulbous gullet, nothing could be further from the terrestrial concepts of consumption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
