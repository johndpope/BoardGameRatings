			<description>Publisher's (Designer's) Note:&lt;br/&gt;Insectum is a 24 Hour RPG challenge entry by Dennis N. Santana. It is a game that takes its inspiration from both the story games and the action games by incorporating classes, combat and magic with Scenes, Story Arcs, Tokens and much freedom for the Game Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is also a game about bugpeople! In this fantasy roleplaying game, you take on the role of a human being in an odd fantasy society where everyone has traits derived from some insect or another. Characters have the power of hormonal and pheromonal supernatural abilities to help them achieve their goals &amp;amp; whatever their goals may be is up to the one writing the story!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
