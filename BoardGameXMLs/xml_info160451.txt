			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Star Soccer is a soccer game where you start as a 16 year old hopeful.  You must level-up both your playing skills and your relationship skills in order to progress to bigger and better clubs, to win trophies and awards, and be selected for your national side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is in two parts: firstly spending resources between matches to increase your player's abilities and to acquire possessions, and secondly you have several chances to score goals, make accurate passes and intercept the ball during matches.  This second part is carried out via dragging the cursor to aim and determine kick strength, then clicking on a moving ball graphic to execute the shot.  Whereabouts on the ball you click will affect the type of shot.  Interceptions are made via clicking to move your player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
