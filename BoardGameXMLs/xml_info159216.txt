							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">mGaz1: The Central Altan Tepes</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central Altan Tepes region &amp;ndash; that is the point where the south-eastern part of the chain, coming from Thyatis and Karameikos, meets the northern part of it, which encloses the dwarven realm of Rockhome &amp;ndash; is a frontier area bordering five realms: Darokin, Rockhome, Ylaruam, Karameikos, and Thyatis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, the region is crossed by various valleys and gorges, many of which are nevertheless devoid of notable settlements and have become the shelter of bandits and, mostly, humanoid tribes. In particular, the Karameikan and Ylari sides of this region mostly abound of hostile tribes &amp;ndash; both humanoids and frost giants. Many borderland settlements &amp;ndash; small villages, keeps, and border castles &amp;ndash; and other interesting places are scattered in this region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement wants to give a swift look at the foremost places of the region, with the aim to present the DM with useful ideas to set adventures here or locations in which to send his PCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
