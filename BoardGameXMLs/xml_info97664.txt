			<description>Subtitle: A Framework for Collaborative Roleplaying&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formless adds Collaborative Gaming to Active Exploits Diceless, genreDiversion i (HardNova ][), Impresa Express (Iron Gauntlets), or your favorite RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formless is, at its core, a set of ideas and guidelines as opposed to a hard and fast set of rules. In fact, it might be more accurate to say that Formless is a kind of primer for a very specific style of roleplaying. As such, Formless may be utilized as an ideology that can be grafted onto other published roleplaying games. How you apply these ideas to other games is ultimately left up to you, Formless merely establishes a simple framework to get you started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formless is designed to be transparent and adaptable. Unconcerned with statistical probability and the crunching of numbers, Formless is designed to facilitate telling stories and having fun, and is largely dependent upon common sense and cooperation between the various players. It is, by default, a collaborative roleplaying framework - that is, a method of roleplaying that splits the usual responsibility of a sole referee among all of the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To this end, Formless operates wholly on the good faith assumption that when people sit down to roleplay, they&amp;rsquo;re doing so in the interest of having a good time. Instead of relying on dice, point bidding, or other similar methods used to resolve conflict and create drama, Formless is driven only by words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
