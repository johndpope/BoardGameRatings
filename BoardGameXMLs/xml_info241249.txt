							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Othello - Othello/2 - Strategy</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Othello is a game of strategy played on an 8 x 8 matrix.  The object of the game is to surround your enemy's pieces, converting them to your pieces.  It's a game where the final moves can be very decisive in who wins, and if you don't keep your guard up the PET will beat you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Othello/2 allows you to play the same game with a friend, while the PET directs the game, calling each player by name and totaling and displaying the score!  Accepts no incorrect entries, so it is ideal for younger players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategy is similar to the famous game of Mastermind, but you can control the difficulty!  The PET has a random sequence of numbers which you must re-arrange into the correct order.  you have a choice of 1 - 9 numbers with a sequence of 1 - 9!  If you don't get them correct he PET will show them to you.  Hours of fun for the whole family!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
