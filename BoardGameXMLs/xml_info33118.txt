			<description>From the Rules: The game is intended to be a representation of Target practice as carried out by the Navy; the figured squares in the centre of the board representing the Target, and the shaded squares around the edge of the board representing the course taken by the competing Ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ships always move one square at a time, along the course, in a clockwise direction.  The four squares, colored Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow are the starting points, or Stations, from which the Ships commence their practice.Each player in turn rolls the die or spins the teetotem and counts the number in following the arrow.  If the end result is a square with a number the player score that value and then moves to the next square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all players have gone through 36 stations the player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
