			<description>Inspired by sci-fi works such as Battlestar Galactica, The Lost Fleet series, and games like FTL, our strategy game will test your skills as a leader in times of great need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the captain of the last remaining battleship in the fleet. A relentless, overwhelming enemy has emerged to abduct your people. There&amp;rsquo;s no time to colonize planets, negotiate with alien races, or build an empire. You&amp;rsquo;re outnumbered, out-gunned, and low on resources. Knowing when it&amp;rsquo;s time to fight or flee will be the key to saving the human race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commanding your fleet and managing resources is only part of your job. You&amp;rsquo;ll also need to lead a myriad of personalities as you amass and protect a flock of civilian ships. Who you choose to elect onto your council will effect the entire fleet and alter the options available to you. Your leadership will either inspire loyalty and sacrifice, or drive your people to treachery and sabotage&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
