			<description>Each player has five lives (bananas).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player rolls two dice and say a number. The highest number is always the first.  For example: 4 and 5 is 54. The next throws are possible: 31 (lowest), 32, 41, 42, 43, 51, 52, 53, 54, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, doubles 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66 and finally 21 (best throw). Whatever you say, the next player must throw a higher number than you said. You can bluff, and tell a smaller or a higher number. The next player must decide if he believes you or not. If you believe the number, you roll the dice again and gives a higher number. If you say that the player is bluffing, the bluffer must show the dice. If you're right loses the bluffer a banana. If the throw was right, you lose yourself a banana.&lt;br/&gt;When a player said 21, the next player decides if he believes the throw or not. Believing does mean not to look the dice and you lose 1 banana. Are you saying that the thrower is bluffing, then check out the dice. The loser pays 2 bananas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If during the game you shake the dice and you don&amp;rsquo;t like the throw, you can shake you again. You may not look that throw and you must give it blind to the other player; and you must say a higher number.&lt;br/&gt;The player can also say &amp;quot;more than enough&amp;quot;. If the dice shows a higher number, you can call a low throw. So the next player has the chance to say a higher number without looking at the dice. The poker cup goes quickly around the table, but it could be a bluff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who&amp;rsquo;s left with one or more bananas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
