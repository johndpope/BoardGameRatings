							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Zombie, The Princess &amp; The Kid Next Door</name>
									
			<description>It's the game that features a surprising mix of characters, amazingly simple rules and the right touch of cleverness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 3 tiles.  On every turn place one of your tiles on any open space on the board.  But look carefully so you don't place a tile that will help your opponents score as you try to get three in a row - vertically, horizontally or diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you're successful, collect a token.  On some especially good moves you can get 2 or 3 tokens.  &lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game when the board is full of zombies, princesses and that kid next door, the player with the most tokens wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
