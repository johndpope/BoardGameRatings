			<description>Clustered is an easy-to-learn strategy card game that is fun for the whole family! During the game, players will make moves according to the symbols on the cards in their hands. The symbols on Clustered cards vary by shape, fill type, and number. Challenge your pattern recognition skills by playing cards that share attributes in common with neighboring cards on the board. Carefully choose where to play in order to either score points for yourself or block your opponents from doing so.  Each card you cluster together in a row or a square will get you a point. Simply score more points than the other players to win. It&amp;rsquo;s anyone&amp;rsquo;s game until the last card is played!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
