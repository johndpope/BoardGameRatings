			<description>Snappy the crocodile is hungry! Help him catch some fishies for his lunch by matching the number of fish in the stream to earn fish tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snappy Maths is a quick-fire educational game for children, designed by a 10 year-old. Two players race to compose simple math equations (addition, subtraction and multiplication of numbers 1, 2 and 3) to match a target number determined by a six-sided die. Each of the nine cards can be used in two ways: as a number (1 to 3), or as an operator (+, - or &amp;times;) depending on which way up you place it. The first player to arrange their cards to match the target number wins the round and receives a fish token, and the first player to earn five tokens wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
