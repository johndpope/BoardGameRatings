			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Murder Most Foul&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eleven people find themselves trapped in an isolated hotel.  Elven people go to bed, but only ten will ever wake up again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's time for a good old fashioned murder mystery, Hot Chicks style!  Here are ten fully realized characters from all walks of life.  Use them as allies, adversaries, contacts, love interests... or involve them in a classic murder mystery scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are guidelines for running a murder mystery, and an open-ended mystery.  Who did it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're going to have to work that out for yourselves... technically, it could have been any of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
