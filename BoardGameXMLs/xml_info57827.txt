			<description>Ecclesiaste III &amp;quot;The Quest&amp;quot; is a race game not unlike Candyland or Chutes and Ladders.  You begin the game at the launch pad, and must get to the space station first in order to win.  This is done by rolling dice, moving, drawing cards, and following the instructions on the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ECCLESIASTE III &amp;quot;THE QUEST&amp;quot; the new and exciting strategy board game packed with hours of family entertainment.  Experience endless fun as you journey around the galaxy discovering lost alien races, resolving team conflicts and venturing out on secret missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story begins in year 2077.  The universe has known peace for nearly 800 years since the destruction of planet Tsugari, which marked the last years of the endless battles between the various alien species.  However, as time has gone by the resistance has grown in great numbers causing ongoing tension and unbalance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star date 2077.250:  A distress call was received from Alexi Scientific Research Space Station (A.S.R.S.S), orbiting the planet Caelin in quadrant Deka 7-1.  The transmission was cut short and only part of the message was decoded.  &amp;ldquo;Star Command Justin Randall &amp;hellip; this is Edward Bonja clearance code 117-Si-523&amp;hellip; *static* &amp;hellip; terrible &amp;hellip;. Wrong&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; end of transmission.  Information indicates that all escapes pods have been deployed except one.  Station Alexi is a research facility studying cross alien race bioengineering &amp;ndash; long-range scanners pick up no apparent life signs or hostile resistance activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Command has hand picked a team of crew members for this mission.  A search and rescue mission over a five-planet region &amp;hellip; or is it?  Each member will have to choose to either assist the team or become a solo star.  The quest has begun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
