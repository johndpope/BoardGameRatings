			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shadowed Halls of Ogul-Duhr slumber 'neath the cold, harsh, jagged peaks of the Goblin Mountains. Once the lair of a proud race of mountain Dwarves, the halls are now almost in ruin. Since the Dwarves left the mountain, adventurers have explored the caverns deep in search of Dwarven gold, with many successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, recently, traveller's tales tell of an evil Gorgon that has claimed the Halls of Ogul-Duhr for her own, turning anyone foolish enough to enter to unliving stone. Still, rumour has it that the Halls still contain gold, silver and gemstones, left behind by the Dwarves. Some say that Dwarven weapons, armour and even magic can be found in the deepest parts of the Halls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Halls of the Gorgon await!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitability - 1 first level or newly-created character with max 20 Personal Adds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
