			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World War II is over and the Allies lost. Nomerica is set in an alternate history where the United States withdrew from Europe and also from the South Pacific. Germany invaded from the east and Japan invaded from the west. The country was lost when the Axis met in the middle at the Mississippi River. Players play as US citizens or soldiers that must do what they can to survive after freedom was lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nomerica is a game that makes great use of miniatures, but there is plenty of room for role-playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
