			<description>Reverse Charades: Girls' Night In Edition, an expansion pack for Reverse Charades, consists of 220 cards that feature women-themed words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play remains the same as in the base game, with players divided into two teams. On a turn, all but one player on a team give charades-style clues to that one person left out, and that person guesses as many words as possible in sixty seconds. After each player on both teams has had a shot at guessing (and both teams have had the same number of turns), the team with the most words guessed wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
