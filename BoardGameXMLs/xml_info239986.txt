							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Digimon: Digital Adventures (Version 1.x)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those of you not familiar with Digimon; Digimon is a series of the monster taming genre. That means that it&amp;rsquo;s all about humans and monsters working together towards their goals; generally speaking that goal is saving the world, if not multiple worlds. Digimon, or Digital Monsters, are powerful creatures generally formed out of data, who sport incredible power. Most times paired up with a human partner, often refered to as a Tamer or a Digidestined, who the Digimon will protect and fight alongside, growing stronger physically by changing their forms through Digivolving, while their partner often grows into a better person along the way; overcoming their fears and shortcomings in order to save the day. Digimon will most likely be inhabitants of the Digital World, a chaotic plane all their own with mysterious origins. Digimon stories are tales about growing up, overcoming your fears, and making lifelong friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
