							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aveyond: Lord of Twilight</name>
									
			<description>A street thief steals the wrong heirloom and finds herself on the run from a powerful vampire mage.&lt;br/&gt;In fulfillment of prophecy, the evil sorcerer, Mordred Darkthrop, initiated a series of actions that would eventually see him rule the world. Darkthrop&amp;rsquo;s reign of tyranny and his lineage ended abruptly, when he and his only son died moments before his goal was realized.&lt;br/&gt;The prophecy, however, lingered on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two hundred years later, young Mel, a common street thief, is about to have her life turned upside down, as another stands determined to succeed where Darkthrop failed, and to see the prophecy to its fulfillment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solve dozens of adventure puzzles and explore an enchanting world. Lord of Twilight is packed with monsters, magic, and humor. Race from an evil vampire lord, intent on plunging the world into darkness and enslaving humanity. Gather a colorful group of companions and set out together on a quest to thwart his plans. Traverse a vast, snowy wilderness, rugged mountain ranges, and get a glimpse into the Underworld on your adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lord of Twilight is part 1 of the Orbs of Magic series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
