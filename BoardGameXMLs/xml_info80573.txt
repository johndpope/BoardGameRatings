			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TALES OF THE OSS: The Train is our first Adventure Pack for Simply Roleplaying! Author Mike DeSanto has created a tense World War II adventure where the players are daring opeatives of the OSS (precursors to today's Special Forces), inserted behind enemy lines to stop a strategically-critical Nazi train.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As OSS officers, players must make contact with a band of brave but headstrong members of the French Resistance, win their confidence, train them in their special brand of undercover tactics, and lead them in a number of missions to stop the Nazis in their tracks. Based on historical stories of this amazing group of freedom fighters, TALES OF THE OSS: The Train offers drama and excitement of a different kind for players and gamemasters who may be tired of the same old dungeons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The package comes complete with new weapons and equipment cards, character sheets for some pre-designed player characters (or you can create your own using the Simply Roleplaying! rules), important handouts and pullouts for ease of play, and even a set of black-and white cardstock figures of OSS operatives, resistance fighters and Nazi forces. Artwork by Jeremy McHugh adds a great touch of historical atmosphere to this great adventure package.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
