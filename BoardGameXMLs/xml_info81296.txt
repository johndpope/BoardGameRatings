			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;The new colorful Smurf Carousel of Ravensburger games on the Smurf village is great! The Smurfs can not get enough of the fast gyros, so that you will get dizzy ... With skill you manage to stop the carousel and with a good memory and a little luck, help the Smurfs find their homes.&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 1 roundabout carousel, &lt;br/&gt;24 Schlumpf cards, &lt;br/&gt;1 Instructions&lt;br/&gt;Suitable for children aged from 4 years&lt;br/&gt;For 2-4 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Youngest player begins. Player takes spinner-karussell and makes it spin as fast as he/she can. Then he stops it with his finger. Finger now shows one smurf that you need to find. If finger is between two of them, you can spin again.&lt;br/&gt;Then you can turn over one smurf house to se if that one fits or not. If it is, you keep that house, if not, you lose your turn and leave the house where it was.&lt;br/&gt;When you turn over smurf girls house, you can keep it right away and spin spinner again. If you turn over a black witch card, you miss a turn and discard that card...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules come with some variants and some tips for beginners and for pros on how to stop the spinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You win by getting the most cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
