			<description>&amp;ldquo;2 Armies of Wind-up toys duke it out. Based on an old video game. Victory: Players get 1 point every time a toy goes off their opponent&amp;rsquo;s side of the board. The game ends when the counter pile is empty and there are no toys left on the board (or no toy has been able to move in 5 turns.) The player with the most points wins the game.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on an 8x8 grid or chess board. Six and eight-sided dice are required. There are twelve wind-up toys in the game, each with its own counter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, all of the toy counters are placed in a cup or face down in a pile. At the start of a player&amp;rsquo;s turn, a toy counter is drawn and placed at that player&amp;rsquo;s end of the board. Each of the player's toys moves once. The type of move each piece can make is determined by a die roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
