			<description>The game setting is some date in the near future, after a nuclear war that destroyed much of civilization as we know it today. You play as Luke Rider who is a quiet stranger that roams the lands looking for fuel and other items to upgrade his car, bolster his defense, and survive. Along the way, Luke encounters many foes, be it a convoy of looters, a gang of hoodlums, or a person selling some upgrade parts. Money is a thing of the past. Gasoline is the now the currency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luke Ryder is solo deck builder. It's you against the deck. Contained in the deck are support cards, enemy, attack, defense, and deck manipulation cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was designed from the ground up to played as a solo game. That means you do not need worry about rule exceptions or solo variants in order to play the game. The game contains a deck of 54 cards. 39 of the cards in the deck are unique and 3 have multiple copies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luke Ryder is unique from other card games in that it contains the &amp;quot;The Ultimate Geek DiceDeck&amp;quot; system. This allows for a random enemy attack between 3 and 6 each turn and blends dice with cards without the necessity of custom dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
