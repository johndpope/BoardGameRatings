			<description>Forsaken Uprising a new MMFPSG (Multiplayer Medieval First Person Survival Game). The game centers on a wide variety of craftable goods and building components that vary in strength and usability. The combat system is very fast paced with a 3 tier stat system based on stamina, strength, and health. The player can literally run until they fall dead of exhaustion. Digital Homicides developers wanted to create a game that combined all the elements of games we enjoyed since there wasn't anything in the market that was giving exactly what we craved. You will have to build your castle, grow crops, and keep your livestock alive so that you can defend yourself from other players or for the brave venture out and lay siege with catapults and take others riches for your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
