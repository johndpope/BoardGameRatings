							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reinforcements: Vehicles &amp; Aircraft</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to our first wave of reinforcements for Weird War Two. In this installment we give our field commanders the vehicles and aircraft that just couldn&amp;rsquo;t fit in the main rulebook. There were literally hundreds of vehicles and their variants introduced by the Axis and Allies during the course of the war, and this product allows you to field some of the weapon systems found in the early, mid, and late war periods. We&amp;rsquo;ve also added a couple of traits to be added to some of the vehicles from the main book to make them more historically accurate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
