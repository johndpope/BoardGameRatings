			<description>Seven jewels have been stolen from the eyes of seven skulls [they must have been cyclops skulls, eh? - though I suppose it's easier than having three and a half skulls lying around...].  You have been given the challenge of returning them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are scored by delivering gems and by defeating monsters.  Your character assigns points between Sword, Mace and Axe talents but also Earth, Water and Fire spells (no Air?!).  The dungeon is made up from the face-down hexagonal tiles at the outset.  When explored, you get to orient the hex tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tile may have nothing, a chest, a monster or a skull on it.  Combat with monsters is a simple dicing affair.  The chest rules are unclear; it seems they're used to store stuff (since your hand of cards is normally limited to three).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Really crude components that you must assemble yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
