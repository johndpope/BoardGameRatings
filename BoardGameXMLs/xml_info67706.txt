			<description>War in the Age of Magic is a set of fantasy wargaming rules based on the &amp;quot;square bashing&amp;quot; grid system pioneered by the &amp;quot;Rules for the Common Man&amp;quot; team.  The rules are for 15mm mass battles set in &amp;quot;Dark Ages&amp;quot; mythic lands.  Rules include battle lists, victory conditions, magic, monsters and heroic combat.  Only 6 sided dice are needed.  46 pages plus 1 quick sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;square bashing&amp;quot; system, as it has been named, is a departure from normal miniature systems in that it imposes a seven by five square grid over the battlefield. This grid affects movement and combat - doing away with tedious millimeter measurements and allows the player to focus on maneuvering his units and rolling the dice. Squares can be either open (no impediment to movement) or closed (terrain impedes movement).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment needed for the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A Table (7' x 5') marked out in a 1 foot grid.&lt;br/&gt;     Some pieces of terrain.&lt;br/&gt;     An army for each player. Most armies will have ~22 units and 2 generals. Normally, a unit consists of 4 bases, except Character, Artillery, Chariot, Monster consist of 1 base only.&lt;br/&gt;     About 15 Dice (Ordinary 6 sided dice)&lt;br/&gt;     Some dead body models to represent casualties for the purpose of morale tests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
