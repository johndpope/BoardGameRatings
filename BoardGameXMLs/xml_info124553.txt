			<description>Players are collecting interesting themes for the next show in the series, there are 6 categories - Space, Dinosaurs, Technology, Underwater, Nature and Man. On the board theme- and action cards are randomly distributed. In his turn a player must answer a question from one of the 6 categories. If his answer is correct, he may move up to three spaces, if his answer is wrong, he moves one space. If his move ends on a space with a card, the player may turn the card over - if he can use it for one of his themes, he can take it. If it is an action card, he can use it immediately or later in the game. The player who gathers his 4 themes for the show first, wins the game..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
