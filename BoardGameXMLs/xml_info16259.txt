			<description>The game is ideally played by two players each of whom is the captain of a team. &lt;br/&gt;Captain throws die to determine who bats first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fielding captain shuffles the bowling card deck and places it face down on the table. The fielding captain sets his field by placing one man in the shaded area for the wicketkeeper, one man in the shaded area of board for the bowler and his remaining men in nine different selected positions on the field. (The fielding captain may reset his field at any time between bowls)&lt;br/&gt;The batting captain places one batsman at the wicket. Each time the batting team loses a wicket, the captain of the team surrenders one of his remaining ten counters (representing his batsmen) to the opposition captain. When the last of these ten counters has been lost the innings is closed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play begins with the fielding captain turning over the top card of the bowling deck. This action represents one bowl. The card tells where the bowler has aimed.&lt;br/&gt;Hitting the ball: batter spins both spinners and then throws two dice to determine how he hits the ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
