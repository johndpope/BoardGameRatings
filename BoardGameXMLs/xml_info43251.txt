Corresponding to the thrown numbers of the two dices, or as wished by the players, doubled or trippled numbers the players are asked to bury all the symbols on their hands with skillful moves on the gameboard. There are many unforeseeable obstacles to overcome by the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
