							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carnage: Drive to Survive</name>
									
			<description>Carnage is a racing battle game set in Britain in 2020 or so. Players take control of vehicles from humble Reliant Regals to top-spec Lamborghinis, and then kit them out with improbable Equipment and weaponry, with a view to slaughtering similar minded opponents. They take part in &amp;ldquo;duels&amp;rdquo;, (races against each other for honour, pride or cash&amp;hellip;.but mostly cash), in order to better their machines and skills for the next race. What the end goal is of all this, probably no-one knows, and the Police seem strangely absent from all this. Ah well, who said reality was fun?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start the game with a kitty of &amp;pound;1000.This is used to buy their vehicle and all specialised items for it. They may in the course of the campaign add money to the kitty by winnings, and spend money on repairs, new weapons &amp;amp; equipment, new vehicles etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
