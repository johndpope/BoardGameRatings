			<description>Eduskuntapeli is roll and move game from the sixties, where your want your party members to be elected to Finnish parliament (Eduskunta).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you roll the die and move one of your party members in the game board. Some areas in the game board are electoral districts, where you collect random amount of votes (1000-4000). 10000 votes gets you candidate to be elected to parliament. When you have gathered at least 10000 votes for your current candidate, you can move him/her to parliament. Then you can start moving and collecting votes for your next party member. Every player has 16 candidates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course there are some squares where you have to pick up a random event card. Event cards might give you votes or get your party member to be elected as a minister or get the whole government to be moved to some parliamentary committee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other way to get your party member to government is to move one of your already elected members of parliament to government squares on the board. You want you MP's into government because then you get extra votes.&lt;br/&gt; Game ends when one player gets all his/her party members elected to parliament. Winner is the player with most votes, when the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
