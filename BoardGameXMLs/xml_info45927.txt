			<description>&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Big Bang Comics is a superhero role-playing game, written by Chris Carter and published by Pisces All Media in 2006. The game uses a modified version of the d20 System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game exist in either of the two worlds of Big Bang Comics (the Silver Age Earth-A or Golden Age Earth-B). Players may create new heroes or take the part of existing heroes from Big Bang Comics. Characters are created with two character classes: a power origin Entry Class, and a &amp;quot;civilian identity&amp;quot; representing their out-of-costume occupation. The power origin classes include choices such as Mutant, Elite (super-trained normal), Sorcerer, and Mechanical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game rules use standard d20 skills with a large range of original &amp;quot;Feats&amp;quot;, which in Big Bang include super powers and other abilities.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher &amp;quot; Based on the popular BIG BANG COMICS universe, this gamebook is a complete d20 based system for adventures, character creation and having fun with the classic styles of comics from the 1940s to 1960s... and if you wish, right through to the grim and gritty street cred of the 1980s, the scattered symbols of the 1990s and the over-commercialized modern day!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BIG BANG's focus is always on the fun in comicbooks with larger than life pure-hearted heroes from the 1940s and their descendants and inheritors in later generations across two Earths. The rulebook covers character creation, Feats and Negative Feats -the concept that Pisces introduced to d20- complete rules for all types of comicbook adventures and battles including wisecracking, insults, scaring baddies and of course superhuman and even ULTRAHUMAN feats of strength, speed, endurance and agility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook features predominantly full color artwork by many of the leading artists in comics from today and yesterday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab this one NOW true believers!&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Big_Bang_Comics_(role-playing_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
