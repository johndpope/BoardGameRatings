			<description>Created by Haworth Furniture, HAWORTHOPOLY was designed to reflect the distinctive look of this contemporary office furniture manufacturer. The content was product driven and used to excite the employees about the product line. To add to the flair of the presentation, a game was placed on each employee&amp;rsquo;s desk overnight to greet them in the morning as they arrived at the office. Predictably, there was a significant buzz that spread from the associates to the marketplace as games were shared with clients. It proved to be an unforgettable promotion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
