			<description>DNF 2: The sequel to the successful Dummy Never Fails, with new features, bigger levels and more skins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dummy Never Fails and DNF: Community have over 35 million plays on the internet. We can say that was a success so a sequel was needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dummy Never Fails includes new features like gravity control. You can play throught all new 60 bigger levels, create your own or play online those created by the community. The level editor has been improved and now you can create bigger levels and rotate, resize &amp;amp; duplicate objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being the skins one of the key points in the series we have renamed it to just &amp;quot;dummies&amp;quot;. So there are 50 new dummies to unlock. There is a dummy editor included to allow players to create their own, play with them and share with the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
