			<description>Flash is a card game for two to five players.  Play is much like Rummy, but the emphasis is on sequences.  In fact, the player with the longest sequence at the end of the hand is the only player to score.  Melds of three and four of a kind are useful, however; they are immediately replaced by a like number of cards from either the stock or the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
