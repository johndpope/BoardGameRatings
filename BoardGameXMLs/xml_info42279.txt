			<description>Publisher's description: &amp;quot;The wild race of sets and runs! A fast and furious take on traditional Rummy! Players race to get rid of the cards in their hands by creating sets and runs in the middle of the table. Don't have the right cards? No problem -- grab from a set or run already on the table, or play your cards on any existing set or run.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of Out of the Box's Fun to Go series, the tin contains 72 cards: 1-12 in five colors, 9 wild cards, and three draw-3 cards. The entire deck is dealt out, then each player takes a hand of 8 cards from their draw pile.  There are no turns &amp;mdash; players may do any of the following six actions, at any time and in any order: play a set or run, play a wild card, draw a card, add to or draw from a set or run, or play a draw-3 card. A set is 3 cards of one number; a run is 3 consecutive same-colored numbers. They are set down so that each player can see and reach them. When a player has got rid of all the cards in their hand, the round ends immediately. Each other player must then add points to their score for cards remaining in their hands: 5 points per number card and 10 points for each wild or draw-3 card. After four rounds the player with the fewest points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
