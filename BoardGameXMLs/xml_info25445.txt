			<description>Players receive a green card with the sentence &amp;quot;Have U It?&amp;quot; on it and an equal amount of red counters.  Each letter has a corresponding number next to it in red.  The first player picks a card from the deck and checks to see if the letter and number coincide with his card.  If it does, he places the card face-up in front of him If not, he calls out the combination and all players check their cards.  The player who needs it takes the card. When someone fills their card, they yell &amp;quot;I have it&amp;quot;.  All players pay him in red counters the total value according to the numbers of the letters which they are missing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
