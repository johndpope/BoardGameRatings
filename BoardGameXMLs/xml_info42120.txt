			<description>A roll-and-move child's game where the players try to collect as many carrots as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player in turn rolls a special die. If he rolls a carrot (coming in 3 different colors), he takes a carrot of this color (if available). If he rolls the rabbit, he advances the rabbit one space on its track, and has to feed him a carrot of the corresponding color (if he owns any).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the rabbit completes one round on his track. The player with the most carrots left (regardless of color) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
