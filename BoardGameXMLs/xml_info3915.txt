			<description>The Finish card is placed at the end of the twelve Track cards. Players place their pawns at the opposite end of the finish. Players cut cards to determine the first dealer and the trump suit. In the four-player version of the game all the cards are dealt. (There are rule variations for two and three players.) The player to the left of the dealer plays the first card and the others, in turn, must follow suit of they can. The highest card wins the trick and advances one&amp;rsquo;s pawn down the track. The color of the card on which the lead pawn rests is always trump. No players may share the same space. If the next space is occupied, the player advances to the next unoccupied space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the deck contains two Suit Yourself cards and four Sidetracked cards. The Suit Yourself cards are ubertrump and the players must follow trump if any trick is lead with it. Any player who takes a trick containing a Sidetracked card must move off the track and but that player comes back to the track on the next trick that player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get one&amp;rsquo;s pawn to the Finish card is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
