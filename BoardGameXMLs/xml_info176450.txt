			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ties that Bind: Tales of Legend-Haunted Arkham Episode 6 is an Episode for the Dark Aeons: The Atlantean Chronicles Role-Playing Game. It is set in the city of Arkham. The Cast are called in by a friend of the Curwen Family of House Draconis in an attempt to find out why their friend Cirilius Curwen II is acting so strangely just because his arranged marriage to Erika Dardanus of House Thalus. If this marriage doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen it could lead to open conflict between the Atlantean Houses of Arkham and House Draconis, destroying to tenuous peace that now exists in Arkham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All that is needed to run this Episode is a copy of Dark Aeons: The Atlantean Chronicles Role-Playing Game and 9 decks of playing cards (for the Actors and Director). It should be noted that the upcoming Arkham: City of Secrets setting book will expand on the Arkham setting in much greater detail than is presented here. As such, we have provided a set of pre-made Persona Sheets for this Episode in order for a Director to simply pick this Episode up and run it straight from the presented material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ties that Bind made its first appearance through Cthulhu International at the Origins Games Fair in 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
