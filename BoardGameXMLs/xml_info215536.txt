			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Venerate Me is a roleplaying game that aims to generate stories. Every part of your character is designed to give you, and the game master, something to roleplay with and create story hooks for. This system highly abstracts combat and skill checks and focuses more on emotion. The setting is intentionally light, it lets you fill in the world as you need but gives some guidelines on how to build the world to give you a starting point. Technology in the Chosen Land is specifically vague but Grecian or Medieval settings are the easiest to work with as they offer some powerful lore and starting points, there is no reason this system couldn&amp;rsquo;t be used in a modern day or futuristic setting however.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
