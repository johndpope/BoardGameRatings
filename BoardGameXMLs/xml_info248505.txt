			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The razor's edge during a &amp;quot;Mexican Standoff&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You were a nice group.  Well, maybe not really nice, but at least you weren't going to shoot anyone.  But something went wrong.  A disagreements.  An offensive joke.  A conflict of interest.  The reason doesn't matter anymore; you don't even remember the reason.  All that matters is that you all have weapons in hand, and you're all staring at someone else...  And they think it's all your fault.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
