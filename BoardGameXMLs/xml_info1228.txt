			<description>MANEUVER is a game of skill and strategy for two players.  Each player has nine tanks and nine guns to deploy on the board.  Each player maneuvers his tanks with the objective of being the first player to get one or more tanks across the board to the opposing side.  The guns are deployed along the side of the board and are used to fire at and destroy enemy tanks.  Because the guns are deployed secretly to conceal their ranges of fire, playes must maneuver their tanks with skill, seeking to discover the gun placements of their opponent and achieve a breakthrough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10 to Adult&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
