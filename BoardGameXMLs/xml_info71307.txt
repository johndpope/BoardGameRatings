							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grandia Xtreme</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grandia Xtreme took the relatively traditional RPG gameplay of Grandia 2 &amp;amp; stripped it down to an almost pure dungeon explorer, with the focus being on psuedo-random dungeons, level progression &amp;amp; skill acquirement, rather than the traditional story telling of the series. Despite these changes to the structure, the combat/progression mechanics are very similar to Grandia 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was released on the Playstation 2, skipping the Sega platforms that Grandia games typically came out on in the past because of the death of the Dreamcast platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
