							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lady Bug Fly-a-Way</name>
									
			<description>First you attach a plain balloon to a nozzle inside a plastic flower. Another flower device acts as a spinner on the top and an air pump underneath. Players spin, count the number of ladybugs showing on the spinner, and then pump it that many times. Each turn inflates the balloon until at a certain point, the balloon is full and suddenly flies off. The one who does this is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Completely luck-based game from Marx Toys, known for making games involving novelty plastic devices. This particular game is under their label &amp;quot;The Little Entertainers: First Games for the Very Young.&amp;quot; The game states ages 4-8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
