			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite being the third Princess Daphne, Cennette chose to leave Rose Island to its fate and pursue the man she loves, Drake. Blessed with angelic blood and a stunning natural aptitude for combat, Cennette is renowned as one of the most skilled fighters of her time. At Drake&amp;rsquo;s side she doesn&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to take arms when necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warrior - Light Wanderer - Level 45&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Master Dodge: Whenever Cenette Dodges successfully, you may move her 2 inches. This movement may be used to leave Hand-to-hand combat without having used an Action to Escape previously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supreme Agility: When Cenette Charges (Normal or Special) she can change the direction of her Line of Charge one time. The Charge can still be Intercepted if she passes close enough to an enemy Unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Albas (Ki, Charge) - +3 Attack / +2 Damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last Rose (Ki, Attack) - +5 Attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pewter figure is unpainted and unassembled. Requires additional Anima Tactics figures to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
