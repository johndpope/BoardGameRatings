			<description>Welcome to the colorful city of Bhazum!  Ruled by the Councils of the four Cliques, the city is spilt into two prosperous disctricts. Players are in control of one of these two districts, and by drafting and playing cards depicting the city's Characters, they attempt to secure the support of the councils and have the best inhabitants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with players drafting the 64 character cards to form two 32 card decks, one for each player.  During the player's turn, the player gains actions to play Character cards into his district.  Each character belongs to one of the four cliques, and many have special abilities, called Traits, that occur when they are placed into a district from a player's hand.  Additionally, at the end of a player's turn, the player will place a card from his hand face down on one of the council cards.  When a Character with the Ksari trait is played in a district, the corresponding Clique Council is convened, and the player with the highest value of face down cards wins the support of the convened council.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players score points for the Characters in their districts, as well as points for the Council support they have received.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
