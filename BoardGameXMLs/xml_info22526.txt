			<description>Maug the Wizard-King is dead.  You are one of his apprentices, skilled in the dark arts and in the arts of sorcery.  Summon minions to fight your battles, wield earthshaking magics.  Vie for control of ancient libraries, pools of magical power, and mighty fortresses.  Then, when the time is right, take the Diamond Throne for your own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each apprentice has a different deck of spells available.  These are not only thematic, but give different sorts of abilities.  Wizards going on quests can find magic items.  The Regent must be deposed from the throne first, then the throne held for three full turns to win.  Meanwhile, the peasants will attack whoever currently holds the throne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game contains a rolled up laminated color board, player mats, and cardstock counters, tent-folded figures, a spell deck for each player, and monster and item cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
