			<description>&amp;quot;Medal of Honor: Frontline is the 4th installment of Electronic Arts' popular Medal of Honor series. The character controlled in the game is that of Lt. Jimmy Patterson, from the OSS, as he campaigns his way across Europe into Nazi Germany itself, during World War II. It was released in North America for the PlayStation 2 on May 28, 2002 and for the Xbox and GameCube consoles on November 10, 2002...&lt;br/&gt;Like its predecessors, the player takes on a first person view and fights as an American OSS operative in World War II. There are six missions in Frontline, each breaking down into several smaller levels. Briefings take place at the start of each mission, which help advance the plot and introduce new characters. The smaller missions take place in a linear path, with the player fighting through towns and countryside, killing enemies, and completing objectives. Objectives are explained to the character in a smaller briefing before each level, which prepares that player for that particular mission, the &amp;quot;War Room&amp;quot; serves as the game's main menu, it is modeled after one of the secret underground intelligence bunkers in England during WWII.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Medal_of_Honor:_Frontline,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
