			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capital City needs superheroes. The police are kept busy dealing with all sorts of problems. Criminals, monsters, aliens, and supervillains pose constant threats. This is a city that can use all the help it can get. That&amp;rsquo;s where super kids come in!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prepare for a boatload of &amp;quot;Muhahahaha!&amp;quot;, a pinch of &amp;quot;Bow to your new master!&amp;quot; and a smattering of &amp;quot;All your base are belong to us!&amp;quot; Supervillains, with the aid of their henchmen and minions, are ready to bring Capital City to its knees... or at least become more than minor annoyances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Super Kids expansion introduces the following 10 new supervillains, henchmen, and minions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Necrolose. The necromancer, Necrolose (not to be confused with the undead sweetener of the same name), is capable of zombifying the KO'd to create an army of minions.&lt;br/&gt;    Zombie Thrall. Mostly unthinking minions, zombie thralls latch on to their targets and will take it up a notch to protect their maaasterrrrrr.&lt;br/&gt;    Voodoo. Where people flee and voodoo dolls be, the vile Voodoo you can expect to spot. &lt;br/&gt;    Voodoo's Doll. Voodoo's animated dolls try to &amp;quot;pin&amp;quot; adversaries in place, and they bestow a final blessing on their master when KO'd.&lt;br/&gt;    Behemoth. An over-sized Sasquatch, Behemoth is at his meanest when the odds are stacked against him.&lt;br/&gt;    Gremlin. Sasquatch's sidekick, Gremlin, is lightning fast, mucho sneaky, and carries a bag full of trickery.&lt;br/&gt;    Retroman. Retroman - a supervillain blast from the past - is bent on downgrading all of Capital City, sending it back to his comfort zone: the 1980s. &lt;br/&gt;    8-Bit 2D-Zero. Retroman's droid sidekick, 8-Bit 2D-Zero, uses his tractor beam to bring targets in close so he can short their circuits.&lt;br/&gt;    Double Trouble. Trouble can replicate himself and make Double. The result? Double Trouble.&lt;br/&gt;    Hallucia. Hallucia, The Mistress of Illusion, creates illusory clones to battle and confuse her enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
