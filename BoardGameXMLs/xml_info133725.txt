			<description>First Eagles: The Great War 1918 (Also called First Eagles: The Great Air War 1918) is a PC game (Combat / Flight Simulator) that focuses on World War I between 1917 and 1918.&lt;br/&gt;First Eagles has had fair success in the PC games market, although its impact has a lot to do with the game having an 'open architecture' allowing others to modify and improve aspects of it and add new planes, terrain, weapons etc.&lt;br/&gt;In 2007, First Eagles: Expansion Pack 1 was released that adds the Sopwith Camel, Albatros D.III, Albatros D.Va, and Fokker Dr.I. This pack also includes new campaigns set over the Cambrai sector of France.&lt;br/&gt;In 2008, First Eagles: Gold, a combo pack that contains both the original First Eagles and Expansion Pack 1, was released.&lt;br/&gt;In Feb 2010, &amp;quot;First Eagles 2&amp;quot; was released, following the trend of upgrading to be compatible with Vista and Windows 7.&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on the &amp;quot;Strike Fighters&amp;quot; engine developed by Third Wire Productions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;First Eagles: The Great War 1918&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
