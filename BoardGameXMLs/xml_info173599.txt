			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are all princesses wanting to become the most princess princess in the world. They must collect accessories, dresses and education so that they will gain fame from being rescued by heroes when the demon lords attack. They also need to watch out for weight-gaining food and tea parties, and be careful not to nag too much.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game centers around making &amp;quot;negative&amp;quot; bids for the available cards for the current round. Players bet &amp;quot;nagging points&amp;quot; to gain the card they want; however these nagging points are negative VP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When someone gains a demon lord card, all players are captured and the game is interrupted by a hero rescue auction, in which the players bid for what hero to be rescued by. Depending on the hero and the player's stats, players will gain fame by being rescued. When three demon lords have been defeated, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
