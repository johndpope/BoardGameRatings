			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;The biggest yacht, the fastest car, the hottest spouse and the most magnificent house &amp;ndash; collect all the luxuries and make your neighbors green with envy, at the same time keeping a close eye on them. But remember that even the grandest empire may fall, so watch out for that nasty mother-in-law! The game where you treat your neighbors the way you always wanted to but never had the guts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played up to 6 players. The game has four goals in the each corner of the board: the fastest car, the biggest yacht, the hottest spouse and the biggest and most expensive house. In the middle of the board you have deck of cards you use to get pieces you need to get next best thing in one of the four possible things. You move your playing piece around the cards and if you get the number necessary you can enter to the out of four big goal corners and try to get yourself the next best thing available! You win the game when the mother-in-law gets you and you have the most (better) stuff!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
