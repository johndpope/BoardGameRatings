			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A printable rpg battlemap compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl or skirmish game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset. The map is 50x50, equivalen to 25 of our standard 10x10 tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A forest map, with various sized muddy tracks and trails. Dense areas of forest and woods, with small clearings and rocky outcrops. A campsite in  clearing with bedrolls, crates and a small fire, an ancient road cutting through the trees, with an older, less travelled road leading to an overgrown ruined building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uses: The hideout of a group of bandits, mercenaries or freedom fighters, the haunted remains of an ancient church hidden deep in the forest, the Imperial Road - the last remnants of a once mighty empire now crumbling in the woods, encounters with bugbears, owlbears..and even regular bears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    250dpi A4 pdf, with gridded map spread across 50 ages for easy printing.&lt;br/&gt;    250dpi full jpeg versions (gridded and non-gridded), for VTT or poster printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A note on VTT use - we have deliberately kept the quality of the file high, and you may need to resize the jpeg for use in your VTT software. Keeping the file size and resolution high gives you the flexibility to use the map how you want - crop out a particular section or use the entire map, the choice is yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
