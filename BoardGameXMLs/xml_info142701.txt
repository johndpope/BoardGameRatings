			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Traumaville: To many, Traumaville is just another quiet city, with well-manicured lawns, tract housing, friendly neighbors and honest suburban living. But stay in town for any length of time, and it&amp;rsquo;ll become quickly apparent that there&amp;rsquo;s more to the city than would appear at first glance. For one, Traumaville happens to be the murder capital of Southern California; more teenagers disappear from the school and upper-middle class neighborhoods than anyone could think possible. It&amp;rsquo;s as if, for some reason, evil is attracted to Traumaville. Those in the know argue that the city has become a mecca of sorts for all types evil: serial killers, practitioners of witchcraft and other hellspawn. In actuality, bad mojo just kind of permeates the place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And despite all of this, people still come in droves to live in bright, sunny Traumaville. Even the residents who live here seem ambiguous to the horror and danger that surrounds them, as if missing and dead teenagers are just a way of life. It is because the residents of Traumaville are desensitized to the violence?&lt;br/&gt;Or perhaps something more nefarious holds sway over the community...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note:  Includes the adventure &amp;quot;Wrap Party:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs are all members of the Traumaville High Theater Company or are friends/significant others of someone in the Company. In order to raise some money for props and playbill printing costs, they recently dressed and acted as ancient Peruvians for the Peruvian Mummy exhibit at the Traumaville Museum. As the exhibit ends, the Company has decided to hold their wrap party at the museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
