							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Computer Foreign Exchange</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A computerized version of Avalon Hill's Foreign Exchange board game.  The rules are identical to the board game, but the computer takes care of all of the bookkeeping.  Players own and manage multinational companies in various cities throughout the world.  Changing conditions affect currency exchange rates, and players must decide how to react to these situations after considering the financial resources of their company and that of their opponents'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
