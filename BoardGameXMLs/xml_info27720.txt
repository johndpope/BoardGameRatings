			<description>From the box: GALLERY is a boardgame in which you must get the best painting collections and then  show them in your own  galleries, fully joining yourself into the exciting world of the art collecting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game mechanics are: &amp;quot;buy property&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;strengthen property&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;wait for other players to land on it and have to then pay you&amp;quot;. Its originality resides in the fact that, in order to &amp;quot;strengthen property&amp;quot;, you must build up your art collection. The better your collection is, the more deadly it becomes to other players who must spend money when they land on it. Players compete among themselves to obtain the best sets of pictures to fill in their galleries. &lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;Game components:&lt;br/&gt;- A boardgame.&lt;br/&gt;- 171 painting tiles.&lt;br/&gt;- Two dice.&lt;br/&gt;- A cloth bag.&lt;br/&gt;- A wood hammer.&lt;br/&gt;- 6 pions.&lt;br/&gt;- 12 gallery property cards.&lt;br/&gt;- 42 fortune cards.&lt;br/&gt;- Million &amp;quot;Galleys&amp;quot; money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
