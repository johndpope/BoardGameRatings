							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hissy Fit: the Thinking Drinking Game</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's Hissy Fit'', a new kind of party game for adults featuring creativity, vice, and reckless behavior! Oh, and also drinking and gambling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We present, for your entertainment, a new sort of party game for adults. Fair warning, though, it contains drinking, racing, expenditure of petty cash, and all manner of chicanery. Have you ever wondered if you were the fastest thigh-poker around? Are you confident that you could portray the most convincing withered crone? Do you excel at eloquence while inebriated? Want to win money from your friends? Do you enjoy judging the wit and skills of your peers? If you answered affirmatively to any of these, Hissy Fit is the game for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, and it also pays for itself the first time that you win, provided you play for real money. Now that's value!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of Hissy Fit consists of players dividing into teams and competing against each other in bizarre and humorous challenges. These can be anything from &amp;ldquo;First person to reach the Great Outdoors&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Best Impromptu Facial Hair&amp;rdquo; to the dreaded &amp;ldquo;Slurgeon General&amp;rdquo;, where a player will be forced to navigate a tricky tongue twister. After judgement is passed, losing players pay a dollar in tribute, and the winner flips their coin to determine how the drinks are administered. If they&amp;rsquo;re lucky, all the losers will drink, but if fortune turns against them, they drink instead. After much competition, the besotted winner gets a huge pile of cash, and the losers go home happy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's with the name? Well, in Hissy Fit, outbursts of laughter are both constant and contagious. Naturally,we decided to reward and punish it simultaneously. When the Hissy Fit token is invoked, all laughter is forbidden and only good-humored hissing is permitted. This effect persists only until someone screws up, but it is truly a sight to behold. As it happens, trying not to laugh is in fact more hilarious than just laughing, and the copious hissing adds tremendously to the fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a game that pits subjectivity against objectivity in winners. Want to win a &amp;quot;Best&amp;quot; challenge? You'll have to convince the judge of your superiority. Want to win a &amp;quot;First&amp;quot; challenge? Well, the only things standing in your way are your own limitations. It's truly the best of both worlds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
