			<description>Global Chess is pure chess with 64 squares, traditional pieces and traditional moves. The game of chess was developed when armies fought on open fields in distinct formations and the entire battle could be seen from a single vantage point. As warefare and technology have advanced, battles are fought over the limb of the horizon with no edges to the battlefield. This is the transformational premise of Global Chess. There is no backline and no sideline on the Global Chess board. There is nowhere to hide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think of a 64 square chessboard wrapped around a globe. Now you can play chess around a sphere with no edges to the game. The problem is that it's difficult to see all the squares at the same time and understand your options. The Global Chess game separates the globe at the equator and flattens them into hemispheres that are geared together. By turning the game you rotate the hemispheres against each other to examine the crossing point of a piece in it's possible trajectories across the hemisphere or through the poles. Turning the board does not alter the relationship of the game pieces to each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The easy to understand rules of chess as they pertain to a global playing surface are explained in text and graphic form. The possible strategy is yet to be written! The board is annotated to record game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
