							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Citizens of Bedlam (Mutants &amp; Masterminds Edition)</name>
									
			<description>Supervillain sourcebook for the Bedlam City setting; available in Mutants and Masterminds and Savage Worlds versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are ninety-two NPCs for the Bedlam City  campaign setting, each ready to suffer and die in whatever ways you prefer. We know you can think of some real tasty ones (and we're sure your PCs can, too).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the characters in this book have superpowers, but most are much more soft and vulnerable. Because every good superhero campaign needs a steady supply of secondary characters to run, scream, fall off things and generally get in the way. It's also helpful to have people who could sue the PCs, treat their injuries or serve them pancakes in a diner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of these NPCs are characters we mention in the main Bedlam City sourcebook (yes, you will finally get to see stats for Count Skankula). But at least as many are completely new. Use them in whatever cruel, depraved way you like best. Feel free to bend, fold, spindle and mutilate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
