							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">PiRat Rummy</name>
									
			<description>Times be tough on board the Red Chetta. Cheese is scarce and the smelly humans be going crazy mad with the Scurvy bug. The Vermin crew have split thar allegiance. Half be siding with our fair Captain Gruyere while the rest be hidin behind the big mouth of Til Mook. Instead of riskin the entire crew on an all out war, the mice and rats have agreed to the &amp;ldquo;Test of three&amp;rdquo;. Each captain will send forth squads of 3 to fight. When 3 sets of 3 have managed to win their fights and hold their ground, the losing crew members have agreed to be cast adrift on a rotten cheese wheel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In PiRat Rummy the two players play the battling PiRat captains choosing and sending out their crew members into battle. Players make squads (sets) of 3 cards and places them into one of 3 fighting rings. When a set is placed opposite an opponent&amp;rsquo;s set and in the same ring a fight takes place and the losing squad is removed from the fight ring. The object of the game is to place and keep 3 strong squads on the field before your opponent and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PiRat Rummy was designed as a submission to Cate108's Themed Rummy contest 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
