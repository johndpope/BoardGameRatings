			<description>This small free, print-and-play game is a preview for the Napoleonic Operations system game &amp;quot;Batavia&amp;quot; and depicts the British seaborne invasion of Callantsoog (Batavian Republic &amp;mdash; modern Netherlands) in 1799, lead by Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercromby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Second Coalition&amp;rsquo;s grand strategy for 1799 called for an Anglo-Russian landing in the pro-French Batavian Republic. The landing was to coincide with offensives by Erzherzog Karl on the Rhine and General Suvarov in Italy. At the dawn of August 27th, after almost a week of sailing up and down the Dutch coast, the invasion fleet commanded by the Duke of York dropped anchor outside a hamlet called Callantsoog (note the actual spelling is with two &amp;quot;ll&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics of the game are based in the Napoleonic Operations system, a simple operational level (division/brigade scale, 1500 meters per hex and three turns per day) set of rules with 16 pages, whose major interest consists in its original simulation of the flow of the operational Orders through the chain of command of the contending forces, along with the particular initiative of the generals involved in battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The previous game in this series was Bailen.&lt;br/&gt;(&amp;lt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/54417/bailen&amp;gt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/54417/bailen&amp;gt&lt;/a&gt;;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
