			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game about fashion, travel and everyday magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are mages who draw power from fabric, threads and garments.As a coming-of-age rite you're travelling the world. You'll visit new cultures, find out why they value the fashion they do, and summon the spirits of garments to learn magical secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're only novices, and things won't always go well. You might fall in love, get involved in local politics, or overindulge at a festival. When you summon spirits, be careful. You might twist them into a rampaging monster, or destroy the culture's relationship with the garment. What right do you have to power?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weave is a diceless storytelling game for two or more players. To play, you'll just need some paper, character sheets, some crayons/pens, and a few hours to play through an episode of your journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Weave] is a story game about novices in a magical tradition that draws power from fabric, garments and the symbolic power people invest in them.
