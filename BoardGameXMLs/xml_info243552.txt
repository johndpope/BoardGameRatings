							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Emergent: The Supply Chain Strategy Game</name>
									
			<description>Enter the business world as the president of a new company competing for consumers' money. Build your supply chain and your brand to become the leader in supply chain agility, but watch out: your competitors will do everything they can to stop you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emergent is a game about supply chain network strategy with game theory elements. The goal of Emergent is to build a network of Distribution Centers (DCs) to make the most money by satisfying customer demand by selling products from your DCs to nearby cities. The game ends after round 4, and the player with the most money is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Round, all players use a strategic planning board to purchase distribution centers, stock them with inventory and invest in marketing. This is done secretly until all players are ready. At this point, each strategy is revealed and players execute the strategy by placing their distribution centers, marketing chips, and inventory onto the main board. The demand is then revealed for each city on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are able to fulfill demand to each city based on their whether they are the market leader, closest shipper, or the only available inventory. Players then receive revenue and pay costs and the round ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players continue playing for 4 rounds. The player with the most money by the end of the game wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emergent simulates strategic supply chain decisions that lead companies to real success in the marketplace. It punishes timid play and over-zealous strategies, leading people to react carefully to the strategies of competing companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
