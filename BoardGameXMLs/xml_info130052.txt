							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">You Cannae Push Yer Granny Off The Bus</name>
									
			<description>.......but you can push someone else&amp;rsquo;s off&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has two Grannies - a Big Granny and a Little Granny. Big Granny is a passive playing piece, whilst Little Granny is an active playing piece, moving around the board according to the dice roll. Using the Little Granny a player collects Attack, Defence and Hazard cards. The Attack cards are then used to attack other players Big Grannies, who can use the Defence Cards collected by her Little Granny to defend herself. Eg Attack Card - &amp;quot;Handbag Head Bash&amp;quot;. To successfully defend this attack a player must have the &amp;quot;Umbrella&amp;quot; Defence Card. If not, the players Big Granny is moved one seat closer to the door, until eventually she is pushed off. The Hazard Cards add a bit of spice and luck to the game. Eg - &amp;quot;Your Little Granny has just taken her vitamin pills. You may have another go.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can your Granny fend off a whirling handbag attack or survive a bombardment of mint humbugs, with just an umbrella? Can she dodge the tartan shopping trolley to take a swipe at another Granny with her walking stick? Alternatively, bore the pants off other Grannies with stories of your grandchildren or set your ankle biting lap dog on them. All this to push other players&amp;rsquo; Grannies ever closer to the open doors...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Cannae Push Yer Granny Off The Bus is a game of tactics, luck and cunning with a large slice of slapstick comedy thrown in. An ideal family game... especially if Granny is playing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
