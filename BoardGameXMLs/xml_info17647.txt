			<description>LAW &amp;amp; ORDER is a board game concerned with all aspects of the (British) law from employment, marriage, divorce, criminal law, civil liberties, police powers, motoring offenses, children and the law, and consumer legislation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start the game with 50 points and progress round the board moving in accordance with the number thrown on a D6.  Most of the squares result in points being won or lost, or a player missing a turn.  20 points are also awarded for completing one circuit of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On certain squares players will be invited to &amp;quot;Answer a Question in Court&amp;quot;.  Dependant on where the player is on the board the questions are drawn from one of four packs (a total of 168 cards) of &amp;quot;Court&amp;quot; cards (named after Judges Snooty, Boil, Grimface and Wagfinger).  The questions may be multiple choice in nature or require a specific response.  The answer(s) given will result in points being won or lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to score 300 points.  This should take 2 to 3 hours, though game duration can be reduced by reducing the score required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
