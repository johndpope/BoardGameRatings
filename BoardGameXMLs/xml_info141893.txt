			<description>Players select tokens and start them from the middle Square. High roll of the dice decides the starter.&lt;br/&gt;Each player in turn rolls the dice and moves his token the number of squares indicated.&lt;br/&gt;Tokens can move in any direction, therefore players always have a choice of letter squares to land on.&lt;br/&gt;As a player lands on letters, he writes them down in consecutive order. Players try and collect letters which give the best chance of building words of consecutive letters. The words may be of any length, and may have overlapping letters.&lt;br/&gt;Example &amp;mdash; PEGAGAYLYZX contains the words &amp;mdash; PEG ; GAG ; GAY ; GAYLY.&lt;br/&gt;If a token lands on an &amp;quot;ANY LETTER&amp;quot; square, the player chooses any letter he wants.&lt;br/&gt;Tokens cannot pass each other, and cannot land on the same squares. Players can therefore try to block their opponents. If a token is blocked so that it cannot move in any direction, it loses that turn.&lt;br/&gt;The words that are built, count one point per letter. The example above is worth 14 points.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect 20 points is the winner, or, the game can be shortened or lengthened, by deciding at the start of the game what the winning score should be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A variation on this game is &amp;quot;SCRAPWORD&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses any word and all the players write it down. All the players will have the same list of words. The game plays the same way as &amp;quot;AWKWORDS&amp;quot; but when a token lands on a letter that the player has on his list, he crosses it out.&lt;br/&gt;The first person to cross off every letter in every word, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
