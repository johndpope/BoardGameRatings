			<description>D-Day Dice Pocket: Two mini games in one small box!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;D-Day Dice Battle!&amp;quot; is a dice-rolling, competitive push-your-luck game for any number of players, where you must match the enemy forces die for die. While doing so, you can earn medals to influence your rolls... or hinder the rolls of the others!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;D-Day Dice Express!&amp;quot; is a cooperative game for 1 to 4 players, where everyone must work together to invade the beaches of Normandy. Fighting in increasingly harder conditions on 6 different beaches, players must rally specialists to defeat the German defences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This box includes 13 dice, 7 medal/specialist cards, 6 advanced beaches and 1 special black die, &amp;quot;The Kommandant&amp;quot;, which brings an extra layer of difficulty to both games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are special rules to include the grey dice into your main D-Day Dice game as MGF Dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is completely separate game to D-Day Dice, but uses the RWB mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
