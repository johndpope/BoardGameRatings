			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not &amp;quot;that&amp;quot; kind of Law &amp;amp; Order (but close!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scales of justice are balanced precariously. One side is weighted down by the villainy of the scum that bring about more anarchy and discord with each new out-lash. They are brought into check by the responsibility of the just and the vigilant. Those that strive to bring justice and order to the world are at constant war with the baser impulses of man- fighting off depravity, indulgences, corruption, lethargy, and greed at every turn. They know they fight a futile war against the forces of chaos as their legions sleeps within each of us and await the day we give in to the weakness of our hearts in a moment of indiscretion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the pages of this tome you will find the weapons of the lawful and those creatures of chaos that do battle with them. The judge base class, an eternal champion of the law, is part lawyer and all executioner.  He represents the heavy responsibility man has to overcome their animalistic nature and bring order to the universe. He is countered by the convict- a substitution class for those who have learned wicked ways during their time incarceration at the hands of the law. They see the whole legal system as a joke, corrupt from the core and in the pocket of those who play by the unjust rules of the privileged. Finally we will end with the kinslayer prestige class. While each kinslayer tells their own story, each story is tragic for they have been driven to kill their own kin. Criminal? Hero? You decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    20 pages of Chaos vs Law themed material.&lt;br/&gt;    Part lawyer, part paladin, part detective, all exicutioner- he's the Judge base class.&lt;br/&gt;    A substitution class, the Convict, who can represent a character who's been in jail for a while!&lt;br/&gt;    The re-design and re-release of the Kinslayer prestiege class!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
