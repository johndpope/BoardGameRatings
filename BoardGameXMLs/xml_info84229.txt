			<description>Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels is a video game published by EA in 1995 for the 3DO which was later ported to the PC, PlayStation, and Sega Saturn, It is based on Games Workshop's board game Space Hulk and is the sequel to the 1993 game Space Hulk. Like its predecessor, Vengeance of the Blood Angels combines first-person shooter gameplay with strategic elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the initial stages of the game, the player controls a Terminator and simply obeys the orders they are given. As missions are successfully completed, the player increases in rank and can then give orders to other members of their squad.The most common enemy in the game is the Genestealer, but hybrids and others are also present. As well as the main campaign, the game features training missions and recreations of historic battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game included all the missions from the Space Hulk (1st edition) rulebook, as well as the missions from the prior Space Hulk PC game. The PC version came with 2 CD-ROM discs, which allowed for multiplayer games over a network. While the multiplayer was called &amp;quot;deathmatch&amp;quot; it was still a cooperative multiplayer game, where marines compete to kill the most genestealers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
