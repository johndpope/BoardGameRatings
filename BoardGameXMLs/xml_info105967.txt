							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Speed Racer  (Handheld)</name>
									
			<description>Speed Racer is a tie-in to the 2008 film adaptation of the same name. The actors from the movie reprise their role of their video game counterparts.&lt;br/&gt;The game is a racing game in the vein of the F-Zero series, including tracks full of odd twists, turns and loops impossible by realistic standards, set in five vibrant, exotic locations. The goal of the game is not only to win first place in each race, but also to have the most points by the end of the cup to win the competition. Points can be earned by placing high during races, but also by performing stunts and, most commonly, bashing into and destroying other racers with the use of car acrobatics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Speed Racer (2008 video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
