			<description>The game consists of 24 dice. Each die has a single letter on each side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player rolls all the dice and places the resulting letters in a crossword style grid. The objective is to use as few words as possible while using all the letters. The player who needs the fewest words to use all the letters is the winner. The game can be played as a single round, multiple rounds, in teams or the players may choose pass the dice undisturbed to the other player or team so each is using the same letters to form a grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
