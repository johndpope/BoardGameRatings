			<description>21E is co-operative game of following the clues and finding the jewels.  The game is played by deciphering the clues sent from Dr. Iverson.  The E21 code uses symbols to represent syllables.  Once the clue is decoded you are on to the next city and clue.  As the game progresses variants are added to the  21E code to make harder for you and the thieves to decipher the clues. The game includes a Code Cracker card, a deck of Code Cards, one set of city clue cards, paper and pen, and a Mission Pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
