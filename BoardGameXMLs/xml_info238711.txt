			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have some unfortunate consequences to your magic items!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are magpies ... they collect any and everything they come across and, let's face it, they have a thing for magic items. So how about you give them what they want ... with a twist ... magic rope that unties itself, items that boost their armour class but attract unwanted attention, a magic carpet with phobias ... the list goes on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find 21 cursed magic items along with unfortunate magic items suitable for any adventure theme from the jungles of chult, the nentir vale or across to ravenloft. Canny players might find positive uses for these items and indeed some of them do have positive effects ... but there is always an unfortunate side effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are full descriptions, short narrative histories and stats for the following &amp;ndash; (rarity is indicated after the item name):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bottle of Stink, uncommon &lt;br/&gt;Potion of Psychedelic Vision, uncommon &lt;br/&gt;Chalice of Misfortune, rare &lt;br/&gt;Candy of silence, uncommon &lt;br/&gt;Necklace of Fame, rare &lt;br/&gt;Garment of Infamy, rare &lt;br/&gt;Carpet of Will, very rare &lt;br/&gt;Gas of Confusion, rare &lt;br/&gt;Potion of Gibber &lt;br/&gt;Lesser Belt of Banishment, rare &lt;br/&gt;Greater Belt of Banishment, very rare &lt;br/&gt;Rope of Slippage, unusual &lt;br/&gt;Scent of the Prey, very rare &lt;br/&gt;Bag of Rust and Decay, rare &lt;br/&gt;Map of Wandering, very rare &lt;br/&gt;Bracers of Binding, rare &lt;br/&gt;Mirror of Vanity, uncommon &lt;br/&gt;Oil of Banishment, uncommon &lt;br/&gt;Saddle of Haste, rare &lt;br/&gt;Perfume of Tarnish, rare &lt;br/&gt;Hat of Forgetfulness, rare&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
