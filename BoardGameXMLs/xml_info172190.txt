			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the middle ages there was little to no organized sport as we know it. Oh, there were sports and games aplenty, and any time traveler could go back and find the distant (or not so distant) ancestors of such modern games as field hockey, football (i.e. soccer), lawn bowling, and even baseball. But there were no regulated sports with one exception. This was the tournament, a martial sport performed by the nobility, of the nobility, and for the nobility. Tournaments were often planned well in advance (up to a year or more), featured a great deal of pomp and spectacle, and often had carefully spelled out rules for what would be (and would not be) allowed. Best of all, a tournament might last for a week or even longer, and would bring a great influx of people and money to whatever town was lucky enough to have one held nearby. Thus, a medieval tourney makes for an excellent Fantasy Hero scenario, and can feature all the action and adventure a GM and his players may wish for -- even if no one is actually fighting in the tournament itself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The latest addition to the Surbrook's Stuff product line will jousting with the best of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
