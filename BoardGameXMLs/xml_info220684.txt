			<description>A Pulp Science Fiction Expansion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While sword and sorcery was popular among pulp enthusiasts, it was science fiction that ruled the genre. These stories imagined futuristic worlds where man had reached out to the stars and the stars responded, often with violence! Retrospace is a Blood of Pangea expansion that aims to recreate pulp adventures in this style...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Retrospace requires Blood of Pangea to play, adding new rules and additional content, including playable alien races, robots, and special rules for epic battles in deep space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like sword and sorcery, pulp science fiction was a human genre that imagined new heights of technological advancement safe in the knowledge that mankind was up to the task. These were thrilling, action-packed adventures that emphasized heroics as much as hard science, with strange creatures on par with the beasts of mythology!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
