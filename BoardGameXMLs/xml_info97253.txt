							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Terror on the Titanic</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your friend Jessica have been exploring the world-class ocean liner for a few thrilling days. You've noticed that the crew is just as excited as you are to be aboard the most luxurious ship in the world. A little too excited, you think- sometimes it seems you and Jessica already know more about the ships workings than they do. One night, you borrow a pair of binoculars and look out to sea. You've learned so much about this great ship already. Now, you're about to make history when you either avert a great tragedy or fend for your life in the deadly, freezing cold waters of the Atlantic Ocean!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
