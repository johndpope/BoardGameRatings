			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arched stairwell dips slightly before it climbs upwards into what appears to be a small symmetrical chamber filled with a dull greenish glow. A distorted and crumpled humanoid shadow trickles across the room&amp;rsquo;s rune-scripted walls dissipating down the dark basalt steps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chamber itself is small and stark, with the exception of it its centerpiece, a raised dais bearing the statue of a weeping hound-headed humanoid fitted with cruel torture devices. A soft green-glow leaching through the transparent glass floor hauntingly illuminates both the room and the statue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Under the Mountain is a massive dungeon complex extending endlessly below the ground. In a remote past, ancient evil beings dwelled in the area. Now, the remaining of these mysterious evil beings have seized the dungeons and filled it with deadly traps and monsters. Also, many known villains have established their strongholds in the depths of The Dungeon Under the Mountain. Nobody knows why this dungeon is filled by danger, but nobody cares, since this dungeon is the most prized adventure ground of the world. However be warned, adventurers, your life will be not easy here and dozens of self-calling heroes never returned from The Dungeon Under the Mountain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the fifth of a series of products detailing the rooms in the massive Dungeon Under the Mountain environment. This is Room 30, Level 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains one room or one dungeon-based encounter. All the rooms featured here are taken from one of The Dungeon Under the Mountain products, although these products are not necessary, since the encounter can be adapted without effort to any existing dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
