			<description>Consuls of Rome depicts the rise of the Roman Republic, from a small city into a large empire.&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the roles of the noble families, who seek to develop the power of their families in the favorable time: the peak of the Roman Republic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a deck of cards that depicts celebrities of his family. Some of them are capable of great deeds and some will spoil any project with which they are entrusted &amp;mdash; but with a good player's decisions, even those small souls could do a lot for his family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players manage the deck of their characters to achieve, in competition with others, as much as possible on each of the planes of life of the Republic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
