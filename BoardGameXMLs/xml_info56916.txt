							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Net Worth</name>
									
			<description>Net Worth is a financial game that attempts to teach budgeting principles by recreating a typical family economic situation. Players have a monthly budget that includes insurance, expenses, income, savings, and stock speculation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monthly income is determined by the job that each player receives at the beginning of the game and by investments that pay dividends or interest each month. Expenses are both fixed (for insurance, etc) and determined by random card draw. For example, a card may say, &amp;quot;You have a child go to college, pay $50 a month for the next 16 months.&amp;quot; Players are also allowed to take loans, which of course increases monthly expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after 24 months. The player with the highest Net Worth is the winner. Any player who's debts cannot be paid off is considered bankrupt and has lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There does not appear to be a maximum to how many people can play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
