			<description>One player plays the 21 pieces of the French army (including Napoleon). The other player plays the 25 pieces of the English army (including Wellington) and the 12 pieces of the Prussian army (including Bl&amp;uuml;cher). The game depicts the battle of Waterloo, and is played on a somewhat abstract map with squares and lines between the squares to symbolize movement possibilities. All French and English pieces have their fixed starting positions on the board. The Prussian pieces have numbers on them, and come into play on a square marked &amp;quot;P&amp;quot;, on the game turn with their number. The game is played over ten turns. The goal for France is to hold two specific squares marked with red crosses. The goal for the allies is to hold two squares marked with blue crosses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
