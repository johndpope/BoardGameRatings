							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Infamous: The Pirate Wars</name>
									
			<description>Blackbeard. Calico Jack. Anne Bonny. Names that live on in infamy, along with their legendary exploits. Can you continue their legacy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this high stakes game of ship combat and capture, you are the pirates from this Golden Age, and your hand of cards is your flagship! Seize the most valuable vessels you can, embark on lucrative campaigns, and prey upon the ships of your fellow rogues &amp;mdash; but beware the Black Spot, for danger lurks within! You'll find hurricanes, mutiny and vile curses, and there&amp;rsquo;s not a soul to be trusted. Alliances will rise and fall as you seek to build your fortune. When the last volley is fired and the rum is flowing, whoever pillaged and plundered their way to the most loot earns the title of most &amp;quot;infamous&amp;quot;, winning the Pirate Wars &amp;mdash; and the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infamous: The Pirate Wars is a game for 2-4 players, played in turns, and lasts anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes. Working from a hand of randomly drawn cards, you capture ships by matching sets of cards of the same type, and by placing those ships &amp;ldquo;in play&amp;rdquo; on the table. Ships are made up of valuable Loot cards that provide you with gold, and powerful Attack cards that help you defend it. Balancing the two is a key strategy in the game. For once in play, ships can be used to attack and capture ships belonging to other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action cards aid you in this endeavor, and Campaign cards give you extra objectives to achieve along the way. Event cards round out the deck, providing dangerous obstacles to overcome. The game ends when one player has at least 12 cards on the table (across all their ships), and can discard their last card. The winner is the player with the most loot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
