			<description>Ignite the flames of war and take back your homeworld.  For three years the soldiers of the Black Lance Legion have watched as the Invaders turned their solar system into a hellish, desolate wasteland. Humanity's most advanced fighting force lurked in the shadows, doing little while their species was forced to choose between eternal enslavement&amp;hellip; or extinction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wait ends when Admiral Franks, the legendary Storm Lord at the head of the Legion, announces a system-wide uprising against humanity&amp;rsquo;s oppressors. Cromulus and his team of human fanatics find themselves on the front lines, doing whatever it takes to crush the will of the Invaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Sol Invictus, Cromulus finds out that not all humans are willing to take the kinds of risks that he takes. And while he has less than zero tolerance for pacifism, what the Legion does with its softer recruits may be too much even for him...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A POWERFUL STORY THAT YOU CONTROL&lt;br/&gt;The second part of Kyle B. Stiff's legendary adventure gamebook series has been brought to life as never before in this official Sol Invictus game. Get ready for the ride of your life as you become the hero of your very own story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
