			<description>Grand Slam is a card game about Tennis. The are 2 decks of 54 cards, each containing the same number of serve, volley, forehand, backhand, slice and ace cards. All six card types have different values. The points in Gland Slam are counted exactly like in professional Tennis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player plays with the red deck, the other with the blue one. The starting player must open the game with an ace or a serve card. An ace gives him the point immediately, a serve gives his opponent the chance to return. A successful return is made, when a player plays a card of equal or higher value. Playing serves and aces when returning is also possible, but several special rules apply then.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
