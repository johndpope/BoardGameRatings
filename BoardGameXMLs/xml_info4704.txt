							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Real Estate</name>
									
			<description>This game created for the &amp;quot;REALTY WORLD&amp;quot; Company as an advertising tool. The object of the game is to obtain as many home listings and sales as possible, thus earning high commissions. You move around the board using a die roll to land on properties (sort of like Monopoly),  acquire listings of property for sale and then try to find prospects who would be interested in buying the particular property that you have listed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
