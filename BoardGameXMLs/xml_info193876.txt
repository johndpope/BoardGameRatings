			<description>Each player starts with three pigs in his pigpen. The goal of the game is to get rid of the pigs. Movement is determined by two dice and comences on the track of each players color around the game bord ant into the meadow in the center. If at least one of the dice shows an 1 and one of the player's pigs is in a segment of his color, he discards the pig to the meadow, or if a pig is in the color section of another player, it may be put in this players pigpen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the last player gets his last pig onto the meadow. So even if one player is the first to get rid of his pigs, he may still get new ones until the last player ends the game and may himself lose the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
