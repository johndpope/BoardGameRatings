							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Grail Epoch</name>
									
			<description>from the title page:&lt;br/&gt;This game is a hack of Archipelago, which was designed by Matthijs Holter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the designer's blog:&lt;br/&gt;The normal version of Archipelago requires you to sketch out a map of the locations on a piece of paper, but I thought it might be fun to use a bunch of markers and post-it notes on a large piece of posterboard, then add miniatures and props (like the catapult and volcano).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Grail Epoch is a hack (which, if you don&amp;rsquo;t play tabletop RPGs, is something like a remix or a modification) of an existing game of Archipelago II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with Archipelago II, designed by Matthijs Holter, it&amp;rsquo;s a story game in which your character strives towards a destiny that&amp;rsquo;s partially defined at the beginning of each session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Normally, your Destiny is written by another player, but we thought it would be interesting to split the Destiny up between two, just to see what shenanigans would ensue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
