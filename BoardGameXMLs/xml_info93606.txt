							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kamon</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The iOS version of the board game Kamon. The game permits solo play (against an AI), two-player mode, and a new &amp;quot;puzzle&amp;quot; mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Kamon's BGG entry:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the two-player abstract strategy game, Kamon, a hexagonal board is filled randomly with 36 tokens.  Each token is valued 1-6, in each of 6 different symbols.  The black player starts by replacing one of the tokens with one of his 18 pawns.  The white player does the same thing, now constrained by black's choice:  The token she selects must be either the same symbol or the same number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends immediately when one of three victory conditions are fulfilled:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A player connects two opposite edges with her pawns (as in Hex).&lt;br/&gt;     A player completely surrounds one or more spaces - those spaces could be either empty or occupied by the opponent's pawns.&lt;br/&gt;     A player has prevented her opponent from playing any more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
