			<description>Colossal Clash Core Set: The Ultimate Battle for Cosmic All-Time Power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player versus player internal deck-building card game for 2 to 4 players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With whimsical humor and cartoony fun, Colossal Clash takes you to the outer edges of the singularity that lies at the Center of the Universe. There, you will do battle with alien warlords, galactic despots, and masters of every form of power imaginable. Casting about for Creative, Destructive, and Forbidden energies, you will summon strange beings, mighty heroes, and ancient (and bizarre) relics to throw against your enemies, and you'll fling spells of terrible power and reality-altering emanations to...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;... Oh, to heck with it! You're gonna bust some heads and try to wipe everyone else out! After all, this is -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ultimate Battle for Cosmic All-Time Power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set includes 240 cards, with over a hundred unique cards to make the game different every time you play it. Includes the rules in PDF form (with printable tokens and game mat included).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a crossover between magic the gathering and deckbuilding and it does it very well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this deck-building game is to reduce each of your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Player Life to zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two gameplay modes that change how cards are played: Standard and Limitless Mod.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives four &amp;quot;Creative Energy&amp;quot; cards, four &amp;quot;Destructive Energy&amp;quot; cards, one &amp;quot;Forbidden Energy&amp;quot; card, and one &amp;quot;Simple Guardian&amp;quot; card. They shuffle these up and this becomes their personal Deck, which will grow as the game progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a Standard Mode game, each player can Buy one card, Play one Summon, Play one Relic, and Play one Spell (provided that they have the energy to do so). All of his or her Summons can take their Action as well (Buying, Playing, Summons, Summon Actions, Relics, and Spells are explained below in their sections).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you decide to play Limitless Mode, each player can Buy and Play as many cards as they can afford, along with each Summon taking its action. These games change the strategy up a bit, but be aware that in Limitless Mode, player turns tend to take longer, which will make the game itself takaware take more time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the table you will have an ENERGY deck (where you can draw extra energy cards), a GUARDIAN deck (cheap units that add to your defense), a DIMENSIONAL outcast deck (also cheap units that add your attack) and the BUYING deck where all the rest of the cards are added (creatures, spells, instants). You may have up to 5 creatures and 4 relics on the table at any time. Also 5 cards from the BUYING deck are drawn and placed face up on to shape the BUYING POOL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you can buy creatures, draw energies and attack the opponent with creatures you already summoned on the previous turn, spells on the table or instant effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is really great is that creatures in this game also count with special abilities that can activate if you decide not to attack with that particular creature adding a lot of strategy and possibilities to this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player s life is reduced to zero he/she is out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
