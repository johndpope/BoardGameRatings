			<description>Task Force H.A.T. (Heroes Against Tyranny) was formed by the United Nations to combat dangers to the global community. Recruits are bonafide action heroes, like we might see in the movies. Task Force H.A.T. agents are deployed against dictators, drug lords, and the like, when diplomacy and attempts to bring suspects in quietly have failed. Agents are authorized to neutralize the threat by any means necessary. If they manage to collar the perpetrator in their operations, so much the better. Task Force H.A.T. is meant to be played as if it were an action movie. The player characters are the stars of this movie, as such they are protected by the power of the plot. The plot has certain demands on its stars though and if they hope to get better and continue upping the ante on the evil forces of the world they will have to strive to earn Action points. Task Force H.A.T. is intended for 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players earn Action Points by killing bad guys, making cheesy action movie puns and just doing cool stuff in general. Action Points are used to avoid attacks and activate certain special abilities that give players an advantage against their foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes must complete a series of missions to level up their characters and equipment. The better they do on each mission, the faster they are able to upgrade their special abilities and equipment!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
