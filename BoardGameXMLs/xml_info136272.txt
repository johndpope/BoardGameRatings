							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">After the Fall</name>
									
			<description>With civilization decimated, you and your fellow survivors struggle to eke out subsistence and build self-sufficiency before the harsh winter sets in. Can you survive after the fall?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has established an outpost in one of five home bases, from the scrap yard to the mansion. They begin the game with a leader character who has a special ability plus six community members. Each turn the players' improvements produce resources. Then, everyone allocates their people to either scavenge for resources and equipment or build new improvements. Players can also trade to improve the overall community's chance of survival. Finally, resources must be spent to keep the members alive. Over the course of the game, winter sets in. After the fall, the winner is the player whose base is best equipped to survive, and the overall community score determines the fate of the entire human race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
