			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shock Compression&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are lined up. The goals are clear. The waiting is over. The ultimate rush is beginning, and it&amp;rsquo;s going to pull a lot of dangerous elements closer and closer together until they explode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shadows of Seattle have been heaved this way and that in the Great Seattle Artifact Rush, and a fair number of artifacts have been collected (in exchange for a handful of deaths and a helping of destruction). The powers of the magical world have been alerted, and they ready to get their hands on as many artifacts as possible. This means shadowruns, which means plenty of runners are about to be caught up in one of the worst mana-based drek-storms to hit the city in a long while.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What starts as an investigation into a museum heist rapidly grows into a conflagration that could consume a good part of the sprawl. Clever players will need to see if they can survive, and how much nuyen they can wrangle out of the fight. Hopefully they'll get enough for a nice vacation or significant medical treatment, because chances are that they're going to need both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SRM 04-12: Showcase is the latest in the Shadowrun Missions living campaign. Whether you&amp;rsquo;ve been playing the whole fourth series of Missions now and are ready for an explosive turn to the ongoing story, or you are new to the series and are looking for a high-stakes, high-danger run, Showcase is ready for you, with the full adventure details and NPC stats needed to give players one of those shadowruns they'll be talking about for years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SRM 04-12: Showcase is for use with Shadowrun, Twentieth Anniversary Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artifact Rush, Part 6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a long year for both the Draco and Atlantean Foundations, and they&amp;rsquo;ve each amassed a nice collection of artifacts. Ares has offered to host a public showing, allowing both groups to show off their finding. When the entire collection is stolen before the show, the runners are hired to recover the artifacts from the thieves. Find the artifacts and return them to their rightful owners&amp;hellip;or whoever is paying the most!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
