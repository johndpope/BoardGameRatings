							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Volantia: Kingdom in the Sky</name>
									
			<description>Volantia is a kingdom management game about piecing together the scattered fragments of a continent in order to forge a prosperous new society amongst the clouds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a game about building, optimizing and exploring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game positions you as the leader of a green-punk society on a tiny piece of floating earth. To expand and save your people you must scout for new chunks of land to be rotated and grafted onto your existing landmass. You will be constantly designing your island as you build the kingdom that resides upon it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Efficient design will become crucial as you research new technologies and start producing more complex goods. Space comes at a premium and maintaining a stable income to ensure an optimal flow of goods around the kingdom will be tricky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make matters worse, this is a world that is always on the edge of collapsing! To prevent the inevitable sundering, your new citizens must explore and discover the mysterious floating Zardim. They hold the power to keep the land afloat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volantia is a game for the both the most hardcore engineers and the most zen-like sandbox players among us. Both can build an island that they are really proud of!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
