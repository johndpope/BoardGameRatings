			<description>Described by the publisher as a &amp;quot;multiplication and division poker game,&amp;quot; It's a Cinch is an educational game designed to teach multiplication tables. Three stacks of poker-style chips with answers to multiplication tables printed on them are placed in the center of the table. Each player is dealt five cards with single-digit numbers. Each player in turn tries to find two cards in their hand that can be multiplied to match the total on one of the three top chips. The player then captures that chip, discards the two played cards, and draws two new cards. They player may then try to capture another chip (up to three per turn). When the player reaches three chips or cannot capture another chip, play passes to the next player.  If a player makes a mistake and plays the wrong cards to capture a chip, the player must put both that chip and one previously-captured chip on the bottom of one stack and pass his turn. After all the chips are claimed, the player with the most chips wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a couple of variants which add extra rules, as well as a solitaire version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
