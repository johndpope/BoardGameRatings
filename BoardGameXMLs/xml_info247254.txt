			<description>RollerCoaster Tycoon: Added Attractions (also known as Corkscrew Follies in the United States) is the first expansion pack to RollerCoaster Tycoon. It wasn't received well by critics due to the fact that it just featured more attractions, scenarios and scenery. The famous Banner Sign was invented in this expansion pack. The reason why this expansion had two names is that Chris Sawyer originally named the add-on 'Added Attractions', but Hasbro decided to rename it 'Corkscrew Follies' in order to attract the US buyers. This led to confusion and therefore the next expansion pack was called Loopy Landscapes in the whole world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://rct.wikia.com/wiki/Added_Attractions&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://rct.wikia.com/wiki/Added_Attractions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
