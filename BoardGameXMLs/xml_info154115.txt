			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUPERHEROES... THE ROLF! WAY!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Husband and wife superhero team Bulletman and Bulletgirl are confronted with an impossible choice: When nefarious mad scientist Der Kopf kidnaps their son and threatens to kill him if they interfere with his plans, they must choose between rescuing him or saving Guardian City. What are loving parents who fight crime on the weekends to do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given that this is a supplement for ROLF!: The Rollplaying Game of Big Dumb Fighters, they set out to kick the butt of Der Kopf and his Robots of Doom... Little Billy can probably take care of himself while kicking a little robot butt along the way, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Bullets to the Head&amp;quot; brings a new dimension to ROLF! with new traits and combat maneuvers designed to emulate the straightforward, head-busting superheroes of the Golden Age of comics, as well as their goofy sidekicks. The supplement includes, among other things the game-changing Super Power trait and the crazy Walking Disaster Area combat manuever; statistics for six pre-generated characters; and four linked combat scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you like having fun with superheroes and if you like taking ROLF! beyond what we offer up in these supplements by making your own characters, we think you'll love &amp;quot;Bullets to the Head.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interesting Trivia: Bulletgirl was one of the first female heroes to appear in comic books, predating even Wonder Woman. She gained her initial powers by sneaking a dose of her future hussand's super-strength formula, because she wanted in on the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
