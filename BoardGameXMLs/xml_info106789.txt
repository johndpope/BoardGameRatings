			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play Password, and American original. For more than 35 years, Password has been challenging players' communication skills. Teams of two square off to see who can guess the secret Password first. But you've got to be clever when you communicate because players can give only one-word clues, and the fewer clues given the higher the score! Contents: 50 Password Cards, Scoring Indicator Dial, 2 Vinyl Card Holders, Instructions, Score Pad&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
