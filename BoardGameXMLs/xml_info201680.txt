			<description>Behind Football is a board game for 2-4 players over 9 years old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a game designed for the family, football players and anyone who loves board games.&lt;br/&gt;The game covers everything behind the scenes, i.e. the business of buying a club, hiring training staff, building a stadium and investing in club shares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ref's card and 3rd half card keep the atmosphere continuously tense, with lively comments and orders to be carried out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your way to success you&amp;rsquo;ll meet sponsors and the fan club. You will go through nerve-wracking matches and once in a while, will have to suffer the indignity of a touchline ban.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be taken through the entire emotional spectrum with Behind Football.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who supports the best club?&lt;br/&gt;How will MY club perform?&lt;br/&gt;And &amp;ldquo;if only they&amp;rsquo;d bought him&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;fire the manager!&amp;rdquo; are familiar comments from any professional sofa manager.&lt;br/&gt;The passion and belief that anyone can run a football club from the sofa has made a whole range of computer-based football manager games highly popular.&lt;br/&gt;These two concepts are now finally brought together in the Christmas present of the year: &amp;ldquo;Behind Football&amp;rdquo;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played by 2-4 &amp;ldquo;clubs&amp;rdquo;. The winner will be the club which gets the most from its initial investment in the form of the best manager, the best team and the biggest stadium!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAYING THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Players place their pieces on the beginning square (1)&lt;br/&gt;     players roll a dice or dices and move his piece as per the numbers indicated on the dice, clockwise. &lt;br/&gt;     when landing on a field, events are triggered and followed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE FLOW AND AIMS OF THE GAME IS TO&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     control one or more clubs by buying, renting or selling them.&lt;br/&gt;     develop stadiums.&lt;br/&gt;     build team spirit.&lt;br/&gt;     buy and sell shares in the club to make a profit.&lt;br/&gt;     draw a &amp;quot;3rd half&amp;quot; card, with comments or good/bad instructions to be followed.&lt;br/&gt;     draw &amp;quot;Rank&amp;quot; cards, allowing the manager/trainer to rise or fall in ranking.&lt;br/&gt;     draw a &amp;quot;Referee&amp;quot; card with comments from the referee.&lt;br/&gt;     lead the club through exiting matches.&lt;br/&gt;     experience pressure from the fans or the press.&lt;br/&gt;     become manager of the month.&lt;br/&gt;     serve bans.&lt;br/&gt;     participate in meetings with sponsors.&lt;br/&gt;     complete your mission&lt;br/&gt;     LET THE MONEY MACHINE FULFILL YOUR POTENTIAL AND DREAMS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
