			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You were born to rule. Among the heirs to the most powerful nobles of the land, you have always known that one day, it would be necessary for you to accept the power, the privilege and the responsibility of rulership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You never thought it would come so young. But His Majesty has commanded, and you are bound by honour, by tradition, and by duty to obey Him. And so you leave your homes, your families, everything you have ever known and loved, to travel to the Royal Court. There you will be trained in the arts of rulership, and the duties that are demanded in return for the privileges that your rank allows you to enjoy. For though you were born to rule, you still have much to learn. You must learn the arts and the arts of war as well, the disposition of troops and the deportment of oneself. You will learn, above all things, that to rule others, one must first rule oneself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And your life will change forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
