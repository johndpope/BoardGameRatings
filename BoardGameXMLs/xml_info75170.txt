			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harvest Moon (牧場物語, Bokujō Monogatari, Ranch Story), a 1996 game originally released for the Super Nintendo system in Japan, was published in the United States by Natsume in 1997 and was the first installment of the Harvest Moon series. The game revolves around the player tending a farm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A PAL version was released on early 1998 in Australia, France and Germany (with German screentext). It is the last Super Nintendo game edited by Nintendo in these countries and one of the rarest PAL games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was released on the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console on January 4, 2008 in Europe and on February 11, 2008 in North America, costing 800 Wii Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;The game play consists of daily tasks, and strategically using your time wisely for the best outcome in the end. For vegetables to develop, they must receive water each day; lack of water does not kill crops, but does keep them from growing. Animals must be fed once a day to keep producing. While the only care that chickens require is feeding, cows must be continually talked to, brushed, and milked to retain their health. A cow may become sick and even die if not fed for a day. The only way a chicken can die is to be left outside and allowed to be blown away in a storm or eaten by wild wolves. After dark, the only business in town that the player can access is the bar, where a number of non-player characters gather to drink and talk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
