			<description>Maiandros is a 2-player connection game (such as Hex, Twixt, etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games are always played in odd square boards with 9x9 being the minimum size recommended.In this game players alternate turns placing identical two-color tiles, each with an inverse side. Tiles must be placed in a way that its colours match the colours printed on the corners of each square (to ensure all tiles match each other). The goal of the game is to connect opposite sides of the board, be it horizontally (east-west) or vertically (north-south).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
