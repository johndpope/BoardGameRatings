			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;It's really only a matter of time, he thinks, twirling his gun around his index finger. The girl's moves are obvious, rote. She's a teenager; she doesn't know any better. She'll reach out for the only type of protection she's ever really known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which means they'll be coming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that's just fine, the man thinks as his badge glistening in the moonlight. Police car lights flashing just long enough for him to take an illegal U-turn. It's fine because they don't know the game, which means he'll be able to set one enemy against another and buy himself some time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He can use them all for pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A story in the Storytelling Adventure System for Werewolf: The Forsaken&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coyote Falls contains a collection of scenes, Storyteller character records, a number of hyperlinks to various portions of the text as well as bookmarks, so you can always jump right to what you need with just a click.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
