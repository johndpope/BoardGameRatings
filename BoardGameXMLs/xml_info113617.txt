			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new exciting strategy game promoting color and shape recognition. Vivid and shining tiles, painted with water colors, to be placed on a natural bamboo mat for great fun and a learning experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 1-4 players, from 4 years of age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 16 orange squares, 16 blue circles, 16 green hexagons, 16 yellow triangles, 4 bamboo mats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a slight paraphrasing of the inside rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three versions of how to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Version 1: Each player takes one bamboo mat and places it in front of him. Each player takes 4 tiles of each color / shape and places them next to the bamboo mat. Place all tiles in such a way that each color / shape appears just once horizontally and vertically. The fastest player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Version 2: Each player takes one bamboo mat and places it in front of him. Choose one of the given patterns (different levels  of difficulty) and place the tiles on your mats as given in the pattern. Try to place the missing tiles as fast as possible, Pay attention that each shape / color appears just once horizontally and vertically. The fastest player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Version 3: Put the four bamboo mats together to form one big mat. For alone or team play, choose one of the given patterns (different levels of difficulty) and place the tiles on the mat as given in the pattern. Try to place the missing tiles correctly. Pay attention that each shape / color just appears twice horizontally and vertically. The same colors are not allowed to lie next to each other. The winner(s) successfully place their pieces first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
