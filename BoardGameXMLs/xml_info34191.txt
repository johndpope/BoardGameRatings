			<description>A fast playing set of period-specific tabletop wargaming rules emphasizing the use of authentic tactics and doctrine.  Designed with 15mm figures in mind, but usable with 25-28mm scales also.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction, p.2:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;These rules are primarily designed for the wars in the Middle East around the time of the Crusades.  In practice they can be used for warfare in Central and East Asia, the Middle East and around the Mediterranean.  Many armies over this range used tactics and organizations common to the Crusades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules start with the Heraclean &amp;quot;crusade&amp;quot; against the Sasanids and the early Arab conquests.  They carry through to the Crusade of Nicopolis against the Ottomans (1396AD).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules emphasize the tactics used by the various Latin, Middle Eastern, Central and East Asian armies of this time.  The important feature of warfare of this era was the dominance of the mounted warrior.  A wide variety of tactics were used, from the traditional Arabic karr wa farr tactics to the furious Latin charge and the versatile Mamluk.  The rules are not intended to cover warfare by different armies of different eras.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
