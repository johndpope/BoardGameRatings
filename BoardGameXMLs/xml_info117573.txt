			<description>Risk all your troops on a daring land grab. Use diplomacy to coordinate a group assault on the game leader. Feel the thrill of victory as you crush your last opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Conquer Club, an online multiplayer world domination game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for the casual gamer, playing Conquer Club is not a time consuming process. You can take your turn in 5 minutes with your morning cup of coffee or in between classes. A game typically lasts several days, but hardcore risk takers can play multiple games at once and stay up all night strategizing their next move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conquer Club is a turn-based strategy game. Opponents engage in combat and the last remaining player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a map (there is a wide variety of maps to choose from), divided into regions, which are grouped into zones. To start, three troops are placed on each region and they are randomly divided amongst the players. Any of the remaining regions that do not divide equally are made neutral.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then take turns deploying troops, assaulting opponents and reinforcing their regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player always gets 24 hours to take his turn. This means you only need to play once a day, but games progress quicker if players take their turns more often. If a player misses a turn, he forfeits his turn for that round, however he will still get credited with the troops that are due to him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
