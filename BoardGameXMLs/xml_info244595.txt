			<description>Domino Baustelle is a cute arranging fun for 2-3 children ages 2 years and older. Who will get rid of all their domino cards first?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have a domino card with one of the two building site pictures? &lt;br/&gt;Yes? &amp;ndash; Excellent! Then place the domino card so that the pictures that are the same are next to each other.&lt;br/&gt;No? &amp;ndash; Too bad! You can't place a domino; take one domino card from the stack and place it face-up in front of you. If the new domino card matches a picture on the table then you may immediately place it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End of the game    &lt;br/&gt;If players can no longer place any cards and there are no more face-down cards, then the game is over. If a player successfully places all of their domino cards, they win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
