							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Labyronia RPG 2</name>
									
			<description>&lt;b&gt;Synopsis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Labyronia 2 is a traditional, story-driven RPG, mainly focused on a strong atmosphere. The story takes place in a dark, icy fantasy world, and contains horror elements.&lt;br/&gt;The progression through the maps and objectives is mostly linear, but optional secrets are hidden in certain maps. Advancing and puzzle solving may require critical thinking at times.&lt;br/&gt;The game has a simple turn-based battle system, and a skill-collecting system via Arms Manuals and Spellbooks. These items can be found from the secret areas of the game, or bought from certain stores. Playing the first Labyronia is not required to understand Labyronia 2, since the overaching storyline can be obtained through the course of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10 years have passed since the hero of Labyronia fulfilled the Dark Prophecy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Labyronia, a warring world once ruled by four gods of the four elements. To gain absolute power over the unruly nations, the four gods used their might to create the Labyrinths: maze-like structures formed from bits of surrounding nature. To achieve this, they used a magical item called the Pendant of Labyronia, which was said to be of divine origin.&lt;br/&gt;After the people had spent a few years getting lost in the messed up new world, a bunch of monsters appeared. Without further ado, they started to wreck every place (no questions asked) including the capital of the world and the place where those gods were hanging out!&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately the gods had a plan to counter these monsters, and of course they had to go and execute it. This is where things got even worse. It's all got to do with this guy called Arres, and how we gave a good beating to both the monsters and those smug gods! This led to an event followed by the state we're now in...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world has gone cold, and dark. Seriously, there's no clear spot up on the sky from the clouds. I need to scrape frost from my whiskers every morning! Additionally, there are freaking ghosts out there, trying to kill everyone not looking at race or gender. Believe me, you do not want to stick with these guys... 'cause they are gonna stick on you! If we can't resolve this situation with haste, i'm a bit worried that this world might experience the opposite of &amp;quot;heat death&amp;quot;, and it ain't gonna take long! So, it's time to start doing something about it.&lt;br/&gt;First, I need to go see Windir. He used to be a god after all...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;-Garic's diary, final page&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Features&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Discover the hugely atmospheric world of Labyronia during its final days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Learn new skills by reading Arms Manuals and Spellbooks. Explore the world to find hidden skills!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Yanfly's Visual Battler system provides enjoyable combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Recolored and revamped tilesets and graphics to offer an original look.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Solve puzzles and overcome environmental hazards ranging from easy to demanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Experience the dark and emotional storyline in a world of fantasy and horror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
