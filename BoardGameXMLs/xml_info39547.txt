			<description>Cards have a number (1-7) at the top, and a hole at the bottom. Each player starts each round with 7 cards. The starting player plays a card face up to the discard pile. In turn order, players discard a card directly on top of the discard pile, either playing hole-on-hole or hole-on-number. The sum of visible numbers must be equal to or greater than the previous sum, but no higher than 7.&lt;br/&gt;- If you cannot play, take a penalty card -- turn over.&lt;br/&gt;- If you discard a card and the sum is not 7, draw a card -- play passes to next clockwise player.&lt;br/&gt;- If the sum is 7, set aside that discard pile and start a new one by playing another card -- your turn is over (do not draw a card).&lt;br/&gt;If a new draw pile is needed, shuffle all cards already set aside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player runs out of cards (plays their last card creating a sum of 7), they take 1 VP chip + 1 chip per player remaining. Play continues until only 1 player is left with cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 2-4 players, the game ends after 7 rounds; with 5-7 players, play till the VP chips have all been handed out. The player with the most VP wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
