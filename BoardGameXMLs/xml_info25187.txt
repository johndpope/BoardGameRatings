			<description>This is a game for ages 6 and up. The box contains 1 potter's wheel and 100 coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wheel contains 2 circles, and is therefore always showing two results. The outermost circle contains 4 letters (G, N, A and E), the inner circle contains the numbers 1 to 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coins are distributed amongst the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you name one of the other players and you turn the wheel. If the wheel stops on the &amp;quot;E&amp;quot;, you have to pay the indicated amount of coins to the Bank. Stopping on the &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, means you get all the coins present in the Bank.&lt;br/&gt;Does the wheel stop on &amp;quot;G&amp;quot;, the player you have named has to pay you the indicated amount of coins. While stopping on &amp;quot;N&amp;quot; means that you have to pay the indicated amount to the player you have named.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends if one of the players runs out of coins. The winner is the one with the most coins remaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
