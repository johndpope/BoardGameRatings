							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brewin&#039; USA: Taproom Takeover</name>
									
			<description>The brewing industry in the USA is flourishing and taprooms are leading the way attracting customers to the site of creation for the ambitious new ales hitting the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete to brew craft beer and fill their taproom with the best lineup of liquid gold. Taproom Takeover brings dice drafting to the world of Brewin' USA and adding new Breweries and beer cards that can play with the original Brewin' USA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Draft an ingredient die or brew a beer if you have obtained the necessary ingredients. Stock your taproom quickly with the classic beer styles, or be the mad chemist and line the taps with experimental  brews.  When somebody has brewed 5 beers, the game ends and the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will also need to focus on expanding their taproom with more offerings to brew their 3rd, 4th, and 5th beer.  A player may spend two dice showing the Tap facing to acquire a new beer tap.  Each beer tap may have an action that the player may use on their turn as well as 1-2 beer styles and VP associated with each style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
