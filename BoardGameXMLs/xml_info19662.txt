			<description>This baseball game aims to re-create the game of baseball without specifically duplicating the efforts of real-life Major League Baseball players.  The owner of the game simply specifies a number of 'teams' for a league, and then plays out a number of contests to determine a winner.  The 'teams' are simply a bunch of names, since players have no specific individual characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game engine is a set of 100 cards with a series of play results on them.  Results are situation specific; thus a play with one out will turn out differently depending on whether there are runners on 1st base, 2nd, 3rd, or none on.  Each card also has two orientations, with a different set of play results on each side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was marketed in conjunction with The Sporting News magazine.  Included was an abbreviated version of TSN's booklet, &amp;quot;Batting And Pitching Averages At A Glance&amp;quot;, which is designed to help the player figure out batting averages and other stats for his 'teams'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
