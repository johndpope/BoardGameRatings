							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hjalward</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ringed by a timber palisade, the village of Hjalward comprises wooden lodges and cabins built atop snow-covered hills in the shadow of ancient, giant-crafted architecture of a fallen elder kingdom. Looming over Hjalward like a tombstone, a crumbling stone wall fully 200 ft. high and 60 ft. thick and a yet higher sky-scraping tower remind the residents of this mining community of the follies of past civilizations, and that in time all empires crumble. Nearby deposits of iron, silver and lead draw desperate or avaricious miners to this cold, hard place while legends of lost giant treasure ensure a steady trickle of adventurers make the long, perilous journey to Hjalward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Village Backdrops are short, richly detailed supplements that each present a single village ready to insert into almost any home campaign. Perfect for use as a waystop on the road to adventure, as an adventure site themselves or as a PC&amp;rsquo;s home, Village Backdrop present the details so the busy GM can focus on crafting exciting, compelling adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
