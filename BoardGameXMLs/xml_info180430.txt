			<description>Grapple is an exciting 3D platformer for PC.  In Grapple you play as a blob of goo exploring outer-space.  The blob must reach the black hole at the end of each level in order to continue his exploration.  Every level can be beaten multiple ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fling, swing and climb across everything in Grapple.  Different surfaces react differently to the gooball.  Grapple is as fast paced as you want to play it.  With multiple checkpoints and unlimited lives your skill is the only thing slowing you down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
