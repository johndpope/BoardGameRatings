			<description>Elvis - The Game that Allows The Legend To Live On&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using tokens that include a blue suede shoe or a teddy bear, players roll and move around the board, hoping to land on enough spaces (or draw enough record-shaped cards) to earn $25 million - in a combination of cash and gold records (which are valued at $250,000 each).  Most cards list an accomplishment (&amp;quot;Variety declares Elvis &amp;quot;The King of Rock and Roll!&amp;quot;) or event (Daughter Lisa Marie is born) in Elvis&amp;rsquo; life.  Many cards let players collect money and/or gold records.  Others force them to pay money to the bank.  Some send them to specific spaces on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several of the spaces are named after places where Elvis spent his time (Graceland, Hollywood &amp;amp; Recording Studio).  There are also Army and Hawaii boxes, where (if you draw a card and get &amp;quot;drafted&amp;quot; or go on vacation) your token must stay for one or two turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One unique feature about the guitar-shaped game board is the &amp;quot;On Tour&amp;quot; row of spaces that make up the guitar&amp;rsquo;s neck.  Most of the ten spaces here are just the names of cities where Elvis toured and don&amp;rsquo;t offer anything of value.  But the ultimate goal is to reach the last space - Las Vegas - by rolling the exact number needed.  When a player makes it to Vegas, they immediately collect $500,000.  For their next 4 turns, as long as a 1 or 2 is rolled, the player can stay in Vegas for a &amp;quot;Return Engagement,&amp;quot; collecting $500,000 each time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players get a &amp;quot;grace&amp;quot; period and can take out a loan if they lose all of their cash and are forced by a card to make a payment to the bank.  According to the rules, &amp;quot;In the spirit of Elvis&amp;rsquo;s well-known generosity, no player can be forced out of the game by going broke!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
