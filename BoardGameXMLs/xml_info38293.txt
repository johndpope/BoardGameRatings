							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Unnamed Game</name>
									
			<description>The Unnamed Game is a game with three distinct, recurring phases (resource gathering, trading, and creation) for three to five players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During resource gathering, you play a trick-taking game against your opponents. During the trick-taking game, each of you has a unique special power you can use to bend the rules of the game, but when one special power activates, any other active one goes away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll trade the cards you accumulate during the first phase and use them to purchase special one-shot FX in the trading phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any cards you have left over at the start of the creation phase turn into action tokens. You use action tokens to gather workers and to have your workers build creations. You can also use the FX you purchased in phase two to help your workers. The game ends when a player has five or more creations at the end of the third phase. If you have the most creations at the end of the game, you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Unnamed Game requires a Special Powers deck, an FX deck, a Creation Tracker. You can download these from the publisher. You&amp;rsquo;ll also need to provide a Poker deck, about 5 six-sided dice per player, a unique pawn for each player, a totem, and about 30 tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A three-player game takes about 40 minutes to play. The Unnamed Game&amp;rsquo;s unusual structure and strategic nature probably makes it appropriate for ages 14 and older.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
