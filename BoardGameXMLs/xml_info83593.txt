			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Game Enhancement for Honor and Corruption&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quests are monumental undertakings by those of honorable character. Once fulfilled, they provide a testimony to the character and their accomplishments bestowing recognizable abilities.&lt;br/&gt;With the Quest feat described later, a character can set out to accomplish a specific quest that they previously chosen. Once the quest is fulfilled, the character will be granted permanent special abilities and honor points to be applied to their honor score at the end of the game session.&lt;br/&gt;However, not just those with the Quest feat may try to accomplish a questing task, anyone willing to attempt a quest may do so. These characters will be able to also earn honor points, but will not be able to possess the abilities granted to those with the Quest feat.&lt;br/&gt;Thirdly, you can also use the following quests for a guideline when a character is under the effect of a lesser geas, geas, or quest spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
