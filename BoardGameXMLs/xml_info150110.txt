							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Armored Knights: Guderian Crosses the Desna 1941</name>
									
			<description>Guderian Crosses the Desna 1941 takes you to the place where Guderian made his turn to the south and started the encirclement of Kiev.  Two of his Panzer Divisions, 3rd and 4th, attempted to take the major bridge over the Desna River by a Coup de Main.  After failing the Germans make a more deliberate attempt the next day and the fate of the Soviet Armies at Kiev is sealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has units built as Battalions for Infantry, Armor, and Artillery.  Supporting arms such as Recon, anti-tank, anti-aircraft, engineer, and military intelligence are built as companies.  These supporting arms units are used to multiply the combat strength of the battalions.  The system uses a variable strength table that eliminates gaming the system for a few extra strength points.  Players will find that combined arms are the ticket to success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game makes an excellent introduction to the Armored Knights game system.  It is small and yet challenging.  Once you learn the basics of calculating strengths things move along nicely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 2-4 hours&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 1.24 miles / 2.0 kilometers&lt;br/&gt;Units: Company to Battalion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;Four 11 x 17&amp;quot; full color mapsheets&lt;br/&gt;One dual-side printed countersheet (216 1/2&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 26-page Guderian Crosses the Desna 1941 rulebook&lt;br/&gt;Three scenario setup charts&lt;br/&gt;Nine Player Aid Cards&lt;br/&gt;Two 10-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;One 6-sided die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
