			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A delivery person gets winds up in the control room of a burning building. Only he has access to the controls. But to contain the fire and save lives, lives must be lost. It is up to the player to choose what doors to lock, what switches to pull and tell the people where to move. Inevitably someone will die each level, but with too many deaths you will have to try again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
