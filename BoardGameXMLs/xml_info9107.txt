			<description>Based on the long-running game show, players bid on a prize whose value is the sum total of the cards dealt to the players. Each player gets two cards, and in turn players either bid higher than the previous bid or stop bidding by declaring &amp;quot;Freeze.&amp;quot; When all the players have stopped bidding, the value of the cards is determined and the player who bid closest without going over wins the prize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues with a new prize and the cards reshuffled and dealt. The winner is the first player to win three prizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
