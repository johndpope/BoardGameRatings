							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Digimon: Monster Match</name>
									
			<description>The 36 tiles are separately placed face down on the table. The object is to collect a set of 4 characters. A set needs a Kid at first and then followed by related tiles - the In-Training Digimon, the Rookie Digimon and the Champion Digimon. These are collectively known as a Team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game play is easy. Reveal a tile. If you can use it, take it. If you can't use it, it is shown to the other players and returned face-down to the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If an Evil Digimon is revealed you must duel with another player. A duel is resolved by a die roll each, the highest thrower wins. If the challenger wins, the other player has to turn over one of his tiles. The Challenger gets the Evil Digimon as it is worth points at the end of the game. If the challenged player wins, he gets the Evil Digimon tile and the challenger turns over one of his tiles. A further advantage on winning a duel is that you can turn back a tile in front of you if it has previously been turned face down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until there are no more tiles from the middle of the table to be revealed. Points are awarded for:&lt;br/&gt;A complete team (all face-up) scores 5 points.&lt;br/&gt;Any other turned up team members in uncompleted teams score 1 point each.&lt;br/&gt;An Evil Digimon in your possession scores 2 points.&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
