							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monstrous Humanoids</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 16th volume in our Mythic Monsters series, Mythic Monsters: Monstrous Humanoids brings you a dozen and one half-human monsters. Some few are indifferent to the ordinary humanoids that cross their path, simply being another intelligent species on a world full of magic and strangeness, but for others their nearly human shape belies their cunning, cruelty, and predatory inhumanity. The creatures herein include mythological classics from all over the world like the horse-bodied centaur of Greece, the abominable snowmen of the Himalayas, the yeti, the blood-hungry sea hunters of the Solomon Islands, the adaro, the sinister and spiny pukwudgie of New England, and the brutal buggane of the Isle of Man. You will also find a host of horrid hags and classical fantasy archetypes from doppelgangers and mongrelmen to pulp staples like derhii winged apes and serpentfolk. As if this deadly dozen were not enough, we also bring you the xotenga, a flying fiend from the wild wastes that feeds on hunger and is sated only by suffering, a creature that lives and breathes famine and desolation in a rain of deadly feathered shafts plucked from its own desiccated wings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On top of these monstrous mutants, Mythic Monsters: Monstrous Humanoids also provides you a new tool for creating your own awful amalgams, the tauric template for non-mythic creatures and an enhanced mythic tauric template as well, just perfect for the mad scientists, corrupt genegineers, and beast-cultists all over your campaign world. The 13 magical beasts contained herein, ranging in CR from 1 to 13, are updated for the mythic rules, and when we say updated we mean complete stat blocks, yes, but more than that every one of these massive menaces has its own unique and exciting new mythic abilities, from a mythic annis hag's fearful strength and grisly grappler to the earth distortion and rending butchery of a mythic buggane!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
