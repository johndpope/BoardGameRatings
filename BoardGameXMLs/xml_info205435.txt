			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mama Mu is a lively cow who wants to build a treehouse. She asks her friend crow to help her. Crow, as always, is reluctant, but she does. She helps Mama Mu with collecting all the wood needed for the treehouse and a ladder to get in.&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game is to build your ladder, and when you are done you can let Mama Mu get into her new house.&lt;br/&gt;of course you have to take care, wood can get stolen and the farmer should not catch the cow and the crow do &amp;quot;human&amp;quot; things.&lt;br/&gt;based on a childrens book by Jujja Wieslander and Sven Nordqvist who also were the artists for this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
