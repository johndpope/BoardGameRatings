			<description>Super Series Baseball is a game that uses dice to simulate the positions on the field and the pitches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pitcher die is thrown, showing the kind of pitch (curve, knuckleball etc) and a number (1-6). The batter then choses the die shown on the pitcher die, a fastball is a 1, and that die is rolled. The result of that die shows what happened on the pitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 9 dice for the defensive team, one for each position, 6 batting team dice and 9 pawns, used to simulate batters and count the balls, strikes, runs and outs. The game also includes a board and a deck of scorecards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
