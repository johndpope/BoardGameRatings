			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pajama Sam is a series of children's adventure games whereby a player directs Sam through a cartoon world of puzzles and tasks by collecting and using various items.  These point-and-click adventures are suited mainly for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pajama Sam 2 Pack includes both Pajama Sam: You Are What You Eat From Your Head to Your Feet and Pajama Sam: Life is Rough When You Lose Your Stuff, independently published in the series as Pajama Sam 3 and 4 respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Are What You Eat From Your Head to Your Feet begins when Sam spoils his dinner by consuming too many cookies.  The remaining cookies capture him, taking him to a world where healthy food and junk food are vying for more power.  Pajama Sam must find the missing delegates for a scheduled peace conference in order to prevent an all out war.&lt;br/&gt;In Live is Rough When You Lose Your Stuff, Sam embarks on a mission to find his lost comic book.  Among other adventures, Pajama Sam encounters a helpless dirty sock, thus also beginning his search for the missing sock to go with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
