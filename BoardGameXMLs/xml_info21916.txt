							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Double Tangoes</name>
									
			<description>Double Tangoes is the extension of Tangoes, using two sets of tans in each puzzle, instead of one.  The package consists of four sets of seven tans, in two colors, and about a hundred puzzle cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two player game has two players racing to construct the same picture; but it's just as likely that you'll play solitaire,  or play cooperatively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doubling the pieces more than doubles the difficulty of regular Tangoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
