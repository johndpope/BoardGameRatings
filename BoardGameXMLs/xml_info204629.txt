			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play concerns characters who begin as ordinary people with ordinary lives, but who have recently encountered powerful and perhaps transformative experiences. They must cope with the hassles of life in the light of their extraordinary perceptions. They discover that they are newly empowered to act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As their lives transform or disintegrate, their insights (and powers) become more coherent and effective. Which matters more? What parts of ordinary life survive, or become important?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They may become visionaries and prophets, perceiving that the world&amp;rsquo;s nature and dynamics are symbolically powerful and morally critical. They may become driven to act in significant, perhaps even public ways. They may become monsters. They may try to avoid any of these things. The line between what is true and what is insane is no longer clear. What does it all mean?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character begins alone, but their new lives converge in difficult ways. What will they do about that?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
