			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tombs of the Elder Kings of J&amp;egrave;glur, the third scenario that has been made available for players of Shakh&amp;agrave;n, is a mid- to high-range scenario, designed to introduce the Referee and players to some of the more sophisticated and powerful spells and creatures of Shakh&amp;agrave;n, as well as to demonstrate the unique characteristics of Telostic's dank, sinister Underworld complexes. The scenario is, essentially, a &amp;quot;dungeon crawl&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; an adventure in the mid-lower levels of the Underworlds to the east and north of the city of R&amp;ograve;lon in the central Rocto-Ardae Imperium. For optimum play balance, the adventure party should include approximately 3 to 6 characters of mid-high Experience Levels, specifically from V to IX in the primary Level and from III to V as a secondary or tertiary Level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is distributed as a ZIP archive that includes a DOC file and a CorelDraw image file (map).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
