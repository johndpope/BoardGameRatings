							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cavemen Playing With Fire</name>
									
			<description>After their latest journey through time, the Odynauts have landed in the Stone Age. In this world, they are confronted with cavemen who revere fire above all else. Because not all cavemen have yet discovered how to make fire, some try to steal it from the others. The Odynauts see a challenging game in all of this, but being their usual selves think it would be more fun to put out an opponent's fire rather than to steal it. Can you navigate safely through enemy caves? Can your cavemen outwit their stronger opponents or overpower their weaker ones? Can you be the first to put out an opponent's fire?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cavemen Playing With Fire is a strategic two-player card game. The goal is to be the first player to put out one of her opponent's three fires, which in game terms means taking one of the opponent's three fire cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the game, each player receives an identical deck of 25 cave, fire, and caveman cards. Players use the cave cards to create a playing field on the table with three fire cards for each player at each end. In turns, players place cards and take action. They walk and fight among their own caves and those of the enemy to try to reach one of the enemy's fire cards. The cavemen cards are ranked, and some have special abilities. Lost cards can return to the drawing deck, but to do so a player must lose certain cards first. Losing these is tricky, though.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
