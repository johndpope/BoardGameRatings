							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Piotr Put the Kettle On, Khurgan Take it Off Again</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long before the Empire, long even before Sigmar, a warrior chief named Khurgan ruled over an area of what would become southern Stirland. His lands were a comparative oasis of calm in those chaotic and frightening times. In time, as he does to all the Lord of Dreams came to take Khurgan to dwell in the halls of his forefathers. His body was laid in a cave overlooking the most important of his halls so he could watch over his people in death as he had done in life. As his champions also joined their father's they were too laid in the cave to protect their lord for all eternity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
