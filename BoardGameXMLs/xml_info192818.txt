							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tom Clancy&#039;s Ghost Recon Wildlands</name>
									
			<description>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands is a third-person open-world shooter set in Bolivia, where a vicious yet highly organized Mexican drug cartel, known as the &amp;quot;Santa Blanca&amp;quot; has reduced Bolivia to a drug-state.  You're sent into the wilds of Bolivia as one of the Ghosts - a famous US Special Forces squad - to destabilize the Santa Blanca empire and bring them to justice.  Players can outfit their character with a wide variety of skills (which are leveled up during play) and can utilize a massive amount of real-world weapons in the process (all of which can be upgraded and specialized via various add-ons such as scopes, barrels, and even stocks).  Players can tackle this challenge on their own, in Solo play OR play co-operatively with up to 3 other friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
