			<description>Goblins are pillaging the countryside. Heroes are lining up to gain loot and fame. Which player will have the most successful hero tavern in the land?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Character Quest: Heroes The Card Game &amp;ndash; Game Pack #1 &amp;ndash; King's Guard, up to four players take turns collecting heroes and sending them out to gain victory points for your tavern. From the mighty Paladins and Wardens of the King's Guard Tavern to the powerful Great Wolves and Berserkers of the Savage Beasts Tavern, each player will try to create a powerful combo of heroes to defeat even the toughest locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only one deck is needed for up to four players; extra decks can be used separately by each player or shuffled together for everyone to share. Despite the &amp;quot;TCG&amp;quot; in the title, the components of the items in the game are fixed, not randomly distributed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
