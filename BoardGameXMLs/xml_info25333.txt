							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Antiquity Trivia Game</name>
									
			<description>A trivia game on antiques and collectibles.  Questions are given in three levels of difficulty: browser, buff, and advanced collector.  Each player chooses a level at the beginning of the game, thus allowing experts to play with beginners.  Each card has a relatively easy question (1 point if correct) and a relatively difficult question (2 points if correct).  Players announce their intention to answer the easy or difficult question before the next card is revealed.  First player to 30 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
