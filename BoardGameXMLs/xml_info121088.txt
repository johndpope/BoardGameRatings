							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dice Dodge</name>
									
			<description>Dice Dodge is a dice game related to those in the jeopardy family, which includes Pig and Farkle.  However, instead of the choices being &amp;quot;keep rolling&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;stop&amp;quot;, one must choose whether to roll along a column, row, or across the entire board in order to maximize their chances of winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay involves tossing two dice and marking the space on the board corresponding to the row and column rolled.  The player then decides whether to roll one or both dice again in order to place more markers on the board.  The point value of a row or column is equal to the number of markers on it, squared.  If a player rolls a space that has already been marked, their turn ends and their score is tallied.  The winner of the game is the player with the most points after a set number of rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
