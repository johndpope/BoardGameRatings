			<description>Empire! is a space combat and trading video game designed by Andrew Glaister and published by Firebird Software in 1986 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is the pilot of a spacecraft, set during a period of early space colonization. There are 64 star systems to explore, presented in a rotating top-down 2D view. Each system has a starbase &amp;ndash; which issues missions, receives supplies from the player, and sells various ship add-ons &amp;ndash; a sun that presents a navigation hazard due to its high temperature, and one or more orbiting planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can navigate his ship onto a planet's surface through a warp hole (and a tunnel-maneuvering subgame.) Once there, three different supplies can be collected in a first-person flight subgame. The three supplies &amp;ndash; people, minerals and radioactives &amp;ndash; are then made available for pick-up in the main playing area and can be transferred back to the starbase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must also defend themselves from constant attacks from enemy alien ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adjacent star systems can be flown to through an asteroid field (represented by square blocks.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, the player is able to create a vaccine to combat a plague, which destroys systems 200 stardays from infection. The player can eventually purchase better ships and starbases to form their own empire. The last task of the game is to deploy a defence shield network to secure the player's empire from invaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Empire!&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
