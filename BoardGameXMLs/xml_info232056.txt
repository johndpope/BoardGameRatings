			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the privilege of the gods to want nothing, and of godlike men to want little.                                                                        -Diogenes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buddha, Father Sergius, Gregory the Illuminator, Ben Kenobi, Peter the Hermit, Zarathustra&amp;hellip; hermits of many faiths have been examples of how self-privation and withdrawal from society has brought secret power and enlightenment.  When this collected wisdom is shared with others, who knows what might be accomplished?  Find out with the new Hermit Hybrid Class by Aaron Hollingsworth and published by Purple Duck Games.  A hybrid of the druid and witch classes, the hermit displays interesting powers and abilities that will add new twists and turns to your tabletop RPG game!  The hermit uses both the druid and witch spell lists, and augments her spells with illuminations, brought forth with her lantern, which shows all to those who would see&amp;hellip;  The hermit can also withdraw from the world and contemplate what is before her, and eventually impart wisdom upon those who know what questions to ask, communing with the philosophical powers of the universe itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you like spellcasters with a touch of mystery and sense of self, try out the new Hermit Hybrid Class from Purple Duck Games.  We are sure that you will not suffer any symptoms of withdrawal&amp;hellip; from the solitary simpletons at Purple Duck Games, where our games are what you want!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
