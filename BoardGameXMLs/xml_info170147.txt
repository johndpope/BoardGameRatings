			<description>STOMP-EDE! is a dinosaur themed trick taking game. The dinosaurs used in the game were picked from familiar and popular dinosaurs that most everyone knows about. The main goal of the game is to have the most points at the end of the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is broken down into four suits: Green, Blue, Purple, and Orange. Green cards are essentially the trump or the most powerful cards. The player to the right of the dealer goes first, often times they want to play cards with less power to get a good idea of the strength in everyone else's hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who took the previous trick then plays, or &amp;quot;leads,&amp;quot; a new card for the second trick. After all tricks have been taken, their point values are totaled and the winner declared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
