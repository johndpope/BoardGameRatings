							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flaps Card Game</name>
									
			<description>FLAPS is like an extreme version of UNO. Flaps is a shedding-type card game for two or more players that is popular in the United Kingdom and Czech Republic. The sole aim of Flaps is to discard all of the cards in one's hand; the first player to play his final card, and ergo have no cards left, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a custom deck of cards written in both English and Czech. The game has seven levels, each level adding new functionality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
