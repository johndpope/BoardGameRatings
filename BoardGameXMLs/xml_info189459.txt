							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Abort Retry Fail 1000</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Los Angeles, 1991. A machine, formed from liquid metal capable of taking any shape, arrives from a war-torn future. Its mission: To destroy a malfunctioning killing machine gone rogue, undo the damage done to the timeline, and prevent it from changing the future, using any means nessesary. The new machine is sleek, powerful, and impossibly advanced. It can form its limbs into weapons, survive any amount of damage completely unscathed, and impersonate anyone it meets,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It cannot be bargined with, it cannot be stopped, and it is suffering from the exact same malfunction as the last one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abort Retry Fail 1000 is a 1-page sequel game to Abort Retry Fail. Like it's predecessor, players take the role of subroutines collectively trying to direct a killer robot and failing miserably. Each player takes the role of one disguise subroutine of the liquid metal robot, attempting to use their limited skillset to best effect in enacting needlessly complex schemes. Though thematically similar, the game utilitzes a different set of mechanics to create a more competative atmopshere with greater emphasis on encouraging poor decision making amoung players and coming up with madcap actions to pad out your plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a small, minimalist d6 game for three or more players, with light GM duties, best played immediately following a game of Abort Retry Fail. It can be run extremely quickly, lasting between 30 minutes to an hour, though it can end quite abruptly. This makes it great for a warmup or cooldown game, or for running when time is tight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
