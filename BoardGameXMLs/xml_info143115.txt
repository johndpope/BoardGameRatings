							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombie Mall</name>
									
			<description>Zombie Mall is a print &amp;amp; play survival game for 1-6 players set in a local shopping mall.  In the basic included scenario, players are locked inside of the mall and searching for keys to unlock a door and a radio that will allow them to call for help and be rescued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie Mall can be played as a cooperative game, with all players working together toward the end goal of being rescued.  Zombie Mall may also be played where it&amp;rsquo;s every man for himself (sometimes you have to sacrifice a friend to keep from becoming zombie food).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While searching the mall, players will come across Loot (random items &amp;amp; events) and will find Objectives (hopefully one of those keys that will unlock something important, but possibly something not helpful &amp;ndash; such as a swarm of hiding zombies).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That mall map is constructed from Map Tiles which may be configured differently each time you play Zombie Mall.  Sample layouts are shown in Sample Tile Layouts.  The size of your mall directly affects the difficulty, as larger malls will take longer to search and increase the odds of running into hordes of hungry zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One thing that makes Zombie Mall different from many other games in the zombie genre is that players aren&amp;rsquo;t forced to constantly scrounge for weapons.  Basic combat takes into account that players are grabbing whatever is handy and using everything possible as a weapon.  In addition, the players are not treated as ninja trained since childhood, so those randomly grabbed items are more than likely thrown or lodged into a zombie when used.  There are weapons to be found, but the odds are good that a given weapon won&amp;rsquo;t be durable for more than a couple of uses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
