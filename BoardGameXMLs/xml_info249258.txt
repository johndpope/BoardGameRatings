							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mercenary Vators of Myork</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It takes a lot to be a military superpower.  The city-state of Myork does it through their peculiar method of conscription, where the land owners provide the army with vators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But these are just men-at-arms, right?  Boring, NPC fodder that adventurers wade through when necessary and ignore when they can.  No one cares about the soldiers of the various armies - bring on the dragons!  But it is important to think about the soldiers, what they&amp;rsquo;re doing, how they live.  They are the closest thing to adventurers that aren&amp;rsquo;t adventurers, but they so often get ignored and forgotten.  It really is easy to figure them out, and figuring them out will energize your fantasy world and campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Build Your Fantasy World in Small Bites, or Small Bites for short.  Our goal is to take a subject, whether an archetype, a monster class, or some other FRPG theme and bring you as much content about it as we can.  But this isn&amp;rsquo;t a simple one-shot supplement.  We want to get you involved in the process - giving us the themes you want most, the articles you like the best, and the feedback we need to make you happy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please - take a look at what we&amp;rsquo;re doing here.  We know that veteran players and game masters alike are going to find things they can use, and ideas to spark their characters, campaigns and game worlds!  You&amp;rsquo;ve got nothing to lose!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;40 pages of content&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10 game world posts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;11 blog-style posts on the theme and gaming in general&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;and 19 additional articles focused on Men-at-Arms and other important related FRPG topics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
