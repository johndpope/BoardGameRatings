			<description>In Dungeon Duelers, players will take the rolls of Duelers beginning their journey to become Duel Champions, hoping to one day become members of one of the four Guilds of Glory. The game represents a vast journey across the entire world of Thexia. During the game players will capture monsters of their own which they will train. There is no limit to how powerful your monster can become! They will face several encounters like Duelers, Bandits, wild monsters, traps, and other challenges. As they travel between the regions they will discover ancient dungeons filled with rare monsters and treasure. Players will also complete quests that earn them fame which increases their chances of being chosen to be a Guild member. The game can be played competitively or semi-cooperatively if players want to team up against each other to speed the journey along.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into basic and advanced versions. The basic version is much faster to play and simply requires removing a few components and not using some of the content such as the monsters unique abilities. The advanced version is played using all components and takes about 2 hours to play. There are also components that allow for custom character creation which allow a player to save their information to continue playing again possibly using expansions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
