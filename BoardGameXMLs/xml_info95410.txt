			<description>Game box back cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treachery has turned John Hammond's dream into a living nightmare!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His plan, to introduce the children of today to the kings of the prehistoric age, has now metamorphosed into a monster which threathens the world. With the electronic defences out of action and the computerised control systems sabotaged, his deadly creations are now roaming free throughout Jurassic Park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dare you face up to the terrifying Tyrannosaurus Rex, the deadly Dilophosaurs, and the vicious Velociraptors? Only you, Dr. Grant, have a chance of restoring this island paradise to peace. Are you ready.. to play in the park?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manual inside&lt;br/&gt;Astounding biotechnical advances have brought back to life the most awesome creatures ever to walk the face of the earth and have made possible the most incredible animal preserve of all time...Jurassic Park!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humans and dinosaurs - thought to have missed meeting one another by over 60 million years - have been brought on Isla nublar, a tiny island of the coast of Central America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Dr. Alan Grant, world-renowned palaeontologist, you have been invited to examine the cloned inhabitants of this mysterious, fog-shrouded island. The dinosaurs are monitored and controlled by a huge supercomputer, and you have been assured that you can explore the island and see these breathtaking behemoths in complete safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now something has gone terribly wrong.&lt;br/&gt;Jurassic Park's computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, has sabotaged the security systems - electrified fences and motion sensors are down - and hundreds of fearsome prehistoric predators have escaped their pens and paddocks to roam free on the island. Vicious raptors, spitters and tyrannosaurs have quickly overrun even the fortified visitors center. And millions of years of extinction haven't slowed these creatures' reflexes - they still know how to hunt!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll need to accomplish a number of increasingly difficult tasks before you're free to attempt the toughest one of all: getting yourself safely off the island!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you ready to face some of history's most powerful and deadly carnivores? The perilous primeval world of Jurassic Park awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
