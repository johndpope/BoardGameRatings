			<description>Ballpark Classics is a tabletop dexterity game that brings together everything you love about baseball into a beautiful tabletop game everyone can enjoy.  Whether you are a lifelong baseball fan or just looking for a new spin on game night, Ballpark Classics delivers the fun, excitement, and atmosphere of real baseball right in you own home. You pitch by placing a steel baseball into the pitching pipe and squeezing it with your thumb or fingers. By changing your finger placement and adjusting the force, you can throw fastballs, curves, change-ups, sliders, and even create your own pitches. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to do, but challenging to perfect, just like real baseball. &lt;br/&gt;Batting is all about timing, bat speed, and getting inside the pitcher&amp;rsquo;s head. Ballpark Classics features batting so realistic that you can get called out on a check swing. You can play head-to-head, in teams, or by yourself. Pitching, hitting, walks, strikeouts, home runs, strategy, it&amp;rsquo;s all here, except for the smell of freshly mowed grass. They&amp;rsquo;re working on that. Ballpark Classics, Inc. was recently granted an MLB license and is releasing scale model field inserts of Yankee Stadium, Fenway Park, and others in 2009. Ballpark Classics is developing an ever expanding product line of past and presnt MLB parks. By comparison, the Front Porch Classics baseball game is a one-player mechanical pinball game with an inclined playing surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
