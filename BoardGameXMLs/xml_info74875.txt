			<description>From IF Wiki&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Andrew Plotkin. Multiple award winner at XYZZY Awards 1996.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hot, foul, and dark. How did indoor theater become so fashionable? Well enough in spring rain or winter, but not in the thick, dead afternoon of high summer. And though Rito and Imita looks very fine, shining with electric moonslight in the enclosed gloom, you're much more aware of being crammed in neck-by-neck with your sweaty fellow citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Damn the crowd, in truth: your mood was hot, foul, and dark when you sat down. Aessa was supposed to meet you here. She's made excuses before, and you don't think about what it might mean. Try not to think, rather. Just watch the story. One of your favorites. But it's miserably hot, and you just aren't caught up in the play...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
