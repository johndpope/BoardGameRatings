			<description>Mauseschlau and B&amp;auml;renstark want to recover a treasure from a ship wreck deep in the ocean. But the diving is not without risks. There are aggressive sharks, and a mysterious creature guards the wreck. By he who can answer questions and perform tasks related to ships and oceans, and has a little luck with the dice, will be first to bring his treasure to safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a roll-and-move game where the players follow a track through the sea, from the ship to the diving bell, from there to the ship wreck, and upwards to the surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On many spaces, a question related to the sea will be asked; younger childs can select between three answers on the card, older ones have to find the answer without help. On other spaces, a small pantomime is requested. In both cases, oxygen tanks can be won. These are needed on the shark spaces. Without air, the player has to retreat to the diving bell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When reaching or passing the wreck, the player gets a piece of the treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On addition to sharks, the area between the ship wreck and the surface is guarded by a plastic Kraken. It is moved by a special die, and if it catches a diver with treasure, the treasure is lost, and the player is send back to the diving bell. When a player reaches the surface with a treasure, he wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Changes to the precursor (Mauseschlau &amp;amp; B&amp;auml;renstark: Abenteuer unter Wasser) include: Less shark spaces, especially in the last part after the ship wreck; an additional die for the kraken, so the players can move the kraken in addition to their own playing piece; the treasure is easier to get, since the wreck no longer needs to be reached with the exact die roll; a variant is included to make it easier to leave the sea with the treasure. As a result, this revised game plays in half the time, and has less luck of the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
