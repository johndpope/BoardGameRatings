							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lost Paradigm Game System</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is intended to provide a universal, generic system that can support any genre of roleplaying.  The presentation is concise but dense and probably is not a good fit for inexperienced players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have ten Attributes with values assigned from a point pool at creation.  The Attribute value in turn yields a modifier that is used during the game.  Characters have a variety of derived Statistics that are used in play; none of these are well defined in the game but should be apparent to experienced players.  Characters have four Skills which may be defined at creation.  Action resolution uses a modified d20 against a difficulty level.  Characters gain experience points and levels, which improves overall performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
