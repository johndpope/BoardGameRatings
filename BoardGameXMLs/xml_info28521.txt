			<description>The game is played with 5 dice that are marked like playing cards.  They have values: 9, 10, J, Q, K, A.  One player puts the dice in the box and shakes to randomize.  The player then looks at the dice without revealing their value to the other players. The player who &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; states a value for the dice which may be true or false. The other players must decide if they want to believe or doubt the value of the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
