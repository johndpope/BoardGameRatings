			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOLBROOKLYN, NJ -- We at the National Center for Reanimation Prevention and Control (NCRPC) routinely deal with a variety of zombie infestations. It's a testament to the effectiveness of our organization that you are not currently drooling while you sip brains from your friend's skull. It's a dirty job, but somebody has to get paid very little (and no benefits) to do it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That said, the NCRPC is always preparing for the worst. We have plotted out a series of disaster scenarios that could take place if we decided to call in sick for say, thirty days in a row. Presented here for your eyes only are those scenarios. Don't say we didn't warn you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And oh yeah, if you see a guy with a shotgun standing over a twitching, smoldering corpse, a little &amp;quot;thank you&amp;quot; every once in awhile wouldn't hurt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(A collection of adventure hooks for Blood and Brains: The Zombie Hunter's Guide.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
