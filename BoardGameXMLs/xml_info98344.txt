			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two exciting and challenging games! Brickyard! Score points by breaking through the wall of bricks. Eliminate the last brick for a big bonus. Two players can even play at different skill levels. Clowns! Get the highest score on the laugh meter as your clown catapults off the teeter-totter to break through the balloons. Up to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brickyard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Break through the colorful wall of bricks and score! Quickly, position your paddle under the ball again and bounce it back up into the layers of bricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the ball hits a brick, it rebounds back to the paddle with varying speeds and angles. And, like a &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; paddle, hitting the ball on the corner results in steeper angles and faster action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the ball hits the paddle, it moves faster and faster. When you knock out the last brick, you get a big bonus, a victory tune and a new set of bricks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this exciting action game, you can choose a variety of skill levels, game lengths and scoring options. You can even choose different skill levels for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving the paddle and knocking out as many bricks as possible. The current player's turn is indicated by the dark colored box which surrounds his number. When he misses the ball, the next player's number is highlighted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clowns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The circus organ starts to play and a clown steps out on the high platform. He jumps! Quick, position the teeter-totter to catch him and bounce him back into the air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim him at the moving rows of green, red and blue balloons. If he hits one, it explodes with a pop and you score. Break the last balloon of each color for bonus points. Then, aim at a completely new row of balloons to keep increasing your score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to break balloons by catching a clown on a teeter-totter and aiming him at three rows of balloons. The clown moves slowly at first, but picks up speed until he reaches his maximum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A clown may move right through the lines of balloons, missing all of them, or he might pop several on his way up and even more on his way down. Several things determine his success. When he first bounces off the teeter-totter, his angle depends on how close to the middle of the board he landed. As he rises, then again as he falls, hitting a balloon changes both his path and his speed. Learning to control these is the secret to a high score in Clowns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving the teeter-totter and breaking as many balloons as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
