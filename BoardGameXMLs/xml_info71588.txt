			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A run'n'gun platforming game. The player controls 5 Transformers, selecting one at a time, who must run around on on a 4-way scrolling platform comples in search of four puzzle pieces that will complete the Autobot's emblem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Transformer has shields, ammo and strength, which are depleted when hit, firing or running, respectively. All these can be refilled at the shelters, that area bit all over the stage. The Transformers can also be in either robot mode, in which they run, or car mode, which is much quicker and depletes much less strength. However, as the platforms tend to end abruptly with no warning, and the cars can't fly, using the car form was generally just lethal and worthless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player could switch between Transformers mid-game, but leaving a Transformer outside of a shelter would destroy him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
