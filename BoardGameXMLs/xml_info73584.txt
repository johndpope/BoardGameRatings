							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Overlord</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Overlord is a third-person action-adventure game developed by Triumph Studios and published by Codemasters  for the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3. The former two versions of the game were released in North America on June 26, 2007, then later in Europe on June 29 and Australia on July 6, 2007. (...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overlord is set in an unnamed fantasy world, where the player takes the role of a resurrected warrior known simply as The Overlord who has control over hordes of gremlin-like creatures known as &amp;quot;minions&amp;quot;. The player must defeat seven corrupt ruling heroes in order to reconquer the lands and establish his lordship over its inhabitants. The game features a corruption feature, similar to that of the Fable games, but allowing the player to &amp;quot;be evil... or really evil,&amp;quot; where certain actions and choices affect different aspects of the story and gameplay. While the Overlord is controlled in a third person perspective, the way minions are controlled brings elements of real time strategy and upgrades bring those of role-playing games. The game also uses black humour and is often a satire and parody of the traditional fantasy setting and plot.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Overlord_(2007_video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
