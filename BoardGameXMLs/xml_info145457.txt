			<description>With Fire and Sword is a supplement for Sharp Practice covering the activities in South Carolina between June and August 1780, a critical time for the American Revolution in the south after the fall of Charleston.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The skirmishes and small battles that affected the north of the State were to decide whether the Revolution in the South continued, and were to gaina significance way beyond their actual size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chris Stoesen of Georgia has carefully pieced together the events during this period of intense and often vicious warfare and created twenty-four scenarios for Sharp Practice that will provide the gamer with a selection of scenarios, from a dozen or so men a side up to over 100 figures each covering milita, provincial and regular troops.  Even Banastre Tarleton gets to make an appearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
