			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Scintilla, Hive Tarsus dominates trade offworld and generates large tithes for the Imperium. Traditionally each decade, Lucius, the Lord of Tarsus makes a Progress as he travels the desert in a Leviathan vehicle, collecting the Emperor's tribute and fealty from the lesser habitations throughout his domain. Inquisitor Markus Moncrieff is on the trail of a dangerous cult that has infiltrated the court. He is seriously injured and the Acolytes are enlisted to support his effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario features a radical Inquisitor using forbidden xeno tech. It is appropriate for characters with two career ranks; though the finale, a chaos ritual, features a daemonhost, there are potential allies to help. It is easy for the Games Master to make the opposition more determined, more numerous and better armed if the Acolytes have more experience. This adventure is a mixture of investigation and action that should take two to four sessions to resolve. This can be extended by adding additional subplots and extraneous events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
