			<description>From back of the book: Had enough of fighting for king and country? Sick of being told what to do and who to kill, and hanging your butt out on the line every day just so some career-climbing general can reap the benefits of your hard work? Do you think you can measure up in the big leagues, and carve your name into the history books for all time? Well, bud, now it's time to put up or shut up, because not everyone is cut out for the rough and tumble life of today's mercenary! War's a dangerous business, and for the professional soldier, survival ain&amp;rsquo;t as simple as coming out of the firefight alive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Classic BattleTech Field Manual: Mercenaries, Revised provides an in depth look at modern mercenary operations, including where to go for the best contracts and most active battlegrounds. Over sixty of the Inner Sphere&amp;rsquo;s best-known mercenary commands are profiled here including histories, officers, and favorite tactics. Special rules enable you to bring each of these famous outfits to life in your own Classic BattleTech campaigns, while updated rules provide players with detailed instructions for creating and running their own mercenary commands both on and off the field. Compatible with both the Classic BattleTech board game and the Classic BattleTech RPG system, Classic BattleTech Field Manual: Mercenaries, Revised lets you finally prove once and for all if you have what it takes to find fame and fortune as a real mercenary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
