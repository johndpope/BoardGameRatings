							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battles in The Age of War</name>
									
			<description>These are the battles with samurai and ashigaru troops as seen in Ran and Kagemusha. The armies look a lot like the one lead by Tom Cruise in the &amp;quot;Last Samurai&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 5 x 3 foot table. Units are motivated, they carry out actions and then you move on to the next unit. The opponent has opportunity shooting and the ability to react to charges etc. Rules include Pre-battle campaign, challenges, victory points, troop point costs and historical battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
