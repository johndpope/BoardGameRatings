			<description>This is a traditional family board game in the style of monopoly, but with a fruit machine theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to accumulate enough money to spin a jackpot spinner. If the spinner comes up &amp;quot;win&amp;quot; then you win, if it doesn't, the game goes on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, players roll dice trying to match fruit machine symbols. They can only move if they match at least two symbols. They can gamble on rerolling some dice to improve their move, but with the risk of forfeiting their go completely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After moving, players will collect a certain amount of money based on how many symbols they rolled. They can then bank this money or gamble it by rolling a special six-sided hexagonal metal dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is mainly of interest for the incorporation of different luck-based elements: four six-sided dice with fruit symbols, three six-sided dice with numbers, one six-sided metal hexagonal dice to gamble with (which has sides labelled &amp;quot;lose,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;double win,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;treble win&amp;quot;), and one six-sided spinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
