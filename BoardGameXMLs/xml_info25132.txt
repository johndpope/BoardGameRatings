							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Emily Post Popularity Game</name>
									
			<description>Players roll the dice to determine turn order. The low roller takes the Dog card and begins the game. A player may use either die or the total of both dice to move clockwise or counterclockwise around the gameboard. A player who lands on any one of six social event spaces draws top card from the Emily Post Etiquette Deck. Good etiquette cards from this deck are used to collect friends. Bad etiquette cards prevent you from collecting friends but the cards may be discarded by returning to Start. A player wins by collecting five friends while not having the Dog and no Poor Etiquette cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emily Post, an authority on etiquette, endorsed this game targeting girls ages eight to fourteen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
