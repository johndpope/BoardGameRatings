			<description>&amp;quot;Rome is going to hell. Redneck barbarians are raiding the borders, the economy is in free fall and the sewer workers are on strike...again. To top it all, mercenaries and slaves have delusions of grandeur (they want to be paid, for Jupiter's sake!), while those petty pencil pushers at the Senate indulge in never-ending rhetoric displays. As a wealthy patrician, you're pretty sure it is expected that you lend your help to Rome in this dire time of need...but then again: will your &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; do the same? The Ides of March are around the corner...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Togas &amp;amp; Daggers is a semi-cooperative game of luck, intrigue and treason for 2 to 5 patricians of 10+ years of age and around 30 min of duration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives 2 goal cards (a War card, and a Senate card) and 8 coins at the beginning of the game. The game when any of these conditions is met:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     All players lose if a war is lost by Rome&lt;br/&gt;     Any player wins if they simultaneously fulfill both their goal cards (War and Senate)&lt;br/&gt;     Any player loses if they run out of coins&lt;br/&gt;     Any player wins if all other players loose (because they run out of coins).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns alternatively. On their turn, they must go through 3 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Doom phase: The player rolls the 3 doom dice and eliminates 1 dice. Then, applies the result of the remaining 2 dice.&lt;br/&gt;     Support phase: The player chooses either the Frontiers, the Sewers or the Market, and takes action there (possibly pushing their luck!)&lt;br/&gt;     Influence phase: The player chooses either the Emperor's court or the Senate, and takes action there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After this, play passes to the next player. Play continues until a winning conditions is met.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
