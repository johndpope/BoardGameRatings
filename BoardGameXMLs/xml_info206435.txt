			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Shinra&amp;rsquo;s Locker, your guide to the more technological side of the game. Before the Shinra Electrical Power Company became the de facto world government, the various nations on the planet still used and favored basic (and slightly primitive) necessities. Shinra was able to provide the world with better living and comfortable conditions thanks to their Mako Reactors giving cheap electricity and a pathway to new technologies; though the citizens never knew at first what cost they were paying as the reactors were draining the Planet&amp;rsquo;s blood from beneath its surface; heavily polluting the nearby fields and wildlife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
