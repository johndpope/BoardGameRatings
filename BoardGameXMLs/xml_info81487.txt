							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Olympic Field Hockey</name>
									
			<description>Using a derivation of the system premiered in Kings of Pools Waterpolo, Olympic Field Hockey (subtitled Running with Sticks over Grass) is fast play statistical replay game on Field Hockey, with data for replaying all Olympic Tournaments from 1948 onward, both men and women.&lt;br/&gt;To resolve each game you need only a couple of dice rolls, so you may replay an entire tournament in less than an hour.&lt;br/&gt;For each match, compare the attack and the defense values of both teams, and roll two six sided dice for each, to get the final result of a match. But there is also the &amp;quot;infamous&amp;quot; Third Die, a 10 sided die whose result may dramaticaly alter the result of the match, making a win by an underdog team at least possible, even against the best of the best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
