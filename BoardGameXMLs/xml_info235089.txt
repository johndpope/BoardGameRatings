							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot: Fantastic Booster</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Killer Bunnies are back, do a double take, with fan-inspired cards that will make you quake! The Fantastic Booster Deck adds 55 cards to your existing set plus 27 unique small cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New cards include: a Dated Dolla to make you holler, a Soft Kitty Warm Kitty to cure an ill and make you sound witty.  Staring contests are plenty of fun when you play the card Blinky Madison.  Use your phone to play Text Time or Trip's Trips for a new paradigm.  There's a nice nod to Apple's Steve and a Drazi Feud if you can believe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bunny Triplets are for the birds, dispersed in part by Angry Nerds, and if you can count to 99 then you'll find Carrot N quite fine.  Full steam ahead, we're back on track, Fantastic is a new booster you should not lack!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
