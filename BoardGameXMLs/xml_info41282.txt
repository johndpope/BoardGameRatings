							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Soccer Shootout</name>
									
			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;With a super-strong leg that kicks the ball over 16 feet, this soccer star can score from anywhere on the field! Simply rotate his leg to angle the kick, then softly tap on his head to shoot short distances or whack him harder for extra-long shots. But watch out for the goalie as your opponent tries to block each shot and keep you from scoring! Comes complete with a scoreboard, 2 soft foam balls and 9 distance markers. Sturdy plastic goal is 15 1/2&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
