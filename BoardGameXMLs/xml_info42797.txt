			<description>A GAME OF THOUGHT - PHARAMIS is a great game of strategy played by 2 or 4 players.  Each player has one or two armies at his disposal, composed of a Pharoah, of guards and of soldiers.  The winner is the player who first succeeds in removing one or two Pharaohs from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A FASCINATING GAME - Choosing the movements of Pharaoh and of his army, blocking the Red Square, the originality of &amp;quot;Gateway&amp;quot; and the trap of &amp;quot;Transfer&amp;quot; squares allow countering the opponent's plans and bring on new developments at all times.  This is where the sense of strategy comes in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AN ALLURING AND ENTERTAINING GAME - Easy to learn from the start, PHARAMIS immediately arouses the player's interest as well as the curiosity of onlookers.  Mastery of the game however, will evolve according to the players aptitudes and experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AN ELEGANT GAME - The original Egyptian style playing pieces, have an exceptional artistic design.
