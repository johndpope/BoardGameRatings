							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cloister Games</name>
									
			<description>Cloister Games is a nicely presented compilation of four medieval games, typical of those found etched onto monastery floors.  Fox and Geese is played on a board instantly recognizable to us as solitaire. The single Fox wins by jumping over the geese, landing on an empty point and thereby diminishing the flock until it is no longer viable. The geese win by hemming in the fox  so he cannot move. It's not easy to win as the geese. The fascinating game of Merels is better known as Nine Mans Morris and has an entry to itself elsewhere in this database. Albuquerque is perhaps the pick of the bunch, with a strategy resembling a cross between draughts and Merels and its influence is clearly to be seen in modern derivatives such as Kensington. Finally, Fierges is identical to draughts but without the compulsion (huffing) rule.  Each  game is eminently playable in its own right and, together, provide a fascinating insight into the development of modern draughts (checkers). The four boards are beautifully illuminated in medieval style and accompanied by wooden pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
