			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roguelike is a tabletop role-playing game designed to emulate a specific type of computer game commonly referred to as being &quot;roguelike&quot; - that is, similar to a game called &quot;Rogue&quot; that was unleashed upon the world in 1980. Traditionally, roguelike games are single-player computer role-playing games, comprised entirely of randomly generated dungeons that are represented by ASCII characters on the computer screen - the hero (the character being controlled by the player) is, as you might have already guessed, represented by an Commercial At symbol. Despite the extremely simple nature of roguelike games, they continue to enjoy a large amount of popularity even today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite its stated design goal of recreating the experience of very simple PC games on the table-top, Roguelike isn't a beginner's RPG - it assumes that the reader has at least some basic familiarity with the tenets and terms associated with table-top role-playing games. That said, if you read Roguelike and feel that you understand it, then run with it (after all, being adventurous is what the game is about).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
