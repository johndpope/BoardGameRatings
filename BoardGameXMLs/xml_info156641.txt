			<description>from the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;... I wasn't enthralled with some of the particulars of [the Amber Diceless] system (such as the fact that the outcome of all conflicts is clearly determined even before they begin).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get around this aspect of pre-determined outcome a system of token spending has been implimented in Fiat. Token systems are nothing groundbreaking in RPGs. Similar things have been used before to help skew the odds of a given outcome in games using dice. But in Fiat spending tokens doesn't simply provide a greater chance of success at a given action, it causes events in general to unfold in a more unlikely (and hopefully more impressive or interesting) way that the player intends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So while the outcome of a conflict is no longer pre-determined neither is it left to chance. Whatever happens at least one of the conflict participants will end up having the narrative unfold as they prefer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
