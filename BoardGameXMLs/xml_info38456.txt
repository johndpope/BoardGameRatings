							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spider</name>
									
			<description>Spider uses a system of movement and jumping similar to that of Chinese Checkers, but with a twist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first playing piece (or 'fly') to cross the &amp;quot;Goal Line&amp;quot; at the other side of the board becomes the Spider and is placed in the center of the board. On subsequent turns, the Spider player may move the Spider in addition to their normal move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the spider has collected a number of flies equal to the number of opposing players, the Spider is returned to its place at the opposite Goal and another player may become the spider simply by being first to move a fly into the center of the board. Captured flied are returned to their starting spaces when the current Spider 'retires'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another difference is that movement (and jumping) around the Spider's lair in the center of the board may be made in either direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until one player succeeds in moving all of their flies past the opposing Goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This odd game was published in Ocean Beach - a community of San Diego, California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
