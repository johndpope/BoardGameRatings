							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">VITP variant: Story of the Eight-Eight fleet</name>
									
			<description>This is expansion kit for Victory in the Pacific based on Japanese fictional war novel &amp;quot;Story of the Eight-Eight fleet&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Predominance to the battleship of the aircraft isn't proved in this imaginary world. Because of that, the main force of the Pacific war is not an aircraft carrier but a battleship. It plays except for the added battleship, and a few rules as well as the original game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
