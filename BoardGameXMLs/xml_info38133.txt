			<description>&amp;ldquo;Players control rival commercial colonies on a small piece of stable crust on a volcanic moon.&amp;rdquo; Watch out for the random meteor strikes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 10x10 grid with spaces large enough to hold one game card. Each player starts out with one Outpost located in a corner of the map. The deck of 120 cards contains a variety of installations, resources, and volcanic sites. The players earn income from installations. Some installations are required to be adjacent to a certain site or sites in order to produce income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The game ends when the last card is drawn from the deck. The player with the most credits at the end of the game is the winner.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
