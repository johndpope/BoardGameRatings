							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crypts</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of crypts rises at the center of this cemetery.  The largest at the center, built from bright sandstone easily dwarfs the others surrounding it in a circle. While the large crypt at the center has a roof made from slate shingles and a massive stone plate sealing its door the smaller crypts are built foundation to gable from dull granite and their entrances are barred with simple if sturdy wooden doors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The large round crypt at the center is built around two massive marble sarcophagi and its interior is spacious enough to allow some space for moving around and between them. The smaller rectangular crypts were built around one slightly smaller sarcophagus each and their interior leaves no space for anything else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two well kept gravel walkways surround the central building and the ring of smaller buildings. Between and beyond them the ground is covered by a soft carpet of grass and moss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
