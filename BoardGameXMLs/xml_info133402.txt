			<description>Taken from the game's official web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Cobble together your steampunk contraption before your opponent leaves you in a cloud of smoke!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a flying steam-powered city starts to crash, will you escape to the skies or go down with the rubble? Rig up your escape contraption by raiding the salvage pile and sabotaging your opponent&amp;rsquo;s machinations. This quick, easy-to-learn game of luck and strategy will leave you eager to play round after round!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players roll 4 six-sided dice each. The player's goal is to be the first to build an escape vehicle with 1 of each type of available rig parts (six in total) found in a pile in the middle of the playing area. Both players roll their dice simultaneously and tally the results. On the player's turn, they may take one token for each color that they rolled, assuming there are enough to grab from the pile. After collecting the tokens, they are placed into the player's queue, but the player must decide for each token if it is going to be a part to their rig or an action. On the player's turn, the top two tokens from the queue are always activated. If it is a part, it is attached to the player's rig. If it is an action, the action is taken and the token is returned to the pile. The first player to collect 1 of each 6 parts to complete their rig wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
