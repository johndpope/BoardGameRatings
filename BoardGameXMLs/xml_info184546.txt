							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darklands</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darklands billed itself as an RPG, and there was clear intent to develop a rules system, but when development stopped (about 2003) the final state product was a system agnostic setting.  In most respects the world of Darklands aligns with traditional cyberpunk--the world is a bleak place rules by mega-corporations; the poor are left to fend for themselves; pop culture consumes the attention of the average masses.  What makes the setting unique is the concept of the Warbreed--ancient creatures directly created by ancient gods, left behind on earth in ancient times.  But now, the Warbreed have aligned with earth to fight against those same ancient gods.  The campaign primarily is based in Gothica, a brooding mega-sprawl that sits about where present day New York City is located.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the rudimentary &amp;quot;game rules&amp;quot; as presented character creation appears to have been race, class, and level based with attributes purchased using a point pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the early versions the game was released in DOC format.  The final version of the game (v0.71), as released, exists only in HTML.  In addition, a web-based extension was contemplated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
