							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hopelessness</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For all of their efforts in the defense of the Sticks, the Vigilantes have been branded criminals. And not just petty criminals, either &amp;ndash; they have been labeled terrorists. Which means that they now face an opponent like no other: the entire might of the Ultrapolis. They are to be hunted down and executed. Their hidden benefactor is already dead. The Vigilante group is finished. Their only hope of survival is to flee the city and live in hiding far away. Only, there are monitoring devices all throughout the Ultrapolis. To go out into the streets of the city is to be instantly spotted. Their chances of escaping are so slim as to be non-existent. ...But to remain in the city is to guarantee that they will be caught and killed, eventually. So, they will take their one, small chance and hope. For as long as hope lasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
