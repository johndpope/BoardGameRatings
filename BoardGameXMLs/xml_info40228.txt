							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Card Bowl</name>
									
			<description>Card Bowl reproduces the game of football using standard playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game balances strategy and chance, and almost anything that happens in a real football game can happen in Card Bowl, including runs, passes, sacks, fumbles, interceptions, punts, field goals, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special teams plays&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards representing different values are simply drawn in a certain order, and modifiers applied to determine results (e.g. spot where kickoff is received and yardage returned).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scrimmage plays - Version 1 (Complex)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt eleven cards representing players, and spreads them out on the table in formation, face down. The cards are then moved and turned over in a generally specified manner and order, in alternating turns, which represents the development of the play. In addition, at certain points of action, cards are turned over from the remaining deck, which represent the element of chance and the unanticipated dynamics of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scrimmage play evolves around match-ups between offensive and defensive cards, with the values and modifiers determining the outcome. Multiple cards on each side plus drawn cards may be involved in one match-up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At some point during one of its turns, the offensive player executes a play (e.g. hands off the ball, throws a pass). Cards from each hand that are directly involved in the play are then added along with drawn cards, and the offensive and defensive values are compared to determine the outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scrimmage plays can actually replicate the flow and dynamics of a real play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game does require a lot of addition, so being able to add quickly is also helpful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scrimmage plays - Version 2 (Simplified)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team has its own deck of cards (of course team playing cards would be ideal). A third deck is used as the neutral Draw Deck. For each play from scrimmage, each player selects four cards from his own deck. After each play, these four cards are placed in that player's used card pile, and can't be used again until the deck is exhausted. Thus the entire deck is used in 13 plays, then each player starts over with the whole deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each play, each player places four cards from his deck face down representing players. The cards are all turned face up, and the offense chooses which card/player the play goes to based on the type of play he wants to run and the most advantageous matchup. Additional cards are then drawn from the Draw Deck and added to each player's side of the matchup. Cards involved in the play are then added along with drawn cards, and the offensive and defensive values are compared to determine the outcome. Fumbles, sacks, incomplete passes and interceptions can occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For complete instructions, play diagrams and change history, see Web Links.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
