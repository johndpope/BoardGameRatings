							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Barony of Civille</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sitting at the mouth of the Saint Torgoth&amp;rsquo;s Causeway leading to the Newmack Sea is the port city of Civille and home to the baron of the land. This former fishing settlement has grown in the last century to be a stronghold for the Baron Philostratos de Civille as well as a financial boon for the entire area. In growing itself into a small seaport this city has been able to increase income by a factor of five. While the port itself brings in a significant amount of goods it also acts as a travel point for the Caravan Masters. This location is one of the main areas for the FD series and can be used as a base of operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for any adventuring party.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
