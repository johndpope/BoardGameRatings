			<description>In DestiNation USA, players will be traveling across the U.S., trying to hit as many states and as many special destinations as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up the game, place a state token in each of the continental U.S. states, each player places his car token in a randomly drawn state (claiming the token located there), a special destination is revealed (replacing it if a player is already in that state), and each player receives six driving cards from a deck of 62 (48 of those being states and 14 being special action cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player either moves to an adjacent state &amp;ndash; by playing that state's card or any two cards the same color as that state &amp;ndash; or plays a special action card. The player can play as many cards as he can, then refills his hand at the end of his turn. If a player enters a state that no one else has visited, he claims the state token; if he enters the state shown on the special destination card, he claims that card and a new card is revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when either all 48 state tokens or five destination cards have been claimed. Each state token is worth one point, while destination cards are worth three points. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
