							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Candy</name>
									
			<description>Candy is played with a bowl of candy and a deck containing twice as many cards as players.  Players attempt to locate Puck (Jack of Spades) while avoiding Grandmother (Queen of Hearts).  Puck allows you to eat the candy you  have collected on previous turns.  Grandmother allows another player to eat your candy.  At the end of each turn, you must take one piece of candy from the bowl and give it to another player and also trade a single card with any player.  The game ends when Puck and Grandmother are discovered in one player's hand or if anyone eats ten pieces of candy.  The player who eats the most candy wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Candy is an elaborate descendant of The Lost Pueblo of Doctor Green.  It was first published in the program book of ShoreCon 2000.  It was also published in Chief Herman's Holiday Fun Pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
