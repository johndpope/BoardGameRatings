			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Necronomicon or the Book of The Dead is what you now hold in your hands. Many have died for this book and the secrets that it holds. These pages hold the spells of Necromancy, as well new undead creatures that will give children and even the strongest of heart horrible nightmares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This foul book is what many gave their lives to possess. The knowledge and the power that one can gain is worth any risk to one&amp;rsquo;s soul. To become a Necromancer is to hold the power of life and death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anything is worth the risk to gain such rewards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So do you dare look at the pages found within?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 35 page PDF includes 45 Spells, 7 new undead creatures &amp;amp; Hero Designer files for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
