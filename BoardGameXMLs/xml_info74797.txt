			<description>(From the introduction in the book)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TunnelQuest or TQ for short is a brief set of Fantasy Role-Playing rules entitled Dragons, originally designed by Paul Elliot (of Zenobia fame) and developed extensively by Mike Hill (Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls v6.0). Paul&amp;rsquo;s game was intended to provide a simple but compelling set of rules that he could use with his family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the game concepts and mechanics really are simple, it would be helpful if at least one player is familiar with role-playing games in general and such venerable classics as Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls and Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons in particular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play this game and most role-playing games, you will need some dice; TQ only uses the readily available six-side dice. For ease of reference, dice rolls are indicated by the abbreviation: &amp;lsquo;xd6&amp;rsquo; where &amp;lsquo;x&amp;rsquo; indicates the number of dice to be rolled. For example, a roll of 2-dice would be indicated by the code 2d6. The result of the dice roll will often be modified by the addition of 1 or more; so the code 2d6+2 means roll 2 dice and increase the total by 3. Each player, including the game master should have at least 2 dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TunnelQuest 3.0: Features&lt;br/&gt;- The GM never needs to make a dice roll - the turn of events is determined by the player&amp;rsquo;s actions&lt;br/&gt;- Each round of combat is resolved with one dice roll per player&lt;br/&gt;- 2 six-sided dice; you&amp;rsquo;ll never need more than 2 dice per player (including the GM)&lt;br/&gt;- Small numbers - even I can do the math!&lt;br/&gt;- Enemies are represented by one simple statistic and require no record-keeping&lt;br/&gt;- No defined attributes, choose your character&amp;rsquo;s talents and abilities from a list or create your own&lt;br/&gt;- Simple, incremental character advancement&lt;br/&gt;- An easy to use magic system with plenty of options and over 70 spells&lt;br/&gt;- This version of the rules includes a character sheet and a complete beginning adventure&lt;br/&gt;- A breeze to adapt for published settings and adventures&lt;br/&gt;- Designed for traditional face-to-face and remote play-by-post games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
