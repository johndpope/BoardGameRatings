							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hosford (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder Roleplaying Game GM&amp;rsquo;s Resource supplement by John Bennett&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quaint village of Hosford rests along the Cliffway of the Lonely Coast. The industrious folk of Hosford diligently work the area&amp;rsquo;s largest mine, digging deep into the cliffs for ores and gems. However, decades ago, a large section of the mine suddenly collapsed into the sea, taking a chunk of the cliffs with it along with a handful of small homes. Out of this tragedy was born opportunity as the collapse created a sheltered cove and natural harbour for small fishing boats. Thus, in addition to their mine, the citizens of Hosford ply the coastline, narrowly avoiding the sharp rocks just below the water that would doom a larger ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet, terror now grips Hosford. Folk have recently gone missing, including the former village reeve. A sea drake secretly stalks the coastline, fed on fresh human sacrifices by a senile old druid who believes the creature to be some sort of god. The fortress of Caer Syllan has dispatched a new reeve, an ambitious, inquisitive young man to look into the disappearances but so far all he has uncovered are old grudges as neighbour accuse neighbour of these recent crimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hosford is compatible with the Lonely Coast campaign setting, but is also easily inserted into any GM&amp;rsquo;s home campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
