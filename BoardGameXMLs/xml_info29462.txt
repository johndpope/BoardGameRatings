							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Presidential Election Game: Goldwater For President</name>
									
			<description>from notes from Tony and Theresa Game Wardens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This single, large piece of cardboard comprises the entirety of the Presidential Election Game: Goldwater For President (Kom-Pak, 1964).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One unusual feature of this game is that all pieces are furnished as cutout parts, including the six-sided die. Another noteworthy feature is the small Barry Goldwater circle, which presumably was intended to fill the empty circle on the board reserved for the 36th President. This game is marked, &amp;quot;Approved by the Republican Nat'l Committee.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
