							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The March of Bissel Regional Gazetteer</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are reading this than you are most likely a part of the RPGA&amp;rsquo;s Living Greyhawk campaign in the New England area. What that means, in game terms, is that your Living Greyhawk character is considered a resident of the March of Bissel, a small nation in the Sheldomar Valley. Or you may be acting as a judge for characters playing in the March. Bissel may seem like a small and insignificant place when compared to the mighty city of Greyhawk, the dark forces of Iuz, or even our neighbor and ally, Gran March. This is far from the truth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bissel has traditionally been a highly prized and strategically located area of land. Unfortunately, this has also meant that Bissel has seen much conflict over her borders throughout the years. A result of all this movement of armies and cultures through the land has left an area of diverse if unsettled political and religious factions. It is an area ripe with adventure and would-be heroes are at a premium. Do you have what it takes to shape the face of Bissel and the entire Sheldomar Valley? If not, there are always taverns that need barmaids and fields that need tending. But, if you have the strength to accept the challenge of being a hero of Bissel, then read on! Within these pages you will find the information you need to grow in strength and character in Bissel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
