			<description>Players are director of a bank and will invest in products, develop and bring them to the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game everyone receives a card which states which products are to be purchased. With some starting money and one first random product, every turn dice are rolled and paws moved. The board shows all available products, and whenever the player lands on a product space he can either buy it, or must pay the current owner.&lt;br/&gt;Besides product cards there are positive and negative cards which must be drawn when landing on the subsequent space.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one who first succeeds to collect the products on his card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was released in 1997 at the 100th anniversary of the Rabobank in The Netherlands. All cards and components are Dutch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
