			<description>The deck consists of cards with a category on one side of each card. On the other side is a letter and a designation of the place that the letter must occupy in a word, e.g., &amp;ldquo;ending in F.&amp;rdquo; Choose as many cards as you want, stack those with category side up, and then flip the cards one at a time. The first player to name a word that meets the conditions gets the card (or cards, if a stack has formed because no one could think of answers for prior cards). Play until the deck runs out. The winner has the most cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
