			<description>SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;Booz Mooz is a party game with cards, where players let each other take sips or drinks (alcoholic or non-alcoholic) in a sly and playful way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION - theme&lt;br/&gt;Every year, in some deep dark forest, all mooz of the world gather for the great Mooz Fest. A gathering so secret even we don't really know what happens there. All we know things tend to get quite rough. All mooz (players) are eager to have a nice drink (or two, or three, or more...) but the real boozers get lost in the forest. Their follow-mooz cannot wait to find them and lush up together. Are you curious about what kind of mooz you are going to meet? Before you know it, you are in a world of choices, speed, agility and above all: lots of fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOAL&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is simple: The player who has the least blood alcohol content (bac) points when the game ends, wins. The game ends when all cards are face up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY&lt;br/&gt;STEP 1: Gather some friends and take a seat. Clear the table.&lt;br/&gt;STEP 2: Make sure everyone has a glass and fill this glass with a drink of choice.&lt;br/&gt;STEP 3: Spread all cards on the table face down.&lt;br/&gt;The youngest player starts the game by turning a card of choice face up. Turns go clockwise until all cards are face up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Does the Question Mooz has it in for you? Or are you, as Royal Mooz, calling the shots? Are you a Gentlemooz or do you steal booz from your neighbors? Everything is possible, as long as you finish the game as the mooz with the least points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Servant Mooz, another round please!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
