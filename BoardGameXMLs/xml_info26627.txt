			<description>A very basic trick taking trump card game with very attractive art. Apparently made in France, but with no other manufacturing or dating information available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten centuries ago the old time ended when Earth's cities were laid waste in the war that ended all wars. Leaving only mans' final creation, the Robo Legion to fight on until this day. Now you are the only hope left, so take the cards and weild the ultimate source of power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
