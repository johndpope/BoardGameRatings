							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Agaricath Drow Slave Mine</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Agaricath: Drow Slave Mine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep beneath the earth, hundreds of slaves work in the diabolical mines of the Drow, working endlessly, knowing they will never see sunlight again!&lt;br/&gt; A printable rpg battlemap compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl or skirmish game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset. The map is 50x50, equivalent to 25 of our standard 10x10 tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A huge subterranean mine complex. The entrance consists of loading areas, mine carts and guard rooms. One passage leads to the supervisors office and quarters, as well as the barracks for the Drow guards. The other passage leads to the large cavern where slaves are kept in rough cells. The main part of the mine has tunnels, wooden platforms for mining the cavern face, and tracks for removing the ore. Beyond the mines are the caverns of the Underdark, filled with strange fungi and dangerous creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download includes:&lt;br/&gt;250dpi A4 pdf, with gridded map spread across 50 pages for easy printing.&lt;br/&gt;250dpi A4 pdf, with gridless map spread across 50 pages for easy printing.&lt;br/&gt;250dpi full jpeg versions for VTT or poster printing (gridded and gridless)&lt;br/&gt;Note: Whilst the download looks large, it consists of several separate files - just download the versions you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A note on VTT use - we have deliberately kept the quality of the file high, and you may need to resize the jpeg for use in your VTT software. Keeping the file size and resolution high gives you the flexibility to use the map how you want - crop out a particular section or use the entire map, the choice is yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
