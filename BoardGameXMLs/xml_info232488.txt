			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stacked is a trick taking dexterity game for 2-5 players that mixes the dexterity and simplicity of tower stacking (like a Jenga), with Tetris like shapes and a simple trick taking mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played to a number of points or rounds decided by the players (typically 2 rounds or 50 points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The oldest player calls a trick type (color or if playing with color blind, symbol) and then counts down, 3, 2, 1 FLIP! The player who reveals the highest card wins that trick, takes the lead (so they may start the next turn) AND gets to give their shape to another player who must stack it on the tower for them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two of every number in the deck, so watch out for ties! Both players play their own piece and nobody wins the trick. Fun for all ages with parental supervison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
