							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darkest December: Battle of the Bulge</name>
									
			<description>(NOTE: This is an ASL expansion.  A game of similar title is published for the ATS system by the same publisher).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Darkest December is a detailed ASL comp variant module that tells the story of the Battle of the Bulge from the perspective of the 3rd US armored division, facing down the vaunted 116 Panzer Division.  Hitler's Wacht Am Rhein offensive was under way, and the yanks of the 3rd Armored, along with engineers from the 23rd and 51st engineer battalions faced the 'Greyhound' Panzer Division and the 560th Volksgrenadier Division - and were soon cordoned off form friendly lines....&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The module includes three historical maps, two counter sheets and 20 scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
