Design generation ships intended to cross the galaxy to a new future, or vast cosmic fortresses equipped with the Worldbreaker &amp;ndash; a particle beam capable of vaporizing entire worlds! Prey on unlucky vessels while equipped with revolutionary Cloaking Devices or stun your enemies with mind-bending Matrix Weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, optional rules for fuel consumption, life support requirements, and FTL communications take the simplistic, space-opera rules that are the Starfinder Roleplaying Game default firmly into the realm of hard sci-fi.
