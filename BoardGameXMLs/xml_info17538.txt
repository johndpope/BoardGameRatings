							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jackson at the Crossroads: Cross Keys &amp; Port Republic, June 8-9, 1862</name>
									
			<description>Jackson at the Crossroads is a simulation of the two battles of Cross Keys and Port Republic, fought respectively on the 8th and 9th of June, 1862.  Pursued by two Union forces, Jackson decided to stand and fight before his opponents could effect a junction.  At Cross Keys, he easily repulsed General Fremont's half-hearted attack.  At Port Republic, after some of the bitterest fighting in Jackson's experience, he managed to rout General Shield's lead brigades.  These two battles sealed the fate of the Union campaign to subdue the Shenandoah Valley that year, and allowed Jackson to leave the Valley altogether and join Lee in the defense of Richmond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each hex on the mapboard represents 210 yards of real terrain from side to side.  Each Game-Turn represents 45 minutes during the day or 6 hours during the night.  The units are infantry and cavalry regiments, and sections of artillery.  Each Strength Point represents 100 men or one cannon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jackson at the Crossroads is Volume 5 from the Great Battles of the American Civil War series.  Each game in the series uses a set of standard rules, which cover melee attack, small-arms and artillery fire, cavalry charges, and the effects of leadership.  Each game has a 16-page booklet of exclusive rules to cover the unique features of each battle and an historical article about each event.  The game includes 400 counters and one 22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
