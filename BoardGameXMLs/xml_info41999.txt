							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Koning van Katoren Theaterspel</name>
									
			<description>Just like in the theater play the idea is for the players to fulfill assignments. Whoever first completes four assignments is the winner and becomes the new King of Katoren. The assignments may be fulfilled in any which order, except the jump off the tower, which must always be the final assignment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start an assignment the player must first go on a train trip. The journey consists of two tickets and each assignment consists of three tickets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win you must lay out 20 tickets. For the final assignment, the player may only play the second ticket when he/she has collected 5 pillow tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
