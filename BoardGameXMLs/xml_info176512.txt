							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bound Entity Archetype</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This release for Supernatural Supers &amp;amp; Metahuman Mystics provides you with a new archetype, the Bound Entity. A bound entity is a damned soul, spirit, or the like who has been set free from its eternal punishment and charged with a mission by a Higher Power. In order to carry out this mission, however, the entity is bound to a mortal host who must carry its essence until the entity is called upon to act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes the a base bound archetype template so you can more easily and quickly make bound entity characters of your own (including a mortal host and entity build), as well as guidelines on their origins, appearance and personality, powers and abilities (including example powers), how they may be improved, and a number of variations on the basic theme. Rounding out the product are two new advantages, a new flaw, and a sample bound entity character, The Hangman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
