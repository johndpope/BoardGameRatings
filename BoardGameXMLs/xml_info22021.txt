							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Celebrity Turds</name>
									
			<description>Big name stars earn more in a couple of hours than most of us do in a year. And the media never let&amp;rsquo;s us forget how luxurious their lives are. We offer you a different view... we've drawn them as poo! Are you ready to have a little giggle at the overblown world of celebrities?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the role of movie director. They must create poker style combinations of celebrity turds to star in movies with a fecal theme. The player who scores the most points by making the most valuable movies wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to learn and easy to play. Just deal the cards for guaranteed fun and laughter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
