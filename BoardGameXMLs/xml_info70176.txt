							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">There is something about Mari√©</name>
									
			<description>There&amp;rsquo;s Something About Mari&amp;eacute; is a scenario suitable for characters of any experience level that can be run independently or as an interlude in a longer campaign like The Thousand Thrones. For the purposes of the scenario it is assumed that the Player Characters are travelling in a river barge along one of the tributaries of the great River Reik, but could be placed along any river within Sigmar&amp;rsquo;s Empire and with a little work even the river can be replaced with a road if the PCs are more of the footslogging persuasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario consists of four chapters and its structure is directed by a few key events and the Player Characters&amp;rsquo; choices rather than any preset plot. First, some background and a brief synopsis are given, followed by the actual adventure. Finally, descriptions of all the key NPCs, guidelines for awarding experience, and handouts conclude the scenario. In addition to the core rulebook Tome of Corruption would be useful, but not mandatory since all the necessary information for running the scenario is provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
