							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Siege of Alesia</name>
									
			<description>The Battle of Alesia took place in September 52 BC around the Gallic oppidum of Alesia. Situated probably atop Mont Auxois, above modern Alise-Sainte-Reine in France, but this location does not fit Caesar's description of the battle. A number of alternatives have been proposed over time, among which Chaux-des-Crotenay (in Jura in modern France) only remains as challenger today. This battle was fought by the army of the Roman Republic commanded by Julius Caesar, aided by cavalry commanders Mark Antony, Titus Labienus and Gaius Trebonius, against a confederation of Gallic tribes united under the leadership of Vercingetorix of the Averni.&lt;br/&gt;Alesia was the last major engagement between Gauls and Romans, and marked the turning point of the Gallic Wars in favour of Rome. The siege of Alesia is considered one of Caesar's greatest military achievements, and is still one of the classic examples of siege warfare and circumvallation.&lt;br/&gt;Now, in this game free to download and play, as Caesar, You will defend a system of ramparts, forts and awesome fortifications with units representing legion cohorts, leaders, archers, Germanic cavalry and, as Vergingetorix, you will assault the Roman besiegers with infantry and cavalry units from 46 Gallic tribes. The game system comes from the Ancients freeware game with some modifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
