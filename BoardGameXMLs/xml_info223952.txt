			<description>Boast or Nothing is a trick-taking game (like Hearts or Pinochle or Spades) for 3 to 5 players. Each player is a contestant in the final round of the World Championship of Boasting. Everyone boasted and bragged their tails off to get here, but now it&amp;rsquo;s the big time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We're down to the last few contestants, and you're one of them!&lt;br/&gt;Win, and you'll enjoy free drinks in any bar for the rest of your life from the defeated. &lt;br/&gt;Lose, and it's back to the boasting minor league for you. Let's get to the contest!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to win this battle, you have to raise your popularity higher from audience. You can get a popularity with 7 cards of boasting on each rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the set up according to Reference Sheet for different number of players, they get their own marker and Player Sheet. Then arrange randomly the Color Rank Tokens into a stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle and deal 7 cards to each player, remaining cards are opened on the center of table. The player who most recently had an adult beverage starts to play a card, and round is begun. Other players have to play a card of first player&amp;rsquo;s color. Or they can play pass. &lt;br/&gt;If a player cannot play the appropriate color, they may play any card in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player plays one of their cards, it&amp;rsquo;s time to determine the highest value to get this &amp;lsquo;Trick&amp;rsquo;. The player who played best card  takes this Trick and becomes a new player to start next round. The Value of card is determined according to Color Rank Tokens, and they can be changed dramatically!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each round, players will be assigned Popularity points based on the tricks they&amp;rsquo;ve taken. But the judges of this Championship are drunk already! You get one point when you get a trick exactly matches with judge&amp;rsquo;s wonky criterion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BUT! If you take zero tricks, regardless of the number of players, you will move forward 2 spaces on the Scoreboard. Because you&amp;rsquo;re too cool for school; and you know it, the audience knows it, and the judges definitely know it. Take your two points, Fonz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player reaches the Championship space on the Scoreboard!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
