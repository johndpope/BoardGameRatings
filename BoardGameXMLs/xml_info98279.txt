			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Test your ability in searching and tracking enemy space ships with the use of an instrumentation readout as well as visually searching. This game will keep you out in space. You can play against the computer or a friend. If you've had enough of playing hide and seek, bring your lunar lander down into a soft landing without crashing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Game 1: Galactic Space War]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The screen will automatically show the Galactic Space War screen of stars moving out from the center. The screen is the front window of your space ship in which you visually search out the enemy. At the bottom of the screen are 4 sets of numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the far left are the range coordinates of the enemy space ship. It corresponds to an X and Y axis graph. In moving your screen left or right you are in the Y axis. You are trying to get the coordinates to register 00. In this way you will locate the enemy ship. The second set of numbers is the time limit. It is automatically programmed for 99 units of time, (not necessarily seconds but time units).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third set of numbers is the player's score against the enemy. Certain targets are worth more points than others. The small fighter is worth 1 point. The battle ship is worth 2. The freighter is 3 points and the star ship is worth 4 points. Every time a hit is scored it will register in red on that set of numbers. The last set of numbers on the right is the enemy's score. It scores 1 every time a hit is made. The enemy can score a hit from certain coordinates but mainly fires from the center of the screen at or close to the point where the player's lasers cross when fired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2 players:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the right hand controller guides the search ship and fires the lasers as if playing the one player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the left hand controller maneuvers the enemy ship and can either try to stay hidden or get into position for firing at the search ship. The enemy does not control the firing. The computer fires the laser while the player tries to keep his ship from being hit by the opponent. Both players know where the enemy ship is in distance by following the X&lt;br/&gt;and Y coordinates registered at bottom left hand side of the screen. The enemy may try to keep the farthest distance away by constantly increasing these numbers by moving the hand controller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chase your friends around in space as they try to avoid you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Game 2: Lunar Lander]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game automatically sets up the lunar surface, the green landing pad and the spaceship suspended on the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Below the lunar surface there appear two sets of numbers. Those at the lower left show the units of fuel remaining in the lunar lander, starting with 99 units. If the player runs fuel to zero, the lunar lander will free fall and crash. The set of numbers at the lower right shows the time elapsed from when the lunar lander appears and starts to land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the lunar lander passes too far to the left or right, so as to move outside of the screen, the lunar lander will appear on the other side of the screen, moving in the same direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, give it a try and get that lander down into a soft landing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
