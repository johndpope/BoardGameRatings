							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eidolon: The Electrodyne Opera</name>
									
			<description>Eidolon is a 366 full-colour book. It is entirely dedicated to bringing the campaign setting to life, and the rules are made available for free through a link you will receive upon purchase. The rules are meant to be a living document, meaning that there will be no more editions and erattas, but rules will be updated as players break and make the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no rules within this book, but a link to a live document is available through &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://bit.ly/Dramaturgy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://bit.ly/Dramaturgy&lt;/a&gt; - this division of rules and setting into a live document and a published book will help rules change and adapt as the games unfold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NB: Hardcover copies will be available to order December 2014.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eidolon is a gaslamp fantasy setting, set in the year 1900. It is a world where stories focus upon the nobility and the affairs of state. Herein, the eight great nation-states of the Realm and the alien powers of both the hinterlands and antipodes acknowledge the sovereignty of the imperial Coronal. A celestial family of puissant nobles leads the Imperium, each of whom has attained near-immortality and stand at the centre of the Realm&amp;rsquo;s web of intrigue. The emperor is none other than Friedreich M&amp;uuml;nchausen, known better by the title of the Invictus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Eidolon, the people enjoy a sophisticated technology buoyed by the uncanny advancements of alchemical forges and electrodyne engines; their artefaction precipitating an age of wonder. Newton&amp;rsquo;s fulmonry has opened the starry heavens, having launched the space race of the 17th Century, and the Imperium now enjoys colonies on the planetary gears of Barsoom and Amtor. Alchemical contraceptives ushered in the sexual revolutions of the 1860s, creating robust libertine affects throughout contemporary society. The burgeoning vogue of planetary and science heroes has divided the generations, with the aristocracy cleaving to baroque mores, even as the bourgeoisie embrace avant-garde vogues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus, the Electrodyne Opera is a drama of politics, a game of thrones, and a work of blood and thunder. It celebrates the lives of the nobility in romance and tragedy, exalting their best and revelling in their worst. For each noble contends with his or her own fate, bound as they are to the mythic force known as the skein, making their life a passion play striving for immortality and apotheosis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
