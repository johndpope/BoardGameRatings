							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Menio Keep</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Menio is the heart of a wealthy barony in northeastern Melderyn. The economy is driven by the pottery trade. The many kilns of the Potters' Guild are fed by barges of charcoal and the smell of smoke is everywhere. Poul Morezyn, the young baron, ignores his responsibility to govern his fief and is rapidly emptying the coffers it took his father years to fill. His mother and his liege hope that marriage might tame him; there are no lack of would-be brides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Menio Keep article describes the settlement's history, government, religion, and economics, with special attention to the important pottery trade. Descriptions of craftsmen and other locations in the settlement are included, as well as full-color GM and player maps and complete floor plans for the keep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
