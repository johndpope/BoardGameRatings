			<description>Spin Satan's Hypno-Spinner and move your Tormented Souls game piece around the board as you plod along to Death and have No More Taxes!!!  Climb the Ladders but watch out for the Chutes which will send you back to Satan's delight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember playing boardgames like Candyland? You were an innocent kid with a dumb hair cut wishing so &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; you were playing something else like &amp;quot;Super Colossal Master of All Elementary Schools or Ruler of All the Fudgesicles in the Freezer!&amp;quot; Your super strength allowing you to flick your opponent across the orange shag carpet? Well... Your wishes have come true. With The Wild Wigout Comix Gameboards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wild Wigout Comix Game Boards were created by some very talented and well known underground artists at the now defunct Scairy Hairy Toys in San Fransisco, Ca. in the early/mid 1990s. These very crazy game boards were hand silk-screened and were pretty limited (maybe a hundred of each). There were only seven different games created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
