			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a 13-year-old girl who is possessed by a ghost who strangely hopes to kill her.   Together you seek to uncover the mysteries of an island, where people have lately been murdered.   This game could be thought of as an expansion to The Moon Sliver, as it explains a lot from there, although it does stand alone.   The graphics are still monochromatic and the horror is more atmosphere than events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
