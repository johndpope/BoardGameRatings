							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bibi Blocksberg: Das verflixte Hexkraut Spiel</name>
									
			<description>A licensed game with the famous (comic) little witch Bibi Blocksberg. From the rulebook: The senior witch Mania has a terrible witches cold. The witches congregation decides to make a witches brew that will heal her. A senior witch that has a cold isnt useful to the witches. So we hurry up to the Blocksberg (a mountain in the german harz region where witches are said to be gathering), where the herbs grow. But beware: between healing herbs there is the devilsleaves. And that has a scent which makes witches unable to move...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players place plastic chips of their own colour on the gameboard. Then a black chip representing the devils leaves. By rolling a die they can move on the board, forwards and backwards. The goal of the game is to collect their two own colour chips and reach the top of the game board to place them into the witches cauldron while avoiding the black chip. When reaching other players chips they can play tricks on them...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
