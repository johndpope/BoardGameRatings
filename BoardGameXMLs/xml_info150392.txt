							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jovel Nial</name>
									
			<description>Free RPG Day 2013 Character for use with Shadows of a Black Sun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nial clan is a family of politicos, and they arranged for their eldest daughter to follow in their line of work as a Senate aide. For the young Bothan, the intrigue of slicing into government databases far surpassed the constant bickering and posturing on the Senate floor. Consequently, she used much of her time as an aide honing her skills as a technician. Senator Trellev Aquem discovered her talents by accident and kept them a secret. Now she works for him, and by extension, the Pyke crime syndicate, which has Aquem in its pocket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
