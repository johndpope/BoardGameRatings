			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After Luzbell's magical abilities manifested at an early age she was sent to the church to train and focus her abilities in the proper way. She has progressed rapidly not only showing an aptitude for innovative applications of light magic but also devouring alchemical teachings at a pace her instructors find somewhat intimidating. Luzbell may be young, but she is a rising star in the Church's firmament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mystic - Light Church - Level 40&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Holy Reflection (Magic, Dodge) - It can only be used against Ranged Attacks. If Luzbell dodges successfully, the attack is redirected to any enemy unit that would be within the distance of the attack if it where performed by Luzbell. This attack keeps all of the attributes of the original attacker, but Luzbell must make a new attack roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Holy Cut (Magic, Ranged Attack) - Distance 16 inches. Damage +2.&lt;br/&gt;Limit: Once per Turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Divine Shield (Magic, Dodge) - May be used after the roll for the attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mirror Jump (Magic, Effect) - Relocate a friendly unit within Luzbell&amp;rsquo;s control zone to any other position within her control zone even if the unit is engaged in combat, or into base-to-base contact.&lt;br/&gt;Limit: Once per Turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pewter figure is unpainted and unassembled. Requires additional Anima Tactics figures to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
