			<description>Subtitle: Fantasy Role Playing for Children&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Dad! Mom! Play that dragon game with ME!&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How many gamers have heard this from their children? Your kids see all your gaming material and are fascinated. They want to play too! But what if they aren't old enough to read?  What if they can only count to 10 or 20?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kids,Castles &amp;amp; Caves is a very simple rpg that allows children to take the role of a Hero - a Knight, Wizard, Cleric, Elf, Dwarf, Fairy or Halfling. The entire game is based on a d6 and includes a good selection of traditional monsters as well as descriptions of magic items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With only a few minutes of preparation - or even on the fly - you and the kids are having fun! Sections include the rules for playing, the Heroes you can play, the Monsters you can fight and the Magical Treasure you can find! Also included are three sample adventuring maps which you can fill with monsters and treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
