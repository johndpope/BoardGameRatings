			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not easy being a thug for hire. You need a solid rep and you need to prove yourself time and again if you want to get the big jobs. Pete Kowalczyk was never given the chance he felt he deserved. Desperate for recognition and a shot at the big time, he gathered his illicit funds and actually paid a mad scientist to experiment on him and give him powers... and it worked! As AUROCH, Pete is muscle for hire that packs a superhuman punch! His greed and his drive to maintain a reputation is more dangerous than ever before. Luckily, there's always someone out there looking to hire his kind of &amp;quot;talent.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
