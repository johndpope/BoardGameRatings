			<description>Survival: Frogs of South Eastern Australia tells the struggle of five endangered Australian frog species: The Southern Corroboree Frog, Spotted Tree Frog, Baw Baw Frog, Stuttering Frog, and the Growling Grass Frog. In this cooperative game, the players try to return and establish stable populations of each species to the wild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All player's hands are seen only by them, but they cannot play cards from their own hand. Instead they must use the action cards to find out information about the cards held by other players, all while trying to avoid threats to the frogs and their habitats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was developed and designed by 5D (in 2014), 6A (in 2015) and their teacher at Berwick Fields Primary School. Wanting to do something to help endangered frog species, the class launched a two-year learning journey and this game is the product of that. Along the way, the class was awarded the Zoos Victoria Love Your Locals 2014 winner for its work on the game and was inducted into the Zoos Victoria Hall of Fame for Young Wildlife Advocates of the year in 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
