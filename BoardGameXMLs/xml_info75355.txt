			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vigilante 8 is a vehicular combat video game released on June 4, 1998 for the PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and Game Boy Color. It is a spinoff of the PC game Interstate '76, and features several concepts (auto-vigilantes, the 1970s time frame, and specific fictional vehicle companies) carried over from that title. Vigilante 8 was developed with a team of only five people (Peter Morawiec, Adrian Stephens, David Goodrich, Jeremy Engleman, and Edward Toth), a seemingly impossibly small team size for developing a PlayStation game, when most development teams for such a console ranged around 20-30 people in the 1990s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developer of the two Vigilante 8 games, Luxoflux, produced a game very similar to Vigilante 8 using the Star Wars licence (and the Vigilante 8 game engine), titled Star Wars: Demolition, and has since produced the Grand Theft Auto-inspired True Crime: Streets of LA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vigilante 8 is also very similar to the Twisted Metal series, but with improved graphics and more realistic physics. Vigilante 8 and Vigilante 8: Second Offense were innovative in the degree of level interaction, weapon design and combo systems.[citation needed] It should also be noted that, in the PlayStation version of the game, you may switch the Vigilante 8 disc with any audio CD to replace the game's soundtrack; the game will continue to play without the game disc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other game titles where numbers denote sequels, Vigilante 8 was rather a pun on V8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Synopsis&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt; This video game-related article describes an aspect of the game in a primarily in-universe style. Please help rewrite it to explain the fiction more clearly and provide non-fictional perspective. (May 2007)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's storyline is built around an alternate history, in which there was a worldwide oil crisis in the 1970s and the U.S. was on the verge of an economic breakdown. Strikes, riots and crime were rampant, and all available law enforcement were brought to the cities leaving the outlands vulnerable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A foreign multinational oil consortium, Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime (OMAR), was determined to monopolize the world oil trade. The U.S. was the last country that stood in their way and they were prepared to go to any length to bring the U.S. to its knees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OMAR hired Sid Burn, a professional terrorist, to push the U.S. economy over the edge. Sid began to organize his troops in the remote areas of the southwest. Calling themselves the &amp;quot;Coyotes,&amp;quot; they began to target oil refineries, commercial installations and other vital industry throughout the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the law enforcement in the cities, some desperate civilians began to take the law into their own hands. Led by a trucker named Convoy and referred to simply as the &amp;quot;Vigilantes,&amp;quot; this oddball group soon became a major hindrance to Sid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, the U.S. government, feeling more vulnerable than ever, was intensifying its research and development of a new military arsenal. The most advanced weaponry, rumored to be based on UFO technology, was located at Site-4, a secret facility at Papoose Lake. This information was not lost on Sid, and the Coyotes ambushed the facility. However the Vigilantes unexpectedly appeared to stop them and as a result, both parties found themselves in possession of the world's most advanced weaponry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What followed were no ordinary skirmishes. Auto clashes ensued all over the land, from Colorado's Rockies to California's farmlands, only to culminate in a battle like no other. To this day the events which took place are only a matter of speculation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Weapons&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a variety of weapons, most of which are picked up during gameplay. Every vehicle is equipped with the Mosquito Machine Gun by default (which is relatively weak on its own, but has infinite ammunition).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Xbox Live Arcade&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Main article: Vigilante 8 Arcade&lt;br/&gt;A remake for the Xbox 360, titled Vigilante 8 Arcade, was created by Isopod Labs, an independent company formed by the founders of Luxoflux. The game features a high-definition rendition of the past games plus some added multiplayer levels complete with an online mode. It was released onto Xbox Live Arcade on November 5, 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Sequels&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;A sequel was produced, titled Vigilante 8: Second Offense, released for the PlayStation, Dreamcast, and Nintendo 64 December 1, 1999.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A third game in the Vigilante 8 series was announced for PlayStation 2 early in the system's life cycle, but no further information or game was ever released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
