			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 32 x 30 inch, full color battlemap of a Medieval Lumber Mill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everyone is always asking for their cut. Be careful what you wish for&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;&amp;mdash;Sawyer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medieval Lumber Mill has two interior maps of a lumber mill and sawyer&amp;rsquo;s house on opposite sides of a center creek connected via a bridge and the exterior surroundings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medieval Lumber Mill is intended for use in fantasy or medieval era games. Its isolation also makes it an interesting location for a horror game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sawy-rial Killer: The group has been hired as log drivers. Their job is to get logs from the logging camp to a medieval lumber mill down river. The group can fasten the logs together to make a raft or bid only a few logs together and ride individual logs downstream. The lumberjacks give them clubs with specialized hooks. The hooks are to guide the logs and prevent them from jamming on the way down the river on tree roots or rocks. A jam of logs will become a dam and block the transport of logs down the river for weeks. If the group can successfully stay on the logs or rafts and guide the logs downstream, they get to the medieval lumber mill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the mill, they are supposed to get their pay from the sawyer. But he is nowhere to be found. Instead the group walks around the mill and sees blood on axes buried in stumps, and even worse in the lumber mill. A lumberjack has been brutally murdered, his body spliced in half by the saw. It&amp;rsquo;s clear that someone is killing the lumberjacks and log drivers. But why?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sawyer eventually enters the scene with a load of logs coming in via carriage from the southwest and asks what happened to his hired help. The group can help investigate the murder. If the group asks for their pay for the delivered logs, the sawyer&amp;rsquo;s face darkens, and he says they will get their cut once the murder is solved&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
