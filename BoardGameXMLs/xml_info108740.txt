			<description>Around 1300 A.D., Scotland and England are at war. The Scottish clans no longer tolerate the oppression by the English kings and ally themselves with each other in order to gain their freedom. Only by working together can they overcome the powerful English army in the battles of Stirling, Falkirk and Bannockburn. But there is a heavy rivalry between the clans; each of the clan leaders wants to contribute as much as possible in order to be crowned as king of Scotland in the end, and they are not afraid to resort to treachery if needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to have the most points at the end of 1314 A.D. and rule over Scotland, you will need to increase your clan's prosperity without neglecting warfare and heroism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
