			<description>A game designed to help children learn their numbers in a pair of games. The games are educational and aimed at the 3 - 8 age group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In brief, it is a game to help small children read and count, usually solo but can be played with 2 or 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a card and tries to read the letters on it (ABC) part, these start with three letters and are common objects such as B-E-E or C-A-T and go up from there depending on the age of the child.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to get to a set number of correct answers, dependent on the age of the children. The track is a straight box divided into 12 squares for each color / team / player. Can be dependent on age so that younger children don't need to get as far as older ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the 123 side each card has a number on it and picture of say 2 Dogs or 4 mice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
