			<description>&amp;quot;Liberation: Captive 2 is an Amiga game that was written by Byte Engineers and published by Mindscape in 1994. It is the sequel to Captive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although Liberation was released for the Amiga 1200 computer, it was notable for being one of the few titles developed primarily with the Amiga CD32 in mind. Specifically, it features long cut-scenes, voice acting, and an atmospheric CD-quality soundtrack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has some similarities with Hired Guns; both games have a dark cyberpunk setting. However, the object of Liberation is to find and free a prisoner by gathering clues and following leads. The game world is a very large city containing hundreds of fully explorable households, offices and public buildings. It is this vast setting which precludes a brute-force approach to finding the captive and gives rise to the unusual core gameplay element of detective work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In line with its nominal classification as an RPG game, Liberation features typical RPG tropes such as inventories, character upgrades, shops, money, and banks. Unlike many games, almost all world features are interactive and well integrated - the libraries contain large volumes of real information you have to use, the police actually enforce the law and have working police stations and cells, the taxis are functional, and you can indeed deal drugs with the drug dealers.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Liberation:_Captive_2,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
