			<description>Magnetic ice hockey game, very similar to the Balyna Super Soccer game produced by Balyna (Toogood and Jones of Whitstable in Kent) in the United Kingdom during the 1950s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game consists of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- playing board&lt;br/&gt;- four adjustable plastic legs to be inserted at each corner of the board&lt;br/&gt;- two plastic goals&lt;br/&gt;- four wooden playing rods with a magnet at the end, two each of red and blue&lt;br/&gt;- ten plastic players with magnets on their bases, usually 5 red and 5 blue players&lt;br/&gt;- a small wooden puck&lt;br/&gt;- rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a magnet on the bottom of its base, which was manipulated by a rod (with a magnet on the end of it) which went under the table. The magnets of each team are polarised in reverse, so you cannot affect your opponents players with your rod. The rod is used to drag your players across the board, thus allowing you to push the puck around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is a smooth hardboard surface, marked out with an ice hockey pitch, and a basic raised surround to stop the puck going out of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good fun - lots frantic action!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
