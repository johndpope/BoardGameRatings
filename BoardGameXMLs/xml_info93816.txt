			<description>From the Publisher / Developer Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Natuk is a game of orcish revenge. You control a party of eight orcs, ogres, and half-trolls who plot to assassinate their Emperor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Natuk is the name of your country. A nation of violence, where the strong rule and the weak serve... or die. Natuk is ruled by Emperor Molvosh, the most cunning and ruthless emperor the nation has ever known. Unfortunately for you, you tried to kill him. Even more unfortunately, you didn't succeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emperor Molvosh meted out his usual justice. Your mates and whelps were slain, the leader of the plot was flayed alive, and the eight accomplices of this pitiful assassination attempt (you) were thrown into the prisons of Jagg, never to be seen again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But somewhere, somehow, papers were misplaced or orders misread, and you now find yourselves out on the frontier of Natuk, assigned as warriors to the most loathsome, moronic outpost chief imaginable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But he is strong, and you are weak, and you have learned your lesson. Or have you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
