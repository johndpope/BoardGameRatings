			<description>Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stronghold Crusader 2 is the long awaited sequel to Stronghold: Crusader, the original 'castle sim'. After 12 years Stronghold returns to the deserts of the Middle East circa 1189, with a new 3D engine and realistic castle destruction powered by Havok Physics. Crusader 2 will recapture the original game&amp;rsquo;s addictive, fast-paced gameplay and authentic castle simulation. True to its roots this new Stronghold will define old school real time strategy, combining RTS and city builder gameplay. Playing as a brutal Crusader Knight or Arabic freedom fighter, you must use a deadly array of troops and destructive siege equipment to decide the fate of the holy lands. Lead your forces into battle as either Richard the Lionheart or the Sultan of Syria in two historic single-player campaigns, with dynamic events such as tornados and locust swarms. Become the greatest Lord by managing your desert economy and seizing control of vital oases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When it was first released in 2002 Stronghold Crusader put a unique twist on the gameplay of the original Stronghold by focussing on skirmish gameplay and replayability above all else. With a new setting, additional content and a greater focus on real-time strategy over the sim gameplay elements of the original Stronghold, Crusader quickly became the fan-favourite. Since launch Crusader has sold over two million copies, with over 3000 user-made maps still in circulation on one Stronghold fansite and fans still playing the game today. Recently Stronghold Crusader HD gave the game a new lease of life, offered as a free update for existing owners of the game and made available for purchase on GOG and Steam. Crusader 2 has been on the mind of Lead Designer Simon Bradbury since the release of Stronghold Crusader in 2002. It is only now, having become a fully independent studio, that Firefly feel comfortable delivering a worthy sequel to their fans&amp;rsquo; favourite game. As a developer their mission is to recapture the addictive, intense gameplay that made the original Crusader a classic. Players can also expect new visuals, a reworked battle interface, new AI characters, environmental threats, new units and real-time physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build the Ultimate Castle - Design mighty strongholds and fill them with fiendish traps to crush your enemies!&lt;br/&gt;Skirmish Mode - Lay siege to your enemies in fast-paced custom skirmish matches against the AI.&lt;br/&gt;8 Player Multiplayer - Mix and match human and AI players, maps and game modes to set up your ideal multiplayer game.&lt;br/&gt;Battle a Wide Range of AI Lords - Classic AI characters return alongside new blood, each with distinct personalities, castles and play styles.&lt;br/&gt;Challenge the Crusader Trail - Test your mettle across a range of increasingly tough skirmish campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;Co-op Play - Share control over castle building, troop control and resource management in Co-op Mode.&lt;br/&gt;Castle Sandbox - Dive into the Map Editor or Free Build mode and construct the ultimate castle without fear of attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stronghold Crusader II is the latest title in Firefly Studios Stronghold franchise of &amp;quot;Castle Sim&amp;quot; RTS games, and was released on September 23, 2014.
