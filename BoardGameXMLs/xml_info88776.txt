			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COWntless hours of entertainment with family and friends. Forget cows or balancing the books, this fast-paced card game has everything to do with rolling the dice to be the first to get rid of all your cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Roll the dice!&lt;br/&gt;     Do the math!&lt;br/&gt;     Lay down the cards that qualify!&lt;br/&gt;     First players to lay down all the cards in their hand, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;     Watch out for the Cow eyes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes: Two decks of 48 cow cards - numbered 1-12 in four colours, dice and instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     * *&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this light children's card game, players begin with a hand of cards, each of which is numbered (1-10). On their respective turns, each player rolls a pair of six-sided dice and tries to discard a card from his/her hand based on the result rolled. The numbers on the dice are combined using simple mathematical operations to determine whether a card can be discarded. For example, if a player rolls a 3 and a 2, they could discard a 1 (3-2), a 5 (3+2), or a 6 (3x2). A player who cannot discard must draw an additional card. The first player to empty their hand wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
