			<description>Dan Qi is an ancient Chinese game dating back to at least the Han dynasty.  The exact rules and design of the pieces/board have only been recovered in fragments, but many scholars speculate on what the game actually looked and how it was actually played.  Some scholars believe that the game is dexterity-focused, where players take turn flicking pieces at each other.  Others believe the game may involve playing with pieces hidden in a manner similar to Lu Zhan Jun Qi.  Still others think that the game had some sort of religious application and involved dropping the pieces randomly onto a special diviniatory board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
