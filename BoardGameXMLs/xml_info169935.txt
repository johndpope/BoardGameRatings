			<description>Pittle is a card drafting and tile placement game where each player tries to complete color patterns on their secret cards for points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives an equal number of color tiles. They are then dealt 4 cards from the secret card deck. Each player selects one card and passes the others, continuing like this until everyone has a hand of 4 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player then plays a colored tile in the center of the board. Going clockwise, each player plays one colored tile anywhere on the board until all tiles have been played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the final tile has been played, players reveal their secret cards which depict color patterns which have been completed on the board. Points for completed cards are totaled for each player and the player with the highest point total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
