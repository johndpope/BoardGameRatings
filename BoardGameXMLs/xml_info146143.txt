							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bulwark: Magister Kelemen</name>
									
			<description>From publisher description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroic Co-operative Deck-Building!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magister Kelemen is a peaceful water mage, consumed with furthering his knowledge of magic. Unfortunately, his attempts to conduct research always seem to be interrupted by monsters, bandits and invading armies. Consequently, he is one of the most powerful battle mages in the world. One day he hopes to set up a laboratory that isn't swarming with demons, on fire or both by the end of the first week.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Hard Mode&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magister Kelemen is a new Hero deck, fully compatible with the base game. It introduces a new mechanic, mana, that makes forcing combinations of cards more critical than ever. He also takes time to develop his deck, making him hard to manage for short Start Phases. He is recommended for experienced Bulwark players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
