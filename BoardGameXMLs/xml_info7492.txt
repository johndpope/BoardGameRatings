			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players help each other plant as big a Flower Garden as they can and also help the Growlies find what they need most, so they don't pick and trash the Flowers instead. With some sharing of ideas and talking over of strategies, we will help change Crabby, Messy, Greedy, Stinky &amp;amp; Snobby into happier creatures. Sometimes we will need Scarecrows as well as Special Items such as Fruit Soap, Cornstalk Brooms, Gold Coins, Smiley Buttons and, best of all, some delicious Humble Pie. Guess which Growly needs what item! On each turn, a player gets two cards to play somewhere in the Garden. When and where to plant a Flower? Or put a Scarecrow? Or leave a Pie? Decisions, decisions. Each game unfolds differently, so keep on your mental tiptoes. Lots of play value for as many as 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
