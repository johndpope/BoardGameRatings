			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you need spaceships, or anything spaceship related in your Pathfinder game? Then this supplement, and the main book - Between Chains and Starlight version 2.0, are for you - pay what you want!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains four starships, each with its own history, description, illustrations, and floorplan: The Anvil class attack craft, a small armored ship designed for ground attack missions The Ashenborn class, massive undead dragon skeletons converted into starships The Liopleurodon class destroyer, a warship designed for atmospheric combat and the Manta class transport, one version being a small civilian ship that can perform a range of logistical functions on frontier worlds, the other being a Kurion military ship. Ship floorplans are also included as clean seperate files without text, at the scale of 50 pixels per square (5ft.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three new 'weapons' (civilian mining equipment modified to be used offensively) and two new systems are included for use with the existing starship customization rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, rules are included for damaging and overriding ship systems, doors, and walls, and the effects thereof on the ship and those on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules and stat blocks regarding ship combat are created to be compatible with the ruleset presented in Between Chains and Starlight version 2.0, but can also be used in games using existing Open Game Content rules with relatively little modification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
