All of them however, pale at the size, speed, and utter brutality in which the Mongol Empire came to fame. From a weak group of warring clans in the Mongolian steppe, Genghis Khan forged the largest land empire the world had ever seen. Reaching from the shores of the Pacific Ocean to the Baltic Sea, encompassing nearly all of Eurasia, the Mongols burnt, massacred, and conquered their way into history.

Throughout the Asian steppes and to areas well beyond their borders, the Mongols' effecient and effective war tactics allowed the Empire to grow rapidly, consuming everyone around. However, those who submitted to the Empire found a vast merchant network connecting Eurasia, religious freedom, and laws the reflect those still in use today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Mongol Empire Guide includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Historical equipment utilized by the Mongol Empire&lt;br/&gt;    A look at Mongol military tactics and formations&lt;br/&gt;    A listing of the Mongol Khans&lt;br/&gt;    A timeline of major battles and events&lt;br/&gt;    New Character Options for making Mongol warriors&lt;br/&gt;    Two Legendary Tales&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;hellip; and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Mongol Empire Guide is your source for building warriors like those of history, or building the foundations of a historical or alternate history game set in the Mongol Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
