							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lincoln Highway Road Game</name>
									
			<description>The historic Lincoln Highway, the first coast-to-coast highway in 1913, stretched from New York City to San Francisco. So children can learn more about the highway in a fun way, the nonprofit organization Lincoln Highway Heritage Corridor created a board game. The Lincoln Highway Road Trip comes with game pieces of a vintage gas pump, antique autos, compass, tourist cabin, postcard and suitcase as well as 200 trivia cards and fortune cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board reflects the regional part of the highway -- known as Route 30 -- in the six-county area from North Huntingdon at the Allegheny and Westmoreland County border to beyond Gettysburg. A grant from the Sprout Fund in Pittsburgh enabled the organization to develop the game and distribute it to upper elementary and middle schools along the region's 200-mile corridor. It was created by Alex Grab of Ligoni&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using pewter-like game pieces (vintage gas tank, suitcase, compass, tourist cabin, postcard and antique auto), players move along the highway beginning in Irwin. The goal is to be the first to travel the historic route through Westmoreland, Somerset, Bedford, Fulton, Franklin and Adams counties to Abbottstown in eastern Pa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the 200 question cards reads: &amp;ldquo;A volunteer highway crew is picking up debris along the side of the road near Buckstown. How long does it take for a Styrofoam cup to decompose?&amp;rdquo; A. 20 years; B. 90 years; C. 150 years; or D. 400 years?&amp;rdquo; The correct answer is 400 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another is: &amp;ldquo;The Mountain Playhouse and Green Gables Restaurant originally started as a sandwich stand. What was the dessert that became such a hit with Lincoln Highway travelers?&amp;rdquo; A. Ice Cream Sandwich; B. Custard; C. Angel Food Cake; or D. Torte? C is the correct answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
