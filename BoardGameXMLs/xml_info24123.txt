			<description>This wargame by  Richard Berg  simulates the interesting Battle of Cunaxa in 401 BC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This battle took place after both the Greek vs Persian Wars of 500-479 BC, and immediately after the Peloponnesian War of 431-404 BC. During the course of the battle the Persian Prince Cyrus died which ended his revolt against his brother King Artaxerxes.  The famous retreat of the ten thousand Greek auxiliaries (which fought for Cyrus) was the result. The Greeks were led by the Athenian General Xenophon. This Greek army had to fight its way back to Greece through the hostile Persian Empire (from Mesopotamia and across Asia Minor). The Greek city of Sparta renewed the war against Persia in 399-394 BC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
