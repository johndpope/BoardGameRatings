							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">O Guia dos Curiosos</name>
									
			<description>O Guia dos Curiosos (Guide for the curious) is based on a best seller with the same name from Marcelo Duarte. Although it seems to be similar to Ler&amp;eacute;ia, Guia dos Curiosos presents three types of cards: one type asks for the meaning of an unusual word, the other shows a sentence that should be completed or answered and on the third type is a sentence the players should simply respond true or false. The type of card is chosen based on the movements of the pawns after the counting of points at the end of each round. Except for the third type of card, for which all players answer independently, the other two types allow the players to write false but convincing answers or definitions. Players score points by both hitting the real answer and convincing other players that your definition is the correct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
