							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Universal Adventures Adventure Module BH1: The Blood Howlers of Black Willow Gorge</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trail was not hard to follow, even in the dark. The creatures moved quickly and with no fear of being followed. And when there was doubt, there was always the river that flowed from the west, from the depths of Black Willow Gorge. Somewhere in the dark depths of that gorge is the horn that sounded in the night, the young girl from the settler&amp;rsquo;s wagon and the creatures that carried her there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Face the horrors of Black Willow Gorge!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Universal Adventures The Blood Howlers of Black Willow Gorge is the first part in a new two-part Adventure Module set north of the town of Ravenor along the eastern edge of Greyshroud Ridge. You can combine the adventure with Expedition to Erathor and the expansion pack, Greyshroud Ridge, or play the adventure independently. The Adventure Module includes a new Adventure Record, 9 Adventure cards, 9 Encounter cards, 9 Event cards, 9 Search cards and 18 Treasure cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blood Howlers of Black Willow Gorge takes the characters into a deadly new environment, full of dangerous new foes, fabulous treasure and wonders to behold. Suitable for use with any fantasy role playing game, The Blood Howlers of Black Willow Gorge can be played solo or with a group, with or without a GM. The adventure is highly re-playable and compatible with other Universal Adventures cards. In addition, you can combine the cards with other cards from the series, or cards from other Universal Adventures products, to create your own adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
