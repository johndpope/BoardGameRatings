							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Universal: The Deck of the Future</name>
									
			<description>A trick taking game using a custom 54-card deck with a &amp;quot;revolutionary&amp;quot; alphabetic design. Similar to &amp;quot;Wizard&amp;quot; and other trick-taking games you must guess the number of tricks you will take each round, but the total number guessed cannot equal the hand-size for the round (forcing at least one player to lose each round).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hand size starts at 8 then decreases by 1 each round until it is only 1 card, then it increases (1 card each round) back to 8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck includes rules for three games:&lt;br/&gt;UG I-is the standard 2&amp;ndash;6 player trick-taking game&lt;br/&gt;UG II&amp;mdash;is played in partnerships&lt;br/&gt;UG III&amp;mdash;is a solitaire variant of the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rule book:&lt;br/&gt;In the future, the metric system will be adopted worldwide. The Universal Deck is the first to adopt a truly metric size, 6 x 9 cm. This makes the cards 1/8&amp;quot; narrower than a poker deck, 1/8&amp;quot; wider than a bridge deck, and 1/16&amp;quot; longer than both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
