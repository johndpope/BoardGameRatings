			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wiatyk is a free role-playing game based on the first RPGs of the seventies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players run a team of adventurers. They travel through a sinister land: beasts and undead are lurking in the woods, heretics and sorcerers are hiding in the settlements, and robbers and barbarians wander the trails. In spite of their fear, the player characters set out to escape mediocrity. They have to be ready for the expedition to take everything from them, but it's the only thing that gives them the chance to fulfill their dreams: whether it be power, wealth, knowledge or moral mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wiatyk is an old-school game, supporting sandboxing and role-playing instead of playing scenarios and solving problems with dice. It draws on some of the valuable solutions that have been introduced in newer mainstream and independent gaming systems: skill mechanics rather than features; more flexible and fluid development of characters instead of division into levels and classes; it contains sample event generators and other aids for the GM; not getting experience points for treasure and defeating opponents; more emphasis is also placed on the dynamics of combat, rather than the detail; instead of statistics of magical items, monsters and spells, it makes it easier to create them as needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
