							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Adventures of Blake Borrow, World-Class Archaeologist</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All characters in this amusing game are frauds.  They take turns being the narrative focus while the other players act as &amp;quot;board members&amp;quot; at a common archaeology society.  On each turn, a character draws (yes, literally draws) some cave drawings and then claims to have discovered them and claims they are true antiquities.  Throughout the game characters attempt to win &amp;quot;Back Pats&amp;quot; (e.g., pats on the back) which count as points toward winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[T]he game is all about forcing the other players to pat you on the back, until you&amp;rsquo;ve scored more points than the rest of the players and can claim the title of World Class Archaeologist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
