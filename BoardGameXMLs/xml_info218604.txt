			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the world, upended by the desire to do right above all else. When desiring to purge evil led to the world in conflict; and a new version of our history was born. Gone were the speeches that brought about a new country in a new world; they have fallen to a war that was never meant to happen, and broken the country into strict Loyalties. Choose this day whom you will serve...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is North America, Salem World! Time to party like its 1699!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salem World takes us to Colonial America a few years after the witch trials, and sees the Puritans living independent of England; even dominating in the New World. What was once the 13 colonies has been divided by war and, even in peace time, continues in hatred. The territory has been torn in pieces:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Puritan &amp;ndash; After being emboldened by their victory over the dark arts, the Puritans won independence from England. They continue to seek and destroy all that do not agree with what they see as &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Territory: Pennsylvania, New York, East and West Jersey, Long Island (Embattled with England), Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Maine. Capitol City &amp;ndash; Boston.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crown &amp;ndash; Finding themselves on the losing end of the war, their embattled territory is always one conflict away from falling. England can only help so much, leaving a disjointed feeling of separation; and a little spirit of rebellion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Territory: Maryland, Delaware, and Ohio (Embattled with France). Capitol City &amp;ndash; Hagerstown&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Holy Roman Empire &amp;ndash; The Church state has a foothold, and they don't want to let go. The work of the government of Rome and the Holy See are often inseparable. In this land the people of their territories do the bidding of the homeland to a fault. Most, if not all, believe that going against the will of the state is a Mortal Sin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Territory: Virginia, Carolina, Georgia, and Florida (Embattled with Spain). Capitol City &amp;ndash; Jamestown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witch &amp;ndash; They have no true territory, and are everywhere! Not all are evil, not many are considered good, all are hunted by various groups in the New World. Witches live normal lives, mostly outsiders and peasants, so they don't gain attention. They are waiting for a day they can rise up, and get themselves a land of their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Native &amp;ndash; All the land outside the colonies still belongs to the Native population of the New World. They hold it securely through treaty and war, and take infractions seriously. No matter the tribe they come from, they have one thing in common... keep the new comers from spreading west!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salem Wold includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Period Artwork &amp;ndash; Historical and Public Domain art to give a proper &amp;ldquo;feel&amp;rdquo; to the setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fully Playable System &amp;ndash; Both a player's and Regent (GM) section so there is no need to buy anything else to get started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monstrous Enemies &amp;ndash; Fully realized Monster section, with unique and mythic monsters for various encounters. Choose from our newest creations (such as Shapes, Sinners, and Lost), or some more familiar ones with a twist (Demons, Werewolves, or Trolls).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intrigue and Mystery &amp;ndash; Fight for the state, a cause, or against something you feel is needing to be destroyed. Be a spy for the Holy Roman Empire trying to destroy the Crown, a Puritan Judge fighting against the evils of the Church, or take up cases as adventurers to solve the New world's greatest mysteries!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Point Purchase Character Creation &amp;ndash; Use a pool of points to make the Character you want, with the skills and powers you want. Without random rolls, you are in control of how your character forms; and with Experience Point Spending Growth you decide how the character will grow in knowledge and power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat System &amp;ndash; Fight with our 1d8 system. This makes for quick checks, faster combat (with little or no modifiers), and a faster return to each starting turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...and much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
