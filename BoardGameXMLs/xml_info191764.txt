			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This is a game poem for at least three players &amp;ndash; it should work well with up to six or seven. As a group, choose some kind of fictional large-scale issue that you&amp;rsquo;d like to resolve together. Something like rebuilding a village after a natural disaster, funding and building a museum, getting a group of fourth-graders ready for a big concert, or overthrowing an oppressive totalitarian regime. Something that would make a great feel-good summer movie. You&amp;rsquo;re going to be trying to accomplish that thing, helping each other out along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
