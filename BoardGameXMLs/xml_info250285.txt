							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">CATastrophe: A Game of 9 Lives</name>
									
			<description>A fast-paced player elimination game for 2-6 players, ages 13+ with scalable game length anywhere from 10 minutes to 2.5 hours. Can be played in teams or as individual players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, players choose a cat (or dog) character and attack other players with things like curiosity, cucumbers, flea storms, and dognadoes. If they are not strong enough to withstand the attack (often determined by a dice roll), they lose a life. The last cat (or dog) standing is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple enough. But, be careful. It's no catwalk! Some furry felines have been known to come back from the dead to wage war on the living, and there is always that pesky CATastrophic event waiting around the corner. CATastrophic events change the dynamics of play allowing every game to be unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
