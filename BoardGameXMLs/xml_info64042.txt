							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Ultra-Lite</name>
									
			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It's the power of GURPS in a tiny package! We took the essence of the core GURPS rules and distilled it down to one page! Just print GURPS Ultra-Lite and fold it into a booklet (instructions included). With these rules and three dice, you have a small package for big RPG fun. Play GURPS on road trips. Use one as a bookmark. Print bunches and give them out as Halloween goodies. The possibilities are endless!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Now, this cute idea is a work in progress. The eagle-eyed among you might notice that we've marked it as 'Version 0.8.' That's because it hasn't been fully playtested. So if you have a comment to offer, we'd love to hear it; just head over to the Steve Jackson Games Forums and share your thoughts.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The page count and dimensions is for the PDF:  one page folding instructions, one page for the actual game.  When printed, the booklet prints to a eight-page pamphlet about 2.875&amp;quot; wide by 4.25&amp;quot; tall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
