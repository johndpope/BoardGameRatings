							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Keranak Kingdoms Fantasy Setting</name>
									
			<description>From the front cover of the setting book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kernak Kingdoms is a fantasy game setting. Although designed for the BareBones Fantasy RPG, this setting book contains no game mechanics and can therefore be used with any system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover of the setting book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This setting book details the Keranak Kingdoms, a collection of provinces called home by many races and cultures. Beset by political turmoil and moral instability, it is a realm where a sharp sword or a well-timed spell can make a commoner a legend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Destiny has betrayed the kingdoms. Gods who once walked shoulder-to-shoulder with mortal races are now banished, their power waning. The divinely-chosen royal bloodline has passed to oblivion, and the lords of the kingdoms vie for the right of ascension. The giants have broken free from the shackles of their frozen exile. It is a time of danger, mystery, and intrigue... a time for new legends and epic adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a different kind of setting book. It paints a setting in broad brush-strokes, giving enough of the details to build a framework and to lay the foundation of an epic saga but leaves many details vague. Individual game masters will fill in the details with their own brand of fantasy. In addition to a game world is a pantheon of deities - whose role in your campaigns can be as small or grand as you wish. Riddled throughout the book are plot seeds, adventure hooks, and various storylines to help you along. There are also four adventure plots given to you to serve as maiden voyages to your imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the kingdoms!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
