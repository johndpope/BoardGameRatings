			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a guide for creating an event for humans that allows for the engagement in the major emotions of the human experience.  The experience is part role-play, part ritual, and wide open to interpretations for your purposes.  This book provides instructions for an experience in which a number of human participants take on the roles of trees standing near one another in a grove, and follows their development from germination to their eventual deaths and the passing of their lives to the lives that will follow them...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike many roleplay experiences, the goal is cooperative and peaceful.  The goal of your grove of trees is to reach harmony with the world by engaging in and releasing the emotions of existence by means of artistic expression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
