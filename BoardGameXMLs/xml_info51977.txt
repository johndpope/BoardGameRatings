							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Delian Book of the Dead</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Fantasy Role-Play, death is real and important but, as in life, it is also much ignored.  When a Player Character dies, the event is treated with only slightly more importance than the death of an NPC or a monster.  However, this need not be the case and, in Delos at least, death can sometimes simply be the beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Delian Book of the Dead introduces the Character Class: Deceased (Phantom) along with an examination of the role of the departed spirit as a Player Character.  Other topics include funeral rites, phantom magicks and other spirit-related magicks as well as the nature of the afterlife and the Planes of the Abyss and other matters of importance to those recently deceased.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Table of Contents (abbreviated)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Class: Deceased (Phantom): While not all who die are capable of returning as phantoms, for those who do, a life after death can be a rewarding existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phantom Class Abilities &amp;amp; Limitations: Just as death brings an end to old abilities, life as a phantom -- if you'll pardon the expression -- brings new skills and fresh possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phantom Magicks: While mortal magicks are of little use to those of the phantasmal persuasions, life after death does not mean that there are no magicks to be mastered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Spells &amp;amp; Spirit-Related Magicks: While little attention is paid elsewhere to magicks used by mortals in connection with spirits, those adventuring with phantoms may well find these new spells useful in their endeavors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Class: Archaeologist: Long before Indiana Jones appeared, archaeological adventurers were wandering the paths and byways of Delos.  Sharing some of the abilities of the Thieves class, Archaeologist have their own skills, interests and abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notable Tombs of Delos: Excerpted from The Complete Cracksman by Professor R. J. Raffles, Prof. Emeritus of the University School of the Delian Thieves Guild, Professor Raffles was well noted for her personal investigations of many of the more remote areas of the Delian Commonwealth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funeral Rites of the Commonwealth: Quite aside from possible personal participation, the wise adventurer may well find a knowledge of both guild and regional funeral rites an advantage in remaining among the living.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gem Stones &amp;amp; Other Jewels: It's all very well to scoop up a chance handful of gems in the hopes of finding them profitable ... but how well do you know your gemstones ... and not just which ones are profitable but which ones are safe to handle at all?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Natural Hazards &amp;amp; Other Dangers: In Delos, the adventurer not only must contend with monsters and wildlife but should also be wary of less obvious dangers ... because some are not obvious at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And Doors On New Vistas Opening: Most are accustomed to using doors without a second thought ... but, occasionally, doors are more than they appear ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arms and Armour: ... of course, weapons are not always the answer ... but they are, sometimes, the question ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Gentle Cup of Poison From the Hand of a Friend: Accomplishing the transition from the world of the living to the Planes Beyond may be undertaken in many ways ... and one such route might be ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mirrors and Other Windows: As we all are aware, ghosts and other specters, like vampires, can not be seen in mirrors ... or can they ...?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And, For Light Reading,...: Notes on books, scrolls and other writings which may be encountered while adventuring ... but not always safely ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Matter of Menagerie: On the care, seeking and acquisition of strange pets ... (and the consequences of living with them later...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Book of the Planes: Just as the Delian Commonwealth encompasses many diverse peoples, so too does the Delian afterlife present a diversity of places, planes and regions which are commonly referred to as the Neather Planes, the Abyss or the Great Beyond.  In some cases, these regions are even accessible to mortals (via the Well of the Worlds) and a number of the more popular regions and their inhabitants are described here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Horn of Hern: The Horn of Hern is an adventure designed for the recently deceased but is not limited to those who have passed beyond. As a mission offered by Amazon Mutual Life Assurance, this is a challenge for the living and the dead alike ... and may lead to a most singular conclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
