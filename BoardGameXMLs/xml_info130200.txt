			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the year 2024 and a dream is almost realised. Defence Forces have been reduced to a minimum following a new Accord between the Major Powers, and chauvinistic armies have been disbanded in the civilised world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Responsibility for keeping the peace lies with the World Peace Force. As a WPF operative, you are equipped in your bunker with a computer display, transmitted by Satellite, of your assigned territory. From this bunker, you control a WPF Interceptor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Alert...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WPF Intelligence reports that Mustapha Fracas (the Mad Mullah) has secretly purchased old discarded Cruise Missiles and has declared total war against his enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you fly an aircraft over an isometric landscape with the aim of intercepting and shooting down the incoming missiles. The landscape is littered with obstacles which your fighter must dodge. Fuel is limited, but you can refuel by shooting fuel storage dumps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
