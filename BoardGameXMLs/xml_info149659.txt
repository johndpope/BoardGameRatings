							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frampton&#039;s Folly</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mad archmage Lorcan Frampton was famous throughout the land for his strange behaviour and crazy schemes. Nobody was surprised when he spent all the money accumulated over a lifetime on one final work - a magnificent stone folly just outside town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The day after the folly's completion Frampton vanished in the night, taking all his treasures with him. Despite their best efforts his family have been unable to ascertain what happened to him or why he left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now a clue has been discovered that might help solve the mystery. A recently unearthed manuscript describes a series of secret vaults beneath the folly protected by fiendish traps and guardians. A brave group of adventurers is required to find the vaults and search them for clues to the fate of the missing archmage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the four main vaults beneath the folly can be played as a separate adventure with a minimum of effort by the GM, or the whole folly can be played over several sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frampton's Folly is a Pathfinder Roleplaying Game compatible adventure for four 5th level characters using the Medium XP advancement track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure can easily be adapted to fit into any campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon completing the adventure the characters should attain 6th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
