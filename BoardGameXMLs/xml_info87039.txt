			<description>User Summary: Submission for the Game Chef 2010 Competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;CHRONICLES OF SKIN&lt;br/&gt;The last chief is dead. The kingdom is on the brink of collapse. Once brothers, the Iho and Croen tribes turn their knives in the dark, poisoned by greed and fear. It is a time of rivalry and hatred.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the eve of civil war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THIS GAME&lt;br/&gt;CHRONICLES OF SKIN is a storytelling game for three or more players. Each player contributes to the depiction of a bitter civil war, collaborating to render the peoples on both sides as victims in a grand and unfair struggle. Through a series of atrocities, players build a picture of the war as told by the victors, and record it with drawings, called GLYPHS, on a hieroglyphic mural called the SKIN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
