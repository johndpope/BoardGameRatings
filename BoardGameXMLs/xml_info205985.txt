							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nukie McPooch and the Zombie Mutant Presidents</name>
									
			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armed with a plasma rifle and a hella cool dog, Nukie McPooch is our only hope against the dead U.S. Presidents that we really shouldn't have reanimated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As punk rocker Nukie, you engage in a constant shootout with the Zombie Mutant Presidents (ZMPs) in a bombed-out city.  Move yourself and your dog, Schwartz, on a randomized battlefield grid and use the ruined walls as cover. Command Schwartz to loot the bodies of ZMPs you've wasted, videotape the ZMPs for valuable intel, and plant nukes at the ZMP hideouts so you can blow them sky-high!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the 43 ZMPs has his own zombiefied portrait card, combat rating, and unique National Treasure that Schwartz can loot if he's lucky.  When you've defeated them all, tally your score and read the secret ending you've earned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
