			<description>The object of Domatics is to teach kids the principle of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division in a fun game environment.  It is designed to help children learn basic arithmetic calculations, while encouraging them to learn how to gradually  speed up their mathematical calculations. The game is designed to enable players to use strategy to play efficiently.  Players will need to know when to play a high tile or when to play a low tile, when to take risks and when not to.  This will help to give players that preparation to analyze and make informed decisions based on their evaluations. Most importantly the game is designed to include the whole family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Promotes family bonding &amp;amp; team-building&lt;br/&gt;    Teaches sportsmanship&lt;br/&gt;    Promotes socialization &amp;amp; Improves self-esteem&lt;br/&gt;    Teaches interpersonal &amp;amp; communication skills&lt;br/&gt;    Teaches arithmetic and analytical skills&lt;br/&gt;    Develops thinking skills and enhances decision-making&lt;br/&gt;    Develops cognitive and spatial abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays a lot like Dominioes except instead of number tiles there are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division tiles.  Tiles are added to the end of other tiles just like in Dominoes except that points are gained based on the tile played.  Players will then call out the correct answer to the math equation that they made and gain points if they're correct or possibly lose points if they're wrong.  Special lock tiles will make it where other players can't play on that end unless they have a special unlock tile.  The player whose points are closest to the target number that is rolled at the beginning of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
