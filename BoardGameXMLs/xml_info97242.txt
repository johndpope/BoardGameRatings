			<description>There is no date on the rules but the style of the graphics and shape of the vehicles suggest post 1945 and likely to be in the early 1950's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics of the game is similar in style to ludo/pachisi but involves moving both a pedestrian and a vehicle from Home to Base to win.  The four routes around the board intercept each other.   The pedestrian dodge the motorists to avoid being knocked down and sent to hospital. The vehicles avoid the pedestrians as well as the police car to avoid being sent to prison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A die is thrown and as you move along your route you hope to avoid landing on the many penalty square which may throw you into the path of other players' vehicles or pedestrians&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every time a 6 is thrown the police car is moved to try and catch jaywalkers and cars&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
