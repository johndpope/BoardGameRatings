			<description>Necropolis is a 2 player domino draw game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A necropolis is a large ancient cemetery. The word derives from Ancient Greek literally meaning &amp;quot;city of the dead&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need a set of double six dominoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object - Lowest score at endgame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play - Start by shuffling face down the set of double six dominoes. Leave them in a pile face down between the 2 players, from this point on this will be known as the necropolis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next decide who goes first, then play alternates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your first turn draw a tile from the necropolis and place the tile face up in front of you, this area will be known as the grave site. Your opponent now does the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From this point on, on your turn, you may do one of the following actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Draw a tile from the necropolis and place it adjacent to an existing tile at your grave site or&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Draw a tile from the necropolis but keep its value hidden from your opponent by placing it face down in front of you, but behind your grave site (This area behind your grave site will be known as the mastabas) or&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Draw a tile from your mastabas and place it adjacent to an existing tile at your grave site or&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Draw a tile from the necropolis or from the mastabas and start a new grave site, the old grave site is now considered abandoned and must not be played to for the rest of the game or&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Exchange a tile from your mastabas with the necropolis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now this ends your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tile Placement - The top number on a domino is known as its rank and the bottom number is known as its suit. You must match either the rank or suit to an existing domino in an active grave site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When placing a tile to your grave site, the tile being placed must be placed touching an existing tile along its long edges on either side of the existing tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring - The game ends when the necropolis is empty or when players are unable to add tiles to their gravesite. Players then count the pips on their remaining dominoes in their  mastabas and add +1 points to their totals for the number of grave sites they started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player having the lowest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
