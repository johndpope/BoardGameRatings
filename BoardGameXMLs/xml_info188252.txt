			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WhiteBox One-Shots is a line of short wilderness side treks, dungeon delves, and other brief encounters designed for compatibility with the Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry WhiteBox roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tribe of orcs has moved into a ruined tower and begun raiding local villages. On its surface, it seems like a simple problem that any band of stalwart adventurers could handle. However, the tower was once an Adventurer's Guild outpost and is said to be haunted by the souls of fallen adventurers. Rumors also persist of long-forgotten treasures just waiting to be reclaimed. Can the party drive off the orcs and uncover the mystery of the Tower of Boon Companions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tower of Boon Companions is a Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry WhiteBox adventure designed for 3-6 characters of 3rd-5th level (about 18 levels total). It is a site-based dungeon crawl with a number of different threats and challenges (some of which are class-based), so a variety of classes is recommended. Although vague references are made to the Chronicles of Amherth campaign setting, the adventure is designed to be dropped into any OSR campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
