			<description>Noctis (Latin for &amp;ldquo;of the night&amp;rdquo;) is an open source computer space flight simulator featuring first-person visual exploration of an imaginary galaxy; where you play as one of the last felysians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is manifested in Noctis as a physical intelligent being in charge of a fantastic spacecraft called a Stardrifter(which is similiar to a tardis), capable of instantaneous interstellar travel. This allows travelling between stars, refuelling the Stardrifter from Lithium ion-ejecting stars, approaching planets in star systems and their moons, and even landing where it is physically possible. Many planets feature atmospheres and weather effects. Some harbour plants and animals, or even mysterious ruins. No goal or measure of success is imposed by the game: it simply allows to catalogue and annotate the player&amp;rsquo;s discoveries in a common database of stellar bodies called the GUIDE, which is to be synchronised over the author&amp;rsquo;s Internet server. you can explore the stardrifter and even go on the roof of the stardrifter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game&amp;rsquo;s sci-fi setting, a fleet of Stardrifters was left behind by a race of sentient cats known as Felysians who abandoned their home world (planet Felysia, star system Balastrackonastreya) long ago for unknown reasons. The Felysians were the only sentient beings in the Noctis galaxy, so there are none to find in the Noctis game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Noctis , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
