							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ego: The Adult Game of Communication</name>
									
			<description>The fun filled thought provoking discussion generated between players demonstrates the qualities of being unique and being human. To express your opinion of a subjects qualities (player being evaluated), each analyst (all remaining players) must dieal their &amp;quot;opinionators&amp;quot; to displa a most/least or hes/no answer. Characteristics shown on Ego cards require your opinion of what the player is most and least like. When a statement is read from an Alter Ego card, your yes or no opinion is required of what you think the subject will say. There are no intrinsically right or wrong answers, but gives everyone a chance to express their opinions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing The Game: To select the first subject, an Ego card is drawn by each player. The playwer whose characteristics begin with the letter nearest teh beginning of the alphabet becomes the first subject. The subject then collets all Ego cards drawn and places them face up in the Tripper so that each space contains at least one card. All remaining players and the subject then express their pinions of the subject by dialing their opinionators to mach the most/least ccolor combination under the Ego cards int he tripper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example: The three Ego cards displayed read generous, expressive and shy. If a player perceives the subject as being more expressive than shy or generous then the player would dial their opinionator to reveal the word most in the color that matches the color under the expressive ego card in the tripper. If the player percieves the subject as being less shy than generous then the player would dial their opinionator to reveal the word least in the color matching the &amp;quot;shy&amp;quot; ego card under the tripper making sure that the Most color already is revealed at the same time. When all players are ready they turn over their opinionators to reveal their opinions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Score: The subject moves forward one square for each analyst opinion that matches his, plus one of his own. Players whose opinions do not match any other player move back one square. Players cannot move further back than the beginner square. Player whose opinions match one or more players remain where they are and are not penalized even if they do not match the subject's opinion. After scoring the player on the subject's left becomes the next subject adn the next session is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning the Game: Play continues with a new subject being evaluated after each session is complete. The player who reaches the winners circle first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
