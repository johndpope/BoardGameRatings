			<description>Lists is a very pleasant trivia game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player has to place in the right order some answers in the card that is being played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An example could be chronological order of some events, or American presidents, right order from the longest river to the shortest one, right order from the movie with the most Oscars to the one with the least. The answers are given. You'll have just to place them in the right order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on your right answers in the row, you move along the board till the finish line!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
