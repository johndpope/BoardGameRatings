			<description>Zeugo Table Football (Soccer) is the true successor to the classic game of Subbuteo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specially imported from Italy, where it is manufactured by Edilio Parodi, the players are made using the classic Subbuteo 'heavyweight' moulds from the late 1960's. The players are then inserted into modern, flatter bases which give more control and a smoother action. This starter set contains everything required to play the game, including rules in English.&lt;br/&gt;Players bases designed by ProfiBase , the Italian-German company since 1995 leader worldwide in the production of bases for professional table-soccer. With these bases (similar to the model C8, world champion 2005) is very easy to shoot, to slide and to spin. A very good product which has a very big success all over the world and should help  Table-Football(Soccer)  to have a second birth in the next years&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 8 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2 players or teams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Felt pitch&lt;br/&gt;1 Red &amp;amp; white team&lt;br/&gt;1 Blue &amp;amp; white team&lt;br/&gt;2 Balls&lt;br/&gt;2 Goals&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
