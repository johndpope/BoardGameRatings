			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superpowers and Horror in a Dark Eighties&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Top Gun is in theaters. &amp;ldquo;Papa Don&amp;rsquo;t Preach&amp;rdquo; is on the radio. Halley&amp;rsquo;s Comet is in the sky, and Iran-Contra is in the news. The Soviets are in Afghanistan, and the Doomsday Clock is at 3 minutes until midnight. But there&amp;rsquo;s something else going on&amp;mdash;something even bigger. At school, at the mall, down by the 7-Eleven, you&amp;rsquo;ve started noticing things. Is that troll doll really glowing? Is that cassette tape calling to you? Why doesn&amp;rsquo;t anyone else seem to notice?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And when you follow that strange compulsion to create a mask from these items, you become . . . someone else. Someone with capabilities the world has never seen and goals that may not be your own. The mask gives you unimaginable power, but can you resist its agenda? And there are others starting to show up, too, who may have embraced their masks&amp;rsquo; dark sides. Maybe that Doomsday Clock matters after all . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A complete, ready-to-play campaign setting of superpowers and psychological horror for the Cypher System.&lt;br/&gt;    Four new types and a load of new foci&amp;mdash;and a new approach to superpowers. In your mask form you might be a Metal Head Smasher who Lives on the Dark Side or a Show-O Changer who Flies by Night, but on school days you&amp;rsquo;re a regular teen dealing with bullies, grades, and New Wave fashion.&lt;br/&gt;    The complete, ready-to-use town of Boundary Bay, NY, as well as detailed information and guidance on creating your own small-town setting&amp;mdash;or using your own town, circa 1986!&lt;br/&gt;    New creatures, NPCs, and threats.&lt;br/&gt;    A complete adventure set in Ocean View High School, plus a plethora of tools and advice for building your own adventures and campaigns based around the mystery of the masks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
