			<description>Edited, March 26th 2015.&lt;br/&gt;RuckBowl is a two-player Rugby Union board game, where players control two teams of rugby-men. Each team has only 10 pawns (instead of 15). There are 4 forwards in RuckBowl, and each forward represents 2 real forwards. The n&amp;deg;10 in RuckBowl represents the real fly-half and the real scrum-half. So the 10 pawns in RuckBowl represent 15 real players. Why 10 pawns? Because it is easier to manipulate 10 pawns than 15 pawns. The game becomes quicker and more nervous with 10 pawns.&lt;br/&gt;RuckBowl uses a square-grid board: 15 columns by 28 lines : almost the BloodBowl pitch...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played taking turns: each turn is divided in two segments: Segment I for placing players and launching play, and Segment II for the current play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What happens in the Segment I :&lt;br/&gt;Kick-off, Re-start Kick, 22 m drop out, Scrum, Lineout, Penalty kick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is several options in the Segment II: &lt;br/&gt;Option 1. The coach moves his players, passes the ball, kicks the ball, attempt crash charges or tackles, or attempt a drop-goal, &lt;br/&gt;Option 2 or 3. The coach declares a Ruck or a Maul. &lt;br/&gt;Option 4. The coach declares a Mark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some actions need dice rolls: tackle, crash charge, kick, Ruck, Maul, Scrum, etc. A bad die roll can lead to a Scrum, a penalty, or a turn-over, etc. The opposition can react by: intercepting the ball, tackling the ball carrier, catching a kicked ball, etc... Each team can score with Try, Drop Goal, and Penalty Kick. And don&amp;rsquo;t forget: passing the ball to a team mate in front of you is totally forbidden !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RuckBowl is a game where you must make the good decision all the time : what can I make ? pass the ball, kick, kicking in touch, move the ball carrier, declare a ruck ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to customize your team, you can use Team cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has his own profile :&lt;br/&gt;Move (for...movements).&lt;br/&gt;Power (for melees : scrum, ruck, maul).&lt;br/&gt;Catch (for catching the free ball, after a kick or a bounce).&lt;br/&gt;Impact (for tackles).&lt;br/&gt;Pass (for passes).&lt;br/&gt;Kick (when the ball is kicked).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RuckBowl is a complex game, for 14 year old (or more).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
