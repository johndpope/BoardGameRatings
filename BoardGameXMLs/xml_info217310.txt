			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are Paragons, enforcers of justice, living in the utopia of the Grand Society. Terrorists seeking to spread fear and panic live among us. They threaten the Grand Society by sowing discontent and seeking to destroy everything we hold as good and right and true. If they had it their way there would be no reincarnation, they would force us all to face the final death; oblivion. As Paragons it is our duty to protect our families, ensure the existence of our community, by facing what others must not be forced to face. Our faith in the Grand Society is peerless, it is for this reason we can stand up to those unbelievers, the Sinners, who would destroy everything and everyone we love. No one is above our scrutiny &amp;mdash; even those closest to us &amp;mdash; ensuring this insidious disease does not spread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In [NM 156], players take on the roles of Paragons &amp;mdash; enforcers of utopian rule, charged with ensuring none disrupt the Grand Society&amp;rsquo;s perfection. People who rebel against the status quo threaten the society&amp;rsquo;s values, spreading fear and panic. They are Sinners and it is the Paragons&amp;rsquo; task to capture them, even if Paragons have become Sinners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one is above the law.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
