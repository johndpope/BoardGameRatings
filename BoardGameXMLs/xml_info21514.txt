			<description>The &amp;quot;Terrific Toy Box&amp;quot; card game was distributed by Target Stores in 1998. The cards depict various toys available at Target along with one card labeled &amp;quot;Empty Tox Box.&amp;quot; The cards are essentially ads for toys (with brand names and logos displayed prominently).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two games that can be played with the cards are described on the back of the package. The first, &amp;quot;Match the Toys,&amp;quot; is simply blind Go Fish. Players take turns drawing cards from each others' hands in order to create matches in their own hands. The only card that cannot be matched is the Empty Toy Box card, and the player left holding this card is the loser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second game described on the package is &amp;quot;The Memory Game,&amp;quot; in which  players use the cards for a simple face down matching game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
