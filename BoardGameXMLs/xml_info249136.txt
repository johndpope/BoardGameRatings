			<description>I Want a Casino!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's after the Zombie Apocalypse and players want to find and control a small Casino. Your goal is to clear it out and make a fortune. In the way are zombies, gangs, and other players who have the same idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Casino Carnage is a board game using cards, dice, and minis. Designed to be played solo or cooperatively against the game, or competitively head to head, no two games will ever play exactly alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With our tried and true Origins Award winning Reaction System you're always in the game, every turn. Easy to learn, but difficult to master, Casino Carnage can be played as a one off game or part of a larger campaign telling a Story, YOUR Story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;How many zombies did you kill?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I don't know. It's not that kind of zombie game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
