							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Police City</name>
									
			<description>You play as a young officer whose ambitious goal is to become the leader of the NYPD. Thanks to your staff and the support of your colleagues, you will stop gangsters, regain control of neighborhoods, traffic capture, in brief all which will allow you to be promoted and to fill the quotas of the mayor of the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City Police is based on a mechanism of simultaneous placements: each turn, you send your staff (inspectors, sergeants, lieutenants ...) on the site of the city by conducting joint actions with other players. The hardest part will not necessarily stop the gangsters, but you agree you later for the distribution of benefits of each intervention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus, at every moment of the game, you will make the right decisions and advance good arguments in a very short time. Negotiation and reactivity are your main weapons. But beware: if you and your colleagues will too shoot in the legs, it will be the Mafia who eventually win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City Police is a fun and relaxed which makes great negotiation and role-play. Unlike Gangs City, you need to know to make decisions very quickly, on the stroke of the pulse. It will show you reagents both intellectually and physically, since the investments are trades like an hourglass time of 30 seconds. Thus, the parties are very lively and rhythmic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, all the time of the game(set,play), you will have to make the good decisions and to move forward the good arguments in a short time. Negotiation and reactivity will be your main weapons. But pay attention: if you and your colleagues if you do not hear enough, it will be the Mafia who eventually win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City police is a funny and relaxed game which leaves the beautiful part in the negotiation and in the role-play. You will have to know how to make decisions very quickly, at the time impulse. It will be necessary to show you reactive at the same time intellectually and physically, because placements and negotiation are made the time of an hourglass of 30 seconds. Thus, the parties are very lively and rhythmic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
