			<description>Castlevania Legends is the third and final Castlevania title released for the original Game Boy. It was released in Japan on November 27, 1997 and in North America on March 11, 1998. Its original Japanese title is Akumajō Dracula: Dark Night Prelude (悪魔城ドラキュラ 漆黒たる前奏曲, Akumajō Dorakyura: Dāku Naito Pureryūdo, officially translated Devil's Castle Dracula: Dark Night Prelude)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player starts with three lives, after which the game is over, but a player may continue from the beginning of the last stage they were in. There is also a Hit score showing how many enemies have been defeated in each stage. Striking candles will often cause items to appear. The game does not make use of any sub-weapons, unlike most other Castlevania titles, and relies heavily on the use of magic, which is another unique feature. The magic system used relies on five &amp;quot;Soul Weapons&amp;quot;, including Flame, Ice, Saint, Wind, and Magic. Hearts are used as currency to acquire weapons. Sonia can also enter a &amp;quot;Burning Mode&amp;quot;, where she becomes invincible, moves faster, and has more powerful attacks, though this power can only be used once per life or level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Castlevania Legends&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
