							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Binding of Isaac</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Binding of Isaac, The players is Isaac, a young boy whose mother has been instructed by God to kill her son. He escapes to the basement and finds himself in a dungeon inhabited my monstrous beings. Isaac's task is to reach the bottom of the dungeon and defeat his mother.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At its core, the Binding of Isaac is a dual stick shooter. However, many elements are reminscent of The Legend of Zelda: the dungon structure, the RPG elements, the in-game items, the shops...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most important feature of the game is its random nature: every time a new game is started, a dungeon is randomly generated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of the game is obviously inspired by the Biblical tale of the Binding of Isaac, although transposed to modern times, with Isaac's mother, instead of father, wanting to sacrifice her son.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
