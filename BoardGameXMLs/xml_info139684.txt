			<description>It was a plan, as foolproof as it could be for escaping the most secured prison in this country. And it worked &amp;ndash; until you decided to rest in an abandoned barn without knowing it was the meeting place for all the nearby villains in their ultimate quest. The battle between you and them was short but fierce. It was a battle with no survivors...only legends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Roundhouse Kick, each player is an escaped prisoner who must fight several monsters in an abandoned barn. In each round all players roll the dice and try to kill as many monsters as they can because the monsters are worth points. After the players attack, though, the monsters fight back. The game ends once all the monsters or all the players are dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
