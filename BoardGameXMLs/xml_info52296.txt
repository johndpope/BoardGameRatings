			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of vile humanoids has taken over an old, ruined keep within a day's walk of the nearest town. Local leaders greet this news with alarm, for they don't wish to see a stronghold for evil humanoids so close to their settlement. So they offer a deal to your group of adventurers: Root out the humanoids and you can have the keep as your own base of operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Base of Operations, a short adventure intended for four 5th-level characters, is a site-based scenario designed to be either very brief (one or two sessions) or part of an ongoing campaign. Player characters have the opportunity to save a town from a horrible fate, rid the world of a vile necromancer, and find a little wealth in the meantime. Or, if the DM wishes, the adventure allows for player characters to set themselves up in their own &amp;quot;base of operations&amp;quot; and become permanent members of a community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
