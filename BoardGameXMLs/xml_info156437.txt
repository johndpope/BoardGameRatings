							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Patrol:  WWII</name>
									
			<description>Patrol: WWII is a fast playing man-to-man skirmish system that recreates squad patrols in any theatre of the Second World War with as little as ten miniatures per side and a 4'x4' play area. Individual games last from 15 minutes to 1 hour allowing for multiple exciting games in an evening's play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patrol takes you beyond line &amp;lsquo;em up and shoot &amp;lsquo;em down miniature gaming. Opposing squads draw one of the 20 missions offering a large variety of tactical challenges that reflect historical tactics and weapon effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stats and weapons for American, Commonwealth, Soviet, German, Italian, Japanese, and Partisans forces are included. Additional appendix expands the game into the Korean War with new weapons and missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monstrous tanks, zooming jeeps with 30 cal blazing, flame throwers and mortars raining death, along with random battlefield events, create a chaotic and dangerous battlefield where a realistic morale system recreates the reactions of soldiers and their squad leader's attempts to motivate them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complete campaign lets you keep the same squad over multiple games (if you can keep them alive). Survivors gain experience and skills, scrounge for weapons and gear, and try to get some sleep before drawing replacements and ammunition for the next patrol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
