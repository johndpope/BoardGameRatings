			<description>Skittykitts is a card game that uses a unique deck of 21 cards. &lt;br/&gt;A Skittykitt is an enlightened space raccoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Each character chooses a unique character:&lt;br/&gt;         The Princess - Always goes first; takes an extra turn after the Skittykitts round is played before the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;         The Wizard - Can add or subtract 5 points from his final score; once per game he can fire a &amp;quot;Magic Missle&amp;quot; to knock 1 card from any player's hand and into the boneyard instead of playing a card.&lt;br/&gt;         The Bat - Starts with an extra card; takes 2 cards per turn; takes turn after The Wizard but before the Fool.&lt;br/&gt;         The Fool - Always goes last and only starts with 1 card; always draws 2 cards at the end of his turn.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Each turn players can play ONE card (although The Bat has the superpower to play TWO, each character has special traits). You can also play as many cards as you want per turn if you control the card called Super Speed. Cards are played into different areas:&lt;br/&gt;         The Boneyard - This is a discard pile of sorts. &lt;br/&gt;         The Abyss - The 3 most powerful cards go here when played, they are essentially removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;         The Zones - Each player has a zone, this is where you put stuff like Super Speed to enhance your powers and abilities, you can also use zone cards to hinder your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Every card has two sides. One side has the action/event and the other side can be played for points.  Most cards are worth 4 points, although there are also the 0 point cards, and the 10 point cards.  EVERY card was designed to be OVERLY powerful, which then re-balanced into them all being even, but still every turn a massive shift can happen.&lt;br/&gt;     The object of the game is to get the most points, but in Skittykitts even this can change. If the game ends with Reverse Gravity played in any zone lowest points win. And there are the dreaded 0 cards that can eliminate players entirely if they don't take care of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     21 card deck&lt;br/&gt;     4 special character cards&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed instruction manual&lt;br/&gt;     A pouch for portability&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
