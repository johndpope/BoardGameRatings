			<description>WORLD AT WAR 85, VOLUME 3: THE UNTOLD BATTLES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The British General Heading up NATO&amp;rsquo;s military command continued. &amp;ldquo;We need reinforcements&amp;hellip;now. How far off are the French?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His Belgian aide responded quickly, the information at his fingertips. &amp;ldquo;They are on the move as we speak, heading for their border with West Germany, sir. Just like they have been practicing with the Bundeswehr in recent years. But other of their forces are refusing to cross our &amp;ndash; excuse me, the Belgian border as yet. They appear to be biding their time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE UNTOLD BATTLES is the third volume in The WORLD AT WAR 85 SERIES of games of fast and furious platoon-level combat. Set in 1985, in an alternate history of World War III, the Warsaw Pact armies having already stormed across the border of East Germany attempting to finish their conquest of West Germany, and continue their offensive into The Low Countries, France, and the rest of Free Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WORLD AT WAR 85 system features a unique combat system that involves die rolls by both attacking units and defending units, which keeps both players engaged throughout the game. Die rolls are compared and hits applied quickly, as all the information you need to fight your units is on the counters. No combat results table is necessary. Initiative, formation activation, random turn length, close air support and air cover are all integrated smoothly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
