			<description>The Outlaw Hero Class is a Kickstarter exclusive hero to play for those who pledged &amp;quot;Outlaw&amp;quot; level or higher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing an Outlaw: Outlaws are a bit of a wild card in that they are very versatile! The can lay down a lot of fire and are great at moving quickly in the shadows. Of course this comes at a price in that they are not very accurate with a gun and they do not gain a lot of health over time. One of the coolest elements of being an outlaw though is the ability to rob the &amp;quot;Outpost Bank&amp;quot; in town! This can give you a big influx of cash to buy cool gear and pay bribes to keep you out of jail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This promo includes: &lt;br/&gt;The double sided character card.&lt;br/&gt;A double sided reference sheet with the upgrade chart.&lt;br/&gt;Three Outlaw Starting Option cards: Hitman, Outlaw Charm, Reckless.&lt;br/&gt;4 Starting Gear cards: 2&amp;times;Outlaw Pistol, Bandanna, Sawed-Off Shotgun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was packaged with the kickstarter backers copy of the four promo Gear cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
