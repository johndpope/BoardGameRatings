			<description>From Fear to Eternity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been said that an optimist believes we live in the best of all worlds, while a pessimist fears we do. Yet if we fear that ours is the best world, how fearsome must all those other worlds be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the answers can be found within the pages of GURPS Infinite Worlds: Worlds of Horror. Written by Kenneth Hite &amp;ndash; eldritch architect of GURPS Infinite Worlds and GURPS Horror for GURPS Fourth Edition &amp;ndash; this supplement includes six terrifying timelines where events have taken impossible turns for the worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each alternate Earth provides an intriguing history, complete with an explanation of the divergence point when things began to go awry. Each also offers details of how agents from the GURPS Infinite Worlds setting are active in that timeline &amp;ndash; and what dark secrets they've uncovered. Finally, each section contains campaign ideas, with possibilities for natives and outworld operatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether facing the shambling scourge of the walking dead, the sinister science of Victor Frankenstein, or the soul-crushing secrets lurking in the void, GURPS Infinite Worlds: Worlds of Horror presents a half-dozen horrific possibilities suitable for stand-alone scares or as part of an ongoing campaign. You can't outrun history &amp;ndash; but sometimes it's the only option!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
