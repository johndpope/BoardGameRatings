			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;大きなつづらと小さなつづらと (Ookina Tudura to Tiisana Tudura to) is 'Big Box And Small Box And More' according to the publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three closed baskets on the table - one is full of gold, one has a little gold, and one is empty. You must choose one to place in front of you, but beware! If you're greedy and take the big basket, and another player chooses your basket as well, you'll get nothing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big Basket and Small Basket and... is a bluffing game played in a number of rounds equal to the number of players. Each round, the first few players secretly choose a single basket card from the cards remaining and place it in front of them. The remaining players then choose a basket to peek into - the big basket gold gets stolen easily, the little basket has a little for everyone, and the empty basket rewards the holder. The winner is the player who collects the most gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
