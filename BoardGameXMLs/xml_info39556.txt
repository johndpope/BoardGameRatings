			<description>This is a modern Manqala game with two rows of four pits each. Players start with 4 seeds in each pit and own the pits on the player's side of the board but this is one of the rare manqala games in which pieces are distinguishable, i.e., one player starts with white seeds and the other black. Sowing is anticlockwise starting in the pit adjacent to the starting pit and sowing one seed in each pit until the last seed is sown, without restriction on laps and sowing in the original pit if a sufficient number of seeds are in the original pit. Captures occur when the last seed is sown in an empty pit. That last seed and all seeds in the pits opposite it are captured. The winner is the player to capture more of the opponent's seeds and play continues until no more moves are possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
