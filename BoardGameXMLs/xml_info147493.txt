			<description>When Jeff, noted ghostologist, is called in late one night, he knows that he has a job to do. What he doesn't know is that this job is the most important one he's ever had. As the night goes on, the stakes increase, and when the deadwinds rise and the lights go out, Jeff might be the only person between humans and their total extinction.&lt;br/&gt;History&lt;br/&gt;The past few years have seen a rapid increase in the number of horror games being released. While Amnesia: The Dark Descent has spawned an entire genre of first person games about being scared, 2D side-scrolling horror games are still relatively rare. Cameron Kunzelman saw this field, played 2D horror games like Home and Lone Survivor, and decided that he wanted to go another way. He then mocked up the game in Construct 2 and then launched a kickstarter for $125. After a month he had raised over $1300 to develop the game. Over the next two months he created Catachresis: A Way Too Scary game, and the final product is an intense horror/comedy mashup influenced equally by Hugo's House of Horrors, Ghostbusters, Shirley Jackson, Event Horizon, the comics work of Mike Mignola, and Julia Kristeva.&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than 45 minutes of horror gameplay punctuated by comedy.&lt;br/&gt;    A brilliant dark ambient soundtrack by Anatra&lt;br/&gt;    The violence of duration and a sick feeling in your gut.&lt;br/&gt;    Simple 2D gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
