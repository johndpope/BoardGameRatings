			<description>Realism is a money-based board game which is easy to play at the basic level with a subtle form of competition where, unlike other money games, winners do not succeed at the expense of other players, so everyone can enjoy the game.  A realistic game which makes players differentiate between needs and wants and encourages them to analyze their risk and limit their exposure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to try to become a virtual millionaire by buying property, shares &amp;amp; other assets. The players have jobs, can invest, take out loans and buy insurance.  During play there are personal and market events to cope with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is particularly relevant in these difficult financial times, as it encourages individuals to think more deeply about the financial decisions they make.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is aimed at adults and the family and helps the players learn about investment and spot the difference between &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; debt and &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; debt. While playing they can build up their income with good investments and try to avoid buying costly luxuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the most net assets when play finishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
