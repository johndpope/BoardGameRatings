			<description>This is a two player game played with a skeletonal 5 by 5 unit cube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with eight 2 by 1 pieces, either black or white, which can be neatly but firmly slid inside the holes in the cube in any of the three dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first player to connect any two opposite faces of the cube with pieces of their colour such that each link is at least a 1x1 area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take it in turn adding a piece and if no one completes a chain after all 16 pieces have been added, the game is a draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
