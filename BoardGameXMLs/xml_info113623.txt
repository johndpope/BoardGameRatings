			<description>This game is named after US goalkeeper Tony Meola (who was the American goalkeeper during the 1994 FIFA World Cup). It went under several names in different markets, such as in Latin America under the name Super Copa, in Europe World Soccer, and in Japan under the name Ramos Rui no World Wide Soccer (ラモス瑠偉のワールドワイドサッカー) (endorsed by Ruy Ramos). The quantity of teams in this game is big but also very standard, there are various national teams and some unlicensed club teams from Europe, Japan and America. The interesting thing here is that the players can have the possibility to play with teams from different parts of the United States, so they can play a match between Mexico City and Miami or Los Angeles versus Sacramento (California) for example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tony Meola's Sidekick Soccer&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
