			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deathwish is an adaptation of Dust Devils, the Truly Gritty Old West Role-Playing Game. You will need the Dust Devils print edition or PDF edition to use this game expansion.&lt;br/&gt;The game also requires a standard deck of playing cards and a handful of poker chips or other tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary Briefing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game expansion is a role-playing game of espionage in the tradition of Ian Fleming&amp;rsquo;s famous character James Bond and other spy thrillers popular in movies and novels. Players portray super spies, secret agents and even devious masterminds who play a complicated, high-stakes spy game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much like its parent game, DUST DEVILS, this game focuses on a crucial character-centric issue. In DUST DEVILS, that issue is the Devil &amp;mdash; will your character &amp;ldquo;shoot or give up the gun?&amp;rdquo; That is, will the Devil get the best of him, or will the character overcome his own faults to be a man the Old West can respect and admire?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deathwish emphasizes a slightly different theme. Here, the issue is &amp;ldquo;How far will you go for queen and country?&amp;rdquo; Contrary to the James Bond film title, spies do not &amp;ldquo;only live twice.&amp;rdquo; Espionage is dangerous business. This game examines how far an agent is willing to go to risk his own safety for some greater motivation. Deathwish provides a mechanic for that ultimate moment &amp;mdash; when the agent must choose between his mission and his own life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
