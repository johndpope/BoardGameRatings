							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeon Delving Undying Light Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Delving Undying Light is a trimmed down and simplified version of Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry. This game takes the Continual Light edition and cleans up the rules and the formatting, then adds backgrounds, more monsters, rules for morale and reaction rolls, additional minor optional rules, four optional systems (True Magic Rituals, Action Points, Body Points, Advanced Combat), and some basic explanations for the referee on how to handle dungeon and wilderness exploration. Designed to be easy to play and easy to teach to those new to tabletop roleplaying games while retaining all the fun of exploring strange new lands and crawling through dark and dangerous dungeons. Referees can easily create their own adventures and campaign settings or use adventures and setting designed for Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry or other early editions and variants of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular tabletop fantasy roleplaying game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The digest-sized pdf includes art, sample blank dungeon maps, and dungeon geomorphs; and is formatted in a single column and uses a larger typeface to make it easier to use on a tablet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The epub version of Dungeon Delving Undying Light contains tables and many epub readers display tables in a single column unreadable mess. Epub reader software designed to display epub3 files usually have no problem with the tables. Note that tables in epub files do not adapt well to small screen devices. Some epub readers do not display all of the art. The epub conversion has some font size issues not present in the pdf version, but is quite usable if your epub reader displays tables properly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
