							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Andwan Legacy</name>
									
			<description>A generic adventure for Iron Gauntlets set in a small town, The Andwan Legacy can be inserted easily into any world. The adventure is designed for a party of four to five adventurers, but it can be scaled easily by modifying the number of creatures. Some magical characters and relics may also be helpful. The adventure involves role-playing opportunities and fighting action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters are approached by a beautiful aristocratic woman in a local inn. The woman claims to be Sherl Andwan of the noble Andwan family and tells them she is in great trouble: her husband died recently but did not show her how to retrieve the inheritance in the dungeon of her villa. She wants to hire the characters to disable the magical traps set by her husband to protect his treasure...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
