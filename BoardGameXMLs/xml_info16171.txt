			<description>From the inside box lid:  &amp;quot;This undersea TV drama comes to life with this exciting strategy game.  Each player controls his team of divers as they leave the Sea Lab to explore the ocean depths. The first player to bring his research team back to the lab with samples from the search, wins the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a team of 3 figures that start in the middle of the board.  In the 4 corners of the board are undersea treasures to obtain (for each player).  Movement is done in a Chinese Checkers fashion until one player retrieves them all and returns home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
