			<description>In and Out is a simple roll and move game based on a swimming &amp;quot;Bath&amp;quot;.  The edge of the pool is numbered 1 to 54.  Ten of the squares are entrances to the pool and when the player lands on them they must roll again and follow the path of a swimmer through the water back to the poolside.  The pool sections are similar to the familiar snakes and ladders, with one difference - the paths through the pool are marked out in squares and thus may represent delays as well as the usual short-cuts or backward steps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game appears to consist of only the board, counters and a die to be supplied by the player.  The instructions mention &amp;quot;dice&amp;quot; but it is likely that the game was intended to be played with one die.  Each player must roll &amp;quot;3&amp;quot; to begin and the exact number to finish which might be impossible with a pair of dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board illustration is quite pleasant, possibly representing an Art Deco swimming pool.  All the swimmers are male, in red or blue trunks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Valentine's Games were proud to proclaim the board as &amp;quot;British Manufacture&amp;quot;.  The game is marked as copyright, but this is undated, although the provenance of the game suggests the game to be no later than 1950.  It is marked G12 suggesting that other boards were available from Valentine's Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
