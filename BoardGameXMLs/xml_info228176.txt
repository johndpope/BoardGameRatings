							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nutcracker Skirmish</name>
									
			<description>A 2-player skirmish game with a Nutcracker Theme.  One player is the Nutcracker and the toy soldiers, the other player is the Mice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An 8x8 Grid is used as a board.  The &amp;ldquo;battlefield&amp;rdquo; is the living room floor at Christmas time.  There are two terrain types &amp;ndash; clear or obstacles (boxes, christmas tree, furniture).  Obstacles block all movement and attacks.  Terrain is laid down at the players&amp;rsquo; discretion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck of cards.  Card are of four types: Attack (A), Defence (D), Movement (M), Special (S)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each side gets a unique set of 16 units that can be moved around on the board. Units have different movement allowances and strengths (hit points).  One unit on each side is designated the Leader.  Units cannot stack but friendly units may move through each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up each player places his units in any of his 3 last rows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns. &lt;br/&gt;Each turn has 3 Phases. &lt;br/&gt;1.  Presents Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Draw 3 cards from the deck and place them in your hand. &lt;br/&gt;2.  Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Play cards from your hand. &lt;br/&gt;-   Use Move cards to move one of your units up to the indicated number of spaces. Your opponent may use certain special cards to negate a Move. &lt;br/&gt;-   Use Attack cards to have a unit attack a target unit at the exact range indicated by the card and do 1 point of damage to the target (when hits are reduced to 0 the unit is destroyed). Your opponent may use Defence cards to reduce hits caused by an Attack.   &lt;br/&gt;3. End Phase&lt;br/&gt;Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won when a player destroys his opponent&amp;rsquo;s leader (Nutcracker or Mouse King).  The last (killing) hit on a leader unit may only be made by the opposing leader unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
