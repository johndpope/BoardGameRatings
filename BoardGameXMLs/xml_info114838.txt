			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a system of rules expanding the hacking rules for Fuzion and Interlock. These rules draw heavily on Cyberpunk 2020's Netrunning rules and are intended to be native in a Cyberpunk environment where neural cyberinterfaces are standard, though they are written generically enough to be useable in a modern setting as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules were designed to use existing Cyberpunk 2020 equipment and software with little modification. There are several differences from the original rules, however, that are intended to speed play and optimize simplicity. First, these rules lack a grid. Movement within the virtual environment of cyberspace is conceptual. To convert applications that give &amp;quot;ranges&amp;quot;, simply apply a percentage chance of effectiveness based on range. Second, these rules incorporate the Power attribute from other Fuzion games, essentially the equivalent to a computer's Intelligence from CP2020. Third, the number of CPUs a system uses is irrelevant to these rules and is considered background information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although these rules are written for one type of interface (manual or cybernetic), a GM can mix the two by simply specifying which is the standard and apply a -2 to all manual rolls if cybernetic is standard or +2 to all cybernetic rolls if manual is the standard. In addition, these rules assume a 3d6 die-rolling mechanic option of Fuzion. If you're playing Interlock, or the Fuzion option of 1d10, simply replace the 3d6 with a 1d10 die roll and replace all +10 with +d10. You won't achieve the same kind of bell curve, but the results will be sufficiently randomized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
