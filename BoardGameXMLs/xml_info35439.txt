			<description>The book consists of over a thousand moral dilemmas in the form of questions. A turn consists of a player answering a question from the book by secretly voting either 'yes' or 'no'. The other players must try to correctly guess that players' answer. A short discussion is allowed between the other players. Once all other players have made guess, each scores one point if correctly determining the questioned players answer . The player taking the turn will only score one point if there is a majority or equal number of other players that correctly guessed his/her answer.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
