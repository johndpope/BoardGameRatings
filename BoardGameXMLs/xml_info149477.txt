							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Shadow Bloom</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Shadow Bloom, the player characters (PC&amp;rsquo;s) become aware that something has afflicted one or more of the group&amp;rsquo;s beloved animal companions (AC&amp;lsquo;s). Despite the character&amp;rsquo;s best efforts, the mysterious affliction proves wholly resistant to both magical and mundane means of healing, forcing the PC&amp;rsquo;s to desperately seek out the most ancient of healing arts in hopes of curing their pets, who are wasting away in agony before their very eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the PC&amp;rsquo;s do not have animal companions, they can still play this module by being enlisted to help an NPC with a pet for the same purpose. The difference being that they get fully paid if they save the animal and it would be less agonizing and personal to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Either through research at the likes of a prominent University or in consulting many a healer, it soon becomes clear that their only hope lies in a rare relative of a wild flower, the shadow bloom. What&amp;rsquo;s worse is that the shadow bloom only grows in the most ancient and dense of woodlands, where little light has ever penetrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
