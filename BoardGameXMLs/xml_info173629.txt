			<description>Wallachia 20 features two complete games covering a pair of important major battles fought during the Russo-Turkish War of 1806 &amp;ndash; 1812 for control of the key Danube river port of Rousse in the province of Wallachia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rousse 20 simulates the earlier of these two engagements, fought on 22 June, 1811. In this battle Ottoman forces advanced northwards, towards the present day Bulgarian-Romanian frontier. Russian infantry and cannons were able to stall the polyglot Ottoman army, and although they managed to eke out a marginal victory their commander, General Kutuzov, chose to yield the key town of Rousse to the Ottomans, convincing them they had won a great victory. The Czar was not pleased.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slobozia 20 focuses on the latter battle of 2 October 1811. In this engagement Kutuzov conducted a surprise march which cut off and surrounded the bulk of the Ottoman army, trapping it on the northern (Bulgarian) shore of the Danube. The result was a decisive Russian victory that permitted negotiations to end the war. This had the dual advantage of allowing Russia to transfer key reserves to oppose Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s invasion of Russia in 1812, and also prevented Austria from contributing more forces to support the French invasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
