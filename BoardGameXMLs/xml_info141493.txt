			<description>This letter tile game has been described as a mix between Tetris and Scrabble. 48 tiles are drawn in a random sequence and &amp;quot;dropped&amp;quot; into a slanted 7x7 playing field with the goal of creating as many and as long words as possible, horizontally and vertically. The 49th joker tile is available to be dropped at any time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After its original release, the game has been implemented several times as computer games and web applications (often but not always titled WOW: Word on Word), with seeded tile sequences to facilitate competitive play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
