							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Secrets of the Metadventurer</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you cool enough to play me?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you like to win Pathfinder?! If you understand that this is a competition between yourself and the GM, then I may just choose you as a player. Come discover The Secrets of the Metadventurer, the most awesome character class ever and join me in pwning the entire make-believe world that GM jerk spent years creating. Marvel at the power of my Metagaming Pool to game the system! Witness the firepower of the fully armed and operational third-party supplements I can drag into your game with my Third Party BS class feature! Exult as my 20th level capstone ability Make the GM Cry reduces that jerk into to a weeping mass huddled in a pile of post-its and crumpled paper containing a lifetime of world-building notes! Cower before my mastery of overusing exclamation points in my ad copy!!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Rite Publishing's April Fool's day product, from the same brilliant and sexy mind that brought you last year's In the Company of Gelatinous Cubes and will bring you next year's In the Company of a Dreamy Game Designer (in sonnet form). The publisher describes me as a new 20-level base class that is, &amp;quot;serious fun, functional, and balanced, but with tongue in cheek,&amp;quot; some reviewer will describe me as, &amp;quot;a blatant cash grab that's not even funny,&amp;quot; and I describe myself as the greatest character concept that ever allowed itself to be written&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
