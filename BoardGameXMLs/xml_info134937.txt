							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tiddleywinks Villa</name>
									
			<description>Game published in The Novelty Box, circa 1935.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Children's game that you had to make before you could play. Detailed instructions tell you how you make the Villa from an old shoe box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The difference with this Tiddleywinks game is that there are six different scoring 'holes' in the villa. Positive scores are 5, 10, 15, 20, 50 and there is one negative score of -5. The hole for the negative square is twice as large as the positive holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, you must make a chimney out of an old wine cork. This sits on top of the roof of course and if you can knock it off the roof, you score 100 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I guess Mum would set a winning score total and the first to get to that total, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
