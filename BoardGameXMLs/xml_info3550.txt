			<description>Stock Market Specialist (The Official Game of the American Stock Exchange) is a simplified simulation of the role of the specialist at a stock exchange.  Each player takes the role of specialist in one of four stocks represented in the game, and does his or her utmost to increase personal wealth by trading these four stocks while performing all the &amp;quot;market making&amp;quot; duties that a specialist in a market performs:  Maintaining an order book; executing orders; keeping track of personal and brokerage accounts; and refreshing the quotes as the stock trades.  Refreshing the quote requires adherence to strict stock market rules that prevent price fluctuations of an unruly nature, and if this game doesn't give you a feel for what it's like to perform this very niche role in a stock market, then you'll just have to get hired for the real job!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
