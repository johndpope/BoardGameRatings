			<description>A Co-operative Game with an emergency-room simulation theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is cooperative. Players are all on the same team and take turns being team leader. Players take decisions on who to admit to an emergency room bed, how to distribute limited resources of skilled personnel to address injuries. Game mechanisms control the flow of patients, nurses, doctors and time. Beds are limited, injuries vary from critical to nominal. Patients have varied age range and varied gender/appearence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to treat as many patients in one 8-hour shift as possible. Players do not win or lose, but treating all 15 patients is a perfect game, leaving some patients for the next shift is to be avoided if possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
