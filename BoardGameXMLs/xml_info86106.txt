							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;The bodies that were found were, in many cases, unrecognizable. James Yarborough, 24, a gas station attendant, had been crucified in his garage. Dennis Atwater, 39, a farmer, had been impaled on a pitchfork in his back yard. His right arm was missing, and appeared to have been twisted off. Mary Ann Walker was found in her bathtub, fully clothed, her lower jaw sliced off neatly, as if by some impossibly precise blade. Inexplicably, many of the injuries appeared to be self-inflicted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium is a tabletop role-playing game of modern horror-action, set in a world of black magic and demonic possession. Originally released in 2002, the game has been streamlined and revised. Dread features 88 gut-wrenching spells, including Caliban, Bile, and Viscera, and includes 41 demons, including the seductive Laradina and the pyrokinetic Gatterag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
