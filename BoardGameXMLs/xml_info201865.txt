			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 30 x 48 inch, full color battlemap of a Desert River Village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;As foretold by Khunem he has delivered us these champions in our time of dire need!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Priest of Khunem, Inykhunem&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Desert River Village is a single exterior map of a sandy desert area bisected by a river. The river has two small islands in the middle with six buildings, a watch tower, and a well built on top of the islands. Two bridges span the river from the north bank to the north island and from the north island to the south island. The village can be reached via boat from the south bank. The river banks and island shores have vegetation and palm trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Desert River Village is intended for use in fantasy games. It can also be utilized as an archaic desert village in pulp or modern games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chosen of Khunem:  The player characters near a village on the river in a vast desert. They may be desperate for water and food to replace their depleted supplies, which causes them to approach the village. Upon their arrival, the village Priest of Khunem, Inykhunem, dressed in a mud brown cloak, hooded mask with two ram horns, and a belt with a pattern of interlinked spokes greets them. He declares them the new Chosen of Khunem destined to save the village in their hour of greatest need. After these very public protestations he takes them inside his small temple for a private meeting with the chosen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The priest of Khunem explains that the village of Zatis is constantly harassed by desert nomads that take grain, fish, and water from the village as tribute. If the group of adventurers ends the threat of the nomads, the priest will give them all a talisman of Khunem, a copper necklace with two ivory tusks in the front flanking a small sapphire centerpiece in a clay ball giving it the appearance of an eye. Besides the monetary value of the talisman, the talisman of Khunem marks them as believers in Khunem welcome in nearly all villages along the river with a benefit of free lodging and provisions from believers in Khunem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the player characters leave, the nomads approach the village of Zatis from the south. The player characters must flee, fight the nomads and fulfill the prophecy, or perhaps even convince the nomads to join their roaming band.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
