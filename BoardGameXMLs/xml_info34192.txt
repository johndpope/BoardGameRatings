			<description>Roll and move type game with Safety Education theme. Players start at school and work their way getting home. There are 3 different levels of basic education questions, and then there are a series of safety questions, from &amp;quot;Do you know your area code and phone number?&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;If there is a pot in the kitchen why shouldn't you touch it?&amp;quot; Each question card comes with an answer, but the rules highly encourage customizing the game to meet your needs/situation. The game also comes with numerous blank cards to write your own questions/answer. According to the rules, if you don't like the question/answer to a card, either change it or discard it. Although the first one to make it &amp;quot;Home&amp;quot; is a winner, the rules specifically state the everyone is a winner since the knowledge and safety tips they've learned will be with them forever!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
