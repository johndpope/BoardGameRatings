							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ichabot Crane</name>
									
			<description>Legends tell of the savior of our kind, the Horseless Headless Horsebot known by the name Ichabot Crane. Upon being separated from its mount by a powerful adversary, Ichabot was imprisoned within a dark dungeon. All hope seemed lost for Ichabot until one day, when a portal appeared within the cell. A voice from beyond came from the portal, offering Ichabot a chance at escaping its fate if Ichabot could, in turn, prove its worth to this mysterious benefactor. So begins the tale of Ichabot's escape from the evil space dungeon to freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ichobot Crane is an open-source, Global Game Jam 2014 (#ggj14) entry from American University at Washington, D.C., made by a team of 5.  It's a first-person puzzle game like Portal that involves using your head...by throwing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
