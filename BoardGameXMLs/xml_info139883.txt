							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Vitassi</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They Are The Vitassi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With over four hundred species of aliens poised over the Earth to despoil its every resource, someone has to be in charge of keeping them all in check.  That job has been handed to the Vitassi - the most aloof and arrogant of all the alien races involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Green-skinned humanoids with tremendous physiology, the Vitassi were evolving before the Earth was even cooled from its fiery beginnings.  They're advanced in almost every way, and the problem is, they know it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, while their elders evaluate the Earth to determine whether it's more suited to joining Galactic society or being carved into chunks and handed out to all the other alien races, the children of the Vitassi have made their own discovery about our planet...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...it's a LOT of fun!  The Vitassi children are among us, now, playing at being villains and/or heroes; anything, so long as the after party is epic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saving the planet just got  more difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meet the Vitassi, learn about their advanced society, their biology, and the Artificial Intelligence that makes their enlightened civilization possible!  Includes new Cyberware, new Martial Arts, new Equipment, and space ships!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
