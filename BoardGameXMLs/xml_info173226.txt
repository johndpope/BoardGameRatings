							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chardoom Swamp</name>
									
			<description>Designer's Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another foray into the swamp. This time the party will find themselves in the inhospitable region of the Chardoom Swamp. Once infested with lizardmen, they to have abandon their holy land. Chardoom has new tenants, ones the have made the swamp even more deadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally I was going to design this as a micro-hexcrawl. One of the unmarked islands is where Chambers Island would be located. And who knows I may populate another one of the islands down the line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chardoom Swamp is nasty because the environment is especially troublesome to the party and is really the biggest obstacle in the adventure. While the party will encounter big bad guys, it is the swamp that is relentless in its attack and will slowly drain the party of resources and life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chardoom Swamp was an isolated and sacred land of the lizardmen. The deadly waters, carnivorous plant life and dangerous creatures make Chardoom Swamp the most unhospitable area in the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Micro Adventure, published by Tim Shorts on his Patreon page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
