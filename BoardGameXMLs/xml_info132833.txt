			<description>Tales of VS. (pronounced as &amp;quot;Tales of Versus&amp;quot;) is crossover fighting game featuring various characters across the Tales video game series. It was developed by Matrix Software and published by Namco Bandai Games for the PlayStation Portable on August 6, 2009 in Japan. It was not localized for release in any other regions.&lt;br/&gt;Characters are able to carry out normal attacks as well as &amp;quot;Artes,&amp;quot; special techniques which have been utilized in almost every Tales game. Items appear on the playing field that also affect gameplay; food such as sushi may offer a temporary stat boost, while others, like a boomerang-blade, may offer a temporary means of attack. Battles can feature up to a total of four characters at a time, with an emphasis on two on two battles, although &amp;quot;free for all and one vs. two battles do occur as well&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_VS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_VS&lt;/a&gt;.],&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
