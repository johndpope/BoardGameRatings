			<description>Super Conflict: The Mideast is a Super NES turn-based video game where the player is a commissioned army officer and he has to command his troops to victory during a fictional Gulf War-like combat situation. The blue forces are armed with American weapons while the red forces are armed with Soviet-made weapons. As the game progresses the player is able to control air and naval units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Conflict is played on a hex map in which players try to capture the opponent's &amp;quot;Flag Tank&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Flag Ship&amp;quot;. The map consists of various terrain tiles with movement and defense modifiers. For example, bridges and deserts lower the defense ratings of occupying troops; hills and mountains provide additional defenses but require more fuel to move through. There are over 55 different scenarios and 16 two-player scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Conflict: The Mideast&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
