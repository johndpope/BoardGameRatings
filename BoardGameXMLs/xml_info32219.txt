							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Book of Mormon Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The Book of Mormon Card Game is an LDS variation on Go Fish. Cards are numbered 1-13, with each number representing a book from the Book of Mormon. (The books of Enos, Jarom, and Omni are combined onto one card.) There are also four suits, Beehives, Buffalo Skulls, Seagulls, and Wagon Wheels. Players ask others for the cards they need to complete the &amp;quot;Books&amp;quot; by asking either for the name of the prophet pictured on the card (for children) or by quoting a scripture on the card (for advanced players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules make note that this deck of cards is appropriate for other standard card games as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
