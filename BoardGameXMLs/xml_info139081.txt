			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tavern, according to some scholars is a place of business where people gather to drink alcoholic beverages and be served food, and in some cases, where travellers receive lodging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inn&amp;rsquo;s are basically taverns that specialise in lodgings, but also have facilities for drinking of beverages and food consumption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For many RPG&amp;rsquo;s it is also the starting place for their adventures. It is also a place to relax after slaying the dragon or simply somewhere to unwind after defending the village from vampires for the 5th time this month.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chances are, for whatever reason, your party is going to spend some time in one of these buildings.Almost every village has one. Towns have several. Cities normally have quite a few. They serve as gathering places, rumour mills and places of adventure. In some towns, they act as restaurants, social hubs or places to go for those who require people of a certain persuasion for daring deeds or nefarious tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And you as the GM have got to design all this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But worry not, that&amp;rsquo;s what this pack is for. Use as much or as little as you like to help you  in the design process. You may simply need a name, or stuck for how many floor there might be, or even just what does a swanky up-market tavern have on its menu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
