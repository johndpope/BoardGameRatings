			<description>A band of 12 poachers is sought out in Casablanca. Before they can be arrested, they succeed in escaping to the Rif and Atlas mountains. From there, their tracks lead to the south and the east of Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players in this game represent game wardens who try to follow the tracks of the poachers through Africa to their hiding place in order to arrest them, meeting many exotic animals along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, the players move their pawns on the spaces marked 1 to 36 and pick up the small tracking tiles, which show them, where the tracks of the poachers lead. Each player on his destination sheet draws in the tracks that he has uncovered. With each game, there is only one set of continuous tracks from the space marked 1 up to one of the hiding places (spaces A through K).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to follow this continuous set of tracks and discover which hiding place the poachers are using. A player that knows or believes he knows the correct hiding place can arrest poachers from that space. The winner is the player who arrests the most poachers from the correct hiding place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
