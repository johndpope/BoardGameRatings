			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to a new world... On the 21st of October 1852, the citizens of London and Paris were awed at the sight of the western sky turning suddenly a strange shade of purple andred. The first seismic shocks were felt all over the world in the following hours, and by the dawn of the 23rd of October, the giant waves hit the coasts of Europe. In the evening of the same day, while the tremors continued, catastrophic waves also hit the coasts of Asia. Whole cities, blasted by the earthquakes, were submerged by the sea. Millions of lives were lost. Then the Black Rain began, washing the ruins and leaving behind a thick layer of ashes. Dark, impenetrable clouds hid the sun, and the Thirty Years Winter began. In the Northern Hemisphere crops failed, snow-bound cities went up in flames as the populations rioted and the governments tried to find a solution, the means to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One hundred years have passed now since the Catastrophe, and humanity has survived. In the former colonial domains of Africa and South America. In the blasted plains of China. Among the remains of the Japanese archipelago. In Russian palaces sealed against the howling winds of the steppe. In the land that once was India. With sacrifice and ingenuity, with courage and hope, new nations have crawled back from the brink to claim the new world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Science is a beacon to the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the frozen wastes of Europe, where the mammoth roam, to the proud Zulu Nation of Africa, from the technological wonders of the Anglo-Indian Raj to the mist-shrouded shores of Lost America, these are the stories of a new, strange world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the Machine is a story set in the universe of &amp;ldquo;Hope &amp;amp; Glory&amp;rdquo;, a game setting developed for the Savage Worlds rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Hope &amp;amp; Glory&amp;rdquo; universe exists for the game and for the gamers, and attached to the novel there's a roundup of gaming information for those readers that would like to start playing straight away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
