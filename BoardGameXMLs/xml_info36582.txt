			<description>Draw a card and use your body to communicate your new affliction to the other players, if someone guesses the illness in a timely manner, the amount of points indicated on the card are awarded to both the infected person and the player who diagnoses it. Whoever correctly diagnoses an illness is the next player to get infected. Points are subtracted if a player passes up a card, however that player may pick a new card during the same turn. The game is over when all the cards have been played and the winner is the player with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
