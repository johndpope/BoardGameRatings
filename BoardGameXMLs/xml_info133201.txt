			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We the People is a role-playing game set during the War of Independence; the American Revolution. The two crucial differences between We the People and actual history is that while the original puritans were looking for religious freedom...the puritans, now Mysteritans, of We the People were looking for magickal freedom, and the American Revolution hides a war between two secret societies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much has been fictionalized for the sake of the setting, including the war between the Freemasons and the Illuminati and their depictions thereof. Some colony names have been changed. The circumstances surrounding the revolution have also been altered. Despite this, We The People remains faithful to the ideals that set a nation of people on a course for independence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to space considerations, much has been omitted and much has been given the briefest of examination. The American revolution is simply too large a topic to cover in so few pages, especially when there are new topics (ie magick) to address as well. You would do well, not only for the game, but for your own education to pick up a book on the subject to fill in the many blanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
