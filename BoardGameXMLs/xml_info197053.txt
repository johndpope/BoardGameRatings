							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Port City of Kak</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Port City of Kak! A jewel in the Duchy of Starryshade and near the disputed border of Pryston Realm. A mecca for traders and gamblers this city has something for everyone. While the city is under the control of the duke, Lord Fargo Mellathan is the sole voice of law in this city. The 8th Viscount yields to the duke on most issues but does not allow military units inside the city limits that are not controlled, or willing to be controlled by Fargo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traders abound the city limits with items and goods from the corners of the known world. The city is nestled in an easily defensible harbor and the viscount&amp;rsquo;s men protect the port area with large war engines from the bluff. All adventurers of any experience can find items of interest within the borders of Kak and even locate multiple types of transportation here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether the party wants to gamble hard earned gold at Ohmar Mylo&amp;rsquo;s gambling hall or needs to do research in the Hole of Manuals library, your PCs are sure to find a variety of interesting spots ripe for exploration in Kak. Many rumors can be heard, verified, or quashed along the cobblestone streets of this bustling port city. Flesh out the businesses or better yet, have your players tell you what they expect!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for the 5th Edition rules and used in the Filbar Duchy of Starryshade campaign. It is easily adaptable to any campaign or setting. Save yourself some time and utilize it for your own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
