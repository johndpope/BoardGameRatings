			<description>German card game. 31 cards. Each card has three types of train;&lt;br/&gt;Personenzug = Local train&lt;br/&gt;Eilzug = Fast train&lt;br/&gt;D - Zug = Very fast train&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Underneath each designation there is the name of a city which will have a railway station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays a little like Rummy in that you are trying to lay down sets of cities that are linked by one of the three train types. In other words, a train route.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First to play all their cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think this must have required seriously good knowledge of trains and their destinations. I mean, is it likely that someone living in Hamburg would know a local train route around Munich? Perhaps it was only aimed at keen railway fans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
