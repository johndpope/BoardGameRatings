							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Teamwork Feats</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each book in the Echelon Reference Series is written to be a complete reference for a single topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book focuses on Teamwork feats, feats that allow creatures to work together better than usual. From the PRD:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teamwork feats grant significant bonuses but only function under specific circumstances. In most cases, these feats require an ally with the same feat to have a specific position on the battlefield. Teamwork feats provide no bonus if the listed conditions are not met. Allies who are paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise unable to act do not count for the purposes of these feats. Inquisitors and cavaliers have special class abilities that allow them to use teamwork feats even when their allies do not have the feats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 47 feats in this book are all Teamwork feats that can allow your characters and their allies to work together in combat -- and in other areas! -- when they have like abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains feats from the PRD and from third-party publishers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
