							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Recyclers</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's Cooking Could Be YOU&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do you get when you mix a rundown retirement home, disappearing old folks, malevolent orderlies, too much meat on the menu and a mysterious, eccentric groundskeeper? We're not telling, but with a title like &amp;quot;The Recyclers,&amp;quot; it's bound to be bad. Before they get to the bottom of things, the characters will face extradimensional terrors, ruthless cultists and some of the most fearsome beef stroganoff the world has ever known. And that's before they get to the basement...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's Inside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Recyclers is a complete adventure for Horror Rules, the Simply Horrible RPG, a horror comedy game of ridiculous proportions. This 32pg supplement is packed with everything you need to play, including Bad Guys, Cast, backstory, artwork, maps, Plot Pushers and enough Sequel Suggestions and Plot Twists to turn it into five adventures instead of one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
