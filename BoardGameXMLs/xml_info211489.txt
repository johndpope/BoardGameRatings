			<description>Throughout this game you will have 2 roles. Dungeon Builder and Treasure Seeker. The ultimate goal: to take a piece of treasure from EVERY treasure room and then exit the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays in 3 phases of card drafting. &lt;br/&gt;Phase 1: Building the Dungeon&lt;br/&gt;Phase 2: Strengthening the Dungeon&lt;br/&gt;Phase 3: Running the Dungeon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through each Phase you will be building a dungeon, scavenging for items and backstabbing your fellow Heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player selects a character (The Warrior, Wizard, Ranger or Rogue), matching color treasure room tile and treasure chests then &lt;br/&gt;In each phase Players draw up cards, select one and place it face down in front of them. They then pass their remaining cards in their hand to the player on their left. They continue to do this until there are no cards left to choose from. Each turn following you will place cards to build the dungeon, trap your opponents or upgrade your character.​​&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has visited all four different colored treasure rooms, slayed the dragons and taken a piece of treasure, they must make their way back to the entrance to flee the dungeon.  The first player to do that is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will encounter Monsters, Magic, Treasures and an ever changing dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
