							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Akashic Nodes: The Home of Memory</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If knowledge is power, then the collective memory of all who passed before must be powerful indeed. Akashic Nodes: The Home of Memory is the first in the AEvolutions line of sourcebooks from Blue Devil Games, providing exciting, original material for Monte Cook's Arcana Evolved. &lt;br/&gt;Written by the Keepers of the Oath, a dedicated and talented enclave of AE scholars, this book explores the phenomenon of akashic nodes, locales where the concentration of memory is at its greatest. Each chapter presents a unique, fully-described node as a way of introducing new rules, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Citadel of the Wayhunters: A fallen sibeccai fort with detailed mechanics for expanding the concept of the node. Epicenters, aspects, lore, and echoes offer new ways to customize your nodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Academy of Visions: The ruins of a small community of akashics, magisters, and runethanes, this chapter explores the connection between nodes and magic, presenting new spells, runes, and magic items for characters and GMs alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Forgotten Graveyard: A mysterious resting place marked by bones of every shape and size and home to many strange creatures from the vicious akashic reavers to the mysterious mind giants known as the merro.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Burlboughs: A secluded area of the Harrowdeep, where the Green and the Dark wage a centuries-long battle for control. This chapter offers new rules for adapting nodes to aid characters of every class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Serpent's Heart Guildhall: An exhaustively described akashic guild with a dozen fully described NPCs and enough plot hooks to sustain an entire campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Fading of All Things&amp;quot;: A full-length adventure, in which the party races through the sands of the southern lands to undertake a node ritual and avert a war, all the while harried by a band of vallorians and their dreaded minions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
