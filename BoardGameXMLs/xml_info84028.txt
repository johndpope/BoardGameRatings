Managing your cards requires strategy, planning, resource consideration, sacrifice, and making the right card selection to replenish your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can choose to discard their cards to travel the game board and earn experience. They can use their cards to put together combination attacks against creatures in a quest to earn experience. The third option is to use cards to heal themselves when life gets too low. The game play is dynamic and competitive with other player disrupting plans and having plans of their own. You will need to manage your cards and maneuver your opponents to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal: The goal of each player is the have the highest experience total at the end of the game.
