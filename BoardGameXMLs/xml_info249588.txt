			<description>Cocktails is a fast-paced, push-your-lack, 2-player card game, taking place on a summer evening, having players sit comfortably by the pool, tasting delicious cocktails, as they take on a bizarre drinking challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's quite simple, just 54 cards with numbers between 1 and 12. Players draw cards from the pile and keep guessing if the next one will have a higher or lower number. Stopping just at the right time is crucial in order to get the right cocktails, thus get the most points. Each cocktail has its own value which combined with cards that act or score differently allows players to explore some interesting strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
