			<description>This is a game for ages 5 and up. The box contains a board, 4 wooden pawns, 1 die, 7 castle cards and 27 equipment cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows a tract around a robbers castle. The castle has 7 entrances. The castle cards are placed face down on these entrances. The castle cards are showing robbers, vermin or the treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 kinds of equipment cards : hats, keys and boats. The cards of the same kind have a similar look. The cards are placed next to the board, one stack per kind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a pawn and tries to get the treasure out of the castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you roll the die and move your pawn accordingly. An action takes place when your pawn ends on a special field. &lt;br/&gt;When your pawn lands on a boat field, you get a boat card. Landing on a hat field gives you a hat card and landing on a key field gives you a key card.&lt;br/&gt;When your pawn ends on a sleeping robber, you can roll a second time. A horse helps you move faster, if your pawn lands on a horse field you can move to a field of your choice.&lt;br/&gt;If you land on a fallen tree field, you have to skip one turn and landing on the bridge will cause you to lose all your equipment cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your pawn arrives on an already occupied field, you can take one equipment card of the player whose pawn was already on that field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your pawn can go to the castle if he lands on a pier. Therefor you have to hand in one of each of the three kinds of equipment cards. On your next turn your pawn can move on one of the 7 castle cards and turn it face up. If that castle card shows a spider, a ghost or a bat , you can turn the card face down again and move 1 field further. If the castle card shows a robber you have to start all over again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends as soon as a player has found the treasure card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
