			<description>From the publishers homepage:&lt;br/&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve got a new Enhanced Fiction short story called The Vladivostok Gauntlet out today, and it&amp;rsquo;s full of the goodness that makes Shadowrun unique and delicious. If you&amp;rsquo;re not reading this story, then you&amp;rsquo;re missing out on Russian mobsters, bloodthirsty killers, wolf shapeshifters, decadent nightclubs, and more. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to miss out on that, do you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve made the story available in all sorts of formats. First, you can just pick up the story itself as an Amazon single or on the Barnes and Noble store. The e-reader version doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the game stats, but that&amp;rsquo;s okay&amp;ndash;we&amp;rsquo;ve made those stats available as a free download, right here: The Vladivostok Gauntlet Game Stats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternately, you could buy the whole package from either the Battleshop or DriveThru, and get everything&amp;ndash;a Kindle version, an e-pub version, and a complete PDF with all the game stats. No matter which version you choose, you get new Shadowrun fiction for only $1.99! Here&amp;rsquo;s a full summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for the Breaking&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yuri Yehzov has been off the streets for a long while, surviving by following a few simple rules. Don&amp;rsquo;t stick your neck out. Don&amp;rsquo;t get involved in something that is none of your business. And above all, don&amp;rsquo;t piss off the ferocious mobsters of the Vory y Zakone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yuri doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much left from his shadowrunning days except his cyberears, but that&amp;rsquo;s enough to get him in trouble. When he hears something he cannot ignore, one by one his rules fall by the wayside until he has cold-blooded killers, vicious shapeshifters, and a ruthless Vory leader all after him. His gear is broken, his reflexes are shot, and he&amp;rsquo;s about to face the toughest opponents he&amp;rsquo;s ever been against. The streets have one more chance to claim his life&amp;mdash;and he has one more chance to break the rules, beat the odds, and find a way to stay alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vladivostok Gauntlet is a brand new Shadowrun short story. Read it and immerse yourself in the grit, grime, and dirty glory of the Sixth World!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
