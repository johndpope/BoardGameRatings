			<description>Globalization has been present in our society for thousands of years but its impacts appear in everyday life much more intensively due to the achievements of the &amp;ldquo;modern age&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Globality is a civilization game, in which you are in charge of your country gaining victory points by improving it. To make things more challenging the countdown of the last 60 minutes on the anarchy clock &amp;ndash; whose global impacts affect each player alike &amp;ndash; has already begun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Environmental pollution, corruption, exploitation, mafia connections, global conflicts and your &amp;ldquo;ecological footprint&amp;rdquo; equally increase anarchy. But who will benefit from the consequences of the anarchy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may as well be the most influential, but be careful! Do not go too far because your opponents may turn against you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
