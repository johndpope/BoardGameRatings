							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Judge Fool</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Judge Fool is a superhero adventure for the award-winning Savage Worlds roleplaying game, set on a colossal scale. It's a time-hopping cosmic Odyssey in the spirit of Jim Starlin and Grant Morrison, with maybe a little Moebius thrown in. Adam Warlock meets Doctor Who meets the Incal Light?  Something like that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lords of Dust and Silence are eating the future, chunk by bloody chunk.  Judge Fool has come from the One-Hundred-and-First Century on a desperate mission, looking for champions who might help him defeat them before they gobble up the universe in a frenzy of cosmic crapulence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Literally before.  The Lords move backward in time, touching our universe every two thousand years, growing more and more powerful each time they bite off another section of reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Judge Fool failed to stop them in the Eighty-First Century and the champions he found there all died (or worse.)  If he can fight them in the Sixty-First they might not be too powerful yet to defeat for once and for all, if he can find the right heroes.  The Forty-First Century was no good, so he has come to the Twenty-First, looking for help.  Can the PCs help him save tomorrow?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This giant-sized, 143 page adventure gives you:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Fourteen different battle maps, including the ultra-secret military base known as Camp Nowhere and the unspeakable Vaults of Znorph&lt;br/&gt;    Notes on four different future epochs, as well as the Lost Hyperboean Age of the distant past, when Grud the Barbarian walked the earth&lt;br/&gt;    Dozens of NPCs, including three supervillain teams of the far future, countless horrors from beyond time and space, an arch-villain from the 1960s, the terrible Knights of Nothing, a megalodon shark, all the mightiest heroes and villains of the Hyperborean Age (yes, Grud the Barbarian is one of them) and the universe's last and greatest heavy metal band.&lt;br/&gt;    Fifteen different fight scenes, with detailed notes on running each battle&lt;br/&gt;    Tons of extra options for the GM, including four seperate plot paths the PCs can take to the final battle at the end of time. &lt;br/&gt;    Our solemn word that your PCs will have the oportunity to punch a dinosaur in the face.  Seriously, we promise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
