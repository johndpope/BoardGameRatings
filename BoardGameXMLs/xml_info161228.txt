			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One Spot #3 presents a small shrine to a god of healing dedicated to helping the poor people of town, complete with a mysterious priest (Dolothar) with his helpers, building map, images, and more. One Spot #3: Dolothar's Shrine is another great tool to include in your bag of GM tricks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One Spot #3: Dolothar's Shrine offers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An introduction, location description, shrine map, and images of the signs above the doors.&lt;br/&gt;     A bit of background on Dolothar himself, his mannerisms, and a picture.&lt;br/&gt;     Descriptions for the other NPCs involved in operating the store, including his second-in-command Silea Anez, three sisters stopped here on their pilgrimage, and more.&lt;br/&gt;     A suggestion of how the shrine operates, what services are offered, and more.&lt;br/&gt;     A list of hooks (4 tables of hints) for how one or more of the PCs may have interacted with the shrine previously.&lt;br/&gt;     Plus tables for needed medical supplies, sermon topics, diners, patients, and topics of conversation heard during meals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the latest in a series of short (2-5 page), system-neutral supplements from Moebius Adventures designed to provide easy locations to drop into your fantasy campaign, complete with hooks, NPCs, and a few surprises. Dolothar's Shrine is also the first One Spot product to include both a portrait-aligned document and a landscape-aligned document, both with additional pages of detail. Previous One Spot products have had only 2 pages. This one includes 5! Both versions are included in the zip file.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Moebius Adventures One Spot product is designed to be easily inserted into your GM folder with two pages containing:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Player-ready information, including: a location description providing details on what and who to expect, along with an image or two to help set the scene.&lt;br/&gt;     GM-ready information, including: NPC details, location map, encounter/hook ideas, and a random table to help determine any prior relationship with the place a PC may have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each location can then be used independently or together to help you fill a temporary gap or add details to your worlds without a ton of work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick a spot, drop it in, and roll!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
