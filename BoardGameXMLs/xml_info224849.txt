			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Axioms is Autarch's quarterly supplement for the Adventurer Conqueror King System. Each issue of Axioms offers a mix of short content updates for ACKS, such as new classes, new sub-mechanical systems, explorations of specific themes within the game, short adventure scenarios, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this, our third issue, he who has the gold makes the rules... This is a special double-size issue of Axioms that takes a deep dive into issues of domains, trade, and economics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strongholds and Domains: A revised approach to domains for faster, easier play&lt;br/&gt;    Separating Land and Lordship: Rules for domains of governors and landowners &lt;br/&gt;    Senatus Consultum Ultimum: When the Senate speakers, the ruler must listen!&lt;br/&gt;    Wandering into War: A system of domain encounters to keep rulers on their guard &lt;br/&gt;    Of Coins and Commerce: Comments and context on the economy of the Adventurer Conqueror King System&lt;br/&gt;    The Economics of Peasant Families: What Does life hold for those who till the land?&lt;br/&gt;    Flocks and Herds and Silver and Gold: Calculating the returns from livestock in ACKS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While designed for use with ACKS, content in Axioms is compatible with any d20-based fantasy RPG built on the OGL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Axioms is made possible through the support of our patrons, who receive early access to the articles on a month-by-month basis.
