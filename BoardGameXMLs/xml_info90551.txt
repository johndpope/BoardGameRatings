			<description>Devil Kings, known in Japan as Sengoku Basara (戦国BASARA), is a 2005 video game for PlayStation 2, developed and released by Capcom. The original game's theme song is &amp;quot;Crosswise&amp;quot; by T.M.Revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was followed by several sequels and an anime series, all of them using the original title and setting of Sengoku Basara only&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sengoku Basara takes place during the Sengoku period, or Warring States Era, during which Japan was split into many minor states battling over power and land. The game features two historical warlords as the main characters: Sanada Yukimura and Date Masamune.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Devil Kings' main character is the Devil King (Oda Nobunaga in Sengoku Basara).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a crowd fighting game, similar in concept to the Dynasty Warriors/Samurai Warriors series by Koei.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some significant gameplay changes were made to the Western versions of the game. Several of the characters were made non-playable and various weapons were removed or added. The difficulty levels were shifted to make the game more difficult (with Easy becoming the Japanese Normal and Normal becoming Japanese Hard). The fighting system was also modified, adding an element called &amp;quot;Priming&amp;quot; (one of the characters special attack was made the priming attack, and used that attack to &amp;quot;Prime&amp;quot; enemies making them more susceptible to damage and allowing for higher combo chains).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Devil Kings,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
