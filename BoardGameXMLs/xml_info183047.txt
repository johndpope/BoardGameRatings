			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An easy card &amp;amp; board &amp;amp; drinking game with many mini games, simple rules and cruel skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player draws a card at their turn. There are 3 types of cards in the deck: a mini-game, a skill and a rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     If you draw a mini-game, you are going to play the game that is displayed on the card. Mini games are super easy to play and very exciting.&lt;br/&gt;     If you draw a skill, you can use it anytime you want. Items are powerful abilities that can be used to attack your enemy.&lt;br/&gt;     If you draw a rule, from now on, everyone must obey this rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every time you lose a mini-game, disobey a rule or get hurt by a skill, you have to move your pawn on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player that reaches the exit first, has to drink the King's s shot. This is a mix of different drinks in one glass. Cards in the deck decide when &amp;amp; who is allowed to create this disgusting cocktail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
