			<description>There once was a Dragon that had no interest in pillage and plunder. While all of the bigger, meaner Dragons would pick on him, he just wanted to follow his passion&amp;hellip; for Cooking!  So he opened his very own Tavern! Then it struck him, &amp;ldquo;With the help of some Heroes&amp;rdquo; he thought, &amp;ldquo;I could defeat those Dragon bullies once and for all!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt; Build and run your very own fantasy Tavern! Cook amazing recipes and collect Heroes from across the land to Quest for you, hunting down villainous monsters and bringing back new ingredients, fantastic trophies, and rare decorations for your Tavern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
