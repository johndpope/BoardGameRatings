			<description>Each sheet of a pad shows a 15X15 grid in which some square have been blacked out. The location of the black squares differs from grid to grid. Players take turns marking non-black squares, with the objective to get three in a row diagonally or orthogonally and thereby scoring three points. Subsequently adding a square to the row means scoring the entire row again. play until all the squares are filled in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
