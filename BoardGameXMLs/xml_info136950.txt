			<description>Explore the galaxy! Avoid Space Pirates! Move through Worm Holes! Watch out for Asteroids! Oh, and while you're at it, trade for resources and deliver them to the planets that need them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Player is an independent space merchant captain jetting around the galaxy trying to collect resources to fill orders. There are 6 planets that need different resources, but each planet only sells one resource. Fill orders to make money and earn victory points. Once an order is filled, the planet has a new order. Earn additional victory points by exploring the board, but beware! The Galaxy is full of asteroids, worm holes and pirates that can will stand in your way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hex board is set up randomly for each game, so exploring the board is part of the fun! No two games will play quite the same. Who is the best space explorer and merchant captain?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
