			<description>Corporate Shadows by Mike Haverty is a Two or Four Player action based card game where players manipulate corporate assets and initiate covert operations against opposing criminal organizations. Support from one of the two major solar system wide governments, research and military actions bolster the players' stance and eventual outcome of the shadowy maneuvers between the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is based on the Action Rummy Concept with the use of Oversight Cards allowing the player to score points during a Hand at the risk of bringing down the High Court on the player (Player scores no points) if too many are played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may also play Alliance cards to form temporary teams during the course of a hand in order to score points jointly with that Alliance member.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corporate Asset Cards are collected by the players during each hand in order to score points.  The game is played to 150 Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
