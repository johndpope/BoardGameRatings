							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Approved Little League Baseball Game</name>
									
			<description>This game consists of a gameboard with a baseball field on it, and a spinner in the centerfield corner of the board.  There are also four baseball players used to represent the batter and any runners.  The spinner points you to several tables located around the edge of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who is the pitcher spins the spinner to determine what kind of pitch will be thrown (fast ball, slow ball, curve ball or knuckle ball).  The batter then decides whether or not he wants to &amp;quot;take&amp;quot; the pitch, or make a swing at it.  If he takes the pitch, the result can be either a ball or a strike, though the pitcher could also incur a passed ball, wild pitch, balk, or a hit batter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the batter swings at the pitch, he spins the spinner to get a numerical result, and reads the result based upon the pitch thrown.  This result could be either a strike, a ball, a foul, a hit to the infield, or a hit to the outfield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the result is a hit, the batter spins the spinner again and reads the result on the appropriate infield hit or outfield hit chart, with the result being some type of base hit or out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With runners on base, the batter can also announce to attempt a stolen base or a sacrifice.  In this case he, surprise!, spins the spinner and reads from the appropriate chart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continue this way, playing nine innings of regulation baseball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
