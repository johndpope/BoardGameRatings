							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spirit Realms: Tengoku-SR</name>
									
			<description>Spirit Realms: Tengoku-SR is a 2-4 player army fort builder card game that revolves around a retelling of the gods as animal warrior spirits called Spirit Masters. Each warrior is Ruler of 1 of the 9 realms in the world of Tengoku, SR Prime being the first realm. Each realm is represented by a Spirit Master who comes with his own deck of power, each deck with it's own strengths and weakness. Some decks are magic based, with tech elements some are Mental based with Earth elements while some decks are defensive and others are passive. You can choose which characters and deck(s) represent your goals and personal strategy, and play them as stand alones or combine them with other decks to create your own unique decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must protect their throne by defending their forts from being destroyed while attempting to capture their opponent's Throne. Players get to build forts and barriers while using minions to build armies, while learning basic gameplay players are able to invent unique strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
