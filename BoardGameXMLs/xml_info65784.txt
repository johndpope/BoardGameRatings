			<description>&amp;quot;The Big Fight for Little Round Top. Fast and Easy Rules for Replaying Part of the Battle of Gettysburg.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Confederate attack on Devil's Den and Little Round Top was the subject of considerable controversy. It began late in the day and was marked by confusion and a general lack of coordination. The terrain was partly responsible for this.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Oates' 15th Alabama was given the difficult task of assaulting up the hill. They ran into Chamberlain's 20th Maine, which was defending the far left flank of the Union army. Several charges were turned back. Finally, with his men low on ammunition, Chamberlain ordered a bayonet charge, which finished off the weary confederates.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a miniatures wargame intended for classroom use (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale miniatures. Aspects covered in the rules include infantry formations, sharpshooters, protective cover, commanders, charges, and morale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
