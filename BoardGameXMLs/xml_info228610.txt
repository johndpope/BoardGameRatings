It is  basically a race with pitfalls and shortcuts similar to Snakes and Ladders but consisting of 106 spaces in a spiral leading to the center of the board.

On her way to Hollywood, Polly receives a proposal from her leading man, becomes engaged to Marmalade Mustard, visits Paris for frocks, stars in several movies, marries old school boyfriend, Mickey Milkweed, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
