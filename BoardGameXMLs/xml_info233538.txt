			<description>Sute Sute Marketing is a game about collecting items like erasers, milk caps  or calendars and becoming the top collector of that items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your turn you draw 2 cards and have to discard 1 card. Discarded cards are grouped together with other cards of the same number. When the stack runs out the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;The cards you keep in your hand will determine if you are the top collector. If you have for example the most milk cap cards at the end of the game you are the top collector and get the discarded milk cap. The 2nd collector, the one who collected second most milk caps will get the hand cards of the top collector as points.&lt;br/&gt;Whoever has the most points (cards) is the winner of the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
