							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wuffle Tree</name>
									
			<description>Wuffle Tree is played by two, three, or four players.  Each player begins by randomly selecting Wuffles, which are forty-eight cardboard discs in four colors and numbered one through eight.  The game board depicts a tree with thirty-two holes for the Wuffles to fit into, each with a number value next to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with someone saying &amp;quot;Go,&amp;quot; and all the players simultaneously try to fill as many holes in the tree as possible with Wuffles of their own color.  The numbers on the Wuffles must match the number value of each hole in the tree.  When all the holes are filled, players tally how many Wuffles each has left, and begin another round.  After seven rounds, whoever has the lowest score wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
