			<description>Doolhof (translated 'Maze' or 'Labyrinth') is a game in the public domain which comes with some of the game collection boxes. The board is a maze with arrows and hedges. You throw with a die to move your pawn over the board. When you hit a hedge or side of the board, an arrow shows you which direction you have to move next. When your pawn stops on an arrow which is not near a hedge, you have to move that given direction your next turn, resulting in a move backwards. When two pawns are on the same field, the latest pawn has to restart. The winner is the person who reaches the finish first, which sometimes can take a long time. A nice thing about this game is that almost all boards have a different maze pattern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
