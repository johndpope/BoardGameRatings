			<description>In Downtown, you and your opponent are real-estate tycoons bidding for property in the city&amp;rsquo;s bustling, prosperous business district.   From a standard deck of cards, one player takes the red cards and the other the black cards.  Each card represents a check used to invest in an intersection; when a city block is surrounded, whichever player has invested the most in the surrounding intersections claims ownership in it.  Bonuses are awarded for gaining ownership of buildings near public buildings, or ownership of buildings in specified patterns.  Highest real estate value wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was published in the February 2001 issue of GAMES magazine and features a custom city board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
