							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legacy: Life Among the Ruins</name>
									
			<description>Author description&lt;br/&gt;Legacy: Life Among the Ruins is a tabletop roleplaying game about the survivors of a reality-twisting apocalypse, the families they form, and the new world they will create as the ages turn. Each generation, new threats and opportunities will emerge, and a hero will rise from each family to deal with them. Legacy takes inspiration from the post-apocalyptic wastelands of Fallout, S.T.A.L.K.E.R., A Canticle for Leibowitz and Mad Max, as well as the epoch-spanning gameplay of Civilisation and other 4X games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legacy is powered by the Apocalypse Engine, as used in Apocalypse World, Monsterhearts, Dungeon World and more. It offers quick character creation, simple and intuitive rules, and a range of character archetypes to choose from. Legacy builds on other Apocalypse Engine games by using a dual-playbook structure - each player controls both a Family and a Character from that family, and has abilities that function on both the personal and national scales. Your Character grows as they explore the world and deal with crises, while the passing of ages gives opportunities for your Family to change and expand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
