							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ranger Commandos</name>
									
			<description>Rangers are United States Commandos especially trained for damaging raids on enemy bases and installations. These raids have as their objective the destruction of important docks, munitions plants, power stations, shipping etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Usually their mission is accomplished during the night and at dawn the Commandos return to their own bases. The game follows very closely the usual method of these raids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
