							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Perfect Crime</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Perfect Crime is a story roleplaying game about criminals on the eve of the perfect crime. Inspired by authors like Philip K. Dick, the game explores the tension of trying to do the impossible. In just 24 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters have been over the details so many times. They could recite them in their sleep. But on the eve of the most brilliantly conceived plan, the perfect crime, a miraculous and cryptic vision into tomorrow has shown the job will end in catastrophic failure, and take down most of the team with it. What will happen in the next 24 hours, and can it be prevented?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players.&lt;br/&gt;The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
