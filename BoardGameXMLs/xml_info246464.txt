			<description>Cliques is the quick, fun card game in which you try to be the first to get rid of all your cards by collecting, and playing, same color groups of cute, quirky characters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How To Play&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the deck and deal all players 10 cards. Set the remaining deck face down, which shall have a single discard pile beside it. The player left of the dealer takes the first turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For every turn, the player shall draw 1 card (from the deck or the discard pile), and conclude it by discarding 1 card. Prior to discard, the player may set down 3 cards of the same color, face-up on the playing surface, as a &amp;quot;clique.&amp;quot; Any player may also add 2 more cards of the same color to any clique of 3 to increase it to 5. Cliques may only ever be a total of 3 or 5 cards. Only 1 clique of each color is permitted. Any number of cliques may be created, or added to, during a turn. Play moves clockwise. Ninjas can join any clique to finish it. Zombies are played singularly on any clique to eat it, remove it from play and send 1 card of that clique into the hand of the opponent of the player's choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When any player discards all cards, or the game deck is exhausted, the hand is over. Players score 1 point for each card they still hold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the least points, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
