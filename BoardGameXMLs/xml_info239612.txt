							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Clockwork Ley-Line: Daybreak of Remnants Shadow</name>
									
			<description>Developer Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a mysterious school where day and night are two separate worlds, a mismatched trio work to resolve magic-related incidents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our protagonist is a newly enrolled first-year student at a boarding school with a notably large clock tower located deep in the mountains. Unfortunately, on his first day of school, he gets caught up in some sudden trouble and accidentally breaks an expensive-looking statue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to compensate for the broken statue, the principal orders him and the boy who caused the incident to work for the school&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Bureau for the Investigation of Special Affairs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When they arrive at the Bureau&amp;rsquo;s headquarters, a room situated in the school&amp;rsquo;s enormous underground library, a girl is waiting for them there with an apathetic look on her face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The girl informs the confused pair of the situation: Magic exists in this school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the clock tower chimes, the &amp;ldquo;Realm of Night&amp;rdquo; appears, and merges with the school building. The Bureau&amp;rsquo;s job is to take care of the supernatural problems that arise. And so, our protagonist struggles to protect the school from troublesome magical items known as &amp;ldquo;Mists&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
