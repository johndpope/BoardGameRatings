			<description>Willi the Word Whale plunges the players into the depths of the sea and bring his word friend the octopus with him to blow letters.  Unfortunately he has forgotten the vowels. Can you allocate the appropriate vowels so that meaningful words arise?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: The 36 cards are dealt to the players, the players divide the cards into two stacks - backside up. The first player reveals the two cards simultaneously and place them on the middle of the table -the players then try to form words from the letters on the card by inserting vowels. The first to form a word wins a card. If one of the cards shows a golden ring the players try to be first to shout &amp;quot;Ahoy&amp;quot;, the next time a golden ring card is revealed you should shout Ehoy!, then Ihoy!, then Ohoy! and then Uhoy! When all cards are revealed and distributed, the game is over. The player with the most cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
