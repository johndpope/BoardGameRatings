							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rocket Squad</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rocket Squad is a story roleplaying game about the 7th Empire&amp;rsquo;s War to gain control of the skies. The final days of freedom lay before us. The previous commanders were so focused on the ground assault that no one thought to look to the heavens. Big mistake. Characters are the elite commandos of the Rocket Squad, tasked with defending the Earth from an endless series of raids. Lord Belafor&amp;rsquo;s marauding airships seem to be everywhere, giving you little time to prepare for the next wave of attacks. Does the Squad have what it takes for one last jetpack assault against Lord Belafor&amp;rsquo;s flagship?&lt;br/&gt;Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
