			<description>Players compete against each other the other each playing one of five clans of the PSI Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this strategic boardgame is to enslave at least 2 other Psi Clan Lords or control 16 planets throughout the universe's 5 dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Clan begins with owning 10 planets in their own dimension. Each planet begins with no defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player collect up to 5 cards each turn and use these to either attack or defend planets in any 5 dimensions. Each attack will cost the player stimuli which can be gained each turn depending on the number of cards that is taken that turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By basically taking control of enemy planets, player can force enemy players onto a planet where they can no longer escape from. When this happens, the enemy player will become enslaved and must now work together with the attacking player. This is a great feature which prevents players who would normally have lost from being bored while waiting for the game to end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a 5 piece circular board so that the position of the 5 clans can be changed each game. Each player also has a cool stand to place their circular game cards in, and there's a handy little device from which players can slide out new game cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Van der Veer Games has a playable flash demo on their website and have also just launched an online multi-player version based on the boardgame.
