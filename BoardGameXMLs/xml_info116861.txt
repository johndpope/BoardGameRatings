			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Florence, 1559: a city of opportunities for men who have the guts to pursue them. Here, struggling artists find rich patrons, visionary architects create their dreams, ruthless mercenaries get lucrative contracts, and shrewd merchants become as powerful as kings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever since the times of Cosimo the Elder, the bankers, the Medici, have ruled this city. Sure, way back then it was still called a democracy, but the art, the armies and the votes were all paid with Medici money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon the assassination of Duke Alessandro twenty-two years ago, the merchants and lords of the city enthusiastically welcomed young Cosimo I de' Medici. The nobles saw him as inexperienced, weak, and an easy puppet to manipulate. They couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been more wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Giulia Barbano and Renato Ramonda of the Janus Design collective, this playset is perfect for all your Renaissance-era comedy needs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
