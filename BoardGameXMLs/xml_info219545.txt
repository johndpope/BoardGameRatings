							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido: Special Attack &amp; Defence Cards</name>
									
			<description>These play aids not only enable players to add a bluffing element to their Melee Exchanges, but also serve as reference for any Special Attack or Defence attempted. There are 17 cards in this card pack, one for each of the Special Attacks and Defences, one Unique Special Attack or Defence card and one Bluff card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can replace verbally declaring the use of Special Attacks or Defences by instead placing the relevant card in front of them, then flipping the card to reveal any attempted after the dice have been rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
