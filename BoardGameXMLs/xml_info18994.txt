							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Skittle Pool</name>
									
			<description>Skittle Pool is similar to &amp;ldquo;Skittle Bowl&amp;rdquo;, however the pins have been replaced by nine 2&amp;quot; billiard balls. The table is approx. 24 inches square with 3 pockets each on the left and right sides. At the bottom of the board is a pendulum device that acts as the striker. The cue ball is placed in a special pivot foot and that foot is rotated to aim the cue ball at a target ball. The striker, a ball similar in size to the cue, is lifted and released (or gently thrown) to strike against the pivot foot which in turn transfers the energy to the cue ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most billiard type games can be played on the table. A scoring rack (wire with plastic scoring chips) is included in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was most notable for its promotion by American actor Don Adams who was well known for his role as a bumbling secret agent in &amp;ldquo;Get Smart&amp;rdquo; on 1960&amp;rsquo;s television.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
