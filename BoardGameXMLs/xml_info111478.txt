			<description>&lt;br/&gt;     * From Wargamedownloads.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The place is New York,&lt;br/&gt;the year is unknown,&lt;br/&gt;the future is unwritten...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hiding in his secret headquarters, the President is calling the survivors of the nuclear holocaust to join him in New York and rebuild the Land of the Free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an age when anarchy is rampant and danger lurks everywhere, the competition among the various militias in the President&amp;rsquo;s service is fierce to install a new millennium of order and civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of those gangs will contribute to writing a new American legend and protect their land from the rising Neo Soviet peril others will serve their own ambition and risk the President's disfavor and possible banishment. A sentence that means a very likely death at the hands of the mobs of brutal outcasts, filthy mutants or alien slavers awaiting them beyond the boundaries of the city in the lethal Rad Wastes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab a weapon and gather your gang &amp;ndash; as whether you choose your destiny or allow it to be imposed upon you, it is a belief well worth fighting for!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutron York 3000 is a post-apoc skirmish game brought to you by the Golgo Island Studios and supported by a range of 28mm miniatures by East Riding Miniatures. It features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Alternate activation. Move one figure, then your opponent does the same.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Simple no-chart, no-math combat mechanics. Just roll some D6s and&lt;br/&gt;immediately read the result.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A campaign and experience system. Take your gangers from Rookie to&lt;br/&gt;Legend status, and fit them with the best weapons available.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Scenario-building tools. Use them to make your own scenarios, or use&lt;br/&gt;the ready-made samples provided.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A point system that comes with a complete Character/Force builder.&lt;br/&gt;Join one of the 8 factions described or design your own, be it for a&lt;br/&gt;campaign or one-off games.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Plenty of extra rules.
