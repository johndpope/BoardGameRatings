			<description>Strike Gunner S.T.G. (エス・ティー・ジー) is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up video game originally released on the arcades in 1991 by Athena, and Tecmo then later ported for the Super Nintendo. The player takes control of a high-tech jet, the &amp;quot;Strike Gunner&amp;quot; of the title, and faces wave after wave of enemies, ranging from helicopters, jets, tanks and airships, among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player goes through various levels and stages, usually based around certain environmental elements such as snow or desert, and faces numerous types of enemies. The levels feature wave after wave of normal enemies ranging from helicopters to turrets that usually only require one or two hits to destroy. At various points in each level, the player faces a boss vehicle, such as a giant airship or an enormous desert tank. At certain points, a stealth bomber (or in later levels, a space shuttle or capsule) will appear to airdrop the player laser power-ups, recharge special weapons, or give a speed boost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the Strike Gunner, the player is armed with a dual red laser weapon that can be upgraded several times to a more powerful blue laser. In addition to this weapon, the player chooses a second, more powerful &amp;quot;special weapon&amp;quot; with a limited charge before they begin the mission. There are 15 advanced weapons to pick from such as the devastating MegaBeam Cannon or AntiAir Mines (see below for a complete list). This allows for a strategic approach to the game because certain weapons are more effective on certain missions. The &amp;quot;special weapon&amp;quot; has various limitations, depending on which one is being used; for example, the MegaBeam Cannon is extremely powerful, but only lasts less five seconds and can only be used once per charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game supports two players as well, with two Strike Gunners (Player 1 is Jane, red, and Player 2 is Mark, blue) facing the same missions as single player. This adds another layer of strategy to the game because each player can choose their own &amp;quot;special weapons&amp;quot; and utilize a deadly combination of timed special attacks. Players can link their aircraft in two different ways by pressing the X or Y button.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Strike Gunner S.T.G.&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
