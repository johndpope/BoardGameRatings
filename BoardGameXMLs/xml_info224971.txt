			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a series of three adventures set near a mid-sized city or town located on in forested hills near a frontier or wilderness areal. It is designed for a party of 4 characters of first level whom should gain two to three levels by the completion of the story arc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story covers the player characters discoveries and disruptions of the machinations of a mysterious person lurking in the background, manipulating people and events like a dark puppet master. Eventually the players will finally face this adversary only to discover that he too is merely a pawn of something even more sinister and deadly that left unchecked, could threaten the peace and stability of the entire region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
