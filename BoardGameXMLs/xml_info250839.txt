			<description>A Cugel-Level Scenario&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since your last adventure you have ranged the lands seeking wealth and ease. Occasionally you have found such but never retained it. Some weeks ago you ended up in Azenomei and took a small suite of rooms in a rundown and unoccupied manse. The folk in these parts are uncommonly civilized, and apart from the local Constables calling weekly to collect their &amp;lsquo;purely voluntary&amp;rsquo; donation to their Benevolent Fund, none have bothered you for this residential situation. However, now your funds are running dangerously low, and the threat of honest labor looms uncomfortably large in your immediate futures.  Understandably you are disconsolate, and desperately trying to come up with some scheme to gain the maximum reward for the minimum effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
