			<description>Dollar Bill Poker - An inset on the box lid shows Tony Randall and Jack Klugman endorsing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dollar Bill Poker (a game of bluff and challenge) is similar to &amp;quot;Liar's Dice&amp;quot; using a special deck of numbered cards instead of dice.  There are six cards of each number 1 through 6 and six &amp;quot;Wild Cards&amp;quot;.   Everyone (from two to six players) starts with a handful of dime-sized cardboard discs, each of their own color.  A special green playing mat is placed in the center of the playing area.  It contains places for cards and a grid for the betting discs.  The dealer deals out a predetermined number of cards depending on the number of players, and each player lays three cards in the &amp;quot;Down&amp;quot; space in front of him on the game mat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player will add a card to their &amp;quot;Down&amp;quot; stack and place a bid of at least two of any number one through six by putting a disc on the grid  in the proper row and column to indicate their bid.  In turn around the board, each player must make a higher bid or challenge the bid just made.  The bids reflect the combined total number of cards in everyone's &amp;quot;Down&amp;quot;  stack having the same number on the card as the bid  (including &amp;quot;Wild Cards&amp;quot;).   For example: a bid of 4 fives, means that a player thinks there are at least 4 cards containing the number five (or &amp;quot;wild&amp;quot;) in the collective total of everyone's &amp;quot;Down&amp;quot; stack.  Players may bluff in their bidding in an effort to outwit the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a challenge occurs, the other players (in turn) get to place a higher bid or allow the challenging player go through with the challenge.  If no higher bids are placed, the cards from everyone's &amp;quot;Down&amp;quot; stack are revealed to see if the bid was successful or not.  Standard poker chips are used to keep score.  The winner is the player with the most chips after the predetermined number of rounds have been played or some other end-game condition occurs.  (The rules are inconclusive on how to end the game, but a predetermined number of rounds seems to be the direction intended by the game designers.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
