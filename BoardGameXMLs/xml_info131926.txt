			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the aging lower merchant class neighborhood of Cobbler&amp;rsquo;s End, the Church of the Hero is asking for donations. And they&amp;rsquo;re getting them at an alarming rate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Priests of the Church ask, and all of the older people of Cobbler&amp;rsquo;s End are turning out their pockets and purses, scratching together ever last mouse they can find. Grown children have found the dead changed wills and at least one couple has leased their teenage grandchildren in service to the Church. (This is technically legal, but generally frowned upon.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is there any truth to their claims that they can contact the dead for the sake of the living?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meddling, while legal, is very likely to draw the attention Priest Hunters, and what is a small series of questionable activity could turn into full scale turf warfare in the blink of the eye. And the casualties may be those who have already lost the most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
