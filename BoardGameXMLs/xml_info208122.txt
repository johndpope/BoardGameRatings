							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mistborn: The Siege of Luthadel</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Elend felt the ash dust his face and clothing, but he ignored it. In the distance, the bloody red sun was close to setting. It backlit the army that had come to take Elend's kingdom from him...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fall of the Lord Ruler is not the end for the Houses of Luthadel. Rather, it is the beginning of a whole new world, where fancy balls and courtly intrigue give way to wars of kings, social upheaval, and political strife. Amid the chaos, strange new beings rise at the fringes of society &amp;mdash; hordes of rampaging koloss, eerie mist-spirits, and strange shape-shifting kandra... threatening the whole of civilization!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much like Mistborn: House War follows the narrative of the first Mistborn novel, The Final Empire, The Siege of Luthadel details the trials and tribulations faced by the nobility during the events of Mistborn: The Well of Ascension. The players are leaders of the Houses left standing following the Final Empire&amp;rsquo;s collapse, and they must navigate the perils of dangerous new times. Their negotiations continue, but now there is another balance of power to consider...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement&amp;rsquo;s major addition is the Siege, which divides players into two &amp;ldquo;teams:&amp;rdquo; one consisting of the Houses besieging Luthadel, and the other consisting of those defending it. The progress of the siege is represented on the Siege Track, a sideboard that imparts benefits to those on one side of the walls and new challenges to those on the other. Conditions on the Siege Track change regularly through the game, as certain Problems are solved or erupt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your choice of sides also changes how you&amp;rsquo;re affected by various Problems: whether you can take control of the koloss or the Skaa Assembly, for example, and how ready certain Personalities are to cooperate with you. Houses can change loyalties throughout the game as they maneuver for the greatest advantage, and this adds a whole new layer of intrigue and politicking to the Mistborn: House War!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay remains the same as in the core game, with players collaborating to solve Problems, gain Favor, and control (or manipulate) Unrest. When this expansion is used, the game ends when the Battle for Luthadel Problem card is solved or erupts, or when Unrest reaches 8, but there&amp;rsquo;s an additional twist! Only the highest or lowest score from the winning &amp;ldquo;team&amp;rdquo; can win the game. This gives players a reason to cooperate and collaborate, in addition to just &amp;ldquo;being on the right side of history&amp;rdquo; as the game comes to a close.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Siege of Luthadel will also include revised and updated Problem and Personality decks, along with new House sheets to represent the thrilling events and storyline of The Well of Ascension. Now players can...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    ...face and solve issues like Spirits in the Mist, Koloss at the Walls, and Chaos in the Assembly.&lt;br/&gt;    ...employ Personalities like Spies, Oracles, and even named characters from the second Mistborn novel!&lt;br/&gt;    ...command the power of Houses Cett or Penrod, or new forms of old Houses like Lekal or Venture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These new decks and Houses are designed to be easily swapped in and out with those in Mistborn: House War but for a true-to-the-novel experience you can play them right out of the box. The ways and effects of mixing and matching to make your own perfect story is one of the team&amp;rsquo;s primary focuses as the design comes together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
