			<description>Remainder includes marbles of six different colors (Red, Yellow, Blue, Green, White, and optional Black) placed on a wooden board having spaced configured to receive the marbles.  The board is separated into four quadrants at the corners of the board.  Each quadrant includes 16 spaces, where the Red, Yellow, Blue, and Green marbles are placed; 16 marbles of a single color at each quadrant.  Three white marbles are placed between neighboring quadrants to provide a bridge from one quadrant to its neighbors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move their marbles based on a roll of a die.  As the marbles move, they can be used to capture other player's marbles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the game is to eliminate an opposing player's marbles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer describes the game as follows on Kickstarter.com:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;-  The object of the game is to be the last player remaining on the board. You eliminate other players by capturing their marbles. &lt;br/&gt;-  Gameplay is turn-based much like Checkers or Spades, and is played by 2 or 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;-  Movement is determine by the roll of a die. Movement restrictions are explained in detail in the instruction manual.&lt;br/&gt;-  White marbles are placed on bridges that link movement from one quadrant of the board to another.&lt;br/&gt;-  Landing on white marbles has positive consequences.&lt;br/&gt;-  Black marbles are included for an optional gameplay variation, explained in the instruction manual. Landing on black marbles has negative consequences.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
