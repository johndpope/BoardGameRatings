			<description>Dang, look, it's Gunhouse!! It's a video game where you:&lt;br/&gt;1) do puzzle stuff in a weird tiny grid to:&lt;br/&gt;2) add guns to your house so:&lt;br/&gt;3) you can shoot at the enemy invaders that want to steal your orphan children!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the initial release on PlayStation Mobile (Vita) back in 2014, we've added loads of stuff, like more enemies, more stages, a hardcore mode, higher res graphics, more story, rotating objectives, stats tracking (offline), and a whole lot more! We also rebalanced the game, improved the tutorial, added a help section and a did bunch of other stuff we probably forgot! Some super dedicated people have played this game for dozens of hours, so we wanted to make sure they had lots to do! Here's some stuff about who made it! Our unique art style is courtesy of Juan Ramirez, we&amp;rsquo;ve got music by Fez and Hyper Light Drifter composer Disasterpeace, code and some design work by Jim Crawford (he made Frog Fractions), and it's directed and designed by Brandon Sheffield (Oh, Deer!, Sine Mora EX). It's a game!~&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History&lt;br/&gt;This game sure does have a weird history. It began life as a jam game for the first Molyjam. It was based on the Peter Molydeux tweet, You live in a little house made of guns. You need many guns to fight invaders but also need to keep a roof on top of your many children. When Necrosoft Games was figuring out what projects to make first, Gunhouse was a natural fit, since we had a game jam prototype already! So then we released it for PlayStation Mobile after lots of trials and tribulations (we had three completely different prototypes for this game), and it did fine! Then Microsoft needed games for Windows Phone, so we got a grant to port it there! Then we figured why not put it on other mobile platforms? So we did. But then!! We decided to put on consoles. For the console versions, we came up with a brand new controller input method, added enemies, backgrounds, and all that stuff mentioned above. And now hopefully we're done with the dang thing, 4 years later!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;Sumptuous block-sliding!&lt;br/&gt;Dastardly tower defending!&lt;br/&gt;Buying stuff, like in a store! (but not for real money)&lt;br/&gt;Hecka bosses and weirdo cute-friend enemies to smash up!&lt;br/&gt;A weird story!&lt;br/&gt;Rotating objectives! Zoop zoop!&lt;br/&gt;Controller support!&lt;br/&gt;It's god darned endless, it is!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
