			<description>Money, adventure, &amp;amp; success in thirty minutes or less!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GettaLife is a fun card game illustrating the universal aspects of every day life. Players will draw and play cards to their individual Life Grid while simultaneously blocking their opponents from building theirs. As players build their Life Grid, they accumulate points, and after the deck runs out, the game ends and the player with the most points is crowned the winner and has GottaLife!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During play, however, players will also play Hard Knocks cards on their opponents' Life Grids in order to slow down their own progress, and will even play Damage cards on their opponents. Life Grids consist of four different tracks, or suits: Relationships, Wealth, Knowledge, and Experience. Each player must build the best Life Grid possible by balancing the development of all four suits with the hope of playing the Legend card and multiplying their points. Of course, the crowning achievement for any suit is for the player to achieve knighthood in one of their suits by playing all four cards in one suit without having any Hard Knocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
