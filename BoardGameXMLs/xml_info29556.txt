			<description>Spider-Man 3 3D Skyscraper Game is a modular roll-and-move game given away in packs of Ovaltine 3-in-1 (a powdered chocolate flavoured malt drink). Each pack had 20 sachets and came with one module of the game. There are four different modules, each module consisting of a booklet of thick cardboard pages, which are to be cut up and assembled into skyscrapers and structures. The modules can be played individually or put together to form one big city - New York (structures include the Statue of Liberty and the Chrysler building). &lt;br/&gt;The game is for two players, and one can choose to be either spidey or black spidey. The object of the game is to race around the city and the first player to reach the 'Winner' space wins. The path winds through the city and up and down the sides of the skyscrapers - the pieces can fit into slots in the walls. There are also spaces that allow a player to draw a card and follow instructions like, &amp;quot;Drink Ovaltine, get more power, Jump two steps forward&amp;quot;, or, &amp;quot;Strong wind, all players go back four steps&amp;quot;. A feature is that the die for the game is also included in each module - but you have to cut it out and assemble it yourself.&lt;br/&gt;The text for the rules and on the cards are in Thai and English and the manufacturer of the drink is Thai. Besides Thailand, the packs were distributed in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
