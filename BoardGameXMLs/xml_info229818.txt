			<description>Cabal of Shadows Faction Scenario&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Adventure for 6th-level Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The land is filled with dark portents that while intriguing, they threaten spill the Cabal&amp;rsquo;s careful planning into chaos. The weather has become increasingly stronger: thick fogs, violent storms, and unexplained summer cold snaps are becoming more frequent. The creatures of the deep plague shipments from Khorvaire with increasing frequency and the pirates that hunt Shargon&amp;rsquo;s Teeth are becoming more active. The seers and scholars loyal to the Cabal foresee a time of upheaval and change and the Council of the Obscured has declared that the Cabal must capitalize upon it while the other factions are in disarray.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has come to the attention of Cabal spies that the Iron Watch, an elite company of the Stormreach guard manned entirely by warforged, has captured one of the pirates, a flamboyant man known as Looish the Soft. Due the great activity that has arisen around the watch station holding him, the Cabal as taken an interest in Looish&amp;rsquo;s story. Cabal spies have determined that in addition to valuable information on the pirate fleet, Looish knows the location of an item that may be related to the ever-increasing foul weather. Either of these would be useful information, but together they make Looish too valuable to leave in the hands of the Coin Lords. He must be recovered alive for interrogation, and if he knows the location of any powerful relics, the Cabal will control them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
