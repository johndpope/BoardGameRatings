			<description>Token Wars (tm): Battle For Table Plain makes you king of a medieval army. The Table Plain is a coveted trade route once owned by a Merchant Prince, a merchant prince that has been reported dead (though no evidence of his death was ever found). He was loyal to no king and had no heir. Now, eager Kings from adjoining lands battle for control of the Table Plain in hopes that it will bolster their kingdom and further their means. Will you be the victor or will you watch your opponents take control of the land you so covet?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Token Wars is a 2 player head to head battle of skill and strategy. Each player takes control of an army of tokens that they must strategically push into the battle field (any flat surface with very little resistance). The game is played in four rounds with each player having two turns to defend and two turns to attack. In order to win, one player must either kill the other player's king, take the other player's flag, or capture all three of the other player's chests. If at the end of four rounds there is no victor, the player with the most powerful army wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever your tokens survive a round, they level-up thereby making your army more powerful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a fun game that is easy to learn but difficult to master. Buy your copy today and start owning your friends tomorrow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some Assembly Required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available through thegamecrafter.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
