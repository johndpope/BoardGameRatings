							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sector 15</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sector 15 is a full-color, 32 x 20 inch, floor plan of a research and development/science lab facility, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;A new research specimen! Excellent work!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sector 15 is a multi-room, single map research and development/science lab facility. The rooms include a specimen storage room, the main lab, and an observation room or lounge for the researchers. This product comes with a single 360 panoramic view of the specimen storage room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sector 15 is meant for use in near or far science fiction games. It could be part of a terrestrial base or building or as part of a spaceship, star port, or space station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sector 15 can be used as an investigation area. The group brings back a live or dead specimen and brings it to Sector 15 for dissection, interrogation, or experimentation. This works well if the group is comprised of some marines (to grab the specimen) and some scientists (for the actual research and investigation). A complication could be the scenario below occurs with the group needing to stop the theft attempt in this case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sector 15 can also be used as an adventure location. Someone that wants a specimen from Sector 15 hires the group. The group has to figure out a way to bypass security measures to get inside and then bypass or fool the hand scanner to get access to the lift. Then they need to grab the specimen and get out of Sector 15 as fast as possible. Complications could be that the specimen is sealed in the main lab with a couple of dead scientists and it is trying to escape when they arrive by attacking the door or the glass windows. The group might be able to bluff the surviving scientists that they are a security team sent to deal with the problem. If the scientists fall for the bluff, they release the seal and let them into the main lab to deal with the creature. The group can defeat the creature and kidnap it, perhaps bluffing the scientists again by saying they are moving it to a more secure facility within the area. Eventually their ruse is discovered when the actual security team arrives and a chase scene ensues with the real security team trying to recover the specimen as the group flees from them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
