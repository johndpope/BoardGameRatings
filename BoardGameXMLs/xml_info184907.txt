			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;School'd is a game about trying to thrive when it feels like the world conspires against them. It is a game about depression, uncertainty, fear, destitution, and isolation, but it is also a game about learning, love, friendship, growth, and hope. School'd is a game to tell the story of students, but not the way you see them on TV. The players will not take on the role of the rich kids misbehaving, zany antics, or supernatural students trying to fit in while balancing the hidden world. School'd is a game about real students with stressful home lives attending an inner city school. If you are looking for a game where your character is like the protagonist of a movie or TV show you love, than this is not the game for you. If you are want to play a game just to have a good time, this probably isn't for you either. But if you would like to play a game where you explore human problems, even when it hurts a bit, then I encourage you to give this game a try.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
