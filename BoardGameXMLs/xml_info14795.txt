			<description>&amp;quot;It's NBA Excitement In A Box!&amp;quot;  The claimed maximum of 24 players is only possible if players divide into teams since only 6 playing pieces are provided.  First player or team to reach the space with the red buzzer on it wins.  Each of the 500 cards has 4 trivia questions on it.  Players decide before the game starts whether they will read through all four before replacing each card or not.  Each question has multiple choice answers and is worth a number of points specified on the card.  Each correct answer allows the player or team's token to be moved that many spaces.  24 seconds is recommended as the time limit for answering.  Some spaces on the board have special instructions that must be followed (lose a turn, move ahead two, that sort of thing.)  Variant games are also suggested in the rules, such as rolling the die (provided with the game) to determine movement instead of taking the point value from the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
