			<description>Rough translation from the rules introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this city game, there's something going on -- such a little board, but sooooo much fun!  Where's &amp;quot;in&amp;quot;?  How do you get there?  Where is there a lot to see in the museums?  Where does the bus go?  When does the train leave?  And just think -- there's another monument!  At the end, everybody has won:  the one that got the most points, and everybody who got to experience a city tour in the game.  Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;1 board in four pieces&lt;br/&gt;30 double-sided cards&lt;br/&gt;4 pawns&lt;br/&gt;1 die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
