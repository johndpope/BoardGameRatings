							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The New and Fashionable Game of the Jew</name>
									
			<description>Cloth-backed, hand-colored folding engraving with slip cover.  Shows a publication date of May 27th, 1807.  Board is 18.5 x 16&amp;quot;, cover is 7 x 5&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is played with two six-sided dice, but while I have pictures of the case and board, I can find no explantion of game play other than this quote from &amp;quot;Deconstructing Sondheim&amp;quot;, a March 8, 1993 New Yorker article by Stephen Schiff:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you enter his five-story town house in midtown Manhattan, the first thing you notice, besides an enormous black poodle named Max, is his antique-game collection: on the walls, in glass museum cases, on various low tables. Most of the items look faintly sinister: here is something called Schimmel, or Ball and Hammer and here an inscrutable British concoction, Squails, and, behind the sofa, his earliest acquisition&amp;mdash;the ghastly New and Fashionable Game of the Jew, a dice game devised in 1811 that, according to Sondheim, &amp;quot;taught kids to be anti-Semitic. But all the games you see here are very nice to look at and real boring,&amp;quot; he adds. &amp;quot;This thing about games&amp;mdash;I'm not really fascinated with games.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--&lt;br/&gt;Looks to be a variation of Gluckshaus.  Roll both dice and pay the amount rolled onto the space of the same value.  If there is something already on the space, collect it instead.  Rolling a 7 always pays to the Jew space.  Rolling a 12 collects all the counters on the board.&lt;br/&gt;From: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.gamesetal.net/Stock_Pages/GLB/glb3930.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.gamesetal.net/Stock_Pages/GLB/glb3930.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
