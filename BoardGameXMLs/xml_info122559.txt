			<description>Dragon's Lair 20th Anniversary Edition is a special collectors edition of Don Bluth and Rick Dyer's hit 80's arcade games Dragon's Lair, Space Ace and Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp.  Designed as an action-packed and feature-filled tribute to the original arcade laserdisc version of Dragon's Lair enjoyed by over a quarter billion people worldwide, the DVD is loaded with extras such as previously unreleased scenes and video, original interviews with Don Bluth and Rick Dyer at the time of release as well as their biographies and information about Gary Goldman and John Pomeroy, the animation wizards who worked with Bluth to develop the stunning sequences that make up these three games.  To round out this nostalgic release, there are box shots of virtually all the software releases of Dragon's Lair over the years, as well as selected shots of merchandise based on the game.   This ultra-interactive version promises to be the best release of Dragon's Lair ever! .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
