							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kemet: Dice Tower Promo 2016</name>
									
			<description>3 new tiles for Kemet which were originally available as a reward in the 2016 Dice Tower Season 12 Kickstarter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These three additional power tiles are added to those available at the beginning of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They have the distinction of being 2 colors. The players need the pyramids of both colors at the correct level to be able to buy them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Divine Prescience (red/blue): Your opponent must reveal the Divine Intervention cards he will play during a battle, before you choose your Battle and Divine Intervention cards. If your opponent has the Prescience blue tile, the revelation of your Battle card and his Divine Intervention cards are done simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Renewal (white/red): During the night phase, before the new Divine Intervention cards are dealt, discard as many Divine Intervention cards as you want and draw the same number plus one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disciple of Ptah (blue/white): Each pyramid you control gives you a temporary VP at level 3 instead of level 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
