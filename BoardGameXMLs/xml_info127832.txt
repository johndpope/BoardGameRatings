							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Abbey of the Golden Sparrow</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Abbey of the Golden Sparrow&amp;quot; is the first in our line of &amp;ldquo;locale&amp;rdquo; supplements featuring information for players and Game Masters alike. Locales are places of interest that can be dropped into any fantasy campaign that help bring the setting to life for the already harried GM.  &amp;quot;Abbey of the Golden Sparrow&amp;quot; is designed especially with an eye toward monk characters but there is no reason that another character class might not be living at or visiting the abbey (or make use of many of the new rules presented).  No matter the class, players using this text will be able to give their characters that much more background which only enhances the roleplaying experience.  Likewise, GMs will find plenty of plot hooks and adventure ideas that can occur either inside the abbey or outside, using the locale as a springboard for adventures nearby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The supplement begins with a short narrative describing the typical life of an initiate at the abbey.  This is followed by the locale&amp;rsquo;s physical description, history, two local myths, and sample doctrines.  Then we get to the rules sections.  New feats as well as new character traits are featured.  Following these are a new special material (obsidian), three new magic items, and two signature NPCs of the abbey.  In short, you get a grab bag of material that can be used together or separately without hindrance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
