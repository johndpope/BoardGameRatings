			<description>From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a travelling salesman. For fifteen years you have travelled the width and length of England attempting to use your skills to sell various products. Successful, professional, wealthy, intelligent with good looks and a wicked smile, you have done well in your career and are respected by your colleague's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you drive through the storm down the dark country lane in Suffolk you curse your bad luck at being caught in the storm. Wiping your hand across the windscreen that is steaming up you take a quick look at your mobile phone. There us still no call or text message from John. Where is the cottage? It must be around here somewhere?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you look up from the phone you scream in shock at the pale young woman in the road. The cars headlights light her up and as she throws up her hands across her face you slam down the breaks and turn the car. With a loud screech the car skids across the road and narrowly misses the girl. You scream as the car spins around in full circle and with terrifying speed slides into the embankment and overturns with a crash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You hit your head on the airbag and feel glass shatter across your face as the car comes to a halt at the bottom of the embankment. In agony you try to unfasten your seat belt and let go of a sudden a cry as you realise your right leg is pinned to the damaged chassis of the car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Help me!&amp;quot; you cry above the noise of the car and the storm. In the darkness, alone and afraid you try desperately to get free and suddenly hear your mobile phone. You grasp at the phone and scream for help to the recognisable voice of John. As he asks for directions and you try to give them you feel the signs of nausea and lose consciousness into an inky blackness...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You awake in a warm bed. Facing you is the welcoming face of John and his partner Mirrian. &amp;quot;How are you feeling,&amp;quot; he asks, &amp;quot;You had us worried these last three days&amp;quot;. You look at him in shock, three days. You tell him you have felt better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Thank god we found you alive when we did!&amp;quot; Mirrian says quietly. &amp;quot;You have missed some terrible news?&amp;quot; John tells Mirrian to leave her news for now but she hands you a local newspaper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You read the headline in disbelief and look at the two faces of your friends. Several thousand now dead from plague. Army starts mass vaccination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;When did all this happen?&amp;quot; you ask.&lt;br/&gt;John tells you that the vaccination program started several days ago. Just after your crash. Unbelievably like some terrible disaster or horror movie the origins of the plague were unknown but the symptoms terrifying. The government had now declared martial law as those perishing from the disease were turning into undead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mirrian and John speak to you into the late hours of the evening. They inform you of the plague; how the hospitals are overrun with vacation programs and that a doctor had recommenced you stay at the cottage rather than the city. Vaccinated along with the others you had been left with John who himself is a doctor and his wife.&lt;br/&gt;After discussions of the plague and the crash you are left to sleep until the morning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
