							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">VeloCITY: The Wind in Your Hair</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VeloCITY: The Wind in Your Hair is a homebrew system designed to replicate the feel and freedom of running around an urban playground and going anywhere. Taking its main inspiration from the Jet Set Radio and Air Gear franchises, the game's focus is on freedom of movement, radical action, oodles of style, and several varieties of sticking it to the man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking place on the artificial island metropolis of Velo City, players take on the role of &amp;quot;rudies&amp;quot;: all manners of young punks, vagabonds and daredevils with a tune in their ear and color in their hearts; their main gimmick is that they rely on the four types of human-powered movement: running, rollerskating, skateboarding and biking. In the urban playground, the players will follow the people of Velo and learn of their ambitions and struggles. Between the police and the corporate overworld, rudies fight to cut out a niche of their own in the city. With varying degrees of power level and a system that plays fast and loose, the game can be as realistic or over-the-top as the players desire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
