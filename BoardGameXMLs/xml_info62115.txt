			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blue Deception - Quod - Wisp of Pallstone. These are but three of the lethal poisons that grace the pages of this book. Never again will your characters yawn at the mention of a poisoned arrow or the sight of a venomous serpent. For instead of merely being weakened by the kiss of poison, they may find themselves deafened, unable to cast spells, or thrown into the very depths of fear!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first in our Complete line of d20 sourcebooks, this 96-page tome contains so much more than a simple recitation of poisons. A free-form poison creation system means the product of your character's skill will be limited only by the breadth of your imagination. The Complete treatment includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed rules for brewing magical poisons, harvesting raw materials from vanquished foes, and creating antidotes.&lt;br/&gt;     More than 40 new feats, including metapoison feats, epic feats, and the dreaded Toxic Substitution.&lt;br/&gt;     Over 30 poison-related spells, including the ultimate in retributive magic: Vengeance on Tainted Hands.&lt;br/&gt;     An armory-full of new equipment and magic items, like the sinister Hollow-Blade and the legendary Staff of Serpents.&lt;br/&gt;     Six new prestige classes, including the Ki Corrupted and Toxomancer.&lt;br/&gt;     A menagerie's worth of baneful creatures, featuring the venomous gaze of the Syrallax and the grim essence of the Toxic Deathlord.&lt;br/&gt;     Adventure seeds incorporating all of the new rules for levels 1-20, including fully statted NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed notes for using the Poisoncraft rules in any Monte Cook's Arcana Unearthed campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You might find all of that in a regular sourcebook. In a Complete sourcebook, that's just the beginning! Blue Devil Games also gives you: rules on poison decay, the perils of handling poison, two versions of the poison cleric domain, three creature templates, a random poison naming table, a detailed description of all nineteen poison families, a character sheet addendum, and a Poisoncraft worksheet for creating new poisons. Oh, and did we mention the Codex Venenorum, with more than 60 poisons!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All this, brought to life by the incomparable artistic talents of Tyler Walpole, Kev Crossley, Jennifer Rodgers, and Fil Kearney.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
