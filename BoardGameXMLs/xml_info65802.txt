							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">Le Tour de France - Jeu Officiel</name>
									
			<description>French cycling game published during the 1950's in St.-Etienne on the Tour de France. The game can be played with up to three teams (in green, white &amp;amp; red). Each team consists of three riders. There is also is one yellow rider for the Tour leader. Although there is a map of France in the game this is not the gameboard. Instead there are three small boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
