							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Starbird</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the confines of your solitary world exist other planets, confined by cosmic spheres and warmed by their own distant suns. The Starbird lives in the space between these spheres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A incredibly rare creature of cosmic energy, it wanders the universe, peering into the spheres to watch the worlds and the lesser creatures that inhabit them. Sometimes, however, it is not enough to just watch. When it&amp;rsquo;s curiosity becomes too great it will tear open a gap in a sphere to slip inside and directly interact with the people living there. This rarely goes well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the Starbird isn&amp;rsquo;t a malicious creature, its nearly-godlike power makes it difficult for it to view other life forms as being more than playthings. Countries, continents, and even entire worlds have been left ruined by Starbirds that simply wanted to see what would happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
