							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eagle Alight: The Lunar Lander Board Game</name>
									
			<description>In honour of the FAVOURITE Computer Game (Arcade), Lunar Lander, and the 40th anniversary of the (faked?) Apollo 11 Moon Landings, here is &amp;quot;Eagle Alight&amp;quot;, a Lunar Lander inspired board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use fuel, Fuel, FUEL to rotate and slow your craft for an &amp;ldquo;Eagle Has Landed&amp;rdquo; moment! This is effectively a simulation of gravity on two hex maps: One with a small playing piece for the larger wide scale view of the moon surface; the other representing the various landing sites by use of layered colour hexes, with a larger playing piece to represent the ship in close-up. In the interest of best representing the original game, the two boards need to be double sided, with one side giving the large scale where the two boards are placed side by side (landscape).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
