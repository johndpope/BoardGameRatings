			<description>A One-Round Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A week after the last of you arrived, the wizard Askinn called you all into his laboratory. You all know that he is a wizard of time, and that most of you have been brought from different times in the history of Alenkirth. Hoping to find out why, you gather as requested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;My friends,&amp;rdquo; begins the old chronomancer, &amp;ldquo;I am one of a select brotherhood of wizards called Time Guardians. It is our duty to monitor the flow of time and ensure that history is not changed through the actions of rogue chronomancers. Sometimes, however, a greater danger presents itself. This is one such case.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
