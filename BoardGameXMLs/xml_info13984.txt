			<description>This one-on-one action/dexterity game pits the G.I. Joe action figure Duke against Cobra infantry trooper Neo-Viper in a match to five points. Turning the controller allows the two figures to attack with kicks and punches, with the object to connect with a small &amp;quot;strike plate&amp;quot; on the opposing character's chest (which releases the catch holding the figure to the controller), knock him out and score a point. Anyone who's ever enjoyed Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots will likely get a &amp;quot;kick&amp;quot; out of this one, which plays at a much faster pace and allows for a greater variety of attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Others in the line included Batman vs. the Joker and a Small Soldiers tie-in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
