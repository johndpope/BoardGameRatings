			<description>The game board shows pairs of shoes. The players draw tiles and and place them face down on the board, starting on the left side (there are four rows). The tile has to match the picture under it. The other players can doubt that and check - if they doubted correctly, the wrong-doer removes two tiles, if not, the accuser does that. Each column of four matching tiles scores points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
