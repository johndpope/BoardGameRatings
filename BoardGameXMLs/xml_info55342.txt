			<description>There are six forests, consisting of three trees each. One of the 18 trees has a little hole at the bottom, the object of the game is to find that tree. &lt;br/&gt;The players roll a die and move their wooden foxes towards the trees. The die contains the numbers 2-5, a goose and a tree. The tree means that two trees can be swapped without looking under them; the goose means that the player can secretly check out one tree. &lt;br/&gt;To win the game, a player must move on the one square directly in front of one of the forests, pick up a tree and find the hole in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
