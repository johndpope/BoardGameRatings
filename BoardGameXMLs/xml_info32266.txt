							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SuperCross- The Home Version</name>
									
			<description>Brings the Supercross experience to life. With movable obstacles, lets you place the doubles, triples and table tops where you want them. With bike modifications and factory rides, you can improve your bike's performance. Be careful of the whoops and don't let your tire drop down inbetween or you'll crash. Family oriented game that is easy to play, which comes with a nicely designed track, cut out bikes and stands, cut out jumps, full throttle, Modification, and obstacle cards, and gear dice for movement. The downfall of the game is the poor design of the jumps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
