			<description>INFILTRATE                                   ANTICIPATE                            CAPTURE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the period of Rome&amp;rsquo;s bloody civil wars, a divided army fought for control of one of the mightiest empires on earth. Take sides in a game that balances skill and chance. Anticipate and plot your next moves, as you scheme to infiltrate and plunder enemy territory. Ambush and capture your opponents, but beware! Fickle Roman gods may take sides and intercede to seal your fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your moves are determined by the cards you draw. Uncertainty haunts your every turn, because sprinkled among the tiles are Roman gods that may aid or impede your efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The perfect balance between strategy and chance in the unpredictable Ancient World. Young players will love the unpredictability and surprise while more experienced players will treasure and master the infinite playing strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played on an 8 x 8 board with marble pieces and a stack of cards full of mystical and powerful gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capere is a Social Abstract Game SAG for 2 or 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
