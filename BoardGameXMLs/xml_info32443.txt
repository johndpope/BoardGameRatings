			<description>Let the good times roll. Toss the cubes of fate and create millions of outrageous and hilarious combinations of personal ads. Never the same ad twice. In this fast-paced game of self-celebration, you race against the clock, using as many cubs as possible, to set up the last word in relationships between imaginary (and not so imaginary) characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game abounds in elements of romantic mystery, hyperbole, white (and not so white) lies, crazy juxtapositions, wild adjectives, clich&amp;eacute;s and codes, all blending to create some of the most humorous reading and exciting game play ever. Its entertainment values cannot be matched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
