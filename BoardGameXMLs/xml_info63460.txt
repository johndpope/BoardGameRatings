							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Triplex</name>
									
			<description>Triplex plays on a hexagonal board. The board itself is divided in several hexagons.&lt;br/&gt;Each player possesses one of the following piece : a cylinder, a cube, a parallelepiped (right triangular).&lt;br/&gt;Each piece can move on the board according to different rules. &lt;br/&gt;It is allowed to superimpose several pieces on one another, e.g. a cube over the cylinder. The &amp;quot;new piece&amp;quot; created then possesses the characteristics of the piece which is at the top. &lt;br/&gt;A player wins when he is the first one to superimpose its 3 pieces on the central hexagon. &lt;br/&gt;Pieces can fight against one another. When a fight is lost, the piece goes back to the edge of the board, on the hexagon where it started. &lt;br/&gt;The strength of each piece is inversely proportional to the number of hexagons it can move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
