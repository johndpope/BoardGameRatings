			<description>Explore the new world as a dragon hatchling! Players compete with each other to see who can amass the greatest horde of gold. As they gain experience and grow into larger and more capable dragons they will also face the challenge of slayers. With only 9 rounds to play it will be a tight race to see who can be most infamous Wyrm!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you will take actions that include search, eat, move, explore, raze, and fight. The explore action will allow you to draw new tiles to expand the play area. The search action will let you draw an event for a specific tile, which may be a fort, ruins, or a farm. These farms and forts may be razed for gold, or you can eat the livestock they produce to grow and gain experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experience can be used to grow your dragon, from whelp to drake, and then to a mighty wyrm! You will also use experience to unlock and upgrade skills for your dragon. Each dragon has several unique skills that only they can use, no two dragons are exactly the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each new round will start by introducing a new slayer to the board. The player who's turn it is to go first will control this slayer for the rest of the time it remains on the board. These slayers come in a variety of forms, from the simple bandit chieftain, to the mighty heroes of legend. Defeat these slayers and you will earn gold and experience, fail and you will have some of your actions crippled for a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the 9 rounds there will be new objectives introduced that will give players chances to earn more gold as they complete them. Whoever ultimately ends up with the most gold at the end of the game wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
