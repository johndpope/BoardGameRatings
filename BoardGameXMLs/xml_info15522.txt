			<description>From the Rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game of HIGHWAY PATROL is won by the player whose automobile first completes the tour of the board from the space in the central traffic circle marked &amp;quot;Auto Park&amp;quot;--to the finish space marked &amp;quot;Finish&amp;quot;. The same hazards and delays that are found when actually driving a real car on the road will be encountered in this game, as well as the same traffic signals and regulations which govern modern motoring. The player who avoids accidents and traffic violations will suffer the least delay and should reach his destination first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
