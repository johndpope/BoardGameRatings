							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bremen Town Musicians</name>
									
			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this roleplaying game, the players are animals who encounter adventures while traveling to Bremen to become Town Musicians. To return to their farms is certain death, so they must go onward. It is the job of the gamemaster to give them adventures on the road to Bremen. In the original story, they never get there, but in your story, they might - and have even stranger adventures!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 24-Hour RPG is a traditional roleplaying game, requiring a gamemaster and at least three six-sided dice (preferably per player).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters are normal animals, without the ability to use tools or weapons. They are assumed to be able to communicate freely with other animals, but not well with humans - no better than real-life animals, anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
