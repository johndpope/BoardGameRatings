			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since before the recession of the Galactic Federation the administration of the navigation buoy network critical to interstellar commerce has been the sole responsibility of Federation Navigation Systems (FNS). Three months ago, FNS started losing reception from seven of its nav-buoy stations imbedded in the Southern arm of the Nagol Dust Clouds in a region of space known as the &amp;ldquo;Ship Graveyard&amp;rdquo;. These recent reception outages have resulted in several costly navigational mishaps and lost data transmissions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In reaponse to the growing public pressure to expedite repairs, FNS has contracted the Navistar Corporation to send a trouble shooter team to investigate. One problem, the night before the scheduled launch half of the team was afflicted by an infectious spacer's disease and is stuck in quarantine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an effort to keep the lucrative contract, the local Navistar office in Kingsport is seeking to recruit anyone they can to fill the vacant crew positions on their starship. No experience, No problem! Our veteran crew can handle mentoring a few new &amp;quot;green horns&amp;quot;. After all, what could possibly go wrong on a simple Nav-Buoy repair mission in a mysterious region of space known as the &amp;quot;Ship Graveyard&amp;quot;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scions of Faranis is a beginner Frontier Space Role Playing Game adventure for four to six players with Characters ranked 0-2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
