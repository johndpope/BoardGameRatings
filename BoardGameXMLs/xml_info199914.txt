							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wormhole: The Definitive Question and Answer Game</name>
									
			<description>From box:&lt;br/&gt;Wormhole (n): An imaginary passageway in space and time connecting the history and the present of the universe.&lt;br/&gt;The exciting game of Wormhole lets you travel through the universe in your own space and time. Discover how truly fascinating the world's history is and how it connects to your everyday life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling a die and moving around the board answering questions. Six of the eight categories are historic and geographic, divided by continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts the game with 6 discs, one of each colour. When you correctly answer a question on the large space, you discard your disc of that colour. If, however, you answer incorrectly, your turn ends and you pick up all of the discarded discs of that colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to discard all of their discs, make it back to &amp;quot;Start&amp;quot; and correctly answer a &amp;quot;Global&amp;quot; (miscellaneous) question wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
