							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Secret Seven</name>
									
			<description>Card game based on the series of books by Enid Blyton. The Secret Seven consists of Peter, Janet,Jack, Barbara, George, Pam and Colin and they always had to do detective work in each story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 44 cards in four suits of eleven. Each suit is represented by a different colour. The cards are numbered 2 to 12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player on the left of the dealer begins by taking into his hand the top card from the face&amp;not;down pack on the table. If he has a card in his hand bearing the number 7 he plays it by placing it in the centre of the table. If he has no No. 7 he may not play any other card and the play passes to the next player on his left. The second player draws the next card from the top of the pack and plays either a No. 7 card or, if the first player laid down a 7, the No. 6 or No. 8 of the same colour.&lt;br/&gt;The other players follow in turn, drawing each time and playing one card if they can. The cards must always be played in order on the right or left side of the 7&amp;rsquo;s and in their proper suits in accordance with the colour of the numbers. For numbers under 7 the numerical order goes downwards, for numbers over 7 it goes upwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player cannot play a card when his turn comes he merely keeps in his hand the card he has drawn from the pack and the turn passes to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Important rule: PLAYERS MUST PLAY A CARD IF THEY HAVE ONE THAT CAN BE PLAYED BUT MUST NEVER PLAY MORE THAN ONE CARD AT EACH TURN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to use all his cards, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reimplements: Fan Tan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
