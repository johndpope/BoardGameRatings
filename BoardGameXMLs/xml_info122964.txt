			<description>A Texan-made American football game based on the exciting new tactic at the time, the T-Formation. This is not a statistical game and is played head-to-head against your opponent. After choosing a card for the type of play you would like your team to accomplish and then refered to a table that gives the result of the play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think it could be played solitaire because I cannot see any interaction that would happen each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
