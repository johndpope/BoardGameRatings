Printed on sturdy cardstock, each pawn contains a beautiful full-color image of a character, perfect for use as a hero, an enemy, or your next character, whether it's an elf, a dwarf, or something far stranger. Each cardstock pawn slots into a size-appropriate plastic base from any of the Pathfinder Pawns: Bestiary Box collections, making them easy to mix with traditional metal or plastic miniatures. The Heroes &amp;amp; Villains Pawn Collection is the best way to ensure you've got the perfect character for every Pathfinder Roleplaying Game encounter!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
