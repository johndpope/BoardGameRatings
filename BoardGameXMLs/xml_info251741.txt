			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than two centuries ago, a red wizard by the name of Houn made a discovery that shook the foundations of magic on Toril. Yet, due to a considerable amount of effort on his part, it never saw the light of day. The exact nature of this discovery is unknown but it involves the location of the skeletal fragments of an ancient being. The weave, which governs all magic on Toril, reacts strangely to the fragments. More information existed before Houn destroyed his research and fled Thay. His current whereabouts are unknown but many of his peers have attempted to track him down and steal his research for themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 5th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
