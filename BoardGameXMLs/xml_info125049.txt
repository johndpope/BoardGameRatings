							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ísland-opoly</name>
									
			<description>&amp;Iacute;sland-opoly is a licenced Monopoly clone which theme is unsurprisingly Iceland. The properties are famous landmarks, tourist attractions, building and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;How do we make a board game about the most fun country in the world?&lt;br/&gt;It's impossible to put all the great places of Iceland in one board game so we have chosen fun places and landmarks all over the country. We start in the Hvalfj&amp;ouml;r&amp;eth;ur and travel all around the country that keeps surprising us with natural disasters and unexpected happenings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do you play &amp;Iacute;sland-opoly?&lt;br/&gt;You can buy famous places or landmarks all around the country, up the rent by buying houses and upgrade them to hotels. Sounds easy? We'll figure it out! Traffic jam, radar guns and the police can make it harder for us, but that's just more fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You pick a fun pawn and go to the starting place, perhaps you'll become the richest person in Iceland... or just stuck in a traffic jam because of the ash cloud!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get ready for the game! This is our country... and it's your turn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
