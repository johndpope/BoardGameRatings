			<description>A card game very much like Foolish Questions, but with some differences:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains one deck of cards with questions (Green) and one deck of answers (Blue). The Answer cards are dealt to all players equally and the questions are spread out on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player begins by selecting another player and draws a Question card from the pile and ask the question. The player selected then takes the top most answer card and read this.&lt;br/&gt;Now (s)he pics a player, draws a card and reads the question&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until there are no more Questions and Answer cards.&lt;br/&gt;The one who first get rid of Answer Cards is the winner; if the game ends because the Question cards run out, the one with least Answer cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Possibly illustrated by Hans Quist (1922-1983).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
