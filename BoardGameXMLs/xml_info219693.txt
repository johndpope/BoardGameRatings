			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evildoer spotlight is a new Saturday Morning Tabletop RPG series of short books (5-10 pages), introducing knew enemies, animals and other antagonists. Included in every book will be a brief summary of the evildoer, their character traits and possible plot hooks to tie that evildoer into an adventure, and of course their stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonus material will also be included in each evildoer spotlight. The nature of the bonus material may be a new magic item, a supporting cast of weaker evildoers or even a new evildoer trait to add to the list of traits found in the evildoer toolkit at the end of the core rule book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Book #2: The Jelly Father&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jelly father is a tortured man that followed a tortured path. He, or &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rdquo;, is a massive gelatinous mass of digestive goo, giant magical eyes &amp;amp; ill intent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the spotlight is Yuseff Belkir (the jelly father) and his gelatinous spawn. As well as the Gelatinous trait for your evildoer toolkit &amp;amp; two examples of gelatinous evildoers made with the new trait.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jelly Father &amp;amp; his minions are suitable antagonists for level 1-14 characters. As Yuseff is a powerful Adversary and even his minions have minions. And with the new gelatinous trait, you can create &amp;amp;/or modify any evildoer to suite the level range and challenge you wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
