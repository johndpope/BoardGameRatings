			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mobile version of GemCraft is a fantasy-themed Tower Defense game like the rest of the series.  It is most similar to GemCraft Chapter Zero: Gem of Eternity in gameplay, but has new graphics, and several gameplay changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You defend your base by building towers and traps and filling them with gems. Gems can be combined to make stronger ones or dropped on monsters to do area of effect damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has been reworked in terms of skills and when different gems and abilities are available.  This makes the first several levels an effective terminal as you are only able to do a few things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old levels are available to replay for more experience, this time in seven different modes, with the top score from each counting towards your experience total.  In other words, there is a huge amount of game-play here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Achievements are available on Game Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
