							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bob&#039;s Brain</name>
									
			<description>Our hero Bob has a problem. He needs to do something &amp;mdash; but what? And how does he deal with the fallout of what he does? In Bob's Brain, a party game and social experiment of psychological upheaval, the players are different &amp;quot;voices&amp;quot; in Bob's head, each seeking to influence his actions in problem-solving. One player presents problems that Bob faces; the other players come up with solutions, then derive the problems that might come from their answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to set backs this game has not been published but if you are a psychotherapist and want to try it out at work I will sell one off copies at cost to get people using it in counseling. It has been a very good tool for me in my thirty years in social work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
