			<description>atWar, formerly Afterwind, a free online multi-player turn-based strategy war game - in the traditions of Risk and Axis &amp;amp; Allies - is now available to play in BETA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some features of atWar are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Free troop movement, no 'grid' or predetermined paths, allowing for complex battle sequences.&lt;br/&gt;    Realistic World default map based on real world populations and GDP to determine reinforcements and income from cities.&lt;br/&gt;    City populations suffer from collateral damage when attacked, affecting reinforcements and income.&lt;br/&gt;    Play against up to 20 people simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;    Make your own maps and units to provide for endless entertainment and possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;    Free to play, also available via Facebook. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In&amp;nbsp;the pursuit of creating an engaging turn-based strategy game a&amp;nbsp;realistic world map was taken and the 'grid' system and&amp;nbsp;pre-determined paths that dictated troop movement were eliminated. Now units can move&amp;nbsp;anywhere in the map based on their individual range (although land&amp;nbsp;units can not go on water and vice versa). There are over 10 main&amp;nbsp;land, naval and air units available with many more 'rare' units that&amp;nbsp;are sometimes found when capturing a city. Having this new free&amp;nbsp;movement induces complex battle sequences and demands a high level of&amp;nbsp;strategy acumen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another&amp;nbsp;method to enrich the gaming experience is the use of real cities&amp;nbsp;within real Countries and Provinces, rather than just regions. Cities&amp;nbsp;are based on current Population and GDP statistics to determine&amp;nbsp;Reinforcements and Income players receive. Furthermore city&amp;nbsp;populations suffer under attacks affecting the Reinforcements and&amp;nbsp;Income of the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A&amp;nbsp;feature sure to bring a lot of interest is the Map Editor, where&amp;nbsp;players can make their own maps and units paving the way for one to&amp;nbsp;Re-enact any battle in the Past, Present or even Future. There are&amp;nbsp;already hundreds of maps available that were created by members,&amp;nbsp;including maps based on the Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, Ancient Greece and&amp;nbsp;Futuristic battles for Galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has also been kept straight-forward, with most of the inner complexity&amp;nbsp;in the background, so new players shouldn't be intimidated. The&amp;nbsp;interface and controls are simple and intuitive, and there's no annoying micromanagement. Most of the game revolves around expanding&amp;nbsp;your territory, using different units at the player's disposal. Each&amp;nbsp;game can have up to 20 players spread around the entire map. To&amp;nbsp;reward the players, we have Medals (achievements) and Strategy&amp;nbsp;Points, which can be used to unlock various upgrades, and also&amp;nbsp;translate into ranks. Of course, the best reward is still winning a fair game against worthy opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;more than Risk online&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
