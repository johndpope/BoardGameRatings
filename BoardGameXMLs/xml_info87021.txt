			<description>From Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eyeless they see. Earless they hear. Their hunger feeds the growing emptiness that is Vahhsh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superficially, xeshaals resemble exotic humanoids. From a distance, their tattooed bodies resemble alabaster-skinned humans. Their primitive garb makes them easily mistakable for albino barbarians with white hair that sways without wind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once close enough to make out their physical features, however, all illusions fall aside. What was mistaken for hair coalesces into tendrils of flesh. The facial features are painted on in a crude mockery of eyes, ears, nose and mouth. Hidden underneath is featureless flesh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The eyes do not linger on the empty face, instead drawn to the gaping maws on their palms. Black liquid drips between the teeth, quickly dissipating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xeshaals are a truly alien race. They have no shared ancestry with any other race or creature, aliens among the races of the multi-verse. They are living portals to the plane of Vahhsh. Neither good nor evil, their only purpose is to experience and&lt;br/&gt;feed the plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
