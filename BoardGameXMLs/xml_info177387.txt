							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battlestar Galactica: Civilian Ship Bases</name>
									
			<description>Civvies are more than just DRADIS blips &amp;ndash; give your Vipers something to protect!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything in the Battlestar Galactica board game has a lovely plastic miniature&amp;hellip;except the civilians! These acrylic ship bases give your civilians a presence on the game board, making your game board look like a fleet instead of a handful of minis and cardboard chits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set includes 12 bases, two in each of six designs. They have a recessed area to securely and secretly hold the civilian ship tokens, and add only a small amount to the overall size of the token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
