			<description>PewDiePie: Legend of the Brofist is a 2D side-scrolling action-adventure platform video game developed and published by Canada-based indie development studio Outerminds Inc., in collaboration with PewDiePie. The game was released for iOS and Android on September 24, 2015 and became the top-grossing paid game in the United States App Store less than two hours after its release. The Microsoft Windows and OS X versions were released on December 10, 2015, with additional co-op mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PewDiePie had long-time aspirations for launching his own video game, and in December 2014, he revealed to his fans that he was collaborating with Outerminds Inc. to make a PewDiePie themed video game. He was heavily involved in the game&amp;rsquo;s development to ensure that it would turn out the way his fans would have liked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes references to previous videos and pop culture, with CinammonToastKen, Markiplier, Cryaotic (Cry), JackSepticEye and CutiePieMarzia lending voices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;PewDiePie: Legend of the Brofist&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
