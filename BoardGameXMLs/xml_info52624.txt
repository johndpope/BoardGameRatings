			<description>Tired of vampiric melodrama?  Sick of all the speak-easies being torn apart by creatures from beyond?  Dying for a little laughter in your live action?  Well you're in luck! 9th Level Games is bringing all the fun of Kobolds Ate My Baby! to the LARP scene.  Strap a colander on your head and bust out the rubber chickens!  Strive for new heights of overacting, brush up on your dog mimicry, and revel in the drunken debauchery!  The Kobolds are in the house, and they're ready to bark, err. . . LARP!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kobold!  The Charades is a stand alone Live Action RPG set int he world of dimness. A world remarkably similar to the world of Kobolds Ate My Baby! just not as brightly lit.  Within, Kobold! The Charades answers can be found to many of the burning questions on an aspiring Kobold LARPer's mind, such as. . . Do I have to buy a fancy costume?  How do you resolve things without resorting to dice or a fist fight?  Is brooding mandatory or simply encouraged?  And most importantly, other LARPs have hot chicks in tight costumes, will yours?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
