							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frustration Ball</name>
									
			<description>A marble maze game with a difference. The marble is enclosed in a ball and you have to get the ball into each of eight cups, built into the ball, in order. The first player to achieve this wins. If no winner after a pre-determined time, the winner is the one who got to the highest cup number. That time limit might be drastically shortened by the players because this game is frustrating, as it says in the title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
