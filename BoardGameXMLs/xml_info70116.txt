							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">18 Ghosts</name>
									
			<description>For half a millennium, a group of ghosts have been growing quite weary of one another's company in an old Scottish castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since they are thoroughly bored with the social scene of the stony structure, each ghost secretly wishes to escape the castle and go on wild adventures. Unfortunately, the ghosts are trapped there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suddenly, an opportunity arises! They discover three glimmering magical portals that they might be able to use to find freedom. Desperation sets in quickly, because they know the portals won't be open long, so the ghosts scramble and jostle one another, trying to slip through the portals while they have the chance. They certainly don't want to see each other's ethereal faces for another 500 years!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPONENTS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;18 Ghosts includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A board depicting an old Scottish castle with 25 rooms (5&amp;times;5) and one large dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;     18 ghosts in 2 types and 3 colors (3 for each color and type).&lt;br/&gt;     3 portals, one of each color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOAL OF THE GAME:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players try to help their ghosts escape from the castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to win the game, be the first to have a red ghost, a blue ghost, and a yellow ghost outside the castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When this happens, the game ends immediately. That player is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
