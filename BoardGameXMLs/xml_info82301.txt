			<description>Take No Prisoners (also known as TNP) is a computer game released in 1997. It was based on the Vampire engine, developed by Raven Software, along with Mageslayer. The engine provides a top-down view with NPC and props being sprites. The score was composed by Kevin Schilder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The whole game is set in San Antonio, Texas, in a post-apocalyptic near future. The player takes the role of Slade, a soldier recruited by Martech Industries, Inc. to retrieve a crystal located in the Dome, in the center of the desolated city. He must make his way through a San Antonio in chaos and fight irradiated inhabitants and mutants to get to the Dome and retrieved the crystal that is supposed to be used to build a new Dome. The end of the game suggests a sequel, but it was never released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Take No Prisoners (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
