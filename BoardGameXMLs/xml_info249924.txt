							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Glyph: Seer Champion</name>
									
			<description>Glyph is a dice-building combat strategy game for 2-6 players. Players are tasked with forming a team of three champions and defeat their opponent. These Champions are broken up into three distinct classes--Strikers, Guardians, and Adherents--with each Champion having his or her own strengths, weaknesses, and unique abilities which you will use by harnessing the power of mystical glyphs. As the game progresses, your Champions will have the opportunity to acquire new items which will enhance their capabilities as well as perhaps give them even more skills to use to defeat your enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glyph: The Seer further expands the options available to players for customizing their group of Champions with a the Seer, a hero with no combos of her own but the devastating ability to see into the future to better turn the tide of battle for your side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
