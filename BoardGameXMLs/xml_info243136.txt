							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yacht Race</name>
									
			<description>The game consists of a very large  43 by 32 square board, six yachts, 72 wind change cards, 18 spinnaker cards, a wind indicator and a pack of Sailor's Luck cards. Each player starts with one yacht, 12 wind change and 3 spinnaker cards which once used are returned to the box .&lt;br/&gt; The yachts race round a proscribed course, moving a number of squares depending on their direction relative to wind direction: 3 squares in line with wind or 45 degrees off the wind, 2 squares if perpendicular to wind, 1 square if 45 degrees into the wind and  zero if directly into the wind.&lt;br/&gt; On their turn a player chooses to play a number of wind change cards (0+), each shifting wind direction 45 degrees in a clockwise direction, and/or play a spinnaker card , and then must make the full legal move or not move at all. A spinnaker card increase 3 square moves to 5 squares and remains in effect until that yacht can no longer make  a 3+2 move in which case the spinnaker card is discarded.&lt;br/&gt; If, when it is a player's turn to mover, there is a yacht directly upwind, then the turn is forfeited.&lt;br/&gt;There are a number of squares marked with an anchor. When a yacht passes over one of these a Sailor's Luck card is drawn and acted upon, which may effect one or all vessels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
