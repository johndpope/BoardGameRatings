			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A graphical text adventure game. The game manual says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Life was never peaceful in the big city, but nothing had prepared you for the events to come. You, Tommy Astle, had seen all the facets of life in your job as news hound on the local rag, or so you thought. That night changed your opinions on a great many things. The deaths had occurred in strange circumstances and there had been talk of the supernatural. At first, you would have none of it but, as the investigation unfolded the truth began to dawn. A truth more terrible than you could guess. The woman had spoken of a creature from the realms of myth and superstition, the Loogaroo. Could it exist? Hack newswriter Tommy Astle was sure it could!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Werewolf Simulator is an adventure game with Graphics, written by Charles A Sharp of the Dreaming Djinn.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
