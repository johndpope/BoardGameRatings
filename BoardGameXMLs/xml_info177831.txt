			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stars and Nightmares is a supplement for Otherverse Games&amp;rsquo; Galaxy Command campaign setting. Inspired by the weirdest and coolest bad sci-fi you can name, the future of Galaxy Command plays like 80s cartoons and 70s comic books. This 29 page supplement describes a trio of new races for the Galaxy Command setting, which can be allies or enemies for your players. Darklighters and Starchildren are fierce rivals with similar star-based super abilities. One faction aids Galaxy Command for the sheer fun of adventure; their rivals aid WARSTAR and oppress the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conflict between the peace loving and heroic Galaxy Command organization and the brutal WARSTAR regime defines the setting, but those two powerful factions aren&amp;rsquo;t the only forces in the galaxy. This short supplement describes Planet Nightmare, a dangerous fringe world rocketed to galactic prominence by the export of a pair of very dangerous drugs. The monsters of Planet Nightmare certainly live up to their reputations, and the three new sentient races that call the fog-shrouded world home are even worse&amp;hellip; especially the cruel Quille Kathrix overlords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
