			<description>Iron and Fire is a diceless simulation of battles of the American Civil War in the Valley of the Shenandoah in 1862.  The game uses terrain and counters included with the game with essentially a miniatures system of tactical combat and movement.  Orders are issued to units with impulse counters.  Combat is resolved by calculating &amp;quot;total fighting power&amp;quot; of units rather than rolling dice and looking on a chart.  There are several tactical battle scenarios and also rules for an operational level game with point to point movement, with individual battles resolved with the tactical rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
