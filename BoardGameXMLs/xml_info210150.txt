							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Triple-Barreled: Savaged</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why settle for one barrel of buckshot when you can load up three at a discount? This package has all three volumes of the Dog House Gang's Buckshots adventures for Savage Worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That means a Judge gets a trio of wild west adventures that can be played separately as one-shot games, or linked together as part of a longer-running game. With three barrels packed full, the Judge gets a passel of completely described NPCs with statistics for Savage Worlds, not to mention a number of battle maps and the Dog House Gang's trusty Forks in the Road to help tailor these adventures to fit pert near any wild west gaming environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the three Buckshot adventures comes with an adventure synopsis, special notes for the Judge, fully described role-playing and battle scenes, maps, and fleshed-out NPCs equipped with character sheets and combat blocks. And all of the important characters have original illustrations to boot. Even if a Judge prefers not to use the stats, there's plenty of content packed in these pages to make Triple-Barreled suitable for any Wild West game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Savaged Buckshots: Triple-Barreled includes each of the following products. Please see each individual volume for more details about each adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Johnny Comes Marching Home - An introductory adventure for heroes of 1st to 3rd level.&lt;br/&gt;    Hidden Canyon - A traditional western adventure designed for cowpokes of 4th to 7th level.&lt;br/&gt;    For Whom the Bugle Blows - A challenging shoot 'em up for heroes of 7th to 10th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
