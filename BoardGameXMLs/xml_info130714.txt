			<description>Haze is a first-person shooter video game, developed by Free Radical Design and published by Ubisoft for the PlayStation 3. It was released worldwide in May 2008. Releases for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows were canceled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A multinational corporation with bio-medical expertise developed a drug called Nova-Keto-Thyrazine - also called Nectar, a &amp;quot;nutritional supplement&amp;quot; that enables soldiers to fight harder and smarter, but also induces a hallucinogenic effect, where soldiers are no longer cognizant of the real battlefield around them, instead viewing an idyllic, painless environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place over a three day period as Mantel battles a group of rebels known as &amp;quot;The Promise Hand&amp;quot; which is led by Gabriel &amp;quot;Skin Coat&amp;quot; Merino, with the player assuming the role of Shane Carpenter, a 25-year-old Mantel soldier. After Carpenter witnesses the effect Nectar is having on his fellow soldiers, and after a twist in the storyline Shane then turns rogue and teams up with The Promise Hand to take on Mantel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Haze (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
