							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">LOST The Answers</name>
									
			<description>You will play as one of the survivors of the ill-fated Oceanic flight 815 which crash-landed on an island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. You must go exploring with other survivors, visiting certain locations in order to discover answers to the many questions which surround the mysterious island.&lt;br/&gt;Each time a player gains Answers Counters, the Story track will advance. When this track reaches the end, the game is over and the player with the highest value of Answers counters is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LOST The Answers is a fun, Print and Play, Card Game (which uses a board) for 2 &amp;ndash; 5 players.
