							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nuclear Escape</name>
									
			<description>A game with an obvious political agenda (arms reduction) that succeeds anyway (at being an entertaining game).  Each team plays either the U.S. or the U.S.S.R. with a large nuclear weapons stockpile.  Most of the fun comes in the negotiations and voting.  Both sides win if they succeed in reducing the nuclear stockpile, Nuclear Escape.  One side can win by having less than 100 million in casualties, AND significantly more nuclear weapons than the other side and the rest of the world, Nuclear Domination.  The &amp;quot;game&amp;quot; wins with massive nuclear war, Nuclear Suffering (some of humanity survives) and Nuclear Annihilation (no humans survive).  Status quo is maintained (Nuclear Tension) if the world ends up on the &amp;quot;end of game&amp;quot; space with none of the other conditions having occurred.  In my limited experience, the last three scenarios occur half to three-quarters of the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
