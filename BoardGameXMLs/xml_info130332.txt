							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Stake-Out</name>
									
			<description>The Stake-Out is a 2 player unequal-forces strategy game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That darn Vampire has gone too far! With his flowing locks, eye-liner, and accent, he's setting the bar too high and the women-folk aren't willing to marry a simple guy anymore. They want poetry and compliments, charm and *ugh* romance! *shudder* Enough is enough! It's time for us villagers to stand together, put him in his place (and make sure he stays this time!)! He can't kill us all... right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stake-Out starts with the Villagers pouring into the Vampire's lair and the unaware Vampire napping peacefully in his coffin. Moving slowly and staying out of the shadows, the Villagers need to surround the Vampire in order to stake their claim. The Vampire flies in shadows, taking out the villagers that stray too far from the group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Villagers win by surrounding the Vampire with at least 3 pieces. The Vampire wins by not being staked (and hopefully eating all of the Villagers!)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
