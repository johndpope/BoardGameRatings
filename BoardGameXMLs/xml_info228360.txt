							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TradeWorlds: Tactical Core</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A breakthrough in the Deck-Building genre, the Tactical Core features 60 miniatures (5 unique) and a foldable 18&amp;quot; x 18&amp;quot; tactical board used in conjunction with the Exterra Edition core.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Tactical Core allows players to travel around the galaxy and attempt to &amp;quot;re-conquer&amp;quot; Terra Prime (the planet of origin for all the Mega-Corporations).  This game Expansion uses a &amp;quot;King of the Hill&amp;quot; mechanic which allows players to control Terra Prime for a certain amount of turns in order to obtain a victory!  As such your opponents must race to Terra Prime in order to try to stop you from winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, players can benefit from the use of all the other Expansions that add onto the game an extra layer for Tactical play.  There are a couple notes regarding how certain Expansions may alter Tactical game play (in minor ways)...  which will be explained further detail in the rulebook used by this Expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
