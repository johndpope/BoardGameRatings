							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Othereon: Lair of the Lightsbane</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You wake up feeling stiff, your mind clouded. There is a foul, sour odor in the air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you open your eyes, you see that you are lying on the floor on a mat of damp, moldy hay. Looking around, you find that you are locked in a small cell made of iron bars in a large stone room. Torches flicker on the wall, revealing other cells in the room, each one against a stone wall. The doors to the cells have large locks hanging from a length of chain through the bars, keeping the doors locked. There is a single wooden door leading out of the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you try and fail to shake the fog from your mind, you notice that all of your possessions are gone, and you are wearing an old, stained, tattered tunic. You have no idea how you got here. Last you remember, you had been going about your business in the town of Nowhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An introductory adventure for a party of 1st level characters.  Although set in the proprietary world of Othereon, the adventure is suitable for adapting to nearly any fantasy setting with small adjustments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is distributed as a ZIP archive including the following items:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Scenario PDF&lt;br/&gt;     Printer-friendly Scenario PDF (identical contents, no graphics)&lt;br/&gt;     Blue &amp;quot;old school&amp;quot; map in PNG format&lt;br/&gt;     Color map in PNG format&lt;br/&gt;     Color map of Nowhere (local town) in JPG format&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
