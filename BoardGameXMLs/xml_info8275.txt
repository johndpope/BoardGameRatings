			<description>A small game board the size of postcard and 4 wooden markers given way as free game during Essen 2003.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both the board layout and the game is inspired by PacMan. You both play one treasure hunter and one ghost. On your turn you may move a total of 3 steps with your hunter and your ghost. If the hunter lands on a treasure token, he may take it and score between 3 and 5 points. If your ghost lands on the other players hunter he is bumped back to the starting area, which sometimes saves you some running.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the last treasure is collected the game ends and the one who scored most on his treasure wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
