			<description>Hogswallow is an open ended, mythical storytelling game for 2 to 6 players. Players use the primitive imagery on the cards to guide the creation of a cohesive tale. The glyphs on the cards do not have any fixed meanings. They are purposefully pliable, designed to jump start the imagination, and may be interpreted differently from player to player and game to game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hogswallow is wonderfully adaptable and suitable for any age and any group, as the stories told are created completely by the participants. The rules provide the three most common variations of play, including one cooperative method, and two competitive ways to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the cooperative version &amp;quot;High Hogswallow&amp;quot;, the players take turns adding an element to the story, building off what has come before until one of them wins by bringing the story to  satisfactory conclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the competitive versions, players play only with their own hand of cards to either trump the single card that was played before them in a storytelling battle (Dilly Dallying) or to tell the best story using a limited hand of cards, argue it's merits compared to the other stories, and ultimately vote on whose was the best (Low Hogswallow).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
