			<description>A partnership card game, played with traditional playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 13 cards but only 12 tricks are played for. The 13th card is used at the start to give to your partner. This should indicate how many tricks you think you can win. The card will be used later in the game. Tricks are won by playing 1, 2 or 3 cards. 1 card played is just a normal trick as in Bridge or Whist, but there are specific rules about what constitutes a trick playing 2 or 3 cards.&lt;br/&gt;100 points equals a game. Before play begins, players decide on a 'best of' five, say, i.e. the first pair to score three games would be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
