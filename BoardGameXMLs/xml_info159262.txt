			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The caravan master Santos Boromite was personally assaulted and his Euriduis, the symbol of caravan power, was stolen. The item signifies full authority over all legs of the caravan and in the wrong hands would wreak havoc. You have been summoned to speak with the Governor Lando Shardo at once to save Timel yet again! Can you find the bandits responsible for the theft and bring them to justice. Timel wants a caravan traffic and unless this matter is taken care of quickly that won't happen. Just when you think you have it figured it out it turns out you were wrong!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is suitable for adventure groups of level 4-6. This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign, however it is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
