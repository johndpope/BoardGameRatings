			<description>This trivia game is &amp;quot;For those who know Newfoundland and for those who want to know it better.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Newfoundlandia is a cultural experience probing our past and present. Dabble in Viking lore. Recall the Smallwood Era. Saunter through the alleyways of North America's oldest city.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ARTS &amp;amp; CULTURE category tests your knowledge of Newfoundland's life  style, language, music, literature, arts and sports. PEOPLE &amp;amp; POLITICS draws on your knowledge of politics past and present and your ability to recall who's who and who was who in Newfoundland. HISTORY &amp;amp; GEOGRAPHY deals mainly with the events of our past, nomenclature, and general geographic knowledge. The TOWNIE TRIVIA section is designed to test your knowledge of St. John's, past and present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although every culture has its unique features, Newfoundland, to Newfoundlanders, is more than a quaint place. It's home. Newfoundlandia is about our land, our people and our ways. Based on our history, geography, and culture NEWFOUNDLANDIA will provide hours of entertainment for Newfoundlanders at home and abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
