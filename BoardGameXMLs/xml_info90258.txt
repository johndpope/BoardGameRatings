							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Everest</name>
									
			<description>You are intrepid explorers looking to climb up and down Mount Everest. The first one to do so wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses three dice, a pen, and a piece of paper. Each player writes down the numbers from one to twelve, and then from twelve to one. The one to twelve represent climbing up Mount Everest, the twelve to one represent climbing down Mount Everest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each player's turn they roll the dice once, and using the results either separately or combined, they cross off the numbers representing the ascension of Mount Everest. For example, if a 1, 2, and 4 are rolled, they could cross of 1, 2, and 4, or 3 and 4, or 2 and 5, or 1 and 6, or 7. Once they have crossed off all twelve numbers going up, then they start crossing out the numbers going down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
