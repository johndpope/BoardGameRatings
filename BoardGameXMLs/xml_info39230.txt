			<description>A game of skill, intrigue and fun(chess/draughts level). Based on 3,000 years of folklore, customs and superstitions of the spring festival of fertility. Players pit their wits against each other to move their own 15 pieces, which can be moved in varying ways, across the maroon and white board while outmaneuvering, blocking and capturing the pieces of their opponents with the aim of scoring the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
