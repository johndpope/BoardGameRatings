							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Iron Grip: Marauders</name>
									
			<description>Iron Grip: Marauders is a free-to-play online browser game with 3D turn-based battles using the Unity game engine. It has been in continuing development since the open beta was launched on January 17, 2011. The game was released through Steam, an online distributor, as part of their Free to Play catalog on September 30, 2011. Iron Grip: Marauders became available on Amazon.com through their Games Connect feature in 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;In Iron Grip: Marauders there are two parts to the game: the strategic resource management and the tactical 3D battles. Players decide on plans for scientific research, unit production, and which battles to enter. When a battle begins, the game switches to a 3D view using the Unity game engine where players are asked to deploy troops that were produced in the management phase.&lt;br/&gt;The game allows PvP battles once players reach a certain level, and cooperative boss fights, where a number of players each fight single-player battles to defeat a boss for greater rewards. There are also tournaments where players play several rounds to compete for a grand prize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Economy&lt;br/&gt;There are currently three resources in the game: gold, iron, and gems. Gold and iron are earned through raids, smuggling or assault missions, and are used to produce units, construct buildings, and perform research. Gems can be purchased with real world currency. Gems can be used to buy clothes for the in-game avatar, to develop special units on the black market, to buy perks which can increase research speed, unit production speed, or XP gain, or Gems can be used to buy energy, allowing players to participate in more battles in a given day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles&lt;br/&gt;Marauders uses the Unity game engine to depict fights on a 3D battlefield. At the beginning of a battle, players decide whether they want to perform a raid to capture resources or attempt a conquest to capture a base. Players must then strategize to spend a limited number of deployment points by selecting which of their units to set up on the battlefield. Battles are then effected through turn-based combat. At the beginning of each turn, every unit is given eight action points which can be used to move or attack. Each unit class has associated strengths and weaknesses when attacking which must be considered in order to choose the most effective unit for a specific task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Iron Grip: Marauders&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
