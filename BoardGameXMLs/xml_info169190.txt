			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF HORROR TO THE EDGE OF THE UNIVERSE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Award Winning Developers of OUTBREAK: UNDEAD...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outbreak: Deep Space is a Sci-Fi Survival Horror RPG that allows you to create your own nightmare world in the realm of Deep Space. Created using the same gritty, deadly, and unforgivable settings that you&amp;rsquo;d expect from the creators of Outbreak: Undead.&lt;br/&gt;O:DS is a open world system that allows you to build 3 types of settings of Horror:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infestation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creatures who mutate or bend the laws of nature, be it man-made or extraterrestrial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invasion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aliens with vastly superior technology to our own. This isn't war, it's slaughter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trans Dimensional&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vast Horrors from another reality, bending time and space and twisting the minds of man in it's wake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Players:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Choose from a wide variety of Character options, even use yourself as a template to build off of for immediate immersion!&lt;br/&gt;    Fluid Chracter Advancements and Unique party Roles (be the 'morale center', or 'gun nut' of the group!).&lt;br/&gt;    Fully customizable gear options to make any weapon, armor or device your sci-fi imagination can devise!&lt;br/&gt;    Go on GM designated 'Missions' to earn Survival Points and unlock a Finale to your Survival Horror Adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For GM's:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    As your players generate 'RISK' with their actions, you can choose to use RISK to purchase a wide variety of hazards and upgrades during the game!&lt;br/&gt;    A simple Encounter Based System, which keeps gameplay either scripted and structured, or fast and loose!&lt;br/&gt;    Run Single Session Horrors or Sweeping Campaigns of Terror&lt;br/&gt;    Build Dread Slowly, or create action/adventure moments of gameplay!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Random Scenario Generators&lt;br/&gt;No two games will ever be alike, as the ability to generate random scenario objectives, will allow a GM to experiment and weave narratives to link the randomly generated events together. Storytelling just got a lot easier now that you know the main plot points! The GM is always free to invent their own objectives and, more importantly, their own dramatic endings&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We don't ask the Question *If* you're going to die. But *how* and *what will you accomplish* in that time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
