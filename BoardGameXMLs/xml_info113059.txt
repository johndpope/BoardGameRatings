			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dungeon Empires players take on the role of a warrior aiming to build the most dangerous and feared dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One part of the game revolves around venturing out and raiding other player's dungeons too find creatures, rooms and other dungeon improvements. The player's character can be developed in tradition RPG fashion, including level-ups, stat points, various skills and equipment. Combat inside the dungeons is turn based but modified with a time component where some actions take longer so that enemies might get two turns instead of just one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other part of the game consists of building one's own dungeon. Players can place the looted rooms in their dungeon grid and connect them with hallways. Creatures can be added to fight intruders and various room improvements exist to bestow benefits to the creatures. Almost everything can be upgraded through magic runes (mostly obtained from disassembling unneeded items).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is free to play using a micro transaction shop to finance itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
