			<description>Each player tries to complete a picture of a fish, made up of 9 tiles. Some tiles are placed openly on the table, most are facedown. In his/her turn, a player can either take an open tile and place it in his/her picture, or flip open three tiles and take one of these (if it fits into his/her picture; the tile has to be adjacent to a previously placed one). After all tiles have been seen once, a player can either take one open tile or a facedown one (that s/he has remembered from a previous turn). The first player to finish his/her picture is the winner. &lt;br/&gt;The game is made difficult by the fact that the two pictures are mirror images of each other, so it isn't always obvious which picture a tile belongs to. There are four fish pictures included, so two or four players can play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
