			<description>Author Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;User Summary: Submission for the Game Chef 2010 Competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;A Journey to Fall&lt;br/&gt;Not knowing is worth a Question&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You asked a Question. Of someone. Yourself. World. Life. Doesn't really matter. It has been pressing your soul and now it's out there. No taking it back. You've asked it. Now there's a fragment of a street map drawn on your palm, in ink. Like an imprint from a cheap newspaper, but there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's here, in the City. Your Answer waits. So start moving. Through the streets. Through time. Step of the building already. Fall. Fly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can't stay on the Edge forever. There are too many things too be said. Your Skin knows. Watch it. Follow as the marks are written. Only... this is Your Question and Your Answer... So who's writing?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City is a construct providing Answers. It superimposes itself on any given surrounding, mimicing time period and space. Once unfolded, it ensures both obstacles and guidance. Feeding on lost Pledges of those that were here before, it exists solely to react to Questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
