							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Project: Vardukar</name>
									
			<description>From the Book's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vardukar: Corruption (common) of vard&amp;oslash;ger, from the Old Germanic word for a doppleganger or double. Used by D801 scientists after they discovered their first examples of replicated humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For decades, unknown to us, there has been another threat to humanities survival on the Earth. While the Grays played mind games and performed esoteric experiments another, more sinister, force was preparing the way for invasion. Unlike the Grays, the Vardukar have no pseudo altruistic goals, their plan will result in the extermination of all indigenous life on Earth. They intend to conquer, subverting us from within, eventually taking our planet for their own. Originating in a parallel dimension to ours the Vardukar are many times more alien than we can imagine. Their plans are laid. Their silent invasion has started and the majority of us don't even realise it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book gives all the information referees need to run scenarios or campaigns featuring the Vardukar. Inside you will find details of their motivations, capabilities and plans. It also explains how other groups are reacting to this threat. It is the second STOCS lite background book set in the PHASE I world. The first book, MAJI, dealt with the aliens known as the Grays and also gives additional information on Department 801.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ownership of MAJI or STOCS lite are not required to use the information presented in Vardukar. Throughout this book, you will find boxed scenario ideas involving the Vardukar. These will have to be fleshed out by the referee but will provide numerous plot hooks for your campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
