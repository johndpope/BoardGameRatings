							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bear&#039;s Den (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The southern seas of the Known Lands are home to countless small islands, most of which are uninhabited, many of which hide terrible dangers, and a handful of which contain incredible secrets. One small island that is well known to travelers is the one that hosts the Bear's Den, an outfitter and supply post for ships that have gone too long between ports. Uros Cern is a powerful ferran golemoid, but one with a keen eye for business. Somehow he manages to have whatever a ship needs, or produces it very shortly, and thus is one of the southern sea's most beloved figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This gazette features information on the Bear's Den, its proprietor, and the secret he uses to keep his business profitable when so many others have fallen into ruin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
