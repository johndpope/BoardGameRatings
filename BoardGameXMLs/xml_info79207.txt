							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yo! Noid</name>
									
			<description>Yo! Noid is a platform video game released in the United States for the NES by Capcom during November, 1990. It stars the Noid, the claymation mascot of Domino's Pizza in the late 1980s, going through fourteen different side-scrolling levels throughout various locations of New York City (including an 8-bit rendition of Central Park) to battle his evil duplicate, Mr. Green, for the public good, and for the massive pizza reward. The game is a modified version of an earlier Japanese release called Kamen no Ninja Hanamaru.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Noid has no life meter, and loses a life by either making contact with an enemy or running out of time before completing a level. He's equipped with a short range yo-yo for offense, but can gather magic points by collecting scrolls and use them for screen-clearing special attacks or very rare power-ups, both kinds of which are found in large scrolls opened with the yo-yo. Extra lives are awarded for every 20,000 points scored. Most levels are traveled on foot, but one features a skateboard, two a gyrocopter, and a part of one level features the &amp;quot;Pizza Crusher,&amp;quot; as seen on the &amp;quot;Avoid the Noid&amp;quot; commercials, and the front of the game box&amp;mdash;a cross between a large weight and a pogo stick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Yo! Noid , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
