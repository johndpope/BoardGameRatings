							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Milenian Scepter</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CIVIL WAR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unrest. Turmoil. Rebellion. As above, so below&amp;mdash;the cataclysmic events of the Wrath of the Immortals echo throughout the HOLLOW WORLD&amp;reg; setting. The Milenian Empire, with its classical Greek culture, has not escaped. Already the streets are unsafe, and the omens are getting worse...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The emperor is dead...long live the emperor! But is the new emperor a man of the people, or a tool in the hands of malevolent powers? Walk carefully, for no stranger is safe upon the streets these days, and adventurers least of all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mood of the capital city is turning ugly. Minions of the new emperor look on uncaring, while citizens disappear and philosophers fall to heedless mobs. The old emperor's elite guards are disbanded and scattered. Disorder reigns, and restless citizens threaten open revolt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And yet...a whisper is heard. Civil war can be averted. An ancient artifact, the Milenian Scepter, can rally those who would serve the Empire best. But the Scepter has been lost for generations, and who can say where it might be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trail leads into the depths of the city, and across a dangerous wilderness to a forgotten oracle. For the lucky and the bold, perhaps it will lead to...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE MILENIAN SCEPTER&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This stand-alone adventure is compatible with the WRATH OF THE IMMORTALS boxed set and the accessory HWR3, The Milenian Empire.&lt;br/&gt;     You will need the D&amp;amp;D&amp;reg; HOLLOW WORLD boxed set to play this adventure.&lt;br/&gt;     Easily adaptable to the AD&amp;amp;D&amp;reg; Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
