			<description>&amp;quot;A triple challenge strategy game&amp;quot; -- An intriguing game of pure skill, TRIAD offers and ever expanding network of strategic options for two players. Built on simplicity of game piece movement, TRIAD plays rapidly, but, to win, requires an uncommon accomplishment. You must achieve three unique outcomes: a Trap, a Capture and a Score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a board crisscrossed by lines in three directions.  Tiles are played on the intersections and remain where they are played unless captured.  Pawns are played inside the triangles and move from space to space.  The object of the game is to complete scores, traps and captures; once one of those is accomplished, a new round is played.  The first person to accomplish one of each is the winner; once you've accomplished one, you are not allowed to repeat that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A score is accomplished by moving a pawn from your goal to the opponent's goal.  A trap is accomplished by trapping an opponent's pawn so that it cannot move.  A capture is accomplished by capturing ten of your opponent's tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
