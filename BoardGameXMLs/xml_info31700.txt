			<description>From the Box (all spellings and grammar are identical to the box text):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Alaskan Gold Rush&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Game of High Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is the rousing new board game that combines the excitement of poker with the incredible adventures of the Alaskan Frontier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 1890's thousands of greenhorns flooded the Port of Skagway looking for riches beyond their wildest dreams. However, charging bull moose, ferocious Grizzly bear, raging rivers, ice flows and frost bite (sic) await all those who quest for gold. Only the most experienced gold-panners emerged from the wilderness unscathed with gold in their pockets. These SOURDOUGHS were the toughest of the tough, and would literally risk an entire year's earnings on the flip of a card in a poker hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Would you be willing to bet everything you have on a bluff, or will you play it safe. This is a game of strategy, luck and skill, where the game dramatically changes with the personality of the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The easy to play game includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 Board of Alaska (the game track is superimposed on a satellite picture)&lt;br/&gt;1 Deck of standard playing cards&lt;br/&gt;100 Silver and Gold coins (Poker Chips)&lt;br/&gt;100 $1 Dollar Bills&lt;br/&gt;6 Playing pieces&lt;br/&gt;1 Die (d6)&lt;br/&gt;27 Adventure cards (15 gold, 12 silver)&lt;br/&gt;6 I.O.U. Cards (4 gold, 2 silver)&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins as a simple roll-and-move mechanic with various spaces giving rewards or penalties. There are also spaces that can trigger a round of poker between the players - winner take all monies bet. The players must accumulate wealth enough to buy transportation to the gold fields and then find the motherlode (Big Vein). Once there, a final hand of poker is played and the person at the mine must have $500,000 remaining after the hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components are of high quality and it presents an interesting twist on a mundane night of poker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
