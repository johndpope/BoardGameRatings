			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The screaming of a woman&amp;rsquo;s voice can be heard over the hustle and bustle of Burden&amp;rsquo;s Peak. As the PCs look around, they spot a bloodcovered human woman running through the street. Her clothes are tattered and shredded. A shadow moves overhead, and the PCs see a huge red dragon fly over the city, fire bellowing from its gaping mouth. From the ground, the PCs can&amp;rsquo;t be sure, but it appears as though there is someone&amp;hellip;or something&amp;hellip;riding on the dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The woman runs up to the PCs and tells them that she was attacked on the way into the city by &amp;ldquo;devils from Hell&amp;rdquo;, as she calls them. She said her husband was killed, as were her children. She says she was allowed to survive to warn the city that its end was drawing near. She tells the PCs that a large creature that looked like a giant skeleton with a long, scorpion-like tail told her that the portal to Hell had been re-opened, and revenge would be theirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dragon makes one huge circle above the city, and then flies off to the north. Many homes and businesses are on fire, and the residents are in a state of total panic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
