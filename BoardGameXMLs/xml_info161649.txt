							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Escape from Fairyland</name>
									
			<description>When I woke up, I was trapped in a book. I was inside the kingdom of fairy tales! I had to act quickly, in cooperation with the friends I met there, to plan my escape from that world. However, only one person could make it out safely...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start the game, each player is dealt 1 fairy tale &amp;quot;heroine card&amp;quot; (Cinderella, Snow White, etc.) and 1 &amp;quot;attendant card.&amp;quot; Using the abilities listed on these cards, as well as other cards drawn throughout the game, players attempt to collect heart pieces, create a heart key, and escape from Fairyland together with their attendant before other players manage to do so. Remember, only one person can ESCAPE from FAIRYLAND!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
