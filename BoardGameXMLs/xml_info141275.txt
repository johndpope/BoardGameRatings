			<description>Whitetail Wilderness is a game about hunting white-tailed deer. Game play is scenario-driven, with a modular &amp;quot;board&amp;quot; of hex tiles created as per the scenario set up rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific game objective depends on the scenario, but generally requires the players to do one of the following within a specified number of game rounds:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Shoot the biggest buck&lt;br/&gt;- Shoot a specific buck&lt;br/&gt;- Shoot the most deer or most total points in bucks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control Hunter characters as their game personas. Six pre-generated characters are included as well as blank cards for  people to create their own. Each Hunter character is rated 1 to 5 on six different attributes. Event cards and player actions will test the skills of each Hunter character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, players execute two actions from among nine different choices. The players are attempting to find a good hunting area while increasing their rating on the Deer Encounter Meter, which is a measure of progress toward finding where the deer are located. Eventually, players will execute Hunt actions in the hopes of seeing deer. Once a player determines that deer are present, the deer need to be identified and brought in close enough for a shot. As the deer move closer and the encounter continues, the alertness level of the deer will generally begin to increase as they sense danger nearby. If the players aren't careful, the deer may flee and ruin their chances for a shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have to manage their Energy levels, items, Hunter cards and save up for bonuses while staying aware of what the other players are doing and attempt to blunt their efforts where possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
