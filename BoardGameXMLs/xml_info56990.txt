			<description>A modern fantasy setting for use with the Game Engine Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From The Genre:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Magical Girl genre is a common anime convention. It is basically a story of a young girl, typically in middle school, who somehow gains magical powers to defeat some great and terrible evil. Usually, the girl is reluctant, stumbling onto the magical power, and then has to learn how to harness her new abilities as the evil threats start to expand around her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Using this Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents rules and ideas for creating and running a Magical Girl campaign. On one hand, it is a tool for the Game Master, allowing her to create scenarios, design a campaign, and throw up evil villains for the party to face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the other hand, this book is also for the players. Inside are rules for Magical Girl generation and special powers. Also, a lot of the conventions of the genre are explained to give a player for the feel of the campaign&lt;br/&gt;she is joining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
