							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">2nd Guess</name>
									
			<description>Prove your knowledge of the second largest, the second farthest, the second fastest, the second of just about everything in this &amp;quot;2nd&amp;quot; trivia game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start by choosing a 2nd Guess topic and answer the question immediately for the most points.  If you are unsure of the answer, you can ask for a second chance which enables you to choose from 4 multiple choice answers - but you get fewer points and give other players a chance to score as well by second guessing you.  Highest score at game's end reigns as 2nd Guess champion - second to none!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
