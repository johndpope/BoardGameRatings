			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        CANCELLED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         The information that BGG has on this item indicates that Marvel Superstars TCG will not enter production.  This entry currently serves as a placeholder for the announced item and will likely later be removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marvel Superstars TCG is a new game based on the Marvel Universe as envisioned by the movies.  This is first time that the movies, including Iron Man, Hulk, Fantastic Four, the X-Men Trilogy, the Blade Trilogy and others, will interact with each other in a Marvel game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Starter Deck will be the first release, followed a few weeks later by the Booster Packs. Approximately 300 cards will be released in the first set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses to become a classic Marvel hero or villain, then constructs a team to defeat the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
