							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flip Four</name>
									
			<description>This is a collection of four card games published in the June, 1997 issue of Games Magazine. They require a standard deck of cards, and one game also requires a token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All four games begin by dealing out a 7x7 grid of cards, face up. Play involves flipping cards over, one at a time, according to rules which usually involve looking for matches in either rank or suit. The four games are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matchline - one or more players&lt;br/&gt;Connections - one or more players&lt;br/&gt;Saboteur - three players&lt;br/&gt;Cross/Block - two players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
