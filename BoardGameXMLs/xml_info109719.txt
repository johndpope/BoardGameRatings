							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Police Academy: The Series</name>
									
			<description>This is a children's game based on the cartoon series that followed the &amp;quot;Police Academy&amp;quot; films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players represent movie characters (Mahoney, Hightower, Captain Harris, etc) in a simple set collection game. The cops collect &amp;quot;badges&amp;quot; as they move around a circular pathway. If the grumpy captain is looking (when his token is face up) nobody can grab a badge. The first player to assemble a set of badges is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes a colorful board, 4 pawns, 4 police ID cards, Captain Harris, a die, and the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to be enjoyed by 2, 3, or 4 players ages 5 to 10 with no reading required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
