			<description>Inkarumi (&amp;quot;Stone of the king&amp;quot;) is a roll and write game in which the players aim to be the first to fill their entire pyramid of 21 fields. Six sixes are needed for the bottom row, five fives for the next, etc., with one one topping off the pyramid. &lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player rolls six dice only once and can check off all fields that are supported by two fields in the row below. However, if they roll more of a number than the row supports, they cannot fill that row. When a player rolls the exact dice to finish their pyramid, they have to yell &amp;quot;Inkarumi&amp;quot;. If another players yells first, they roll is forfeit. Anyone who calls out &amp;quot;Inkarumi&amp;quot; in error has to delete some previously filled fields. The first player to completely fill their pyramid is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
