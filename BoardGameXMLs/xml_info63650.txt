			<description>Addenda is played with a standard deck of cards. A trick always consists of four cards. If the total value of the cards is more than 17, the trick is lost by the player who took it above 17, otherwise it is won by the player who played the last card in the trick. Other rules give many strategic options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
