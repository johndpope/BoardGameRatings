			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who are you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find here, gentle reader, a collection of character concepts for both players and Gamemasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Able Seaman through Native Shaman to Trader &amp;ndash; in part-created form, each template comes with a description, notes on background, abilities, skills, and possessions, and a selection of Fates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can use character templates to aid in Hero creation, and GMs can use them to create NPCs quickly when required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, again, we ask you, who are you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Graeme Davis, these character templates have been designed to make Hero creation quicker and easier. They supplement the backgrounds given in the core rulebook by adding more detail according to a more specific character concept.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can use character templates for suggestions on spending points on abilities and skills, buying equipment, and creating Fates for a Hero. GMs can use them as a quick way to create NPCs of a desired type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nothing in any character template is mandatory. Their purpose is to aid in character creation, not restrict it. However, when departing from a character template, it can be helpful to think about why this particular character is different from the norm; doing so will help flesh out the character&amp;rsquo;s background and personality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
