			<description>Ost is a miniature medieval wargame rule. It can be played with 15mm figures or with the counters included in the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players first set up the playing surface (using a system of die rolls to find out what terrain features to use), deploy their armies, then write detailed orders for each of their units. Once the game has started, these orders can be modified only by leader pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement, ranged fire and melee combat are resolved simultaneously, losses are written on a unit sheet (a unit is destroyed only after loosing 20 men).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other rules cover morale, different unit types, and victory points (gained by securing objectives like a crossroad or a bridge).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content of the box:&lt;br/&gt;a felt playing surface, 120 x 90 cm&lt;br/&gt;two counter sheets&lt;br/&gt;seven sheets of terrain (hills, river, road, wood)&lt;br/&gt;a rulebook&lt;br/&gt;order sheets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
