			<description>This game has interesting ideas, especially in the manner you accrue track. The locomotive shaped board has many segments. In your turn you must move to an adjacent segment and you can then take the track allowed by the new segment that you are in. Furthermore, next turn, you cannot move back into the segment you were in at the start of your last turn (In other words, you cannot go to and from between the same two segments). However, it is possible to impede an opponent because no two players may be in the same segment. As up to six can play, this board can get pretty crowded. In each segment (except for two special symbols) there are images that relate to the piece of track you receive. This track is laid on the tabletop area, there is no board on which they are to be placed. Therefore, your direction and length of track is only limited by the size of your table!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Track received must be added to one of your lines immediately. The objective is to build three independent lines that end up with a black tile (a station). When one player has achieved this, the game ends and you score a point for every track tile on your network. The most points, wins (note that this might not be the player that ended the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
