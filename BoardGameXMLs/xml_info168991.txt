							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing</name>
									
			<description>Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing is an application software program for teaching touch typing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The typing program was initially released in late 1987 by The Software Toolworks and has been published regularly ever since. It was originally created by independent computer programmer Charles Haymond. Editions of Mavis Beacon are currently published by Encore Software (hybrid Mac and Windows) and Software MacKiev (Mac OS X only) and are available throughout the retail sales world. An early version supported both QWERTY and the alternative Dvorak Simplified Keyboard layout. Later versions supported only QWERTY until the 2011 Ultimate Mac Edition from Software MacKiev which returned full Dvorak keyboard lessons to the product. Earlier versions were made for Apple II, Commodore 64, Atari 400/800 (version 1 only), Apple IIGS, Atari ST, Mac OS, Windows, Palm OS (version 16), and Amiga systems. The current Windows and Mac versions are published under the Br&amp;oslash;derbund trademark by both Encore and Software MacKiev.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This application/utility also includes games to test typing skills, including a car racing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
