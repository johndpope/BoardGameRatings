			<description>Legends of Time and Space: Repel Boarders Starboard is a role-playing game system of which this is a wholly contained adventure. Each player controls one or more characters who go adventuring. Players mark their characters with cardboard pieces and use a hexagon board to&lt;br/&gt;depict an encounter area. One hexagon (hex) equals roughly one meter to five feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is driven by paragraphs and designed to be played either solitaire or with other players. If played with others, one player should be the Game Master (GM), reading the instructions aloud and keeping close track of game time and the party's current progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: Although the game states it has game pieces, in fact it does not.  Pieces from other games in the series should be adequate or any appropriate square counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The colonists of a nearby planet are under sporadic attack and you are hired to pilot a small ship in to rescue them.  The game includes travel and combat, both in space and man-to-man. It can be used in conjunction with other modules in the series, as the rules are fully compatible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be downloaded here: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.darkcitygames.com/docs/RBS.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.darkcitygames.com/docs/RBS.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
