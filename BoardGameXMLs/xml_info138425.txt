							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Rail Golem</name>
									
			<description>From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A powerful model that uses Burning Tokens to power its spells, abilities and attacks. It can be the heavy hitter many crews lack, and even though expensive, you are getting a massive piece for only 9 (or 10) SS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rail Golem works well with models that can put Burning Tokens on it, but it is self sufficient enough to work with any crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rail Golem has very significant offensive abilities. Its melee weapon has a good reach, is Paired, and causes grievous damage, and it can use Burning Tokens to get positive twists to attack or damage, or an extra melee attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main &amp;quot;trick&amp;quot; with the Rail Golem is to balance out how it accumulates and uses Burning Tokens. Often, you will need to balance between increasing attacks in a short-term way (by increasing attacks and damage flips, or getting an extra attack), healing up (by burning all tokens for 1 Wd of healing each), or saving them up to Reactivate (which costs 5 tokens, but can be very powerful.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
