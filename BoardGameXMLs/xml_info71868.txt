			<description>&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Excitebike 64 (エキサイトバイク 64, Ekisaitobaiku Rokujūyon)  is a video game published by Nintendo  and developed by Left Field Productions. It was released in North America on April 30, 2000 for the Nintendo 64 video game console. It is the series' first 3D game. Excitebike 64 is the sequel to the acclaimed Nintendo Entertainment System game Excitebike and is the second title in the series. It was later succeeded by the Wii game Excite Truck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can choose from one of six riders, each with his own pre-set handling attributes. To control the bike, use the analog or D-pad moving the bike A to accelerate, B to brake, R for slide, and Z for a turbo boost. Just as in the original, holding down gives you more air on jumps, while holding up aims your front wheel forward to enable landing on slopes. The game isn't meant to be an accurate motorbiking simulation. It chooses to follow the original in giving &amp;quot;extreme&amp;quot; jumps and physics, creating a far more &amp;quot;exciting&amp;quot; atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main game features a 20-track season mode. Completing races unlocks more tracks and features. Also included is a tutorial that will teach you how to play through 17 different tracks. Also included are a variety of exhibitions and time trial modes that let you do more activities other than the main game. A major feature is the track editor, where you can create your own fully-functional track and save it into the game. The announcer, Limua, shouts out the tricks and crashes throughout the race. Also featured is the original Exitebike, the first in the series.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Excitebike_64,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
