			<description>Grobda (グロブダー, Gurobudā) is a multi-directional shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1984. It is a spin-off from Xevious, as the player's tank first appeared in that - as an enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a tank in an arena filled with numerous indestructible obstacles - and several enemies such as tanks. When the player kills an enemy, it will cause an explosion and other enemies that happen to be in the way at the time will share the same fate as the first one. But if the player's tank is too close to the explosion it will also be killed. The player's tank has a shield that offers temporary protection from enemy fire, but constant firing from enemies will make it disappear. Each level is called a &amp;quot;battling&amp;quot;, and there are 99 in total. If all 99 battlings are beaten the high score table will show that you have beaten 100 battlings. There is also a level select screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game runs on Namco Super Pac-Man hardware but with a DAC for speech. Each stage begins with a voice saying &amp;quot;Get ready!&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arcade version was ported to PS1 for Namco Museum Volume 2, as well as Namco Museum Battle Collection, which includes a more accurate port. It also ported on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan, released on November 10, 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Grobda,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
