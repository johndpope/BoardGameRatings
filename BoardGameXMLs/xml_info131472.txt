							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Delving Deeper (Special Limited Edition Boxed Set PDF)</name>
									
			<description>user comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Special Limited Edition Boxed Set  was distributed in September 2012 in PDF format to customers who had pre-ordered the game in early 2011.  The PDFs were released in advance of the shipping of the printed boxed set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The page counts include illustrated cover pages.  The &amp;quot;no art&amp;quot; edition PDFs include cover illustrations, but no interior artwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Delving Deeper RPG closely emulates the rules of the earliest version of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular roleplaying game. Go back to a time when every weapon did d6 damage, clerics could cast no spell at first level, only fighters could use magic swords, and if you wanted a locked door opened you had to bash the thing in!  It is difficult to imagine in a world where multiple, weighty tomes comprise the rules; but this single, small book contains all you need to build a campaign that can span decades of real time! If you&amp;rsquo;re tired of trying to find the rule for determining whether your fighter is left-handed and is able to swim and just want to kill some goblins, have we got a game for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delving Deeper is an attempt to recreate the gameplay of the early editions of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.  The rules are divided into three booklets:&lt;br/&gt;Volume 1: The Adventurer's Guide (42 pp.)&lt;br/&gt;Volume II: The Referee's Guide  (34 pp.)&lt;br/&gt;Volume III: The Monster &amp;amp; Treasure Reference (42 pp.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;admin comment&lt;br/&gt;when we can determine this is the same as Delving Deeper Boxed Set, we will merge the two Items&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
