			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CardFit is a card game that blends exercise and strategy together into one fun, addictive product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two primary modes of play: 1st to 40! and Bid War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1st to 40!, players take turns drawing exercise and repetition cards, then performing the movements that are described on the cards. Starting in the second round, players may begin to use modifier cards, which can do anything from change the exercise, skip a player, increase the amount of repetitions, and even make other people perform additional exercises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player earns the number of points listed on the card for successfully completing a round. The first player to earn 40 points, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Bid War, players divide the repetition cards equally between them and draw 3 modifiers. Each round, an exercise card is drawn. Players then bid by using their rep cards. The highest bid gets to do the exercise for the number of reps they bid. In the case of multiple players bidding the same number, those players may all do the exercise or they can play an additional bid--that additional bid adds to the number of reps that they have already played. After the bidding, players may use modifiers to alter the workout. Players earn the points listed on the card for successfully performing the exercise. The player with the most points after all the rep cards are done, wins! In groups of 4 or more, it is acceptable to reshuffle and re-deal the rep cards once or twice in order to extend play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CardFit brings friends and family together in a fun and competitive environment while enabling them to exercise at the same time. This game is child friendly&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
