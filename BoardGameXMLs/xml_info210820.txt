			<description>Author summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOU are a Royal - half-magic, half-human. You're one of the court cards from the tarot deck - the impetuous Princess of Wands, the calculating Knight of Pentacles, the empire-building Queen of Wands, and so on. You use magic like a brick through the window of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THEY are the Arcane - Death, The Hanged Man, The Devil, The Lovers, The Star. They are reality-bending monsters that wear human skin like a suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TONIGHT, before dawn, you are going to corner one of them and take their power for your own in a heist the likes of which the worlds have never seen. The city is going to burn. It's going to be beautiful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ROYAL BLOOD is a rules-light heist roleplaying game for three or more players and a gamesmaster. To play, you'll need a deck of tarot cards and a handful of coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- from product page&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
