							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Adventures Under Turtleopolis</name>
									
			<description>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Adventures Under Turtleopolis, is graphically based on the late 80's cartoon that originated from the comic book by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 to 4 players play as one of the four Turtles competing around the board while trying to avoid traps and bad luck spaces. The object of the game is to reach the end of each game board, which supposedly represent a different mission:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 1: Rescue April&lt;br/&gt;Game 2: Take Over The Technodrome&lt;br/&gt;Game 3: Battle to Stop the Ooze&lt;br/&gt;Game 4: Race for the Pizza Parlor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These four boards came on the back of the Ralston Cereal Boxes and as such are in conjunction a very simplistic version of similar games like &amp;quot;Snakes and Ladders&amp;quot;. Just throw the dice and let luck decide in which space you&amp;acute;ll end up. Some spaces have rewards while others punishments. In reality is what you can expect from a board game that came on a cereal box, but it has a lot of charm and richness of details in the drawings and graphic design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was another Ralston&amp;acute;s TMNT cereal box board game called &amp;quot;Adventures In Turtleopolis&amp;quot; that came out during the same time, but it didn&amp;acute;t have art as nice as this nor as much TMNT thematic enemies and elements such as the Technodrome or the sewers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
