							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Let Them Eat Shrimp: Swim Alone</name>
									
			<description>The Let Them Eat Shrimp: Swim Alone promotional pack creates a brand new solo variant of the game, which was originally for 2-5 players.  The solo pack has 2 instructional cards plus 5 placement cards. The goal of the solo game is to survive 5 days in the hostile ocean. At the start of each day, a player flips a placement card, which determines the placement requirements for the day.  The solo cards open up a whole new experience for Let Them Eat Shrimp!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
