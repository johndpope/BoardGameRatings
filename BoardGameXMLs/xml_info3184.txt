			<description>The board is a map of the United States c. 1822, the westernmost states being Missouri and Louisiana. Because dice were frowned upon as instruments of the horrible vice of gambling, included a teetotum, a sort of spinner used to randomly yield a number from 1 to 8.  This is used to determine the first player. Lines are drawn on the map to connect cities in a continuous path which players must follow. However, the cities are not named, but numbered. &lt;br/&gt;Upon arrival, at a new city, the player must correctly name the place and, if playing the advanced version, its population, or lose a turn and try again.. The first to reach New Orleans (population 10,000) wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first known game published in the United States.  Unlike other games, it was also invented in the USA rather  than being a copy of a British game, as many later ones were. The publisher were sellers of books in New York and later in 1822 also released Traveller's Tour Through Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A copy is apparently still in existence and archived at the American Antiquarian Society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
