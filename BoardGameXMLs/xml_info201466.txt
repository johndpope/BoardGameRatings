							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fear Itself (2nd Edition)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Fear Itself plunges ordinary people into a disturbing contemporary world of madness and violence. Players take the roles of regular folks much like themselves, who are inexorably drawn into confrontation with the creatures of the Outer Dark, an unearthly realm of alien menace. With or without its distinctive mythology, GMs can use it to replicate the shudders and shocks of the horror genre in both film and literature.&lt;br/&gt;Fear Itself serves as an ideal platform for one-shot games, in which, like any self-respecting horror flick, few, if any, of the protagonists are expected to survive the climax. It can also be employed to run ongoing campaigns in which the leading characters gradually discover more about the disturbing supernatural reality hiding in the shadows of the ordinary world. Over time, they grow more adept at combating them&amp;mdash;or spiral tragically into insanity and death.&lt;br/&gt;This expanded edition explains how to adjust both the game rules and the assumptions of Gamemasters and players to different styles of game, from bloody one-shots to extended investigative games. Revised rules update Fear Itself with ten years of GUMSHOE development and play experience.&lt;br/&gt;Included are three sample scenarios:&lt;br/&gt;The Circle: in this one-shot, the players take on the roles of participants in an experimental drug trial. When one of their group disappears, they must investigate what happened to him &amp;ndash; before the same horrific fate consumes them, too!&lt;br/&gt;The Ocean Game: Play the Ocean Game, and find meaning in your life. Play the Ocean Game, and win eternity. Play the Ocean Game, and drown in it. In this miniseries, the players participate in a cryptic contest run by a Mystery Man. The prize is glorious. The cost is more than sanity can bear.&lt;br/&gt;The Dispatchers: No backup. No assistance. Just a voice on the radio in the night, asking you for help. In this campaign, the player are cast as unlikely monster hunters, drawn together by a mysterious radio signal. Can they survive their missions long enough to save themselves?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
