			<description>Quatrix is a two-player game with old world qualities. If you like Backgammon, this game is for you. You must use your best strategies along with the luck of the dice in order to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rings and discs are used in Quatrix. When a disc and a ring are combined, they form a PiP (piece inside piece). Squeezing the ring with the disc inside allows the player to move both pieces together. There are two sets of PiPs in each color, seven pips in each set, and two sets of dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the playing pieces are set up as PiPs on the starting tracks. Players will separate their PiPs as the game progresses. The first player to get his or her pieces reassembled as PiPs across the finish line of the same color wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rings, discs, and PiPs can mose horizontally and vertically backwards and forwards, but never diagonally. Pieces can jump rings and discs, but you may not jump over a PiP of the opposing color. The board is 7 squares wide by 11 squares long, and has a starting track on each end, and a finish line on the opposite side of the board six tracks away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(From the instructions)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
