			<description>After the Battle of Kursk began a large-scale offensive of the Soviet Army. On leaving in 1943 to the Dnieper the Soviet command had decided immediate crossing it. This option does not have any time to the Germans to strengthen the left bank of the river and turning it into an impregnable &amp;quot;East Wall&amp;quot;. Due to the haste of the operation craft sorely lacking, so the main forces crossed the Dnieper on improvised means: fishing boats, makeshift rafts of logs, barrels, tree trunks and planks. The entire burden and forcing the first battles on the left bank fell to infantry units. About heavy fights indicates the following fact - for the crossing of the Dnieper in 2438 soldiers were awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union, which is more than the total amount awarded for the entire previous history of the awards. This title was awarded to not only the commanders of battalions and regiments, but also up to the distinguished junior officers (NCOs). Such mass awarding a single operation was the only one in the history of war. In memory of all the fallen Soviet soldiers dedicated to this game. We remember.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed for two players - one led by the Red Army, the other - Wehrmacht troops entrenched on the banks of the Dnieper. Soviet Player has 6 turns not only to cross the river and take a foothold, but also to keep it to the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has simple rules and takes 30-60 minutes. Released in the PPP format in the second issue of the magazine Stratagema (Стратагема)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
