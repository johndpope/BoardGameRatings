							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sterling Sharpe: End 2 End</name>
									
			<description>This video game was endorsed by retired NFL wide receiver Sterling Sharpe (his career with the Green Bay Packers ended in 1994 due to a neck injury). The game was rated Kids to Adults by the Entertainment Software Ratings Board advisory panel. The object is to win football games by following and complying with the standard rules of the National Football League. Referees deliver penalties to players (human or CPU) who commit penalties; these always carry either a five-yard penalty or a ten-yard penalty depending on the severity of the offence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sterling Sharpe: End 2 End&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
