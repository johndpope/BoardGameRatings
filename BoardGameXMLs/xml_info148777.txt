			<description>Take to the skies in a tabletop dogfight! Players take turns rolling dice to soar across the board, attempting to shoot down their opponent's planes while using evasive maneuvers or returning fire. With 12 2-sided, shiftable sky panels that make up the game board, an Event deck that alters battlefield conditions, and the option of choosing to play as 1 of 8 unique pilots instead of a basic ship, no 2 Dogfight games will be the same!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About Dogfight D6's: Whatever version, Dogfight D6's is a dice rolling, aerial combat themed game which was designed to allow for competitive players while still providing appeal to gamers who prefer less wordy, &amp;quot;quick pick up and play&amp;quot; kinds of games. The objective remains the same for either audience (roll dice to move and shoot down planes), however, the rules are written to allow players of both audiences to participate in the same game and enjoy it without being imbalanced towards either one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features in this Version:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     2 sided, interchangable playing field pieces- each has 1 &amp;quot;all blue spaces&amp;quot; side and 1 &amp;quot;cloud patterns&amp;quot; side, allowing for a different playing field each game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Plane tokens for up to 8 players, although the rules are structured to allow for more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Pilot Cards and Custom Pilot Setup Rules- Now choose either the Basic Pilot Setup (all Stats are set at 2 with no abilities) or use these rules/cards to play a game with unique abilities and rolled Stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Event Cards-Cards which affect gameplay and battlefield conditions as long as they are active.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
