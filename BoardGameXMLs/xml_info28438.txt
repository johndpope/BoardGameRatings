							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Asterix to the Rescue</name>
									
			<description>Featuring the best-selling comic character Asterix, this is an interesting riff on choose your own path books.  Rather than just work through the choices in the book, the player is using the book and attempting to transverse a map.  Another difference from typical choose your own path games, the player can gain and use a number of cards, like magic potions and a coin bag.  In addition, some of the paths available are determined by a die roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a die featuring many of the Asterix characters.  In addition, the game comes with a clever cipher and code breaking card.  One more difference between typical choose your own path books, this one is a weighty 284 pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the cover, &amp;quot;Use your skill to help Asterix outwit the Romans - before his magic potions run out!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
