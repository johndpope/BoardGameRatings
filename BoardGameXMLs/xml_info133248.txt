			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kingfisher Down! takes place in the early 1940's as the world is deeply entrenched in WWII. The Allies have made an incredible discovery off the cost of France. An accident has left an experimental Nazi nuclear submarine stranded on a deep water shelf. Time is of the essence and the Allies have called upon a multi-national team of scientists and journalist that happen to be near the crash site. This unlikely group of heroes must rush to the site and use deep water gear to explore the crash and look for the elusive Enigma Machine in the wreckage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules: Characters are made using 10 dice, hooks and tales and pumping are allowed. The team should contain any combination of scientists and journalists, as well as one military officer to command the team. The players should feel free to invent cool military gear to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
