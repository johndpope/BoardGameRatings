			<description>PMC 2640: Hell on Echidna is not only a demo version &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s also a mini expansion for those of you who purchased the PMC 2640 rulebook earlier!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It contains all the basic things you need to play: core rules (identical to those found in the rulebook); a shortened terrain list; a special, new terrain generator for post-apocalyptic planets; rules for composing an army with basic equipment; a new scenario (not featured in the main rulebook); and a list of several units (including two new ones!) along with all of its special rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, it includs a new Battle Honour, which may be given to your troops if you decide to play your campaign battles on Echidna or a similar devastated planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PMC 2640 is the third wargame made by Assault Publishing and deals with warfare in the 27th century. Although there are plenty of sci-fi wargames, PMC 2640 has many interesting features which make it unique and very enjoyable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PMC 2640 is designed as a &amp;lsquo;true company scale&amp;rsquo; wargame, which means that it runs smoothly both with a few as well as a few dozen units on the battlefield. This was achieved by eliminating sophisticated, but unnecessary special rules, and limiting the number of counters to morale markers only, represented by D6 dice. The ruleset itself is compact and elegant, written in simple, &amp;ldquo;international&amp;rdquo; English, leaving no place for vagueness and multiple interpretations. On the other hand, PMC 2640 offers countless possibilities, as the rulebook contains a few dozen of unit entries, six scenarios and seven terrain generators, all of which ensure that no two games will look the same. The classic alternate activation (with small balancing modifications) makes the game fast and addictive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
