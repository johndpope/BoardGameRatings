			<description>The fairies desperately want to return to their home among the stars. For this they need stardust (the lifeforce of fairies) and what better place to find it than in Starfall Forest?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every now and then a star will come falling down into the forest where the fairies are hiding and waiting. As soon as a stars lands, the fairies are eager to get to it. Moving from tree to tree, as fairies prefer to stay hidden from sight, they all try to get to the star as quickly as possible. Only when a fairy has collected enough stardust can she make it back home to the stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the race to the stars is on! But beware.. There are venomous snakes about. Try not to get bit as this will cost you the precious stardust you so desperately need to go back home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All fairies will eventually manage to return home, clever as they are. But who will get there first?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
