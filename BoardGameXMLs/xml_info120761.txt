Nine sample mechs are included, along with a design system for creating your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Society creation guidelines and generation tables to help GMs flesh out their worlds with vibrant, living cultures and their ages-old conflicts. Every culture comes with built-in struggles to fuel adventures on that world and give GMs a quick and easy hook for pulling in the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If paper books aren't your style, grab this PDF now for this exclusive content!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
