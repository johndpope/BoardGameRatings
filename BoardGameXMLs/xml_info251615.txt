							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trinkets - A Miscellany</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The places adventurers wander into are often abandoned, but at one point in time many of the dungeons and ruins that intrepid murder hobos loot were occupied by normal people doing normal things - and, sometimes, by abnormal people doing abnormal things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GMs often struggle to come up with loot that is interesting for its own sake, or for the story that it can tell, rather than for its gold-piece value or its magical potency. We aim to fix that. Trinkets - A Miscellany is intended to inject more detailed descriptions, variety and flavour into your RPG worlds. The tables you'll find inside this book are system-agnostic, but work most easily in a fantasy setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this download you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    tables full of new and unique trinkets that your players will treasure - and be intrigued by&lt;br/&gt;    over 100 pre-built ideas for trinkets ready to drop straight into your game, eash designed to add depth to your worlds and to provide interesting hooks for future adventures&lt;br/&gt;    adventure hooks, NPCs, and new locations to drop into your games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
