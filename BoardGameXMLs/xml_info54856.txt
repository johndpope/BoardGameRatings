							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Just One Die Soccer</name>
									
			<description>Just One Die Soccer is a solitaire statistical, replay-oriented game on Soccer.&lt;br/&gt;It is based on the comparison between the goal for and against for the two teams involved in the match, with several additional options (as random period of form, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;After a few simple calculations, each game is resolved with a single die roll: so it is possible to replay a season in one sitting.&lt;br/&gt;Basic game comes with rulebook, charts, Italian Serie A 200/2009, Swiss Superleague 2008/2009 and Austrian Bundesliga 2008/2009. More seasons and leagues soon to come.&lt;br/&gt;Available directly from the designer (send an email to pumaye@virgilio.it or pumaye@gmail.com)&lt;br/&gt;Also available through wargamedownloads.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
