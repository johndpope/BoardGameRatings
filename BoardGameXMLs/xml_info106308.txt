							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paper Ninja</name>
									
			<description>Paper Ninja is an &amp;quot;Action Strategy First Person Paper Slasher&amp;quot; as it involves swiping your finger across the screen to cut through horde of aggressive Paper Ninjas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game play is considered simple, just avoid the enemies' weapon and cut across the Paper Ninja's edge. But you will be surprise how this simple concept can leave you begging for more actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paper Ninja requires players to make split second strategic decisions while giving them the freedom to explore the enormous combo possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In short, Paper Ninja is a simple and clear cut game that drives for ever improving control mastery. Players can keep practising to improve their &amp;quot;Critical Hit&amp;quot; timing or challenge their scores against friends in Openfeint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who says paper cuts can&amp;rsquo;t kill?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
