			<description>It's been a long time coming. You and a particular co-worker at the Arcane Bakery simply cannot work together anymore. In a moment of frustration, you challenge them to a duel: After close, no holds barred. The loser resigns. And cleans up the mess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcane Bakery Clash is a resource management game, where your resource is time. Specifically, time to cook the magical treats that you will use against your co-worker. You can choose 2 actions per turn, and you will either put a recipe card in the oven, peek into an oven (in case you forgot what you started cooking), turn up the heat (and advance the track on the back of a recipe card), or take a recipe out of the oven (putting the card into play). With these actions you will bake new treats that are used to either reduce your opponent&amp;rsquo;s health, heal yourself, or allow special actions. When a player&amp;rsquo;s health is reduced to zero, they lose the game, and their opponent wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
