			<description>Don't let your LIGHT go out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Christian Board Game designed to get you acquainted with the Gospel message of the Bible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Keep the LIGHT of your churches burning and be the first to build the Temple of God with 12 candlesticks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Keep your churches from dying as Babylon and going to the graveyard!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play: Players take turns answering questions from the Trial Cards included with the game. A right answer allows you to gain candlesticks by moving a slider clip UP on your church card. A wrong answer will cause you to lose candlesticks by moving the clip DOWN. The number of spaces to move up or down is determined by the complexity of the question and is stated on the Trial Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to maximize his/her church card by reaching the top (12 candlesticks) has successfully built the Temple of God!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player who loses the last of his or her candlesticks (bottom of the church card) loses that church. It dies as Babylon and should be flipped over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
