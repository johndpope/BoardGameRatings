							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anointed Guardian</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heavenly hosts do not often interfere in the affairs of mortals. Some, however, are given the duty to be bound as partners to people of pure heart and strong faith. These people are trained in the art of war, honed as instruments of the gods against the forces of evil upon the material plane. They are then given a divine eidolon that can be summoned to fight by their side. Together, celestial and mortal fight as one: the anointed guardian. The anointed guardian and her divine eidolon form an elite fighting unit, using their teamwork feats to provide formidable offense, especially against evil foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    All the information to play the Anointed Guardian as a hybrid class for the Pathfinder RPG and NeoExodus: A House Divided Campaign Setting.&lt;br/&gt;    All new Divine Eidolons with skills, alignment, base forms, new evolutions and&lt;br/&gt;    7 New Eidolon subtypes including Angel, Celestial Beast and Foo Creature and &lt;br/&gt;    All new alternate class, the Profane Marauder with the information to play this class for the Pathfinder RPG and NeoExodus: A House Divided Campaign Setting.&lt;br/&gt;    All new Fiendish Eidolons&lt;br/&gt;    10 New Fiendish Eidolon subtypes including daemon, demon, hell hound, kyton and nightmare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
