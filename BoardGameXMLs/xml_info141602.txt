			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mounts are a popular staple of the fantasy genre. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s the knight riding off into the sunset on his trusty steed, or the shady horse merchant trying to disguise his broken-down nags as spirited chargers, or the cunning horse thief, mounts and horses are not only a person&amp;rsquo;s primary means of transportation, they are also an adventurer&amp;rsquo;s constant companions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, mechanically, all horses are just about the same. Barring a paladin&amp;rsquo;s special mount or possibly a druid&amp;rsquo;s animal companion, there&amp;rsquo;s not a lot of ways to make them interesting&amp;hellip;until now. A Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s Grimoire: Steeds and Stallions presents a number of alternate rules, as well as a wealth of background information, designed to allow you to liven up horses in your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents new rules for differentiating horses based on their quality, allowing you to mechanically represent the difference between a slow and plodding farm horse and well-bred, fiery-spirited race horse. Further, it allows you to give your horses some personality, by providing a number of quirks, traits, and habits common to real horses, which can be hand-picked or randomly generated for any horse. Finally, the book provides rules for racing horses, both in organized races and in similar scenes, such as chases or even mounted combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
