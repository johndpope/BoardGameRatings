			<description>East German educational game to help youngsters with their numbers and counting. Based on picture lotto, each player gets a player-card with 10 spaces to fill.The spaces are numbered 1 to 10 but not in order so that the player must count to know where to place a card. Each player-card has a different illustration. The illustration is important because only cards that match that illustration are eligible to be placed on the player-card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to fill their player-card, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
