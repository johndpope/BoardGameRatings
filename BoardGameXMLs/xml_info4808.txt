			<description>(from the box)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A Military Strategy Game&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A military game of logic, luck and tactics for 2 players&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Your assignment, strategist, is to shoot down your opponent's squadron before he gets yours!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this aerial combat game, players must move their Fighter-Bombers across to the opposite sides of the board (the 'target areas') and release their bombs in order for their planes to gain maneuverability and become Fighters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second goal is to use your Fighters and your friendly Flak to shoot enemy planes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as your first set of three Fighter-Bombers enters the opponent's half of the board, a further three enter the game on our side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is defined by three dice numbered (blank), '1' or '2' apiece, each dice defining movement for one plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemy planes are shot down by 'over-flying' (jumping) them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of their movement turn, intruding planes are also subject to 'flak bursts' (color form type markers preset by players on a replica of their half of the battlefield, and slid under the transparent cover sheet which covers the gameboard).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any planes sitting on 'flak bursts' after the replica map is slipped under them are destroyed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player to succeed in shooting down his opponent's squadron of six planes wins the game!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
