			<description>The 10th War is a head to head battle game about World War 10. It is based in the future around 2300 AD. There are currently two factions, the rebels and the oppressors. Customize your deck, command vehicles, events, characters, and equipment. Use those cards to attack their forces, roll dice, and once their characters have all been cleared out of the way, you can attack and destroy their base, winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
