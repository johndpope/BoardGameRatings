							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">More Things in Heaven and Earth: A Campaign Frame Compilation</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old gods drink themselves to oblivion in a Philadelphia dive bar. A mysterious death and possible theft are the Saint-Germain legacy. In a small Southern town, that which rises will not be put down. Hard-boiled gumshoes investigate magical crimes in the twisted '50s. Soldiers hunt down and destroy horrible elder beings in Project M.A.G.I. Punk rock channels magic stolen from the Devil, live... from New Amsterdam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a collection of the first nine Mortal Coil campaign frames, plus one additional bonus campaign frame available only in this compilation. A copy of the core Mortal Coil rules is required to use these in your Mortal Coil game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A campaign frame is a fully sketched out setting in the form of a detailed theme document, with all of the world set-up choices written out in detail. These are designed to be customizable by your game group. Each frame contains options for more than one tone and magic level. You choose a tone and pick the magic level that is appropriate for your game. Players then create characters, or choose one of the characters listed in the campaign frame, and you can begin play immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Campaign frames are great ways to do a quick setup for Mortal Coil, and are ideal for playing a pick-up game or convention game. If your players really like the setting, the frame can be used for a longer term game as well. A campaign frame is also useful as a how-to on setting up a unique theme document of your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note: the campaign frames previously released and included are Divinity, Hag Ride, Old Gods, Project M.A.G.I., The Saint-Germain Legacy, Soul Train, Swords of Astagar, That Which Rises, and Twisted 50s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
