			<description>[User summary]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You (as a karateka) fight a series of combats in various locations of the world (simply changing the landscape you see; they do not affect gameplay).&lt;br/&gt;If you defeat your opponent, you go on the next stage. If you are defeated, the game is over (you have to restart all from the beginning).&lt;br/&gt;Both opponents (after achieving black belt) and locations (after seeing them all) loop indefinitely.&lt;br/&gt;You score points based on the moves you use to hit your opponent and how much time overall you need to win the match (the fewer, the better).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
