			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Superpets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Animal Super Hero roleplaying game. No, these aren't Ninja Turtles or furry heroes. Superpets are great animals like Wonderdog, Gleek and Krypto. These are Regular animals with amazing super powers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stuff You Need&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need: Paper, pencil, bunches of dice (all having the same sides). Each player needs ONE die of a unique color (but the same sides as the others). This is called the Master Die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superpets also requires a bag of doggie treats, called Stinky Treats during play. You will be eating these, so you may substitute something else that tastes a little off. Try garlic-stuffed olives or plain rye crackers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamemasters should take note that there are no rules covering Superpet vs. Non-Superpet rolls. If something like this ever comes up, as Gamemaster, you simply make up a number of dice to roll (don't forget to include the Master Die). Roll half the Player's dice for an easy task, equal the Player's dice for a moderately difficult job, and one-and-a-half times the Player's dice for something super tough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can be played with or without a Gamemaster. If no Gamemaster is present, the Players should vote on how best to resolve disputes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
