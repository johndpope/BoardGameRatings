			<description>Finding out what everyone thinks about things has never been easier or more fun! Sussed All Sorts is a family friendly quiz with a twist: instead of general knowledge, you&amp;rsquo;ll be answering questions about each other! As you read aloud a series of real and imaginary scenarios, you&amp;rsquo;ll be given choices to make. Whoever can suss you out scores. Who has the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 200 topics to talk about including secret agents, driverless cars, flirting, writing code, sky diving, armadillos, news bloopers, body odour judges and meditation (to name a few!). So, who've you got sussed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
