							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Got It! A Scavenger Hunt Game</name>
									
			<description>All you have to do is get five objects and bring them home. But then you discover you'll have to navigate waterways and toll roads, and you can't go there without a pass. And you have to figure out the best route to take based on the roll of the die. And while Action cards can help you, they can also help your opponents, and even snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. And you don't think the other players are going to sit idly by and watch you move about unimpeded, do you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Got It! is a game that's easy to learn, but tricky to win -- and since the objects you must get change each game, it's never the same twice. But with skillful use of your moves and a little luck, you'll be able to look at the other players with a grin and say &amp;quot;got it&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing Got It! starts with the deck of Object cards. Each player is dealt five objects, and must roll the die and move around the board to land on the matching spaces. Landing on an object space &amp;quot;gets&amp;quot; the object, but it's not safe until the player gets it back &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; to their starting space. There are specially marked spaces that provide toll passes and boat passes -- a toll pass can get a player from one side of the board to the other quickly, while a boat pass lets players go after objects on the islands. There are also spaces that let players draw &amp;quot;action cards&amp;quot;, some of which are used immediately and others which are held on to and used on later turns. The action cards can provide help (extra moves, extra turns, etc.) or hindrance (lose a pass, lose a turn, etc.). The first player to get all five of their objects home wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
