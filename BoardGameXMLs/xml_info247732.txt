							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strike for Berlin</name>
									
			<description>Game included in Yaah! magazine #11, designed by Brian Train.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yaah! #11 makes a big splash with the issue game, Strike for Berlin, designed by Brian Train. If you've ever wondered what would have happened if the Red Army had managed to win the Battle of Warsaw in 1920 - and then decided to take the Revolution into Germany - this is the game you've got to get on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a drastic reworking of Brian Train's earlier and long out-of-print game Freikorps.&lt;br/&gt;The subject matter is the same - the Red Army, after winning the Battle of Warsaw in August 1920, decides to keep going west and bring revolution to Germany on the points of Soviet bayonets.&lt;br/&gt;But so much has changed: new map, new Orders of Battle, new mechanics and a surprising array of optional rules to keep play variable and interesting: Armoured Trains; the Trotsky Train; the Soviet Baltic Fleet; Tactical Doctrines; Marshal Pilsudski; Volunteer Legions; Entente units; the Virus of Revolt; Reichswehr variable deployment and construction; options for the Free City of Danzig; and Conscription on the March.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also mates with Red Horde 1920 (itself a reworking of Konarmiya) from Tiny Battle Publishing, so you can play one long campaign for Central Europe, during the fateful summer and fall of a 1920 that never happened....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;176 die-cut, double-sided counters&lt;br/&gt;17 x 22&amp;quot; hex map of western Poland/ eastern Germany&lt;br/&gt;John R. Cooper did the art for both!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
