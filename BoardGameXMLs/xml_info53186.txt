			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A decade has passed since the Age of Heroes began. The city of Tyr has broken free of tyranny, though turmoil still holds the world in its merciless grip. The Dragon King lies dead, earthquakes rock the land, and revolution spreads like wildfire across the Tyr Region. Giant rifts pierce this once impenetrable land: far to the north, the alien thri-kreen empire quickens, sensing its opportunity to invade. And to the south, in the obsidian wasteland, the ground stirs with the emergence of the undead....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to a world where metal is scarce, gods don't exist, and psionic powers abide in all living creatures! This significantly expanded and revised set contains everything you need to adventure across the burning lands of Athas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wanderer's Chronicle:&lt;br/&gt;128 pages detailing the world of Athas, extending far beyond the known Tyr Region to encompass such new locations as the Jagged Cliffs, the Last Sea, the Kreen Empire, and the Dead Land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Age of Heroes:&lt;br/&gt;96 pages of updated rules and new mechanics designed to make combat more brutal and adventure more savage. This book features new player character races such as the aarakocra and the pterran, expanded rules for wizards, and revised ability score tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Way of the Psionicist:&lt;br/&gt;32 pages detailing a new streamlined, complete-in-this-box psionics system designed specifically for Dark Sun campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mystery of the Ancients:&lt;br/&gt;A 32-page adventure for characters of 3rd to 5th level that kicks off any new campaign in spectacular fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three full-color poster maps:&lt;br/&gt;One is a close-up of the Tyr Region. The other high-quality maps detail the lands beyond to the north, south, and west-expanding the area of the original campaign by eight times!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Master Screen:&lt;br/&gt;An eight-panel gatefold featuring all the tables needed to run a Dark Sun adventure, on one convenient stand-up screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
