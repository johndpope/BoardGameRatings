							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Army Man Backgammon</name>
									
			<description>This game is played on a Backgammon board using opposing sets of 15 green army men and 15 tan army men (or any other contrasting colors available). The game also requires two six-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The types army men are rated based on the weapon carried (which establishes attack range) and stance (which sets the maximum movement and saving throw values). Units that are standing or running can move faster but are more vulnerable, while units that are prone or kneeling can&amp;rsquo;t move as fast but are less vulnerable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one of your men is hit, it is removed from the game. If the piece designated as your Sergeant is removed from the game, then your remaining men must either dig-in or charge on every turn. The winner is the first player to move a man off the opponent&amp;rsquo;s side of the Backgammon board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
