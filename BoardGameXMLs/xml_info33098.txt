			<description>A &amp;ldquo;History Repeats Itself&amp;rdquo; game for the piecepack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Berlin Wall: A barrier surrounding W. Berlin that closed off E. Germans' access to W. Berlin from 1961 to 1989 and served as a symbol of the Cold War's division of E. and W. Germany. The barrier was built in response to the flight of about 2.5 million E. Germans to W. Germany in the years 1949-61. First erected on the night of August 12-13, 1961, the wall developed into a system of concrete walls topped with barbed wire and guarded with watchtowers, gun emplacements, and mines. It was opened in the 1989 democratization that swept through Eastern Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: be the first player to collect 12 pieces of the wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
