			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 5th Edition compatible adventure for four to six PCs of levels 6-9&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you are successful , your reputation will spread farther and more widely than you might imagine. And when that reputation reaches those who believe that &amp;ldquo;the enemy of my enemy is my firend,&amp;rdquo; you might just find yourself working with and for some interesting people. So when the village go-between for the mayor of Rybalka and local Vikmordere tribespeople asks the party to recover an item, you can&amp;rsquo;t be sure exactly who you are going to earn your coin from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs find themselves having to tread a very thin line to be successful with this job; the Monachy&amp;rsquo;s agent in Rybalka is very interested in what they are doing, as are other, less friendly tribes; but the PCs don&amp;rsquo;t know this. In fact, there is much they don&amp;rsquo;t know and they will only become aware of some of the implications of their actions when potential problems become reality. Of course, if they&amp;rsquo;d know they were meant to find a ship buried in a cliff face, defeat its entire crew before finding great beauty in physical and material form, take what belongs to a king and then return unnoticed through territory claimed by old enemies and new allies, they would have prepared quite differently, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t they? Ah, hindsight is a wonderful thing&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included in &amp;quot;Search for the Tri-Stone&amp;quot;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Maps by 3x ENnie Award winning Cartographer Todd Gamble&lt;br/&gt;    New Runic Language introduced through a Runestick which PCs may use on their journey to decode puzzles and find clues in their search for the Tri-Stone&lt;br/&gt;    High resolution map of the Thingallor Burial Shrine&lt;br/&gt;    New Monster: Zombie Handmaidens&lt;br/&gt;    Numerous New Maps and Illustrations!&lt;br/&gt;    New Magical Items: Sword and Shield of King Rytan&lt;br/&gt;    New Artifact!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
