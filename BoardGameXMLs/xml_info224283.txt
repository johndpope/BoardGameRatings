							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Axon Punk: Overdrive Quick Start Rules</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Axon Punk: Overdrive, you and your friends play as a team of hackers, AI, engineers, cyborgs, and others that are trying to be forces of change as the great war of global inequality rages on the streets around you. The game's theme, rules, art, and pacing are heavily inspired by hip hop and classic cyberpunk. Because the game is set in the hyper-dense megacities of the future, the players together create a Community of locations and fellow city dwellers to interact with during the game. Based on the choices the players make, the Community will produce missions, give rewards, and evolve over time &amp;ndash; or it could be consumed by the chaos and anarchy caused by futuristic corporate oppression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This item includes an introduction to the world and rules of Axon Punk, a demo Community including 4 Locations, rules cheat sheets, 5 pre-made characters, and a 2-hr demo mission for 2-5 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
