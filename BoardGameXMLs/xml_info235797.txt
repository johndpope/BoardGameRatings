			<description>Prove your detective skills in this brain-teasing board game based on the BBC's hit show Who Do You Think You Are? Clues about celebrities&amp;rsquo; family trees are hidden around the world. The first player to piece them together and uncover all of the ancestral secrets is crowned winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After hearing about the mysteries a celebrity wants to solve, move your aeroplane along the global flight paths. Every time you land, check the ancestry book for relevant clues. It&amp;rsquo;s your goal to combine information from several sources and use your powers of deduction to get the correct answers. With the roll of the dice you can even hide hints from the other players and get double clues to help you zoom ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whilst the celebrities are fictional, the history is accurate. Marvel at stories that are by turns funny, gruesome and exciting! Go back in time as you discover how our shared history has shaped the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
