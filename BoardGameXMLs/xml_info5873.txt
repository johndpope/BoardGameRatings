			<description>Brain Baseball simulates America's favorite pastime with a special deck of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pitcher pitches the ball by playing a card.  The other players swing at the ball in turn by playing a card lower than the pitch and higher than previous swings.  The last player to play a card is the batter.  The other players try to catch the ball by playing a card higher than the ball and higher than previous catches.  The ball is scored by whoever catches it, or by the batter if nobody catches it, or by the pitcher if nobody hits it.  Cards are worth standard values, except aces are worth 15 and deuces are worth 14.  All batting and fielding cards are discarded and the player who scored the ball begins the next round as the pitcher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brain Baseball was originally released in August 1998 as a limited-edition game.  It was made with leftover bid cards from a poorly sorted print run of Give Me the Brain!, and contained four sets of Bid cards ranging from 1 to 15.  Brain Baseball was included in Chief Herman's Holiday Fun Pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
