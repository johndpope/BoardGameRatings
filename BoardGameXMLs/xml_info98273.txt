							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Videocart-20: Video Whizball</name>
									
			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This preprogrammed cartridge plugs into the console of the Fairchild Video Entertainment Computer for more TV fun on the Channel F Network. Imagine shooting pool with both players going for the balls at the same time. That's just a hint of the slam-bang action you'll find as you try to knock the whizballs into your opponent's goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play solo, compete with a friend or sit back and take notes as you watch computer-controlled players battle it out. Video Whizball is like no game you've ever seen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Select the point total for the winning score. Put from 1 to 4 whizballs into play. Choose their point value. There's even an option that lets you control your shots at the whizball like guided missiles. But watch out. Make sure you don't get hit by a &amp;quot;guided missile&amp;quot; shot or bouncing whizball. That'll knock you temporarily off the playing field, leaving your goal wide open to be &amp;quot;whizzed&amp;quot; by your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
