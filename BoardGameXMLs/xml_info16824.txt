							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">U.S.A. Bicentennial Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;An enjoyable game for Americans of all ages.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll and move around a board decorated with photographs of American icons (e.g., the Statue of Liberty). Each space has a number. Land on the space, select a category card, and attempt to answer the corresponding trivia question. The difficulty of the questions varies widely. The more difficult the question, the more stars it is worth. The first player to earn 50 stars wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
