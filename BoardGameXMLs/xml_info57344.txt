			<description>subtitled: An Introduction to the Free City&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;This 48-page introduction to the Free City of Zobeck showcases its clockwork magic, its gearforged PC race, and many highlights of the city, such as the Kobold Ghetto. Includes a beautiful city map and other distinctive elements of the setting. As a gazetteer-size treatment of the city, it provides enough that the shared world can truly be shared, without overwhelming a DM who wants to match the city to their own homebrew setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A city of wonders, and a city of corruption and despair. Zobeck is home to gypsies, kobolds, powerful guilds and seductive devils, a crossroads city where the people of all corners of the compass come to barter, cheat, and deal.&lt;br/&gt;Some come with plans to conquer, for the city&amp;rsquo;s freedom is a fragile thing: nobles seek to restore their privileges, devils seek souls, and evil gods seek converts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zobeck is defended only by the wit and the steel of its heroes. While the Crossroads City is an island of light and reason,a dark history gnaws at its foundations. Old cults, dark pacts, and the recent bloodbath of the Great Revolt have all left their scar on the city. To remain free, Zobeck needs brave hearts, powerful masters of the arcane, and bright swords!&lt;br/&gt;Learn the secrets of clockwork magic, the kobold ghetto, fiends, criminals, barkeeps and gods. Includes full details of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Gearforged PCs&lt;br/&gt;    Clockwork Magic&lt;br/&gt;    The Arcane Collegium&lt;br/&gt;    The Griff on Riders&lt;br/&gt;    Guilds &amp;amp; Locales&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
