			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiberium was a title set in the Command &amp;amp; Conquer universe, and was initially revealed when shots of the January 2008 issue of Game Informer were leaked, but was officially announced by EA just a day after. Prior to the announcement, the game had been in production for two years. The plot would have revolved around a repeat invasion of Scrin, shown from the eyes of a GDI commando. It would have been, to date, the only C&amp;amp;C game not to include &amp;quot;Command &amp;amp; Conquer&amp;quot; in its title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiberium was canceled on September 30, 2008 due to the game's failure to meet &amp;quot;quality standards set by the development team and the EA Games label&amp;quot;. Kotaku reported Mariam Sughayer, EA spokesperson, saying &amp;quot;EA has suspended work on Tiberium effective immediately. The game was not on track to meet the high quality standards set by the team and by the EA Games Label. A lower quality game is not in the best interest of the consumers and would not succeed in this market.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;List of canceled Command &amp;amp; Conquer games&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
