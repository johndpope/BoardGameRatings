			<description>Little Monsters is a quick game of cards specially designed to tap on the excitement of 'risk-taking elements' from press-your-luck mechanisms. Players take turns drawing as many cards as they want from the deck, scoring a range of 1-5 Baby Points for each card drawn. There is no limit to the amount of times a player can draw cards, but as soon as she draws a Monster Parent, she loses all her cards in her Baby Zone and is forced to end the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But wait, it is not as easy as it sounds. First of all, cards drawn are secretive and only known to the player drawing them. Players can guess at the total Baby Points of each other by the number of cards they drew, but not the exact Baby Points acquired. A player with 8 cards might only have an actual total of 9 Baby Points while a player who drew 5 cards could already be sitting on 10 Baby Points! This is where players try to match the amount of cards by drawing at least as many cards or more than their opponents in order to ensure their victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play special abilities, sabotage other players' turns and store items to help you pave your way to the top of the Hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
