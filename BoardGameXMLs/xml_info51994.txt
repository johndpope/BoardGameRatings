			<description>From the Publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you bored by the dearth of talent trees presented in the Modern core rules?  Do you wish your heroes had more options? Do you pine for Offensive Driving and and a little Domination?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;22 Talent Trees presents 86 new talents (grouped into 22 trees) for the core classes. With this supplement you can play Strong heroes who use their Mighty Hurling talents to throw objects extreme distances. Or perhaps you prefer a Fast hero who can use the Quicker than the Eye talents to gain a blur or displacement effect! Or would you rather play the Tough hero with FX Resistance and withstand the power of magic? What about the Quick Thinking Smart heroes who can use their talents to take action before other characters even figure out what is going on? Maybe you would prefer a Dedicated hero, devoted to the service others and able to donate their will power, their financial resources, and even their very life to another person in need. And finally, who could resist the pulchritudinous Charismatic hero with her Stunning Beauty?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These and dozens of other innovative ideas fill the pages of this supplement!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
