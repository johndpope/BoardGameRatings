							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crossbows and Catapults: Trojan Horse and Battle Shield</name>
									
			<description>The Trojan Horse and Battle Shield expansions add a Trojan Horse Catapult and Battle Shield Crossbow to Crossbows and Catapults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansions were available both separately and as a two part gift set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trojan horse features a &amp;quot;tail&amp;quot; catapult launcher, and a compartment in the torso of the horse which houses &amp;quot;warriors&amp;quot;.  When the horse is hit at the front base of the unit, the horse flies open, ejecting its occupants to the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battle Shield is a wheel mounted combat platform that mounts a semi-automatic crossbow in its undercarriage.  This is probably the coolest weapon in the game.  Striking the shield (with a catapult) causes the battle shield to explosively destruct by flinging it's shield down and pulling the frame back, ejecting any riders that may be on the shield platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;May be used in a standalone game or added to C&amp;amp;C basic set as an expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTENTS: (for the combined set)&lt;br/&gt;1 Trojan Horse&lt;br/&gt;1 Battle Shield&lt;br/&gt;8 Vikings&lt;br/&gt;8 Barbarians&lt;br/&gt;4 red caroms&lt;br/&gt;4 blue caroms&lt;br/&gt;label sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
