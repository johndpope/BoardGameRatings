							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alhambra: Designers&#039; Expansion â€“ The Towers of Power</name>
									
			<description>The Towers in the game are replaced with new ones, each having a special ability:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blueprint - The player rolls a die and draws that many building tiles, choosing one to keep. The others are returned to the draw tower in the order the player chooses. The building tile the player kept can be placed on the building market at the start of any player's turns, replacing  any already on the tableau. The exchanged tile is placed back in the draw tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loan - The player rolls a die and draws that many money cards from the draw pile, choosing one of them to keep. The others are returned to the top of the draw pile in the order the player chooses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discount - The player rolls a die and places it on the tower. Every time the player purchases his first building in the round, he can choose to decrease the value on the die by one to decrease the purchase prize by one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pinnacle - The player rolls a die and places it on the tower. When scoring walls that number is added to the shortest external wall. This can propel the smaller wall to be the biggest and therefore score more points for the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 11 alternate tower tiles, 4 white dice, 32 black dice, and 1 purple die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
