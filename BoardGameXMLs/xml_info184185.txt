							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Relentlessly Gay</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NINJAS AND INVENTORS AND RAINBOW DRAGONS... OH MY!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mustache, the most evil of evil masterminds, decides the Gay Agenda isn't advancing fast enough. To find someone worthy of assisting him, he plucks gay men and women out of time and space and forces them to do battle in his secret arena. But will good triumph over evil and turn his schemes back on him?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Years in the making, Relentlessly Gay collects more than 20 pre-generated characters and dozens of traits and battle maneuvers not found in the core rules into a single book, as well as throwing in a few new tidbits. You'll find almost every single gay character that has appeared previously in a ROLF! battle scenario (from the villianous to the virtuous), as well as the never-before-seen Rainbow Dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relentlessly Gay also includes feats and talent trees for those who might want to make specifically gay characters in games that use pretty much any d20 System variant you can think of. Some of the feats have previously appeared in Feats of an Adult Nature or Devils in Petticoats, but the talent trees are new to this release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
