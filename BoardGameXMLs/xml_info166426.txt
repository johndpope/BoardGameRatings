			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Witch is not someone to be feared. Not someone who cooks children in the oven and sends a whole castle to sleep. Oh no.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witches are there to help people, to solve those little and not-so-little problems in the village.  But when those problems appear, will the witch be good enough to solve the problem? Only you can tell!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RPG is designed for players of ages 7-12 or so, although anyone outside of those ages will also enjoy the game. It has been designed to ideally be run by someone with RPG experience but has very simple mechanics and is easily learned by anyone of any age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This colour book contains full game rules for playing a Witch character as well as an introductory adventure. Future supplements will add additional character types, although there are enough options presented here to have several witches of different kinds adventuring together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simply requires some six sided dice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
