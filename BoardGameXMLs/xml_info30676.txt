							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Magic Tent Expansion Pack: Mystery Treasure Hunt Vol. 2 â€“ Australia</name>
									
			<description>Designed for use with The Magic Tent, this second volume brings a brand new story and an all-new adventure full of mystery and imagination. Hank, Stella, and Cody camped out one night in their grandfather's mysterious old tent. When they awoke the next morning, they were in another part of the world. It's up to you to solve the mystery and help bring them home again! This time the adventure takes place in Australia. As kids read the story inside their own Magic Tent (not included), parents will hide clues around the house. During key points in the story, the kids will read a hint, climb out of the tent, and race to find the hidden clues. When they do, they'll put them together to reveal a secret message that helps them to solve the mystery! It's an exciting activity for groups or individual kids. It combines reading, imagination, problem-solving, active play - and it's just plain fun! This kit comes with a 58 page adventure book, 7 secret clues, and a smart card with instructions and additional information for parents. For use with The Magic Tent - sold separately. 1 or More Players, Ages 7 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
