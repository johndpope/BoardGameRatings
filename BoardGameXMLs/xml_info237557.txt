			<description>A fantasy themed set matchin card game similar to rummy. Players try to collect the most gold by playing sets of matching cards during their turns. &lt;br/&gt;Each player plays as one of 9 Champions(colors), each one has different abilities that effect game play, and what cards are used to create the deck.&lt;br/&gt;Each hand follows a simple draw-play-discard pattern until someone runs out of cards, at which point gold (score) is counted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
