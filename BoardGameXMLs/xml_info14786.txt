			<description>In this game one player takes on the role of the bandit and is given a card showing which of the 6 hideouts are his real location for this game. The other players all play highway patrol men trying to catch the bandit in action as he sets out to commit robberies and get back to his hideout. The patrol men are also given cards to randomly determine their starting locations on the board. The game includes a board with 3 spinners on it, the bandit always uses spinner #1 which gives the most possible movement. The spinner used by the patrol men is dependent upon how many players are in the game. The more players the slower the spinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game for the bandit is to make 3 robberies, returning to his hideout between each of them. The bandit must announce which type of crime he is committing giving the patrol men an idea where he may be. The patrol men have to end their movement on the bandit's location. The patrol men have special items they can use in their search for the bandit such as road blocks and the use of a helicopter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
