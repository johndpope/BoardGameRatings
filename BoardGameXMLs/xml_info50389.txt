It is sufficient to play the solitaire adventure also included, and to show  your friends how to play with the GameMaster  adventure also included. The full version of  the rules can be purchased at games stores, or at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.flyingbuffalo.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.flyingbuffalo.com&lt;/a&gt;. This booklet is intended to be given away on Free RPG Day (June 23, 2007). (The 5.5 edition  and the 7th edition rules are somewhat different and much more detailed, but it really doesn't  matter which set of rules you use; the play will remain very much the same.)&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
