			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE BODY VANISHES&lt;br/&gt;It seemed a routine case. Determining why young Arnold McCoy had been killed. But, why and how had his body vanished from the morgue?.Why weren't the police cooperative? Was there more to this case than met the eye and did it involve the mysterious curse on the Montique Water Diamond?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE FORGOTTEN MANUSCRIPT&lt;br/&gt;Things seem placid in Northview while the daredevils search for some missing pages from a manuscript by a highly-regarded novelist of the occult. Taking on this job for a prestigious publisher is one thing, even when it involves travel and a nagging side question. Dealing with what seems to be happening in this picturesque rural New England town is another thing altogether! Can the daredevils unravel the various mysteries here and will they do it in time to block catastrophe?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE CASE OF MISS BROOKMEYER'S MURDERER&lt;br/&gt;A frightened young woman comes to the daredevils for help. Her life is being threatened through letters and ads placed in the daily personal columns of the newspaper. Can the daredevils stop her killer in the short time remaining until the threats are carried out? Is there more to this case than surface appearances?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
