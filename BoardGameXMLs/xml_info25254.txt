			<description>A tennis game where the outcome of each shot is determined by rolling a die. Each ball is a series of rolls of the five different dice. There is one die for serves, one for second serve, one for baseline play, one for short balls and one for high balls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no choices to be made. The dice are rolled back and forth between the two players until someone wins the ball. With this tool for determine balls, matches can be played according to normal tennis rules. There are no rules for which of the players of one side is rolling dice when, when playing doubles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From package (rough translation from Swedish): &amp;quot;With Grand Slam Tennisspel you can play tennis wherever you are. You can play single or double. Always exciting.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
