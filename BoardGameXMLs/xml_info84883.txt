			<description>Become an orchard farmer and earn a living selling your crop at market.  Rise early each morning to pick fruit from your trees and load up your market cart.  Spend too much time picking produce and you will be the last farmer to arrive at the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apples, oranges, pears, plums, and apricots are all nearly in season.  Market patrons line up, rain or shine, to get the best fruit at its ripest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make a profit by attracting the right customers.  Meet the demands of your patrons by trading fruit with your fellow farmers.  Help another farmer out when you can because cashing in on a favour is crucial to bringing your victory to fruition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
