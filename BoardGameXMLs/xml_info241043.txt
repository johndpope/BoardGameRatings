			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working hard to escape poverty in Hong Kong, the Cheong brothers might have had what it takes if their mutant abilities hadn't been discovered by the government. They were forced into military service and then assigned to the Ministry of State Security. Eventually escaping they went on the run only to settle down in America where fate pushed them to become the kung fu heroes they always dreamed of being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With flying fists of fury, kinetic kicks, and their awesome roars, DRAGON &amp;amp; TIGER are here to defend the defendless! To befriend the friendless! And to defeat... the defeatless!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
