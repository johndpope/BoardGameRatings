			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shooter Tactics is a standard military shooter best known for its poor gameplay, bugs, and the creator's censorship of criticism as well as his extreme intolerance for anyone who does not share his religious and societal beliefs. It was eventually pulled or removed from Steam after being available for a period of time. The game has since been pulled and re-released onto Steam multiple times, each time under a different name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
