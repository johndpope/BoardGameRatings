			<description>&amp;ldquo;Board &amp;amp; card game for 2 players. Napoleonic warfare theme. Abstract skirmish level combat. Each figure represents a company or unit of men. Victory: You rout the enemy if you destroy 9+ of his units.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chess board or any other 8x8 grid. Miniatures or counters are used to represent the combat units. Each side starts with sixteen units: eight Infantry, four Cavalry, and four Artillery. A custom deck of cards is central to the play of the game. The players draw a hand of cards from a common deck. Card play determines when units may move, attack, or defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optional rules provide for terrain, which comes in six types: Clear, Deep Water, Forest, Hill, Redoubt, and Marsh. The terrain features impact movement and combat in various ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
