							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure</name>
									
			<description>A remake of the Playstation original. The gameplay has been changed significantly, the battles changed from strategy-RPG style to 2-D turn based battles, similar to the ones found in the sequels. Kururu also engages in battle in this version of the game. Though extra scenarios from the third game in the series were advertised, translated, and given as the reason for the removal of the English song vocals, they were absent from the game. NIS America announced that they removed this content because of localization issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
