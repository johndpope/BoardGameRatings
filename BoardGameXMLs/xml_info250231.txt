			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play a few notes on your trusty harmonica as you look off towards the distant walls that surround Arcadia City. Hulking brutes in armor bristling with spikes guard the towering metal entry gates. A trio of scavengers attempt to approach and one of the massive goons fires a warning shot with their laser rifle. Another step or two further and the scavengers would have been reduced to smoldering piles of rags and scorched flesh. They're fools for daring to approach the gates, but you don't blame them for trying. You'd love to get in yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcadia City is the only secure holdout for hundreds of miles. Its said that within those armored walls the citizens enjoy constant electricity, clean running water, good shelter, and a regular supply of food. Outside the walls there's the irradiated wasteland... an endless maze of wreckage, rubble, and hazards. It's a place where most of the survivors of the war make their home, including mutants such as yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though kissed by Mother Atom before you were born into the world, you still have a chance at getting past those gates. Arcadia City doesn't choose between purebloods and mutants. The glorious Mayor simply accepts those who can offer something in return for their citizenship. Payment and proof of one's mettle, that's what Arcadia City wants from you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You slide your harmonica into your jacket pocket and pull your gore encrusted machete out of its sheath. Whistling the final part of the tune your way playing, you begin to work your way back into the deep of the wasteland. Getting through those gates are going to cost some tokens, you tell yourself, and a whole lot of reputation...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complete, solo player game that is played by using a symbol filled maze, a pencil, and a pair of six sided dice. This particular adventure game is set in a mutant filled post apocalypse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
