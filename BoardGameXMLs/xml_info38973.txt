							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Polar Quizz</name>
									
			<description>Polar Quizz is trivia-type game about the polar environment, both arctic and antarctic: fauna, polar explorers, geography, indigenous people, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No particular knowledge on the subject is required to play. Players just need to use their memory, as the facts are given along the game. Thus, kids can easily win against adults, and learn valuable information at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is made of 100 square cards. Each card displays the picture of an animal, a polar explorer, a map, etc... All the questions and answers are gathered in a booklet. Each card has a number referring to a set of questions and their answers in the booklet. This feature allows the games to be easily translated in many different languages. Currently, each box contains 4 languages: English, French, German and Norwegian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to win cards by answering their questions. Each card yields points and the winner is the first to score 7 points. If a player gives the wrong answers to a card, the right answers are given to all the participants. Hence, later in the game, this card becomes easier to be won, but only if  you could memorize these answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
