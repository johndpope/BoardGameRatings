			<description>As the rules put it &amp;quot;The object o' Sea Rats! is to be the last pirate afloat&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with one ship, six cannonballs, and six crates of supplies used to repair damage. The ships are positioned on a sea map board that can be rolled up for storage. Each ship starts at a different port. Cargo can be gained or lost by moving to ports, fighting other ships, and bribing, extorting, or trading with other pirates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dice rolls determine which port you can stock up at next, how much cargo you load, how far you move, and whether your cannonballs hit the ship you aim at. You may also attempt to take &amp;quot;The Treasure&amp;quot; which may be used as a bribe that can't be refused, to buy an extra die for movement, or to buy an extra cargo die with the ability to overload your ship. Possession, not expenditure, of the treasure allows docking at any port.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A ship hit with more cannonballs than it has crates sinks to Davy Jones' Locker, and the losing captain is out of the game. The victorious captain may expend his own crates to keep the ship from sinking and control an additional ship himself, or allow the previous captain to stay on in a subservient role and continue to play the ship if &amp;quot;he/she swears an oath o' allegiance&amp;quot;. This can be used in many cases to keep all players involved in the game to the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AVAST YE!&lt;br/&gt; Welcome te Sea Rats!&amp;trade;, the most excitin' pirate board game this side o' the Ivory Coast. Where old salts and landlubbers alike sail ships on the high seas, battle with their enemies, stock up at ports o' call, an', best of all, steal The Treasure&amp;mdash;Arrrghhh!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Send yer buddies down te Davy Jones' Locker. Capture &amp;quot;the prize&amp;quot; an' build up a fleet o' ships! Bribe yer enemies te escape hostile fire&amp;mdash;whatever it takes te be the last pirate afloat an' win the game! It's easy te learn an' totally wicked fun to play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
