			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Old World:  Peace has broken out all across the vast Bezian Empire, and adventuring work has dried up along with it. However, in the hinterlands of the Empire, there is always work to be found . . . for those willing to get their hands a little dirty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Temple of Bronze: Though the Druidic faith has been outlawed and driven out of all Imperial-controlled lands all across the Bezian Empire (for the most part), on the far northern fringes, one of the Drake tribes is stubbornly still practicing the Old Faith. Worse, there are rumors that these Drakes have revived some of the practices of a disgraced cult that split off from the Old Faith long ago. The practices of that cult include kidnapping and human sacrifice. The Empire wants this vile cult wiped off of the face of the earth before the cult can impose their foul beliefs upon any other citizens of the Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
