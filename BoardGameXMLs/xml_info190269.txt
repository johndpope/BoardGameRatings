			<description>Ninja Squares' is a tile placing game where your pieces are controlled by everyone but yourself. Players attempt to place the pieces of the other players in a way that satisfies certain conditions for their own pieces.&lt;br/&gt;Players seek to have their tiles surrounded by a specific number of other tiles, earning one to four points with corresponding tiles needing the same number of other tiles to border them. When this condition is met, the tile is removed and the player gets that number of points. There is also a special fist tile that only comes to the player after another tile being removed leaves the fist no longer touching any other tiles, which is worth five points.&lt;br/&gt;Players start with five tiles for each opponent they have in the game, plus their equal share of 12 total Mystery tiles. Players then place one tile at a time, until all players have placed all of their tiles. Whenever a tile is touching the exact number of other tiles that it indicates, it immediately goes to the player of that color for points. The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
