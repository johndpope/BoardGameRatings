			<description>The Little Big Game of Lexis Hold'em transforms Texan Hold'em into a word game. Instead of forming straights, flushes or pairs, players spell words. The game ends when only one player has chips remaining. That person is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives an equal number of betting chips. The dealer deals 2 &amp;quot;hole&amp;quot; cards to each player and 5 &amp;quot;community&amp;quot; cards face down. Players must place a chip into the pot to play in the hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pre-Flop (Round One): After looking at their own cards, the players can check or bet. The following players can call (equal the last bet placed in the pot), raise (increase the last bet placed in the pot), or fold (sit out the hand and lose all bets placed so far).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Flop (Round Two): The dealer turns over the first 3  &amp;quot;community&amp;quot; cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Turn Card (Round Three): The dealer turns over the 4th &amp;quot;community&amp;quot; card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The River (Round Four): The dealer turns over the last &amp;quot;community&amp;quot; card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each round players use their own cards and the community cards to form a word and a round of betting occurs. After the last round players secretly write down their words before betting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Showdown: After all betting is done, players who have not folded show their cards. The player that forms the word worth the most points takes all the chips in the pot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
