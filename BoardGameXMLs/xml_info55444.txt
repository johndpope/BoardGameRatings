			<description>Module introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You were hired as escorts for a small cloth caravan that was travelling from Ogburg to Womtham. It was suppose to be a simple job through the Raker Mountains Pass until a flash blizzard hit. Suddenly the caravan was gone and you were trapped on a narrow mountain trail looking for shelter from the freezing cold. The snow or the cold will soon be the end of you unless you find some sort of shelter! Are your eyes playing tricks on you? Is that a small crack in the mountain up ahead? Will you find safety or danger? There's only one way to know for sure....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
