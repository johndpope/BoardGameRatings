							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stampede</name>
									
			<description>Stampede is played on a 12x12 grid of circles, with a square of nine circles removed from each corner.  There is a central &amp;ldquo;open range&amp;rdquo; area of thirty-six circles that separates four side areas, one for each player&amp;rsquo;s starting positions, where they will place nine Cattle pieces and nine Cowboy pieces in numerical order according to the markings on the board and on the pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will take turns moving with the objective of being the first to move their Cattle and Cowboy pieces to the opponent&amp;rsquo;s starting position on the opposite side of the board.  Pieces may move in any direction.  Cattle pieces move to an open adjacent circle or by jumping a friendly or opponent piece to a vacant circle on the other side.  Cowboys move this way, but also may jump over any number of pieces in a row to reach a vacant circle on the opposite side.  Pieces are not removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to move all of his pieces to the opposite side and match the piece numbers to the board numbers wins the game.  Variants are provided using a system of scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
