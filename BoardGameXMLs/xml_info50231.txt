			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battalion-level wargames rules for the Vietnam War.&lt;br/&gt;Game Info&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 stand represents a fireteam, 3 stands plus an MG stand to a platoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is driven by two card decks (supplied fully printed on sturdy card). The game deck drives the order of action on the table and controls the passing of time within the game. The event deck throws in extra situations for the players to deal with, such a weather, radio net problems, booby traps, Medevac and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains many features to give the game the &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; of Vietnam, such as using flareships, napalm strikes, medevac rules, arms cache rules, using tunnel complexes, free fire zones, recon by fire, Mortar Locating Radar, use of Starlight scopes, civilians with hidden VC, PBR's.....and even rules for screaming Broken Arrow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full rules for helicopter use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special rules for the VC/NVA allow them to disperse and redeploy rapidly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player can easily control from a Company up to a Battalion. Games involving Regimental scale NVA assaults have been completed in under 4 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitable for all scales of figure due to the use of stands rather than figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comes complete with a sample scenario to pick-up and play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains example TOE's for VC, NVA and US Battalions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points system allows the bodycount and tactical situation to determine victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comes with everything you need to get started - 45 page rulebook, both card decks, sheet of game counters and a quick reference sheet. The rulebook is printed complete with full colour professional silk-finished covers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
