			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find the hidden treasure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many hidden treasures wait on that secret pirate's isle. Luckily enough, the pirates have left you a treasure-map. But it is ripped in several pieces and no one knows the correct order. Each player can only look at one piece at a time. Try to find the correct location first!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insel der Piraten - Pirate's Isle is more than a simple game of deduction. You have to draw logical conclusions to find the possible paths. Try to mark your guess first on the map and you'll be the winner. But be careful, other player can see where you're going. There are 20 adventures to solve. The game can be played with 2 to 4 player and even with a single player!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
