							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BrainBox: Voyage en France</name>
									
			<description>This is a France-themed BrainBox game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description provided by the publisher: Do you know where Mont St Michel is? Or where Camembert comes from? BrainBox All Around France contains 53 beautifully-illustrated cards showing the very best France has to offer, and then some! The object of the game is to study a card for 10 seconds and then answer a question based on the roll of a die. If the question is answered correctly, the card is kept and the person with the most number of cards after 5 or 10 minutes is the winner. Made from a minimum of 70% recycled material, the BrainBox range is fabulous fun. Find out who the BrainBox is in your family &amp;ndash; it may not be who you think it is!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
