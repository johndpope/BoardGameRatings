			<description>Explore the fascinating history of the German Rheinland with this trivia game. You don' have to be an eager beaver to win this game - you need skill and luck to be the first to reach the goal with the pawn in your colour. &lt;br/&gt;However, each colour may be moved by everyone - and there are some traps along the way, so watch out.... &lt;br/&gt;When reaching special fields a card is drawn. There are two kinds of cards - Knowledge Cards that require you to answer a question concerning the Rheinland and Action Cards that mix up the outcome of the game...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
