			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game combines a wagering card game, played with a standard pack of French playing cards, and a storytelling role-playing game.  Characters are crime bosses, defined by narrative traits and also by their &amp;quot;gang&amp;quot; of criminals (somewhat like henchmen in more traditional games).  While the goal of the game is to win by destroying your rival crime bosses, the setting itself is collaboratively created during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The document suggests several possible settings: &amp;quot;The opium trade in 19th century china, crack dealing in 90s LA, alcohol in the roaring 20s, heroin in Hong Kong, super skunk in Brixton, Compound K on Mars-base Gamma, spleen of siren in the city-state of Greyspyre or a plate of sinners soul in the depths of the seven hells&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The document also includes black-and-white, print-and-play components for the game, including character sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
