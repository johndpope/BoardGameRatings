			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The government and giant corporations rule society. Genetic evaluation keeps those in place that have not enough money or influence to climb up the social ladder. Artificial intelligence is present everywhere, and cyberpods - the first artificial humans - beg the question what it means to be alive and where to draw the line. The poor live their lives in overcrowded slums, pursuing lowly jobs that barely pay enough to make a living while the rich have no such troubles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between all this, Operators exist. Highly talented, trained, augmented and expendable individuals living outside of society in a dystopian megacity like Los Angeles. They work for unknown third-parties who want something done off the books, be it industrial espionage, sabotage, assassination or whatever else needs to be done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are professionals, using cyberware and their unique skills to get the job done and deal with the downside of altering their bodies: alienation. When they lose touch with their humanity they start to suffer the consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neomancer provides you with everything you need to know to get started, including the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    a simple and elegant rule system based on D6 (Mancer Engine)&lt;br/&gt;    an elaborate skill system for individualizing characters&lt;br/&gt;    rigging and hacking rules&lt;br/&gt;    rules for building drones&lt;br/&gt;    cyberware augmentations&lt;br/&gt;    a single Operation for lone Operators&lt;br/&gt;    a group Operation to get started&lt;br/&gt;    an Operation generator to get things going&lt;br/&gt;    lots of fluff to emerge you into the setting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
