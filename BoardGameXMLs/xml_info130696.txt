			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encounter Summary: Following up on their shantytown investigations, the group moves to find O'Mosh, the Drunk. Unfortunately, the Cult of Dagon has already found him, and the characters find them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background&lt;br/&gt;O'Mosh, Bittersnail's partner on their last fateful mission, was doomed from the beginning. A hopeless drunk, and more thug than thief, he met an untimely end early this morning at the hands of Yoa and his minions. Yoa now waits for someone (hopefully Bittersnail) to come calling, thinking he can just take the gem and be done with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Launderer&amp;rsquo;s house is near the Crab River gate of Greenstone.  It&amp;rsquo;s richly appointed, for a shanty-town house, though still made of bleached and rotting wood. A small one-room apartment sits on the canted roof of the place. The Launderer is a stick-thin old man who&amp;rsquo;s quite deaf. Once he understands that the group is looking for O&amp;rsquo;Mosh, he just points to the apartment and signs that the man is drunk, as always.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
