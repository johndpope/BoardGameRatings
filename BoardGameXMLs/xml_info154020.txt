							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rogue Amongst the Peasants</name>
									
			<description>Once upon a time, in 2 neighboring villages at war, 1 of the peasants was not like the others...He was sent to create havoc and take out as many of the enemy inhabitants as he could unnoticed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One day, both villages caught on to the other's sinister plot, and the manhunt to expose the traitor began! And neither village will be at peace until either the enemy's residents, or the other's rogue, is destroyed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Includes 2 8-card decks (5 Peasants, 2 Guards, 1 Rogue per player.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this game is to expose the other player's Rogue card, or kill all of their Peasants, before they can do the same to you. Each turn, the players draw 3 cards and each choose 1 from the other player's hand before discarding and drawing another 3 cards. Should a Peasant be revealed, nothing happens. Should a Guard show his face, your opponent gets to reveal an additional card from your hand for that turn. Should the Rogue be revealed, you win. This was designed as a very quick, as well as easy to learn, mini-game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One final mechanic worth mentioning: should a player have their Rogue card in hand and it is not revealed that turn, both decks and discard piles are reshuffled and their opponent removes one of their Peasants from their deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
