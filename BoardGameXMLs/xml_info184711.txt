			<description>This game consists of a cardboard folder. The inner left leaf has the rules and a pocket holding eight cards with numbered horses. The inner right has a spinning wheel with 21 wedges of different size in either red or black, each with an instruction to either put money into the pot or take money out. The rules say tokens like matches or nuts can be used instead of money. The numbers 1 to 8 are printed around the wheel, each with a thin black line leading to the wheel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player starts in charge of the wheel. Players choose their horses in turn, starting from the left of that player. For each race, the player in charge of the wheel closes the folder, turns a thick cardboard disk on the back of the folder that is attached to the wheel inside, and then puts the folder back on the table and opens it. Each player looks at where his number lies on the wheel and follows the instructions for that wedge. Because of the layout of the wheel, the result for each horse will be different. If a horse's number is directly on a line, that player does nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wheel-spinning duty rotates around the table. The rules suggest that the spinning player's horse is out of each race. After the agreed number of races have been run, whatever remains in the spot is split equally, and the player with the most tokens wins. If the pot ever runs out of tokens, the game ends immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
