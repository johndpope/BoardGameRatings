			<description>[User summary]:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Germany during the 15th century. Four heroes embark to experience their biggest adventure while traveling the land and fighting robbers, Raubritter and witches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The character creation is quite detailed and allows to play young squires, workers, clergy or old veteran soldiers alike. After the creation of the party the player is free to venture through old Germany in search for glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fighting of street robbers and defeating local Raubritter increase the reputation in the nearest city, allowing for more advanced mission from the local authorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the cities, which are quite detailed concerning their names, districts and flavour texts the player can trade for new weapons, spells and divine chants which help in the fight against evil demons and witches that spread in the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of fighting the bad and the ugly the player can choose to become a robebr himself and start to break in guild houses and waylay travelling merchants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without a real end this game can be played on and on with dead characters being simply replaced by newly created heroes at the next tavern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
