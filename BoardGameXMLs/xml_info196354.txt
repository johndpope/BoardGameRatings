			<description>Europe at start of the early Stone Age. The human population is scattered all over the continent and lives in lone hamlets or small villages. You represent the clan chief of a dynasty. And your big dream is: to become the ruler of a vast empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, to reach this goal, there is a long journey. Your subordinates have to strengthen you faithfully and your armies have to be more advanced and stronger than those of your enemies. You have to conquer areas and found colonies to receive resources and luxury goods. You have to maneuver skillfully on political level and use scientific progresses to its maximum value. If you are successful, you will become the supreme ruler of the whole known world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective of the Game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your objective is to get the most Influence Points (IP) at the end of the game. To reach this goal, you have to develop your empire with help of your aristocrats. Use them alternately by placing them in the different chambers of your palace where they can help you in quite different manners:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chamber &amp;quot;Expansion&amp;quot; allows you to spread your vassals, found cities, collect luxury goods or resources and decide conflicts. The &amp;quot;Commercial&amp;rdquo; chamber allows you to increase your wealth by trade. The chamber &amp;quot;Taxes&amp;quot; allows you to levy taxes in your cities. The chamber &amp;quot;Diplomacy&amp;quot; allows you to negotiate with your neighbors, to raise the influence, to change the play order or to acquire additional aristocrats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chamber for &amp;quot;Progress&amp;quot; allows you to discover new improvements which enables you to construct more cities, to improve your strength, to gain more influence, to raise the moral of your population, to enhance the effectiveness of your farmers, to execute navigation, or to improve your trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chamber &amp;quot;Bread &amp;amp; Circuses&amp;quot; allows you in combination with luxury goods to increase the morale of your people. Finally a &amp;quot;Revolution&amp;quot; allows you to ascend into the next higher epoch if you met the conditions for this raise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You gain influence by different actions during play, and by Influence Cards which are distributed secretly at start of the game. These cards will be evaluated at the end of the game and will add additional influence if you have fulfilled their conditions. Furthermore there are some aspects which will give you additional Influence Points after finishing the game. As said before, the player with most IPs will win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
