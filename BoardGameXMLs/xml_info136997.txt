			<description>YOU'LL NEVER GUESS! (...or will you?) Stimulate your brain, challenge your skills of deduction, and have fun trying to guess what players are up to! Say the Presenter reads out a question like &amp;lsquo;Where Am I?&amp;rsquo;. It could be Dallas, France, Hawaii or somewhere else. So how will you figure out where they&amp;rsquo;re pretending to be? By asking them your own questions to narrow down the possibilities.  You could ask: &amp;lsquo;Would I take a plane to get there?&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Is it a city?&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Does it have cold winters?&amp;rsquo;, or anything else you can think of. You decide what to ask. You may also get to roll for a Letter Clue. In another round you might be asked to guess what someone's supposed to be &amp;lsquo;wearing&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;eating&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;holding&amp;rsquo;, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
