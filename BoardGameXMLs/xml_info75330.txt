			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major League Baseball 2K9 or, in short, MLB 2K9, is a MLB licensed baseball simulation video game published by 2K Sports. The game was developed for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Wii. The game was released on March 3, 2009 to universally negative reviews.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New features were implemented for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions. Pitching had been simplified from 2K8 to &amp;quot;2-step pitching&amp;quot;, with &amp;quot;hold and gesture&amp;quot;, eliminating the third &amp;quot;Release Timing&amp;quot; step of 2K8, simplifying the motion while retaining the style. &amp;quot;Meatballs&amp;quot; (mistake pitches) have been removed - instead, badly released pitches will be less effective (fastballs will be straighter, curveballs will hang, and so forth.) The AI's pitch selection was also improved. (Players may elect to use the third step as an option, and users may also still use the older Precision Pitching from 2K7.) &amp;quot;Influence hitting&amp;quot; allowed users to control fly and ground balls, and bunt with improved precision. The developers added a zone hitting feature, improved hit distribution, and improved fielding realism and AI. Also added is the ability to cancel a throw and hold the ball, or pump fake during a rundown. A player can also attempt a &amp;quot;Quick Throw&amp;quot; which gets the ball to a base faster but also increases the chance of an error. Baserunning control has been simplified; a player only needs to hold down the trigger until it vibrates, for instance, then release it when ready to attempt a steal. There are also separate &amp;quot;Steal&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Speed&amp;quot; ratings for runners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
