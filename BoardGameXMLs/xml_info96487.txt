			<description>After the Scouts got a game in 1955, now the Guides get a game.&lt;br/&gt;44 cards. The game is won by the first player to play out a set of 10 cards and the First Class Badge, 11 cards in all.&lt;br/&gt;A game related to Rummy type games but you don't lay down sets or sequences, you lay one card a turn, adding to the length of the sequence started by you.. Players draw a card and, if they have a 1, they must lay it in front of them. Having play a 1, they are now 'looking' for a 2, and so on. If you lay down 10 cards eventually, you only need to add a First Class Badge card (which represents an 11 in your sequence), to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
