			<description>A collection of 4 challenging Puzzle-Games. Rules to play a co-op game with each puzzle is included in every package.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Egg Cetera&lt;br/&gt;The basic solution is an Egg Shape but as the pun in the title suggests, there are many other solutions to try. We offer some such as Faces, Foods, etc. &amp;amp; then you can create your own. Play alone or with as many as l2. 24 pieces, 8x10 finished. 8 to Adult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Messages&lt;br/&gt;The pieces are collections of signs, symbols and pictures. Put them together and a message appears. We have a variety of solutions, but the beauty of the puzzle is you can create your own messages - if you are clever enough! Play alone or as a group. 21 pieces. 7 to Teen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turnovers&lt;br/&gt;Co-operative Tic Tac Toe. Try to get 3 pieces of the same color in a row. Sometimes you have to turn them over and colors change. Sometimes pieces get piled on. Keep your wits about you or you soon have a tangle. A challenge indeed for a young thinker! Play alone or with as many as six. Playboard 5 x 5 in, 12 tokens. 8 to Adult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blot&lt;br/&gt;The pieces start as an ink blot. Rearrange them carefully and you can make animals, faces, letters, numbers, birds, ships, etc. We provide a booklet of 60 silhouetted shapes to try. Do ours, then create your own. Play alone or as a group. Rules for a game included. 7 pieces. 8 to Adult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
