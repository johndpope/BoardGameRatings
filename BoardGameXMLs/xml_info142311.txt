							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Animal Fun</name>
									
			<description>Animal Fun is a game that aims to help children identify animals and learn their names.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are each given an equal of cards, on which pictures of animals are printed, along with their names.  The heads of the animals, all of which are circular cut-outs, are removed and mixed face-down in a pile.  Each player takes his or her turn to flip one of the cut-outs and fits it to their cards if it matches one of their animals' bodies.  If it matches none, the cut-out is flipped back and mixed back into the pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to fit back all their animals' heads wins the game.  There is also the option to mix in and match the irregular shaped name cut-outs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
