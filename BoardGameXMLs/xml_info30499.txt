							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sea Turtle Survival</name>
									
			<description>Free print-and-play game to teach children about the problems facing sea turtle survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 10 turtle tokens, and the game can end when any player increases his population to 50 tokens, or when after a set number of turns, the player who has the largest population. If a player runs out of turtle tokens, he is out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 variable conditions that help or hinder population growth. Each time a six is rolled on the dice, spin the spinner to see if these conditions (human interaction, climate, predators, and food availability) flip-flop from high to low or from low to high:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As players move around the board, cards may be drawn to collect or lose turtle tokens, change conditions, and gain tokens by answering trivia questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As players complete one life cycle and cross the start space, their turtle population increases based on the current population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If players arrive at the same space at the same time, the turtles tussle producing more (baby) turtles for both players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All components, except pawns and turtle tokens are available to download at the website: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://edweb.sdsu.edu/courses/edtec670/Cardboard/board/s/seaturtle/seaturtle.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://edweb.sdsu.edu/courses/edtec670/Cardboard/board/s/sea...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
