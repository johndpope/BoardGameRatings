			<description>from the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game about a choice, and its consequences. The game is structured like a 3 Act play and follows the life of the Protagonist who, as a youth, has to make a choice between two friends and the paths in life they represent. More importantly, the players will explore both possible choices and their ongoing repercussions, good and bad, affecting the Protagonist&amp;rsquo;s later life. Once these two very different lives have unfolded, the Protagonist must forswear one path and exile one close friend from their life, choosing the other path and friend as their true fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
