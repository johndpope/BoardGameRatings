			<description>From the box: &amp;quot;A game where the players in their travels around the Australian Continent learn historical and modern day facts relating to each town, city and the many interesting and informative places along the way. The many everyday hazards of travel add to the interest and excitement of playing the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a map of Australia. Players move around the board, visiting each of the State capitals. The first player back to the starting town stops that round and receives $500. The player with the most money and Town Bonus cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
