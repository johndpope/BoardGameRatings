			<description>Microgame #21 in the Metagaming Microgames series is a wargame module meant to be the character-combat engine for a &amp;quot;Starleader&amp;quot; RPG that was never produced.  It concerns combat in the &amp;quot;30th century of the Space Era (SE)&amp;quot; between defenders and attackers aboard a &amp;quot;Kyrathan 'Royal' class warp yacht&amp;quot; named (conveniently enough) the &amp;quot;Trek Heaven.&amp;quot; It's a hex-and-counter game, but has character sheets; players can allocate resources to create characters as they would in an RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The official rules offer four scenarios, designed to ease the players into increasing complexity and role-playing elements: &amp;quot;The Rescue of Princess Rulian&amp;quot; (one rescuer trying to save the kidnapped princess vs. one terrorist), &amp;quot;Krotic's Treasure&amp;quot; (one rich guy and three thugs vs. four pirates), &amp;quot;Random Piracy&amp;quot; (three crew and one die worth of passengers vs. eight or fewer pirates), and &amp;quot;Random Raids&amp;quot; (all conditions GM- or player-designed).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximate playing time is very fuzzy -- obviously the &amp;quot;Rescue&amp;quot; scenario will play much more quickly than a complex user-designed &amp;quot;Random Raid&amp;quot; with lots of role-playing. The maximum number of players isn't necessarily 2, but all of the official scenarios assume only 2 sides or factions. To support more players, teams or special user-designed scenarios would be called for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
