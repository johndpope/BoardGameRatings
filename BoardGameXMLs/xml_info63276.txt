			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;Renowned gaming expert Martin Hackett brings together fantasy role-playing and fantasy wargaming in a complete gaming system, Magic and Monsters, where players can take part in adventures, lead armies into battle, conquer territory and found empires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In fantasy role-playing, players take a character whose part  unfolds as they make choices and interact with other players.  The game is rune by a 'Controller' who manages the rules and governs the behaviour of all the elements in a complete fantasy world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy wargaming, by contrast, is the clash of two or more mythical armies, played out with miniatures and scenery on a table-top battlefield.  Aspiring generals can lead armies of Goblins, Wolves, Dwarves, Elves or even Ghosts and Zombies, together with a host of mythical creatures.  Martin Hackett has over thirty years' experience of gaming and rule system writing.  He is the author of Lost Battlefields of Britain and lives in mid-Wales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
