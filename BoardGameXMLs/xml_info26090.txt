			<description>Butagaz (subtitled 'Le Tour de France du premier butane fran&amp;ccedil;ais) was released in France in 1934 to promote the use of gas. The gameboard measures 37x28cms (A3 format). Movement of the pawns is decided by a die. As a curiosity, the cyclist who rejoins a Butagaz truck on a square advances two squares. The gameboard has a Tour de France map on it with the two Butagaz factories (in Paillac and Rouen) also mentioned on it. Winner is the player who's pawn reaches Paris first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
