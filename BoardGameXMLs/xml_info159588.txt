			<description>Sticks, Stones and Dragonflame is a 2P micro-game in which each player attempts to destroy the castle of their sworn enemy. Castles are formed by 6 cards or locations, numbered 1 to 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn, players secretly roll a die and assault the matching location of their opponent's castle. However, players are allowed (and encouraged) to lie about their die result. The consequences of getting caught are dire, but getting away with the lie will bring victory much more swiftly. In addition, players have the option to manipulate luck by employing the services of powerful reinforcements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a location is destroyed, the card is flipped and can't be used or assaulted again. Once the Heart of the Castle is destroyed, the owner of the castle loses the game and their opponent is declared the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
