							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hibiscus and Hurricane</name>
									
			<description>Hibiscus and Hurricane is a shrewd game of exploitation, profit seeking, and risk tasking along the coast of a fictional tropical nation.  In H and H you play a civic minded developer tasked with the goal of generating additional profits for your investors while improving the lives of the citizens along a warm, rich, tropical coast that has recently emerged from a long time dictatorship.  You score points by developing provinces along the coast, bringing tourists to your resorts, and avoiding devastating hurricanes. Tourists are fickle and don&amp;rsquo;t take well to nasty storms and other calamities, but are comfortable in places well protected from natures fury while being furnished with amenities and goods. Players rush to fill the limited capacity of each province while placing &amp;quot;clouds&amp;quot; along specified tracks which will generate hurricanes that can strike their opponents cities and send their tourists packing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;H and H is a medium weight Euro game, similar in length to Ticket to Ride or Thurn and Taxis, with more strategic decisions than either of those games.  Its designed as a quick FUN game with plenty of strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:&lt;br/&gt;To invest in this region, bring tourists and score the most victory points after a predetermined number of hurricane strikes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;The Game is played over a predetermined number of rounds, signaled by the strike of a hurricane.  Typical game length is between 3-4 hurricanes (1-1.5 hours).&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with a deck of cards with special actions and bonuses and disasters, a game board representing a small coastal region, and wooden bits to keep track of tourists and improvements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card Management&lt;br/&gt;Players start with 5 cards in their hand. Players may not have more than 9 cards at the end of any turn.&lt;br/&gt;A turn consists of 3 actions, from one of the following combinations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Play 3 actions&lt;br/&gt;     Draw 3 cards&lt;br/&gt;     Play 1 action draw 2 cards&lt;br/&gt;     Play 2 Actions draw 1 card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choice is declared before any cards are drawn or played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each hurricane has been played out that ends a season, and the deck is re-shuffled.  At the end of each season all remaining tourists score points.  Three to five hurricane seasons are played out, and the player with the most victory points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
