			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this ingenious turn-based strategy game you play the role of Jack Putter, a cowboy, and you have a dream: To establish yourself as a respected farmer in your city and gradually buy land and build an economic empire.  All methods of generating cash will prove very useful in realizing your dream. You will thus hire various employees and engage in a diverse array of  endeavors such as the establishment of farms, ranches, mines and the incessant supply of your businesses with all necessities for their smooth operation. Horses, cattle, seeds and tools will all be in constant need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only will you have to cope with all the responsibilities of a cowboy and an aspiring tycoon, you will also have to attend to the random element of flood, Indian assault or locusts, to handle thieves and robbers and to keep a close mind to the competition whose dirty tricks may force you to deal with them swiftly and harshly. Will you prove worthy enough so as to establish yourself as a magnate in twenty years?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
