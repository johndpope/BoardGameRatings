			<description>The Fifth Element is a video game based on the film of the same name released on September 23, 1998 by Hudson in Japan, September 30 by Activision in North America and in October for Europe and the Windows version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the player incarnates Leeloo and Korben, fighting against the police, the Mangalores, Zorg and his thugs. The game has 16 levels, or 'Missions' as they are called in-game. Short clips from the film are played at the completion of certain levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game received average to negative reviews. GameSpot gave the game 2.4 out of 10, with the reviewer calling it &amp;quot;quite possibly the worst game I've ever played&amp;quot;. Game Revolution gave the game an &amp;quot;F&amp;quot; rating, concluding &amp;quot;Poor level design...boring puzzles...it just never ends, but I can't go on. Let me sum it up by saying that The Fifth Element is simply not fun to play. Not even a little bit.&amp;quot; IGN gave the game 5.0 out of 10, stating &amp;quot;All in all, this adventure/action game does what all of the other games in the genre do, but not in any way better.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Fifth Element (video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
