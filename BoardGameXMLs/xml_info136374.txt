			<description>In the turbulent feudal Japan, the warlords fighting each other to unify the country under the rule of his clan. Each player plays the Daimyo of one of these clans to become the new Shogun. One player that eliminates the Daimyo of the opposing faction will win the game, becoming the absolute sovereign of the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game is played over many consecutive shifts, and will last until one of the players remove the enemy Daimyo. If at the beginning of his turn, a player has fewer cards than allowed, must draw a new card from the deck to add it to your hand. Then you have to do one of the following actions:&lt;br/&gt;1. Attack (once per turn).&lt;br/&gt;2. Cure (once per turn).&lt;br/&gt;3. Pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
