							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Preppers</name>
									
			<description>A card game for 2-4+ players in which each player represents a separate group of Preppers who are preparing for the end of the world. Players accumulate supplies and advantages in several different categories.  While this goes on players eliminate different end of the world scenarios until only one remains. The remaining scenario will favour certain types of stockpile categories which will determine victory conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 common decks: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Stockpile Deck: This deck contains 10 cards in each of 13 different stockpile categories: Weapons, Food, Animals, Vehicles, Plants, Knowledge, Medicine, Shelter, Trade, Water, Power, Cold and Equipment. Each category of cards has two cards each of values 3 to 7.&lt;br/&gt;     Scenario Deck: The scenario deck contains 20 cards giving a description of the stockpile categories advantageous in overcoming it (e.g. Zombie Apocalypse = Weapons x3, Vehicles x3)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start flip over all the scenario cards face up and spread them over the centre of the table so that all of them are visible.  The top 5 cards of the stockpile deck are also flipped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 stages: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Prepping Stage: Players take turns with to flip over the top card of the stockpile deck and take 1 of the face-up stockpile cards and put it face-down in their stockpile. Players can look at their own stockpile cards but not their opponents. Move to Scenario Stage if there are no more face-up stockpile cards. &lt;br/&gt;     Scenario Stage: Players take turns to pick one of the face-up scenario cards and put it face-down in a discard pile. When there is only one scenario left, it becomes the End of the World Scenario (EOTWS) and play continues to the scoring stage. &lt;br/&gt;     Scoring Stage: The EOTWS will list categories that receive a bonus card value multiplier. For example: if it is the Zombie Apocalypse, all your Weapons cards and Vehicle cards are worth 3 times as much.  For every category you have zero cards in, get -5 points. Your final score is equal to the total point value of all your stockpile cards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
