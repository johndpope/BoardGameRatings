			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To use this conversion guide you will need a copy of I1: Dwellers of the Forbidden City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction: An AD&amp;amp;D 1st Edition adventure written by David Cook where characters may explore a unique and interesting mini-campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conversion guide allows Dungeon Masters to run the original module with 5th Edition rules and provides a reference sheet for encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now with New Spell Notes and Spell Conversion Notes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure was first used as a module for tournament play at the 1980 Origins Game Fair, and was later published by TSR in 1981 for use with the first edition Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons rules. The module was written by game designer David &amp;quot;Zeb&amp;quot; Cook, who partly ascribes his hiring by TSR to his work on this module. In the adventure, the characters are hired to find an object taken to a lost oriental-style city, which has been taken over by a cult of snake-worshipers, the yuan-ti, and their servants, the mongrelmen and tasloi. The module was ranked as the 13th greatest Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine for the 30th anniversary of the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons game in 2004. Dwellers of the Forbidden City is the first of the mostly unrelated and unconnected Intermediate series (I-series) of modules designed for characters at between 4th and 8th levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
