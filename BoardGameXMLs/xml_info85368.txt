			<description>The game is an indirect sequel to Echochrome.  The player controls a small stick-like figure who can walk, go up and down stairs, and press switches. The object of each level in the game is to move this stick figure from the entrance door to the exit door. There are multiple obstacles that the player must overcome to get to the exit door, including moving platforms, spiked blocks, and pressure sensitive bridges. The player is given a set amount of time to traverse the level, but each level is set up to be impossible to complete in just one playthrough. This is how time bounces come into play. Each time the player moves through the level a recording of their actions is created. When time bounces, the player plays through the same level again, but alongside the recording of what they did in the previous playthrough. This recording is known as an &amp;quot;echo&amp;quot; and appears as a shadow of the player. By cooperating with these echoes of the players past actions, the player can successfully get to the end of the level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Echoshift&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available as a download only in the United States, and on UMD in the UK and Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
