							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Treasury of the Pharoahs (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tombs and Treasures of the Pyramids!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement brings you over 30 magical items ideal for explorers in an ancient kingdom of pharaohs and pyramids, a land of deserts and tombs, verdant oases and dusty wadis, soaring monolithic temples and seedy back streets and black markets. These items are perfect fodder for tomb robbers of every stripe, uncovering long-lost ruins once hidden by the sands or forbidden to outsiders, but now ready to join a daring rush into the dangerous marketplace of artifacts and antiquities. From glittering gold and lush lapis to alabaster, ivory, papyrus, and faience, the treasures of the pharaonic kingdom fire the imagination of treasure hunters the world over, who stand ready to defy mummy guardians, swarming scarabs, and eldritch curses that threaten doom upon any who would violate their sacred burial spaces. Their rest disturbed, tyrants and terrors that have long slumbered may rise to bring ruin upon lands that had forgotten them, but no warning or risk is too great when the plunder of dynasties awaits just behind the next dune. This tome contains treasures of great value to tomb robbers and guardians alike, like the map cartouche and tomb warden's stele, along with deadly weapons like the scarab scourge and dune trap javelin to protective gear like the dynast aegis and mail of the radiant pharaoh. These items are redolent with the mysteries and magic of the desert, like the oasis mirror and faience idols to the alabaster icons of Bast and the canopic chest of eternal repose! If your players hunger for the riches of the ages and to garb themselves like the god-kings of old, they are going to love what they find in the Treasury of the Pharaohs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
