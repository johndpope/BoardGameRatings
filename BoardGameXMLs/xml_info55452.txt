							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chickens in the Mist</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The O'Conner brothers own and operate a small chicken farm in the hinterlands of Golan County, Texas. Unbeknownst to most citizens, the brothers also run an illegal cockfighting operation on the side. Unfortunately, the high-class attendees of these illegal matches have become somewhat jaded towards the normal brand of bloodsport, which has caused the brothers to seek out more exotic match-ups. In this case, the matches have progressed to fighting giant, carnivorous, mutant chickens in a great bloodletting of claws, beaks, and feathers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is presented in an easy format for the GM to customize for his individual campaign as he sees fit. Chickens in the Mist draws the characters into searching the O'Conner homestead for clues, leading ultimately along the back roads of Golan County in a running battle with enraged, giant, mutant chickens! This adventure makes another great addition to your Pinebox campaign or works equally well as a 1-shot adventure when your group needs a break from the ordinary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chickens in the Mist includes all of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Chickens in the Mist adventure.&lt;br/&gt;     One keyed map indicating a remote section of Golan County.&lt;br/&gt;     One page of cut-out figures representing the mutant chickens.&lt;br/&gt;     Full creature statistics on three new strains of Mutant Chicken!&lt;br/&gt;     More than 20 pages of content!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
