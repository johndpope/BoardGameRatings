							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes&#039; Crossroads: The Battle of Lausdell, December 17-18, 1944</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our victory stands behind the last battle!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;Excerpt from General Gerd von Rundstedt&amp;rsquo;s message to the German troops on the eve of the Wacht am Rhine offensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the German offensive in the Ardennes opened, speed was of the essence for them to win. The capture of the crossroads at Lausdell in the first days of the attack was crucial, as this would allow the 1st SS Panzer division to breakthrough. Holding the critical road juncture were the 1st Battalion, 9th Regiment of the 2nd Infantry Division, with support from Company A, 741st Tank Battalion and elements of the 99th Infantry Division, who had fallen back in the face of the overwhelming opening attacks the day before at Lanzerath. Behind this small force there was literally nothing to stop the Germans. Tasked with seizing the Lausdell crossroad was the 12th SS, Hitler Youth Division. One of the war&amp;rsquo;s truly epic fights was about to begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
