			<description>Designer's comment:&lt;br/&gt;G-Man here. Like swords and sorcery type adventures? Then check out my latest, The Skyward Citadel, written for the Barbarians of Lemuria RPG system and hosted by the ever-awesome Venomous Pao, on his blog Strange Stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's the premise: a floating castle has appeared in the skies above the wicked city of Unselmo. At night, winged shapes dart down to snatch up captives and hold them for ransom. Even the siege machines of Unselmo's ruler, the Great Tyrant, can't lob missiles high enough to reach this citadel in the clouds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the heroes. Can they find a way up to the sky-fortress, and once there, overcome its diabolical master, the arch-sorcerer Giacinto? And what terrible secret is he hiding beneath his gold-stitched robes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure has a bit of everything, from beast men mounted on giant bats to demons with Italian names. Though written for BoL, it would fit in perfect with other S&amp;amp;S systems like Crypts and Things, Jaws of the Six Serpents, and On Mighty Thews.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what are you waiting for? You don't need a Kickstarter pledge to access this sucker--download it for free, at the Venomous Pao's blog, Strange Stones&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
