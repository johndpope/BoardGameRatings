			<description>From Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Confucianism and the Succession Crisis of the Wanli Emperor, 1587 seeks to introduce undergraduate students to the suppleness and power of Confucian thought as applied to issues of governance during the Ming dynasty.  The game is set in the Hanlin Academy.  Most students are members of the Grand Secretariat of the Hanlin Academy, the body of top-ranking graduates of the civil service examination who serve as advisers to the Wanli emperor.  Some Grand Secretaries are Confucian &amp;quot;purists,&amp;rdquo; who hold that tradition obliges the emperor to name his first-born son as successor; others, in support of the most senior of the Grand Secretaries, maintain that it is within the emperor&amp;rsquo;s right to choose his successor; and still others, as they decide this matter among many issues confronting the empire, continue to scrutinize the teachings of Confucianism for guidance.  The game unfolds amidst the secrecy and intrigue within the walls of the Forbidden City, as scholars struggle to apply Confucian precepts to a dynasty in peril.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
