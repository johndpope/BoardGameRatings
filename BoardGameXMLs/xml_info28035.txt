			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you can test and improve your vocabulary and language skills while challenging your family and friends to a game of strategy and fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Better keep your wits about you! Players move their game pieces around the board, heading toward the winner's circle. They collect PASS and BLOCK cards as they go. PASS cards will assist you while BLOCK cards impede you. Passing and Blocking adds a dimension of strategy and planning not seen in other games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No matter your native language, Volangulary&amp;trade; will help you discover whether you really know the meanings of everyday words, and how to use them properly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Test your skills in one or more languages regardless of your age. Multiple game levels are included, enabling kids to play against kids, adults against adults, or kids against adults. Anyone can win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
