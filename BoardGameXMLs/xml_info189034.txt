							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS: Ultima</name>
									
			<description>GURPS: Ultima represents an attempt at bringing the world of the Ultima series of computer role-playing games to the realm of pen and paper, utilizing the GURPS role-playing system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While I have tried to remain true to the source material, I have likewise indulged in a bit of artistic license, adding to, and expanding upon, certain elements of the lore. I decided to present the material via a wiki, due to the ease of editing information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS: Ultima is an extensive project, and, while it is in a complete state, it will almost certainly be expanded upon and edited. This work represents one person&amp;rsquo;s interpretation, and there is certainly room for reinterpretation and improvement. I welcome any feedback, particularly by way of rules I may have misunderstood, areas which can be improved, or miscalculations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS: Ultima is an entirely fan-made, unofficial, noncommercial endeavor; a homage to the Ultima series and universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information can be found on the wiki: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://gurpsultima.pbworks.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://gurpsultima.pbworks.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
