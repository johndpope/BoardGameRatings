			<description>Trivia is a game that is not so much about knowing answers to trivia questions but more about having a good vocabulary. It is almost identical to the game &amp;quot;Facts in Five&amp;quot;, released a few years prior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the game set up, 5 cards are drawn, each with a unique list of categories. Categories from each are selected for this round. Letter tiles are drawn at random and both the categories and letters are noted on the player's pad. Players then have two minutes to try and create a word commencing with each of the letters, in each of the categories (25 words in total). At the end of the two minutes, a point is given for each word. Following, a new round begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most words at the end of the game is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;note: This differs from Fact in Five in that the timer and card categories are different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
