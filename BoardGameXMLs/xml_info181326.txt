			<description>Become a God... but without powers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Just Dust you are a god without powers in search of Redemption. The only chance you have to redeem yourself is to prosper the people assigned you. You can influence some key-characters that give you instant benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal on the game is to arrive at the end with more followers than your rivals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just Dust was inspired to my book: Solo Polvere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is composed 108 cards divided into:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 card &amp;quot;FAVOUR OF ANCIENT GOD&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 4 cards &amp;quot;HEART OF TOWN&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 5 cards characters&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 98 building cards: 40 cards production places (various colours) and 58 cards &amp;quot;RED&amp;rdquo; places.&lt;br/&gt; The cards are all: characters, structures, resources and money.&lt;br/&gt;The game hasn&amp;rsquo;t a set number of rounds. The player with the &amp;quot;FAVOUR OF ANCIENT GOD&amp;quot; card starts the game. He choose a character card placing it in front of himself and performs the action with the respective profit.&lt;br/&gt;Then the other players, starting from the left, perform the action without the profit.&lt;br/&gt;When all the players have selected the character and played the actions, the round ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build production places or &amp;quot;RED&amp;quot; places. Get the necessary resources and acquire followers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one who has at the end of the game the highest number of followers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
