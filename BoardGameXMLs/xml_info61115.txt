			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gush! Blush! Wonder and marvel at the sight of the volume which you now have the pleasure of holding in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;Yes, gaze with awe on that familiar watermark, chuckle as you recognise the onslaught of pretentious wit and occasional moments of sound design &amp;ndash; for Superliga now has another supplement!&lt;br/&gt;The tome which you are casually leafing through consists of 108 monsters and 108 items for use in your Superliga campaigns (actual numbers may vary. This document will be in a state of flux until about July of 2009). As always, the idea is not to do the work of&lt;br/&gt;the Overseer for the Overseer, but rather to enable the Overseer&amp;rsquo;s imagination to step in, make a couple of dry comments about the&lt;br/&gt;layout of the manual, and then create their own works of brilliance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
