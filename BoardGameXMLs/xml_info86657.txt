							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Outpost Qether (RuneQuest)</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outpost Qether, for use with the new version of RuneQuest is a setting guide to the westernmost Tirasim frontier. This outpost is home to all sorts: traders, criminals, farmers, and military men. It's a place where hope is fading fast now that the Judges in the capitol Arioch have decided that the fifty-year-old installation has outlived its usefulness. Unless someone finds a good reason for the outpost to remain, it will be shut down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently however, local scouts have returned with news: the Gadianti have set up a small post to the East and are digging for... something. Perhaps it might be just the thing to give the outpost reason to exist. All they need now is a party of adventurers to find out what's going on over there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is ready to run right out of the box. Everything you need is within these pages, including: detailed NPCs, maps of Qether and the outlying regions, and the adventure itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you ready to uncover the secrets of Outpost Qether?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
