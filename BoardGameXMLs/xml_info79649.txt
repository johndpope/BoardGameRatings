			<description>PowerSlave (Exhumed in European territories and Seireki 1999: Pharaoh no Fukkatsu in Japan; the US title being a clear reference to the Iron Maiden album Powerslave which features Egyptian art on its cover) is a first-person shooter developed by Lobotomy Software and published by Playmates Interactive Entertainment. It was released in the US, Japan, and Europe for the Sega Saturn, Sony PlayStation, and PC over the course of a year from late 1996 to late 1997.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PowerSlave is set in an area around the ancient Egyptian city of Karnak in the late 20th century. The city has been seized by unknown forces, with a special crack team of hardened soldiers sent to the valley of Karnak, to uncover the source of this trouble. However on the journey there, the player's helicopter is shot down and the player barely escapes. The player is sent in to the valley as the hero to save Karnak and the World. The player finds himself battling hordes of evil creatures including mummies, Anubis, scorpions and evil spirits. The player's course of action is directed by the spirit of King Ramses, whose mummy was exhumed from its tomb by these evil creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the game, gameplay follows a standard first-person shooter formula. Familiar elements from the genre, such as collecting keys to open doors in a level, are present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the game progresses, the player character picks up a number of artifacts which give him new abilities. Such abilities include being able to jump higher, levitate, breathe underwater, walk in lava, walk through force fields and jump further to reach previously inaccessible areas of the maps. In a similar fashion, there are a number of key symbols (Power, Time, War and Earth) that can open sealed doors in previously visited areas. In the console versions, each map is connected together by a world-overview map in a similar manner to Super Mario World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Exhumed (Video Game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
