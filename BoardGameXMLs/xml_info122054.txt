							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bridge Crew (Best Friends Version)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario uses the Best Friends rules but puts them into quite a different setting, though still one that is very apt. Bridge Crew is a popular, if somewhat cheesy, space opera about exploring new frontiers and contacting strange alien races (in other words, it&amp;rsquo;s classic Star Trek from a parallel universe). On-screen, the characters form a happy family who, though they may occasionally argue, will always risk their lives for each other.&lt;br/&gt; Off-screen, the actors are a bunch of self-centred, bitchy prima donnas who are only interested in the size of their dressing room, the amount of exposure they get and boffing fans on the set under the guise of getting them into the show as an extra.&lt;br/&gt; The players take on both sides as they try to create a classic episode of Bridge Crew and hence insure the series getting renewed, whilst also each making sure that they personally are top of the tree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
