							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Morrow Project 4th Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the long awaited 4th. edition of The Morrow Project. One of the best loved post-apocalyptic games from the 1980's!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One hundred and fifty years after the fall of civilization, the members of the Morrow Project wake to a changed world. Without the modern transit and communications infrastructures, distances that once took hours, now take weeks, and news that once traveled in milliseconds now takes months to arrive, if ever. This new world is characterized by tiny hamlets of simple daily existence awash in a sea of barbarism and anarchy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Morrow Project could not prevent the coming catastrophe, nor did they have the resources to help everyone immediately. It was possible to help with the rebuilding, but even this was a massive undertaking. Plan became action and over the years many well-trained teams were cryogenically frozen in hidden bunkers to emerge at the time when their resources and help could do the most good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intended to be part of an organized plan to re-build America, your team finds that they have missed the 3-5 year expected wake-up call. Now, far outside the original time frame and unable to contact the rest of the project, they must start alone the process that was intended for thousands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isolated in a world where the war is only a distant legend, your team must rely on their ingenuity, training and each other to carry out the general orders of the project:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Assist the population in rebuilding America whenever possible.&lt;br/&gt;     Reunite with the bulk of the Morrow Project forces.&lt;br/&gt;     Survive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Morrow Project may be played with nothing other than this book, dice, paper and pencil. Included in this book are full details on Morrow Project teams, vehicles, equipment, modern weapons, complete medical details, people and creatures living in the post-holocaust world, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
