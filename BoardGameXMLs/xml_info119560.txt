							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Maidenheim Book I: Amazon Adventures</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amazon Adventures is divided into two sections, the first of which will help you gain an understanding of just who the Amazons were, what they likely believed in about themselves, men, and especially non-Amazonian women, and their relations with the encroaching world around them. It is not supposed to be a historical, mythological, or scholarly work on the Amazons or Greek Mythology, nor does it assume to surpass, challenge, or replace anyone else's perceptions on just who the Amazons were and what they represented. This material is also left generic enough so that it can apply to any d20 campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second section is specific material for the Maidenheim: The Age of Scorn Amazon Campaign Setting, such as the races available for use as player characters, goddesses and deities for priestesses, and modified styles of armor for Amazon warriors in this particular campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
