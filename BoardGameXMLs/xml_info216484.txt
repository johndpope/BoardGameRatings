							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Asnar: The Last Kingdom</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asnar the Last Kingdom is a fantasy campaign setting steeped deeply within the Norse culture and pantheon. Though designed for 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons it is easily adaptable for any fantasy role playing game system. Asnar is a kingdom in desperate need of heroes. 150 years ago a horrible plague called the Red Death decimated the kingdom and left much of the land abandoned and desolate. The kingdom desperately tries to rebuild from the ashes of ruin while constantly being assaulted by evil forces from within and surrounding the kingdom. Without heroes Asnar will surely fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The campaign setting book for Asnar the Last Kingdom and digital files contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    20 Plot Hooks&lt;br/&gt;    18 Detailed Regions&lt;br/&gt;    33 Detailed Cities and Settlements&lt;br/&gt;    A Large Scale Beautifully Crafted Campaign Map&lt;br/&gt;    A detailed history of Asnar&lt;br/&gt;    A guide for each race to see how they fit into their campaign world&lt;br/&gt;    Detailed information of all the groups of power and influence within Asnar as well as enemies and threats&lt;br/&gt;    The Norse Pantheon fully worked out for a fantasy setting that includes humans, dwarves, elves, and other races.&lt;br/&gt;    A section detailing Important NPCs in Asnar&lt;br/&gt;    A Detailed guide to purchasing, restoring, and upgrading abandoned properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
