			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;T&amp;iacute;r Tairngire Wants You!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;T&amp;iacute;r Tairngire has changed. The predominantly elven nation has an ork at its head, and the residents have become more welcoming to outsiders, in the sense that they don&amp;rsquo;t always immediately threaten to shoot them when they come in sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is enough wealth and power in T&amp;iacute;r Tairngire to make even the slightest crack in the nation&amp;rsquo;s fa&amp;ccedil;ade tempting. Every shadowrunner knows that elves, especially powerful elves, do not rank high on the trustworthiness scale, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a deal breaker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anticipating lies and betrayals from the people runners work with is part of the game. Runners should just be sure to gather critical information about getting in to the T&amp;iacute;r, the major cities, and the dominant personalities before they go in, since forewarned is forearmed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Land of Promise is the resource runners need to get caught up on the current status of T&amp;iacute;r Tairngire and its leaders. With adventure seeds, profiles of notable personalities, and essential demographic information, this is a critical resource for anyone living in or near the elven nation&amp;rsquo;s shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Land of Promise is for use with Shadowrun, Twentieth Anniversary Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
