			<description>Players toss a coin, the winner having the choice of batting or fielding. Place the video cassette in player and press start/play and you will be in the thick of the action of World Cup Cricket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 3 hour VHS video contains three condensed world cup matches from the 1982 Cricket World Cup. Using the score cards supplied the game can be played 72 times with a different ending to each game. The games feature teams from Australia, New Zealand, India and Pakistan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you press play the battle commences, and the batting team strives to obtain the highest number of runs while the fielding team endeavours to take all their wickets before the end of the innings and so restricting the number of runs.&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the game is the team with the highest run total after both innings have been played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
