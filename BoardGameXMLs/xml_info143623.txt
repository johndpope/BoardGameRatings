							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Murder in the Puszta</name>
									
			<description>Situated on the edge of the Puszta National Park and about a mile from the nearest village, the Riders Inn is the perfect spot for tourists to experience traditional Hungarian customs and culture. But suddenly a dead body is found...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a murder mystery party game for 8 players. Everyone acts out the part of a suspect in a murder case. Over the course of a dinner, players cross-examine each other. &lt;br/&gt;This murder mystery game differs from the usual boxed versions in one respect &amp;ndash; the players won't get a character booklet at the beginning of the party which would gradually reveal new information. Instead they are given advance character information to read through before the party. &amp;quot;Murder in the Puszta&amp;quot; is based on real life insomuch as everybody already knows at the beginning of the evening everything they did and saw before. Even so, there is no need to learn anything by heart since during the game players can always look up details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
