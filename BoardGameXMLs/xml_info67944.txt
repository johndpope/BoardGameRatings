			<description>Every child loves to visit the zoo. Admire the magnificent animals, exotic specimens, endangered species. Now all these things can happen on the game board. Each player is the owner of the zoo, he must make to the zoo was full of animals.Be careful with the amount of space at the zoo since we have limited. During the game we decide whether it is better to have large animals such as elephant or a giraffe or more animals, but smaller. Pride of every zoo are rare animals (Panda bear, or Chameleon). &lt;br/&gt;When the zoo will be full of animals, it's time to exchange specimens with other players, and visit our zoo visitors in giving us the victory points. The player who collects the first set of their number to be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
