							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stella Nova: Journey of the Magi</name>
									
			<description>Stella Nova: Journey of the Magi is a race to see which of the wise men (magi), who have seen a new star (stella nova), can be the first to safely reach the Christ child in Bethlehem with the three gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magi ride camels along the caravan trails from the Far East to Bethlehem.  Each roll represents one day in the journey.  Magi must carry enough food and water (Supply Cards) to get to the next city or oasis.  For each daily roll, the magi must turn in a Supply Card.  If the magi run out of supply cards on the trail, then they must go back and replenish their supplies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The magi must overcome hazards on the dangerous caravan trails as they cross over mountains and through deserts, such as: blinding sand storms, attacks by robber bands, fog and clouds that obscure the guiding star, and hidden assassin spies. These obstacles can be overcome with the right cards: Tent Cards for sand storms, Weapons Cards for robbers, Compass Cards for fog, and Secret Code Cards for spies.  These Equipment Cards can be obtained at different cities on the trails in the North-- if one can answer a trivia question.  The player can choose from two types of questions: History &amp;amp; Geography, or Biblical Scriptures.  Young children can play without having to answer the questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So as well as a Race Game, Stella Nova is a Strategy Game where players must decide which is the most efficient path to take, and what resources and equipment to keep and what to leave behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course the magi must also obtain the three precious gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh to give to the Christ child.  These Gift Cards are only available a specific cities in the South.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magi can capture a wild stallion at the oases and get a Wild Stallion Card.  These cards can provide an advantage, such as racing ahead or jumping over other magi, or can give a disadvantage to an opponent, such as going back three spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stella Nova is a great Party Trivia game too.  Players demonstrate their knowledge by answering questions on Biblical history and geography to obtain the needed Equipment and Gifts Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Stella Nova is an Educational Game for students, because it's historically and geographically accurate.  The cities have their ancient names from the time of Christ.  For example, Yathrib in Arabia is called Medina today.  It was renamed by the Muslim prophet Mohamed in about 622 AD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
