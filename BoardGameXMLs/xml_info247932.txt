			<description>Each player has 6 pawns. The player rolls a die and. As long as he has pawns that are not on the game board, sets a pawn on the space of his color in the inner ring of the turntable. If the space is already occupied, the the first pawn is removed from the game board and has to be placed again. Then he moves the turntable by sticking his finger in the hole of the same number on the outer ring, till his finger is stopped in the indentation of the brown barrier. If one of his pawns lands on a 1 or 2 of his color, by placing the pawn or turning the turntable, the pawn is placed on a destination space. The first player to get all 6 pawns on a destination space wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
