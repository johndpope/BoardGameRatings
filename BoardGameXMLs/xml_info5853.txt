			<description>Smerge is a word game that uses 127 playing cards, some having single letters on them and some having 2 or 3 letters that form common letter combinations (Example TH).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two rule sets that come with the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is &amp;quot;16 Card Memory Master&amp;quot; where players take turns flipping over 3 cards and try to form a word with them. If a player can't make a word the letters are flipped back over, if a player can make a word he keeps the cards that he used to form the word and new cards are placed down to replace the cards used. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also &amp;quot;5 Card Call&amp;quot; In this game 5 cards are dealt out face up. The first player to see a word and call it out collects the cards in that word. More cards are added to bring the count back up to five and once again players get to look for a word and call it out. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
