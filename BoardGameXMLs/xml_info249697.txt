			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a cooperative, 1 to 6 players, settled in the Elements Realities universe, a concept by Giortech GmbH.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the players are Temporal Agents, in a Time Agency set in the near future, that jump in time for dangerous missions in the past, in the ancient Greece.&lt;br/&gt;The agents must protect the Timeline and preserve the Reality from the attacks of a mysterious force only known as... Darklings! All the wonderful discoveries of the ancient Greece, the democracy, the philosophy, the arts, the sciences, are at risk. The Agents jump in the middle of the most important key events of the mankind to protect the Reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Produced at LudoFact, this made in Germany game is presented in German Version. English Version is coming shortly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game mechanics of Elements Realities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is cooperative as all the agents have to fulfill dangerous missions in the past to protect our Reality from the attacks of the treacherous and mysterious Darklings.&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses an Agent with specific unique skills. Then, each agent chooses a mission card among the currently available in the Agency, and starts the jump procedures: First a briefing card is executed, and then the jump is done on the Time Jump Track with a dice roll, based on the time distance in epoch to jump back. If the jump is missed, then a roll is made on the Jump Failure Track, where the Agent can influence the result by spending his own Reality Chits (the &amp;quot;coins&amp;quot; of the game). When an Agent manages to jump successfully into the past, the Mission story is built. The mechanism of building the mission is so that it is almost impossible to build the same mission twice. Every mission card has objectives on the bottom, and a sequence of Events cards is extracted, each containing one or more objectives symbols, until all the missions goals are paid off. A certain number of Reality Chits are positioned on the Mission card, as final reward. The Agent then each turn faces one Event card that can be passed by successfully rolling against some of the personal skills. Every Event passed shall make gain or lose Reality Chits on the Mission card. If at any moment the number of Chits should go less than zero, the Mission is lost and the Agent is transferred back to the Agency, where can start a new Mission. Every lost Mission reduces by 1 the level of our Reality. Every successful Mission increases the level by 1. Goal of the game is to reach level 10. When all Agents have moved in a round, before the next, there come the Darklings. An Agent per turn possesses the Destiny in his hands, a special white wooden Chit. Whoever owns the Destiny faces the Darklings in that round. A Time Epoch is moved forward, a Reality Chit is given to the Agency from the bank, and a Darklings card is extracted and positioned on the board. If the Darklings card has the same symbol of the current Epoch (circle, triangle or square) then the card comes into effect, and the negative effects are executed. Before that, the owner of the Destiny can decide to roll against the Darklings cards as many dices as many Reality Chits of the Agency is willing to pay. The roll is made against the current Reality Level, so if the Agents are losing the game it will become increasingly more difficult, and if they are winning it will become easier. For every successful roll, a Darklings card of choice can be removed and the positive effect on it is executed. Then a new round starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most interesting aspects of the game is its configurability. The difficulty level is based on the starting level chosen for our Reality and the Darklings Reality. This amounts to almost 100 difficulty levels to choose from, in a 2D space of difficulties. Elements Realities will never become obsolete! Then the Game is unique in that an Agent can join the game in every moment, and can leave in any moment. No more uh-uh moments when a friend knocks at the door and you are already in a one hour game. Just offer a chair and an Agent card. The same if someone has to leave or pause the participation during a game. This *is* freedom!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game of Elements Realities has many facets: family game, strategy choices, roll of dices, collaboration between players, deep immersive story. The presence of Special Missions that build exciting Side Stories that span for multiple Mission cards, give the game an uncommon depth. The Agents, the Stories, the entire World of Elements Realities, are depicted in the Science Fiction Novels that are regularly published. An entire Universe comes to life. Giortech shall also produce a first pilot episode of a series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A final note from the Author &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I want to make a special note, at the end of this presentation of Elements Realities, to put under light the fact that the Missions presented in the game, and the surrounding stories, happen in the real Greek history. By playing the game, you will learn important events that forged the world in which we live, and the dates in which these events happened. So the Edutainment aspect is great and unique.&lt;br/&gt;Last, but not least, I leave you with a thought. There is a deep analogy between our lives and the Universe of Elements Realities. As the Agents jump in Time to protect the great discoveries of the ancient Greece, the Philosophy, the Arts, the Democracy, so everyone of us, in our today time, must not take for granted once and for all terms like Culture, Arts, Democracy, but we have to nurture them every day a little.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of us is a Time Agent, in our time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
