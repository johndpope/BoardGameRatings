			<description>You are caught with your canoe by the raging torrent of Niagara Niagara Falls. But you're not alone. Several teams compete, who will remain the longest on the rapid?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses two canoes of the same color and place them on the starting line.&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the player throws three dice: two normal D6s to determine canoe movement, and a special dice with blank sides and stars.&lt;br/&gt;The star indicates that the movement mechanism is activated, thus carrying the canoes over the edge of the waterfall.&lt;br/&gt;The player can move his own canoes or the canoes of his opponents!&lt;br/&gt;Tree trunks floating on the river can force re-throws for the canoes passing them.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to stay the longest on the rapid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
