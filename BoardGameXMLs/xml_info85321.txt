			<description>Set during the Golden Age of Sail, players each take command of a nation state colonizing a group of unexplored islands.  The goal of the game is to build the most productive empire through conquest, trading, and economic development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fully reconfigurable board ensures that every game plays completely differently, and scales up to make room for additional players.  A three-tier tech tree creates an enormous amount of strategic depth.  An innovative turn system allows players to trade off resources for extra moves.  Fast-paced play keeps everybody playing and guessing until the winning empire is crowned!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
