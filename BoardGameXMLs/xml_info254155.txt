			<description>PorkQuest is a new expansion that will enrich the OrcQuest universe with new enemies. Here, the Porks have a mission to come chase your heroes during their adventures. Secret poachers have hired these ignoble beings to track down and kill any orc infiltrating the Kingdom of Istarra. So you can add porks as additional enemies in any chapter of the Main Campaign. You will also have the choice of playing them as heroes, allying with the orcs, and you risk seeing them kill each other at the slightest misunderstanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As enemies of orcs, the Porks have a mission to hunt down and kill any green skin they encounter. The Pork Trackers will have their own Patrols instead of the normal Patrols. Except that here, the Porks &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; the presence of orcs, thanks to their highly developed sense of smell. They will go directly to the heroes to try and exterminate them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, Pork Trackers are not the only ones who resent greenskins. Three Pork bounty hunters prowl the area and may arrive at any time to do carnage, even if it means slaughtering everyone between them and their target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Porks can also be used as heroes alongside the orcs and as a band of adventurers who have sworn to help the greenskins in their quest, provided they leave them the found treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
