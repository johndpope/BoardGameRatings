			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bill's Tomato Game is a 1992 puzzle, platform  computer game for the Atari ST  and Amiga. The game was developed and published by Psygnosis. The game requires the player to guide Terry the tomato up the vine of Sammy Squirrel and rescue his girlfriend Tracey from the squirrel's villainous clutches. The vine consists of 10 worlds of 10 levels each. All consist of numerous obstacles he has to overcome using the help of various items (e.g. fans or trampolines).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reason the game is called Bill's Tomato Game is because it was designed and programmed by Bill Pullan, although the manual states that this is not the case. The artwork was by Lee Carus-Westcott and the music was by Mike Clarke. Bill Pullan has stated in various TV interviews that the inspiration for the &amp;quot;sensei&amp;quot; character was based on childhood friend Kyle Aldritch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
