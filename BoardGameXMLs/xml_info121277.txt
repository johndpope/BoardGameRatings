			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A graphical adventure game with a point and click interface. You're a private investigator, you were hired several years ago to investigate a scientist, Professor Tcherslawsky. The pay was good so you accepted the job, but two days later your client disappeared and you decided to stop the investigation. Several years later, a journalist friend of yours named Sophie, sensing a good story, decided to investigate Professor Tcherslawsky and went to his house. She has been missing since, and you have a bad feeling about this. Upon hearing about a seminar Tcherslawsky is attending, you decide to investigate his house while he's away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're standing in the entrance of the house. You have two and a half hour before the seminar ends and the professor returns. What do you do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
