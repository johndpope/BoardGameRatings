			<description>[User summary]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to pilot a space ship to complete a series of races on different arenas and win the final one.&lt;br/&gt;The game lasts a number of fictional &amp;quot;months&amp;quot; (with absurd alien names). Each month offers one or more (up to six or so) races: each race has different parameters (entry fee, prize, type of landscape, number of laps required, etc.). You may consult the data of each race, but are allowed to choose only one per month. If you complete it (by surviving the required number of laps: a variety of obstacles and enemy aliens shooting at you will compicate the matter), you get the prize. If you are destroyed (by collision or enemy fire), you get nothing. You lose only if your remaining funds are not enough to pay the entry fee of any race for the next month. You may also skip a month (or more) entirely, if you are rich enough to directly enter a race of the next month (you may like to do so because the month you skipped had only arenas with paramenters you disliked, so you opted to save the entry fee). Thus you do not have &amp;quot;lives&amp;quot;, but rather a resource (cash) to manage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
