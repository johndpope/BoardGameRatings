			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadowdancers exist in the boundary between light and darkness, where they weave together the shadows to become half-seen artists of deception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadowdancers are a sub-class of Rogue (see PC12 &amp;ndash; Rogue) whose focus on stealth transcends the normal limits of reality and enters the magical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally a 3rd edition prestige class, I converted it to a full class for my game a while ago. It's been sitting on my hard drive for several months and decided to finally upload it. It's in many ways a fighter/thief/illusionist, so I didn't include a version for B/X as that does not have an illusionist class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
