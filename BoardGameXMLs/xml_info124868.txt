			<description>A deck of cards each of which bears either three English prefixes (such as &amp;quot;CON- PRE- EX-&amp;quot;), three English suffixes, or one English root word to which prefixes and suffixes can be added.  There are also five special &amp;quot;prize&amp;quot; cards which bear one suffix each (&amp;quot;-ANT&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;-IBLE&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;-EE&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;-OR&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;-FUL&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for five different games to be played with the cards (&amp;quot;Mode I&amp;quot; through &amp;quot;Mode V&amp;quot;) are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;Mode I&amp;quot;, the game described at greatest length, each player begins with four cards in hand, and four cards begin face up on the table.  Players on their turns must combine one card from hand with one or more face-up cards from the table, to form a word.  They may also steal a word from a previous player if they can add a card to make a new word.  If they cannot do either of those, they must instead contribute a card from their hand to the table.&lt;br/&gt;Players score points for making words of four syllables or more, for making words using &amp;quot;prize&amp;quot; cards, or for using the last card from the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
