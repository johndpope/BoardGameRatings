			<description>Dawn of the Dice of the Dead is a cooperative horror survival game for 1-4 players based on the dice system created by Mads Brynnum for Dice of the Living Dead.  The game adds an epic storyline and a multiplayer framework, as well as new mechanics.  Players represent survivor groups who have a limited time to search through an abandoned mall to find supplies and materials that will help them be rescued, all the while fighting off ravenous zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dawn of the Dice of the Dead can be played solo by controlling 1-4 survivor groups, or cooperatively by 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As of March 2010, a print-and-play playtest version is expected to be available soon, as well as a Vassal module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
