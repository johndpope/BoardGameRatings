			<description>Sentymentalna Gra Planszowa PRL (Sentimental Boardgame PRL) is a game about life in People's Republic of Poland. Players do their best to buy a car, but this is no small feat, requiring both money and more than a little luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players in turn roll a pair of 6-sided dice, moving their pawns around the board according to the number rolled and following the printed instructions: drawing cards, earning and losing money, and trading various Communist-era commodities, such as a Washing Machine Frania.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to buy a car (represented by a cardboard model of Fiat 125p), either directly from the sole producer, Polmozbyt, which requires a ration card, or  at much higher expense from second hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rectangular, Monopoly-style game board depicts the Communist-era Warsaw's skyline. Caricatures on game cards and money represent actual PRL-produced commodities and Polish currency from that period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
