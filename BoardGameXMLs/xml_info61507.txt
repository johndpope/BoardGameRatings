							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dire Heroes: Gas Attack at Ypres</name>
									
			<description>The Ypres salient, a 6 mile (10 km) jut into German held territory, was established after the First battle of Ypres in the autumn of 1914. The position was tentative being surrounded by German forces on three sides.  As a result, the Allies started to dig-in forming defensive trenches.  The Germans followed suit starting the race to the sea that culminated in long trench lines that stretched from Switzerland to the North Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the spring of 1915, the German command was ready to launch an offensive to force the capitulation of the salient.  In an attempt to overcome the unexpected stalemate of trench warfare the German command decided on the use of chlorine gas to pry open a section of the Ypres salient and conclusively cut the salient off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;French Algerians, Territorials, Canadians and British were holding the salient unaware of what was to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dire Heroes - Gas Attack at Ypres is a rule book that is used in conjunction with a standard Memoir '44&amp;trade; board and components to recreate the 2nd Battle of Ypres during the Great War. Players take turns moving their units and launching offensives in order to capture objectives or to force the surrender of the opponents forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with the infamous gas attack and the German offensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requires a Memoir '44&amp;trade; basic set and the Dire Heroes - Gas Attack at Ypres rule book to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Memoir '44 is a registered trademark of Days of Wonder, Inc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
