			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pool flared to life and a glowing archway appeared in the mists that hovered over the water. Kor hesitated a moment. Then the tromp of boots and shouts of pursuit came echoing down the corridor behind him. With an oath on his lips, Kor ran toward the pool and leapt into the glowing archway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who knows what lurks beyond the Misty Archway or within the chamber of the Glowing Stone? You will, if your brave enough to draw a card from one of the Custom Encounter II decks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-awaited sequel to the original Custom Encounters deck is here! Custom Encounters II brings you six new nine-card decks for special areas in your Dungeon Deck games. The areas covered are the Web Chamber, Shimmering Pool, Hydra Statue, Glowing Stone, Misty Archway and Throne Room. The decks provide special encounters for the Web Chamber, Shimmering Pool, Glowing Stone and Misty Archway areas and special search results for the Hydra Statue and Throne Room. Add new surprises, fun and excitement to your dungeon delving games with Custom Encounters II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Custom Encounters II requires the Dungeon Deck for complete use. Although not required, you may also wish to use the Encounter Deck, Event Deck and Treasure Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
