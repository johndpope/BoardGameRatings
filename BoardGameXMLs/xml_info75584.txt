			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silent Scope is an arcade game that puts the player in the shoes of a sniper during a series of terrorist incidents. Unlike most first person shooters, this gun for this game is mounted to the machine, requiring players to physically alter their position to shoot. Other notable characteristics of the game include:&lt;br/&gt;The Gun: The gun itself is not a light gun, but mounted on an oversized joystick. The featured sniper rifle in the game is based upon the HK MSG-90.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gun Scope: The gun used in Silent Scope arcade machines is shaped as a sniper rifle, and its scope features a small LCD display to show a zoomed-in view of the current area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time Limit: Players are constantly fighting against the clock at the top of the game, time is increased after clearing an area of all enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life Recovery: To recover life lost in the game, players must look for beautiful women and train the scope on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Auto-reload: Players do not reload the gun, the magazine is reloaded automatically after every five shots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bosses: Bosses have a set amount of hit points (normally 5 or 10 unless they are in a vehicle) they can be killed with one shot if the player hits them in the head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was successful enough to spawn sequels: Silent Scope II, Silent Scope 3, Silent Scope EX and a version for the Game Boy Advance. A port has also been announced for the iPhone OS. The game was offered for a $.99 promotion from August 27 to August 29, 2009 on the App Store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
