			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Braya'Traebor has succeeded in his plan to become a Champion of House Traebor but his path to vengeance is not yet complete. Now resident at the Palace of Traebor he awaits his inclusion in the roster of the Imperial Games, biding his time for the opportunity that will set his revenge in motion. Such an opportunity does not take long to present itself. On a storm-swept night he kills a Morg attendant delivering food to his cell, and then the guard charged with the Morg's safety. Taking the guard's clothing and scimitar Braya has all he needs to begin measuring his vengeance upon the Masters of Traebor. In this mission he will either succeed or die in the attempt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
