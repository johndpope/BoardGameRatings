							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">But Not In Vain: The Battle for Calais, May 1940</name>
									
			<description>But Not In Vain is a war game simulation of the battle for Calais in May, 1940. After breaking out of the Ardennes the German armored and motorized forces drove for the Channel ports to divide the Allied forces from one another. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in Belgium and the British High Command in London were in a quandary as to how best to proceed; whether to find a way to breakout of the German encirclement or withdraw from the continent back to Great Britain. The Allied forces in Calais, composed of recently landed British regular and reservist (Territorials) infantry, as well as elements of the 1st Armoured Division, received contradictory orders as to whether they were to defend the port, advance and attack, or withdraw. The battle of Calais in many ways came to stand for the tragic outcome  of the campaign for the Allies in 1940. The garrison&amp;rsquo;s determined stand also took a toll on the German&amp;rsquo;s 10th Panzer Division, and that any invasion of Great Britain would not be easy or similar to what transpired in France and Low Countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you do as well or better?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complete game of But Not In Vain is composed of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This rules booklet&lt;br/&gt;     One 11&amp;quot; by 17&amp;quot; map&lt;br/&gt;     One Players&amp;rsquo; Aid Sheet&lt;br/&gt;     180 single-sided, un-mounted counters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
