			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lab Rats by Colin Fisk&lt;br/&gt;The Premise: This is a fairly straightforward &amp;ldquo;bug hunt&amp;rdquo; scenario. All the players should be students at Gothik Tonicmiska Arkmah (GTA) High School. Add in a new electronic security system with a serious fault, some giant mutant rats and let the fun ensue. The mood should be one of tension and action. The players should come to expect nothing is going to come their way, and rats are going to be dropping from the ceiling at precisely the wrong moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spam in a Cabin by Colin Fisk&lt;br/&gt;The Premise: A child gets killed in a snowmobile accident. His mom summons a Wendigo to avenge his death. High School kids snowbound in a luxury cabin in the woods, each with the possibility of being controlled by the Wendigo to kill everyone else&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mermaid Cove by James Stubbs&lt;br/&gt;The Premise: The characters are all high school kids out for their graduation cruise in the Bahamas. They&amp;rsquo;ve got a chartered boat that has made the usual stops at Freeport for booze and drugs. Back in international waters, its time for sex, drugs and rock n&amp;rsquo; roll! Too bad the characters never intended on being marooned with a group of young nubile mermaids eager for love&amp;hellip; and that, contrary to popular belief, is not a good thing. This scenario is very loosely inspired by Sebastian Gutierrez&amp;rsquo;s She Creature, a wonderful overlooked horror film if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Always Prepared by James Stubbs&lt;br/&gt;The Premise: A local Boy Scout troop hikes into the remote wilderness for a weekend of learning, companionship and death! A hungry werewolf is on the prowl in the woods in search of prey. Think of it as Dog Soldiers but with kids. Obviously, skills such as Hold Liquor or Mixology won&amp;rsquo;t apply unless someone was really brave and is hiding a can or two of their older brother&amp;rsquo;s beer. Likewise, Seduction is right out as is Shooting. Another fun thing to do is to have a supply of post-it notes. When a player does something that a real Boy Scout would be a badge for, write it on the post-it note and make them wear it on their clothes such as First Aid, Animal Tracks, Climbing, Fire Starting, Cooking, Knot Tying, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
