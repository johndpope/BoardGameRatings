							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grit and Gunslingers</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gunslinger is the archetypical hero of the west, a lone warrior who pits his skill-at-arms and mettle against threats ranging from challengers desiring a shootout at high noon and bandits threatening to destroy the livelihood of towns and whole territories, to hostile natives and packs of wild animals. In many ways the gunslinger is a natural evolution of the heroes of older eras, a direct outgrowth of the black knight, highwayman, and wandering martial artist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To expand on the range of gunslinger options we provide 19 new deeds ranging from 1st to 19th level, and 14 new grit feats, allowing gunslingers to become more versatile, customizable characters. A selection of new gunslinger gear is also provided, including new alchemical cartridges and bandoliers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make grit itself more flexible we also provide a wide range of new options for alternate uses of grit, including applying deeds to different categories of weapons, and alternate forms of grit such as guile and panache. An alternate gunslinger class, the fusilier, is provided to show how these rules work in practice, and to give an option for having dashing Three Musketeers-type characters with less explicit Old West flavor. This allows the grit rules, deeds, and magic items from Ultimate Combat become a more useful part of a wider range of campaign styles, including games with no firearms at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
