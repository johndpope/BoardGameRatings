			<description>&amp;ldquo;Card game version of  N/A. Opposing Noble Houses vie for domination in this quadrant of space.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with one Homeworld Card, one Leader Card, four Power Tokens, and a hand of eight cards drawn from the deck. The game is played in the following phases: Intrigue, Event, Duel, Attack (Military or Political), Production, and Recruit. Leaders may be targeted for assassination or duels. Power Tokens are won from other players by making successful political attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to become Governor of the Sector. You can do so by eliminating all of your opponents, or by being the first player to accumulate eight Power Tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
