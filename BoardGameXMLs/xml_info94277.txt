							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Redneck: The Comedy Role-Playing Game of Southern Dialects, Missing Teeth and Bad Ideas</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to my second attempt at a 24 Hour RPG. This time around I plan on delving into the seedy world of the southern redneck and their kin. This is by no means a serious game, even if there is some drama involved. We all know that no matter how serious a fight begins, everyone is laughing when someone is hit in the groin with a wiffle ball bat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this world, family trees are little more than bushes, or even sticks. One man's sister is another brother's wife. Thirty two people standing in the same room equals a full set of teeth, and most of those will be stained with tobacco. This is a world where dares are common, and no one dies until they say &amp;quot;Hey y'all. Watch this!&amp;quot; Huntin', fishin' drinkin', watchin' NASCAR; all this and more can be yours in Redneck the Role-Playing Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
