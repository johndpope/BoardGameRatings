			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever heard sports fans talking obsessively about fantasy stats and been really confused?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever wanted to stock a dungeon with nasty monsters while simultaneously being a member of the party, but not in a weird, GMPC, Mary Sue kind of way?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FANTASY DUNGEON BALL IS THE GAME FOR YOU!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a GM-less RPG for players who create a dungeon with monsters, traps, and treasure, and then run through it as a party. The more damage you and your hand-chosen monsters do, the more experience you get!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is both simple and needlessly complicated, while still being completely not dissatisfying for all players. And you don&amp;rsquo;t need a GM! Who needs them anyway? Too busy hiding behind a screen to look you in the eye as they mercilessly crush your character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
