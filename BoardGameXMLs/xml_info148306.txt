							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wizard Akyrz</name>
									
			<description>Game Documentation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Evil Sorcerer lay in the depths of his despair, waves of spiritual agony tortured his Soul. To be defeated twice by the efforts of a mere mortal was almost too much to bear. Only an inherent force of Evil prevented the Wizard from complete vanquishment. Eons seemed to pass as the Wizard slowly rebuilt himself from within, feeding on malice as maggots feed on rotten meat. A plan was forming in his demented mind, a plan that would ensure victory over the mortal enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plan that grew would learn from the errors of the prevoious two plans - In the first of these plans, the Wizard had stolen the Golden Baton, an artifact that brought power and prosperity to mortals. The plan failed when a mortal triumphed over incredible odds and recovered the Golden Baton, restoring it to the Royal Palace. In retaliation, the Wizard employed his evil ally XERDON to cast a spell on the Baton itself that would render it impotent. Again this plan failed when the same mortal vanquished XERDON with the aid of a Magical Arrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wizard took heart as his new plan was now fully formed, his plan was designed to utterly destroy the mortal who had been instrumental in his earlier downfall. The Evil Wizard Akyrz himself would take on an earthly form and then he would lay a trap which would inevitably lure the mortal into an Evil snare from which there would be no escape.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
