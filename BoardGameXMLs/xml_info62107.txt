							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lure of Delusion</name>
									
			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This adventure was playtested in TLG&amp;rsquo;s weekly C&amp;amp;C game and was written for the Castles &amp;amp; Crusades tournament adventure being run by John Wright and Eric Piper at GenCon 2009.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module is designed for 6-8 characters with a challenge level of 2-4. Overland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Upon the edge of the world, beneath the eves of the Darkenfold forest, lie the Elkhorn Deeps. Here, where men eek out a living in the shadows of the forest, lays the small berg of Lead Hill. With stone walls and stout towers Lead Hill is a sanctuary or sorts, where travelers may lower their guard and relax. For beyond those walls are the wilds, and the Darkenfold is an unkind place, peopled by dark forces, fey, eldritch powers, and creatures long dead whose still wander the earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of all the dangers the people of Lead Hill face, the most horrifying came to pass. Two children, too young to know the world, vanished from their home, carried off into the forest by some foul minded creatures. Faeries love to torment the lives of men through their suffering children, so few are surprised. Though none know who did it, why, or how. They left only tell tale signs behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of late a hag haunted the area, pestering Lead Hill&amp;rsquo;s mage and its citizens, but they drove her into the forests. Harpies dwell in the woods not far and some have encountered the tree folk in the deeps. Other creatures abound and stalk the edge of wild, hunting for human prey. So none can say what has happened to the children, though all want them returned, or at the very least, those who lifted them, cast down and slain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the Elkhorn Deeps and attempt a rescue of the missing children! But be wary for things are not always as they seem and where allies and enemies work in tandem, great dangers often dwell. But above all, beware the lure of delusions.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
