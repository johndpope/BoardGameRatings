							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Panzerschlacht 2: The Battle for Torda, Sept 1944</name>
									
			<description>The battle for Torda was a prequel to the Russian advance at Debrecen a month later. Torda was the first Russian attempt to trap much of the German 8th Army in the Carpathians. The battle was smaller scale and one in which the Hungarians conducted one of their few successful offensives. Very few German units were involved (except for the 23rd Panzer Division) and successfully tossed the Romanians back to the Maros River until the arrival of the Russian lead units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
