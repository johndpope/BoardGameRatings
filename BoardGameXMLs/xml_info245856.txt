			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some men are irresistibly driven to better themselves. They might walk the Earth in search of whatever it might be that might fill the void in their hearts and souls. Endo Motomu was such a man. With every new thing learned, he only hungered for more. That is until he discovered the Temple of Light. He was trained to harness the Golden Ki and prepare for the rise of chaos dragons and their threat to the world. Although the dragons have yet to rise, Motomu believed he reconized their rising influence and so left the temple to use his considerable skill and power to stem the tide of chaos as the hero, AURUM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
