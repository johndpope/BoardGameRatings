							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Into Oblivion</name>
									
			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the total destruction of the evil, paranoid computer that ruled the 42 planets in this galaxy (Soul of a RobotSoul of a Robot[/thing]) all that is left is a force of erratic and unpredictable Droids and a race of primitive human-like creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have gained control of a sophisticated seeker - the MK II - are based on the planet Safrik. Unless you can locate the legendary 'Safe Planet' you will be at the mercy of the Droids, who have been programmed to obliterate any intruders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are left with no choice, to survive you must find the only planet in the entire galaxy offering you safety from the swarms of Droids. There are a number of space ships left behind from the past generation of intelligent inhabitants some of which you will be able to control automatically on entry, others will be inhibited by a force field, you must learn to de-activate this in order to take control of the ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will also find transporter planets which, once you are able to operate the transporter, will take you to a new location. However as in all galaxies some planets will have unsuitable environments - these must be avoided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally you must gather the Psyche units (of which there are over 90) and take them to the Safe Planet. Will you survive the sadistic Droids or will they blow you into Oblivion?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Stephen Curtis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
