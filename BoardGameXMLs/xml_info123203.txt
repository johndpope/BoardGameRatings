							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zero Zone</name>
									
			<description>ZeroZone is a graphical adventure game in which the player assumes the position of the main character Stan, who must unravel the truth about his father's death. You, Stan Gonzo, find yourself delivered a will from your father, whom you have never before met. You assume his role as leader of the largest cyber technology company, the Kanary, and try to unravel how he died, who he was, and what to do next. The game starts when Stan is already sitting in his office in the Kanary where a police officer asks if you have any information to further his investigation into your father's murder. Your own investigation starts by looking around the Kanary, and meeting the rest of your family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You move around the ZeroZone world in through a semi-3D interface, that lets you look 360 degrees around you, with panorama like scenery. You move around by clicking a section of the panorama image, where you find yourself in another semi-3D panorama scene, the game advances in the same style. Game obstacles are mainly solving puzzles, find clues and talking / interacting with other people. Some 1st person shooting action comes around every now and then, but this is more to further the plot than true fighting. The ZeroZone virtual world is quite large, with many places to visit. Also you can communicate with almost all people you find, often they reveal clues or give you hints on what to do next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;ZeroZone,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
