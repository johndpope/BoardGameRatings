							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Royal Combat: Warriors of History</name>
									
			<description>In this exciting battle strategy card game with 4 methods of play, dueling Kings and Queens gather the greatest warriors from history to battle against their rivals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine playing the popular &amp;quot;war&amp;quot; card game with actual warriors from history, or playing a &amp;quot;battlefield&amp;quot; strategy game in which you organize an army to capture your opponent's castle using the greatest warriors from different times and places from history, or playing the popular &amp;quot;memory&amp;quot; game with pairs of historical warriors. And imagine playing &amp;quot;capture the flag&amp;quot; outside and giving each player a role to play as a specific warrior from history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You get these 4 games in 1 from Royal Combat: Warriors of History, the card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Led by the Royal Gold Star players and assisted by the Special Silver Star players, each team / player strategizes against their opponent to defend their own castle while attempting to capture their opponent's castle.  In the active role play option and the tabletop battlefield option there is a castle area and a battlefield area on which your green star warriors from history can be placed along with the gold star, silver star and shadow players.  Shadow players are lowest in rank but operate subversively and secretly in the shadows and have special powers that enable them to capture certain members of the higher ranks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, the Royal Gold Star cards (King, Queen and Knight) can take out the Special Silver Cards (General, Admiral and Ace), which can take out the Green Star Warriors from History (Commando, Spartan, Samurai, Mongol, Ming, Viking, Highlander, Zulu, etc...), which can take out the black star Shadow cards (Sniper, Ninja and Spy).  Yet the black star Sniper can take out the Silver Star General and the black star ninja can take out the Gold star King, etc...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
