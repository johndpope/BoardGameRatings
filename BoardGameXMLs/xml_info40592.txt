			<description>The players must climb the stages of human development from Pliopithecus to Homo Pfifficus. The development is represented by a 12-field-scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn the players decide to take 1 to 9 chips in their hands. &lt;br/&gt;A playing card with a special condition decides which player may move or have to stay or go back after revealing their hands. This card was displayed at the beginn of the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one or more players reached the 12th field Homo Pfifficus. These players are the winners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was published in Spielbox issue 6/1992.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
