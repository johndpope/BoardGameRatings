							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pastora or the Shepherdess of the Pyrenees: A diverting game calculated to kill care and enliven the dreary hours of winter</name>
									
			<description>This Game, like many others of a similar nature, will shew the variety and innocent amusement that may be derived from a Pack of Cards; were the admirers of them as solicitous to acquire the useful lessons with which they are fraught, as they are to appropriate them to the destruction of each other's fortune, they would soon take precedence of every invention for the exercise of the mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pastora or the Shepherdess of the Pyrenees, is represented in the centre of the plate which accompanies the Rules. In the corners representations of playing cards - King of Hearts, Queen of Spades, Jack of Clubs, 10 of Diamonds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment required: pack of playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
