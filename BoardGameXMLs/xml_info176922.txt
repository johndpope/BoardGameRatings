			<description>RECON TEAM: VIETNAM is a solitaire game of Long Range Reconnaissance Operations in Vietnam. The player assumes the role of a commander of a US Marine Force Recon, Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol (LRRP), Special Operations Group (SOG), or Ranger Long Rang Patrol Platoon in Vietnam. As commander, you are responsible for securing your Area of Operations (AOR) by successfully conducting Reconnaissance, Intelligence, Ambush and Raid operations, deep behind enemy lines, in order to locate and destroy the enemy. Although there are many units available to you, they may often times be limited to you by political, logistical or geographical obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OBJECTIVE &lt;br/&gt;The objective of RECON TEAM is to successfully complete a number of missions to locate and destroy enemy forces in order to gain Victory Points (VP) for the US Forces. The player can choose to play a short game (4 Missions), an average game (6 Missions), a long game (8 Missions) or a full Tour (12 Missions). Once all Missions have been resolved (successfully or not) the Player totals his VP and compares this with the Victory Determination Table to determine the level of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
