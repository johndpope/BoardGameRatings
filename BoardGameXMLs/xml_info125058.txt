			<description>From the game description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take to the Skies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fly a patrol over the trenches and tangle with enemy planes in this set collection card game! Conserve your ammo as you jockey for position, attempting to line up the perfect shot. Choose from 24 different historic aircraft, each with different performance attributes which suffer as the plane takes damage. You may wind up an ace, or go down in flames!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dogfight is a World War I aerial combat flavored set collection card game in which players strive to collect then play sets of cards to line up a chance to damage their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features set collection, card drafting, and variable player powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the game, players manage their altitude and speed while trying to collect the cards necessary to attack each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Damage is recorded, not as hit points, but as degradation to the plane's unique performance attributes. Such damage could eventually cause the plane to be forced down, start on fire, go into an uncontrolled spin, or break up in midair. It is also possible to hit the opposing pilot with a machine gun bullet, killing him instantly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's dangerous up there, and Dogfight is not for the faint of heart!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
