			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forget-Me-Not (FMN) is a progressive roleplaying game experience that plays in about three hours, though longer games are an option. It can be played with or without a gamemaster, but requires at least three players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in the fictional town of Northern Falls, FMN allows players to take on the roles of various key figures in town &amp;mdash; the Sheriff, the Town Drunk, the Heiress, the Reporter, etc. &amp;mdash; but no one controls any of the characters. Each scene is played differently from the last. In each scene, players take on alternate roles and focus on varying aspects of the town, while exploring the confusing and weird behaviors of the people unaffected by Jessica Ashwick&amp;rsquo;s death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
