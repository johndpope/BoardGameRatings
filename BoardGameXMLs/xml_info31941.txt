							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chards</name>
									
			<description>A game that combines Chess and cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is how it is described at the game's website:&lt;br/&gt;Chards TM uses a deck of 52 cards (Chards) with the normal suits: Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, and Clubs. Each player selects a favorite suit, places their King on the board and begins to play. Chards are added to the board during play anywhere on the board so the playing field&amp;mdash;and challenge&amp;mdash;is always changing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Turn - Players do three things on their turn: Move a Chard, Turn (twist) a Chard, and Place a Chard from their stockpile. It's FUN! ... and Easy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chess characters include Kings, Queens, Bishops, Knights, Rooks and Pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card characters include Jacks and Jokers and Dukes (ever played with a deuce in cards?). Chards TM even has Archers and Wizards to give the game a special twist. And it&amp;rsquo;s the twists in the game that make it exciting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no stalemates in Chards TM. Surprises are common so winners often come from behind. Are you clever or lucky? It takes a bit of both to win at Chards TM. That&amp;rsquo;s what makes it FUN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s family fun or party entertainment, Chards TM is a game that players want to play again and again. The FUN is enjoyed by all ages, be they adults or teens or kids. Have a tournament. Form a club. Use Chards TM as a fund raising event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of all &amp;ndash; Chards TM is a great way to have FUN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
