			<description>Keg Bearer is a silly tactical board game for 1-4 players.  Ideal for families and/or kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FREE NOW!  To CELEBRATE the new iPhone support for MUSKET SMOKE!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 2-4 player battle royals.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 2 on 2 team play.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Co-op vs AI play.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 on 1 play.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Various maps and terrain features.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 3 different modes of play. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Select unit custom deployments.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Simple map editing and unit re-positioning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interesting thing about this game is that you can shoot or set defensive states when it's not your turn.  So everyone always has something to do with this 'huddle' style game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UI INTERACTIVE&lt;br/&gt;Drag and drop, tap units to change state, double tap kegs to heal, pull back to aim and shoot (if loaded and in shoot mode).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STRATEGY&lt;br/&gt;The strategy is not just about movement and positioning &amp;ndash; it also involves line of sight crossbow shooting, shot blocking, axe melee &amp;amp; mass beserking. Injured units don&amp;rsquo;t just bleed and lose hit points &amp;ndash; they do less damage and can&amp;rsquo;t move as far. &amp;nbsp;And the one unit you have to protect also happens to be a healer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOAL&lt;br/&gt;The great Keg Bearer (considered to be the king) has a healing 'Keg of ALE' that he sprays upon adjacent units.  If you kill this unit then you win as no dwarf wants to fight without his ALE!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: App store &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/keg-bearer/id425068574?uo=4&amp;mt=8&amp;at=10lazE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/keg-bearer/id425068574?uo=4&amp;...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
