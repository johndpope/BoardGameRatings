			<description>Battle over the Pacific is a complete, stand alone design that takes the Battle over Britain game system to warplanes flown by Japan and the United States in 1941-42.   It is a two-player (with solitaire option) strategy game simulating plane-vs-plane dogfights occurring in the first year in the war in the Pacific after America's entry into the conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Airplanes are individually rated for speed, agility, firepower, performance, and durability.  All planes are compatible with all other planes in the series, so you can fly Japanese planes against British adversaries if you have Battle over Britain, for instance.  Aircraft included are:  American: Grumman F4F Wildcat, Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk, Brewster F2A Buffalo, Douglas SBD-3 Dauntless, and Douglas TBD-1 Devastator.  Japanese:  Mitsubishi A6M2 Zero, Makajima Ki-43 Oscar, Mitsubishi A5M4 Claude, Nakajima Ki-27 Nate, Aichi D3A Val, Nakajima B5N1 Kate, and B5N2 Kate.  Counters (3/4th inch square) are in color, on thick card, and must be cut apart prior to play.  A new Critical Hit Vulnerability rule has been included, to take into account the fragile nature of some of the early Japanese fighters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
