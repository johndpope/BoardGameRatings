			<description>Abstract duel that is very much in line of classic games like Chess and Checkers because of its patterned movement, capturing and 5x8 squared board, but also shares similarity with newer ones like Onitama because of the way that different movement patterns can be applied to pawns. However, it has few of its own mechanics and twists that make it distinctively different. It is language independent and has fairly strong fantasy battle theme for pure abstract game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
