							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">El juego del mono de oro</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Super Juegos&amp;quot; was a pioneer Spanish magazine about both, board and computer games, which was published between 1984-1985. Every issue included a board game inside, with rules and cut-out counters. As far as I know only eight numbers were published, at least in its first epoch (another publication with the same name would appear years later, this time focusing on computer games only).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;El juego del mono de oro&amp;quot; was the game included in issue 6. It was based in the pseudo-Indiana Jones 80s TV series &amp;quot;Tales of the Gold Monkey&amp;quot;, set in the pre-II World War Japanese dominated Pacific Ocean&amp;acute;s isles . Up to 4 players could play, each one starting with and adventurer and a seaplane counters and searching for mythical treasures while eluding or confronting fighters and gunboats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
