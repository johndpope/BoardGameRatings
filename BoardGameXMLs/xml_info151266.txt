							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Journey: Wrath of Demons – Spider Demons Expansion</name>
									
			<description>The Spider Demon Expansion gives the Pilgrims a chance to retrieve the third piece of the sundered Sutras. But before Tripitaka can assemble more of the sacred scroll, his band will have to defeat the Spider Demons. The book describes them as &amp;ldquo;seductive spider spirits, half beautiful women, half spider&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Silk Cave, high in the Silk Mountains, Zige the Spider Demon Queen spins her webs of the toughest silk. Her minions weave traps of sticky cobwebs and wait for unsuspecting prey to become ensnared. Will they feast on our brave travellers?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again, we will introduce new game play elements with the Spider Demons. These Demons fight at longer range, spitting poison and throwing spider web nets. Pilgrims will be more likely to suffer on-going conditions, like Poisoned and a new condition Entangled. Webs act as traps that hold the Pilgrims and attract the Demons when the Pilgrims are entangled. Each Demon moves towards the closest entangled Pilgrim, and may get to attack while the Pilgrim is unable to defend: an entangled target cannot use the Defense Dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
