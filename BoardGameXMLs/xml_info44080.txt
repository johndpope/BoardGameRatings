			<description>&amp;quot;El Submarino&amp;quot; (Das Boot) is a solitaire card game that seeks to emulate the exploits of some of the more famous U-boat commanders like Prien, Kretschmer, Hartenstein, Topp, Schepke and others. It makes use of a simple and uncomplicated game system to do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The German U-boats sank 2,603 merchant ships (slightly more than 13.5 million tons) and claimed the sinking of 175 allied warships. But, their own losses were considerable. The Germans constructed 1,162 U-boats and out of them 784 was lost for different reasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of human lives, the price that both decrees paid was tremendous. More than 40,900 men were recruited by the U-boat weapon during the war, of which 28,000 lost their life and 5,000 were made prisoners. The allies suffered a similar meatgrinder -- more than 30,000 dead only in the English merchant navy and many thousands more from the merchant navies of other countries. More than 70,000 men and women of the Royal Navy died during the war, of which a great proportion were due to the struggle against the U-boats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has the following components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 215 cards&lt;br/&gt;-   4 game boards&lt;br/&gt;-  30 U-boat Sheets &lt;br/&gt;-   1 Campaign Sheet &lt;br/&gt;-   1 rules booklet&lt;br/&gt;-   3 six-sided dice (white, blue and red)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
