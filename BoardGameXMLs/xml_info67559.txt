			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strychnine IV describes a solar system where angels, demons and vikings have been at war for the most part of the last 5000 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each planet has a detailed description and a scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haven I used to be an agricultural colony before being destroyed by a spaceship crash. Now it's an uninhabitable mass grave said to be haunted (but still fought over by zealous Stella Vaticanum officers and demons).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virus II is a green planet, but its flora doesn't like the idea of offworlders and technology and is quite capable of defending itself. The planet is occupied by feral humans, and a few demons and angels sent to study the anti-technology properties of the planet who have become stranded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cryo III is an ice planet settled by vikings who have turned it into a fortress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strychnine IV, the poison planet, is a permanent warzone. It used to be an industrial world, but thousands of years of pollution and warfare have turned it into a desolate place. Neither Stella Vaticanum nor Dunkle Reik has succeeded in taking control of the planet, but each keep sending troops in the hope of finally breaking the stalemate. It has become a favorite testing ground for new weapons and tactics for each faction of the conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hellraiser is a marooned Dunkle Reik spaceship orbiting the sun.It was a prototype battleship (five times bigger than any other ship) that was half destroyed when a Stella Vaticanum battleship rammed it to prevent its escape. Both factions are still fighting inside the two ships, and the environment has given birth to strange mutated fungus in the former hydroponics labs, and undead creatures roam the ship freely, unhindered by the lack of air or radiation shielding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book also includes a some new equipment and creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
