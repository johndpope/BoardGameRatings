			<description>Tactical AI for skirmish miniature wargames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hostile Tactical AI is an Artificial Intelligence system to order enemy units around in skirmish miniature wargames, so you may play solo or co-op against the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules work through a deck of 72 cards that tell enemy units, where to go and what to do. There are two sets of instructions on every card. One set gives orders to patrolling units unaware of the player. The other set of orders is for aware units attacking the player's units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patrol instructions include: Sweeping the area for the player, Patrolling objectives, Checking suspicious behavior, etc...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack instructions include: Rushing the player, Defensive posturing, Flanking, etc...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card includes: Compass directions, Dice rolls, Player to attack, and Reactions. There are also playing card symbols on each card to be used for variable activations or objective orders in the case of multiple objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included with the deck and rulebook are sixteen shards matching the playing card symbols. These can be used for random setup of enemy units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules were specifically designed for miniature games with ranged weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each enemy activation, the player draws a card for that enemy unit. The card gives the enemy order or orders. Sometimes requiring multiple cards to be drawn to show what direction and how far the enemy moves, and also which player to attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hostile Tactical AI is quick to learn and gives you a good fight. The enemy might just surprise you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
