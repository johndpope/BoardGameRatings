			<description>The Quickstart Guide for the Battlestar Galactica Role-playing Game written by Jamie Chambers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forty years ago the Cylons withdrew into the cold blackness of space. When the robots returned to attack their makers, the war was over in less than a day.  Unlike the clunky &amp;quot;toasters&amp;quot; of old, these Cylons are sleek and deadly Centurions, graceful and terrible Raiders, and even some that look and feel completely human. Now the Cylons pursue a rag-tag fleet of ships carrying the human survivors across the galaxy. Standing between the humans and their deadly foe is only one military vessel - the war-scarred Battlestar Galactica.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Quickstart Guide contains a preview of the full Battlestar Galactica Role Playing Game, with easy-to-learn rules, pre-made characters, and a short scenario that will allow the players to participate in the fall of Caprica, viewing it from a completely new perspective. Enjoy the game as a one-time experience or use it to launch a new series of adventures!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
