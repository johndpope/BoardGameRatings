			<description>Can You Handle It? Life with Kids is a stress management game. The higher your stress, the higher your score. The winner is the parent with the lowest stress points at the end of the game. Event cards present stressful situations that you must either overcome or accept. You can also play Event cards against other parents. Don't go out there all alone - use cards from your hand to help you lower your stress points. Equip Items to use throughout the game to help block stress from Events. Or you can use De-Stressors to lower your overall stress score. Once the deck has been played through, the Parent with the lowest stress score wins. But really, does any Parent ever truly win?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
