							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Earth Unleashed (d20)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A woman who&amp;rsquo;s wearing hide armor and carries a long staff, stands in the center of the square. She has long brown hair, bright blue eyes, and the tan of someone who spends most of her time outside. She speaks with a loud voice: &amp;ldquo;Earth and rocks rained down on Wodfeld! The earth trembled! Mother Nature gave us a sign; a warning! She wants us to leave, leave the forest so she can heal it! Twice her warnings came. Who knows what happens the next time? Will Mother Nature warn us again or will Wodfeld be destroyed by her boundless power? Do not wait to find out! Leave while you still can!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth Unleashed is an adventure intended for a party of four 7th-level adventurers. Player Characters (PCs) that complete the adventure should reach 8th level at the end. The adventure can easily be adjusted to suit weaker or stronger parties.&lt;br/&gt;The adventure takes place in the village Wodfeld, situated in the woods. The name Wodfeld could easily be replaced by the name of an existing place in your campaign world, or by a name that fits your campaign world better. The woods in which it lies is not given a name, but it could be any large forest in your campaign world..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
