			<description>Co-operativ children's game. The parents have been captured by pirates, and the children must free them from the bottom of the pirate ship. However, if they encounter pirates on their way, they may be forced to walk the plank, in which case they may be eliminated. If they manage to free the parents you win, but if all but one of the children are eliminated, you lose. Any player can move any playing piece, so it is not really player elimination, just playing piece elimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
