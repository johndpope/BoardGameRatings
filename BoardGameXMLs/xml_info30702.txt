							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of Football</name>
									
			<description>The Game of Football produced by Parker Brothers in 1880 features a picture of young boys playing a game that looks a bit like sandlot football. The game comes with a number of colored pieces that represent players and by jumping over players each team tries to score goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a version of late-1800s football, this game would be completely different from the same-named Game of Football from 1948, as the rules of the physical game developed significantly in the intervening 70 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
