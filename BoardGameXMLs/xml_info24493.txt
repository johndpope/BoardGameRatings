			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an exciting card game of strategy, tactics and chance in deep space combat between the warring space-faring humanoid species who all feel that the galaxy is not big enough for all of them. Their starships combine the awesome firepower of powerful particle accelerator beam energy weapons and devastating hyper-speed torpedoes for close combats and long-range raids by smaller ship-borne strike craft and the deadly mercenary shadowcraft. The four different species can ally in various patterns, resulting in different combinations in different games, or they can operate alone. Players determine when and where to seek battles; to launch distant raids or close with the enemy for battles within star systems or nebulae. The side that scores the most victory points by vaporizing enemy ships and winning star systems wins the game. This is an entertaining and fun card game where every playing is different. Playing time is one to three hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
