			<description>You and your friends can help Little Red Riding Hood get to her Grandmother's house before the Wolf. Remember which pine tree he is hiding behind in the forest and choose the right pine tree to move forward. The Huntsman, foxes and imps will help you along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A kids' cooperative game roll-n-move without rolling the dice (you pick a card that represents an action) with a classic theme, featuring a memory element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player must take a card from the market, turn it and show to others. They must then perform the action indicated on the card. The following player will do the same and so on. Game ends as soon as tree reach the grandmother, once there all you need to do it flip them over and see who is hiding at the bottom:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Hunter and Little Red Riding Hood get ahead of the Wolf, then the whole team won and they beat the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, if the first one that came to the grandmother is the gray Wolf, then if the next one who makes it to the grandmother is the Hunter, and not the Little Red Riding Hood then the team can still win as the Hunter can beat the grey wolf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different Levels of difficulty&lt;br/&gt;Easy level: During preparation of the game Little Red Riding Hood is necessary to remove the card &amp;quot;Cheeky Fox&amp;quot; from the marked cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intermediate: Before the game, mix all the trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Difficult level: During preparation of the Little Red Riding Hood Whoo hop game is necessary to remove the card &amp;quot;Curious Gnome&amp;quot; from the marked cards. Before the game, mix all the trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards with the characters pictures:&lt;br/&gt;Little Red Riding Hood: You need to make one move forward with the tree, beneath which the Little Red Riding Hood hides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunter: you need to make one move forward with the tree, beneath which the Hunter hides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wolf: you need to make one move forward with the tree, beneath which the gray Wolf hides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action cards:&lt;br/&gt;All forward: you need to make one move forward with all the tree's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curious Gnome: you need to choose one tree and find out who is hiding under it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cheeky Fox: you need to swap any of two tree's around so that they stand in each others place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
