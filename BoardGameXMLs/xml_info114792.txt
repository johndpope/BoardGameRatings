			<description>Horse racing game. Looks lovely but it is just a roll and moove game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is unusual, consisting of cards which, if laid out in the correct order, form a track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given a supply of counters (not included in the game). 5 counters per player are placed into the Pool. This will be the prize if you reach the end first. When you move, if you land on a picture space, then you must obey the instructions. Some are the usual Miss a Turn variety but some make you add more counters to the Pool or, maybe, take some counters out of the Pool. The winner of the race i.e. reaches the last space on the board first, collects the Pool and the real winner is the player that has the most counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
