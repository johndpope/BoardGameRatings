							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jurassic Encounters</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Jurassic Encounters! This is designed and dedicated to give more life into your Jurassic themed adventures with Dinosaurs and other prehistoric beasts. In this material you'll find over twenty-five new monsters for custom Jurassic themed adventures and campaigns. The monsters have pictures and full stat blocks, and descriptions. You'll also find, for your convenience, some official Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition monsters that now have descriptions and pictures to better serve your creativity while writing an adventure or campaign. Creatures taken from the official Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition Monster Manual have the exact stat block as they do in the manual, and have been marked with the red Dungeons and Dragons Logo on the upper right-hand corner of their stat block. Please Note: Most of these creatures are historically accurate based on research while others have been modified to make for a more exciting encounter. Like all creatures in the world of Dungeons and Dragons these creatures can be modified anyway you like and were created for inspiration and ideas for your enjoyment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
