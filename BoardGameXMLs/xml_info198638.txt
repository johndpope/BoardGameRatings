							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Inner Strength &amp; Intense Training</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume 8 of Awesome Powers deals with powers that come from within; both in the sense of Inner Strength and Intense Training. It is ideal for building super martial artists, super spies, or just costumed adventurers who don't need super powers to shine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inner Strength a supernatural control over one's own body, mind, and spirit, enabling the user to leap amazing distances, punch through concrete, run across unstable surfaces, heal, and even harness the one's energy to release as fiery burst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intense Training the development ot skills so honed that they are powers unto themselves. Throw a smokebomb and disappear into the shadows, spring from building to building with parkour expertise, master the sword or gun fu with techniques that were out of reach... until now.  We've expanded well beyond the Intense Training powers included in the BASH! Ultimate Edition rulebook here, folks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of the powers in Volume 8 are completely unique, as they interact in new ways with Hero Points and Setbacks, or make use of newer game mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've also updated some powers from BASH! Ultimate Edition. Martial Arts Mastery is expanded to ten styles, with each rank granting a choice of two. Fleet of Foot and Weapon Technique also have a number of new options, among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll also find all new Limitations and Enhancements, Advantages, Disadvantages, and two new rule options: New Skill Specialties (Aerobatics, Demolitions, and Channeling) and Bonus Dice / Penalty Dice (which can really shift the odds).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
