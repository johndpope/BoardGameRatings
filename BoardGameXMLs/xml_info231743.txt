							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rolemaster Blog Monthly (Issue 3 - July 2017)</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So this is Issue 3 of the fanzine. Back in March Brian had the idea of trying to publish a quality blog posts every day. We didn&amp;rsquo;t quite make it, partially  because I disappeared to Iceland for a while leaving Brian flying solo. April  started the same way.I wasn&amp;rsquo;t back from Iceland until the 7th so could not  contribute as many posts as I would have liked. In May I decided that we  would hit that target and we did. We ended up publishing 32 posts in 31 days. That has given me a wealth of material for this months fanzine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ironically I am also on a push to write more unique &amp;lsquo;fanzine only&amp;rsquo; content in  this issue and all the issues going forward. So here I am with more posts to  choose from than ever before and on a mission not to use them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what made the cut? I have a project waiting in the wings.If you read issue  2 then you will know of my diceless Rolemaster idea. What I want to do is  create a version of Rolemaster for children, less blood and guts but the same  skills based role play.In this issue I have expanded on my first thoughts and  you will find ideas on &amp;lsquo;rolemaster kids&amp;rsquo; magic, skills and criticals .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another theme seems to be character creation and we have three takes on  character creation and first level from Intothatdarkness, Brian and myself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will also find a lot of Shadow World from Brian who is definitely our  resident SW Guru&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You also get a new spell list, Automation, from Brian&amp;rsquo;s BASiL project and  Alchemical Zombies, a zombie apocalypse adventure with a difference .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until next time&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
