			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;You have no friends here&lt;br/&gt;What can you do when the Mists deposit you in the city of Lekar? The militia is no better than a gang of sadistic bullies, the citizens are more contagious than a fleet of plague ships, and every foot of public space is covered with the corpses of criminals who committed no crime greater than struggling to survive in the oppressive domain of Falkovnia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Danger haunts your every move&lt;br/&gt;A secret society of assassins, known only as the Edon Fold, has been hunting down visitors to Lekar and killing them in a most grisly fashion; all that remains of the victims are desiccated husks that crumble to ash when touched... and you are their next targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no escape&lt;br/&gt;When everyone who has befriended you is either dead or hunted by the authorities, you have no choice but to fight back. But the Ebon Fold is a numberless horde whose leader holds sway over death. How can you defeat enemies that won't stay in the grave? They strike from the depths of darkness and steal your life... one dagger stroke at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 64-page adventure can be played independently, or as the opening challenge in the Grim Harvest series that continues with Death Ascendant and concludes with Requiem. Inside this package is a poster map that fully details all 10 levels of the chilling complex known as the Well of Bones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
