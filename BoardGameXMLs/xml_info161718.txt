			<description>A prototype issue of the Arkham Gazette, a free e-zine focused on the Lovecraft Country setting for the Call of Cthulhu RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue's topic was the Aylesbury Pike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From publisher blurb of revised edition:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue of the Arkham Gazette was developed as a 'proof' of concept' test to see if the idea for a magazine focused on the Lovecraft Country setting for The Call of Cthulhu RPG was feasible and if there was interest.  First released in August of 2013, this newly revamped version of the issue has been updated to our current format, the articles within have been revised, two pieces of artwork by Galen Pejeau added, and a new article has been included as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme for this issue is The Aylesbury Pike, the (fictional) road running between Arkham and Aylesbury, which forms a parallel backbone for Lovecraft Country along with the Miskatonic River.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New place: The Amos-Goodrich Cemetery&lt;br/&gt;     New England's Highways, an introduction&lt;br/&gt;     A History of the Aylesbury Pike&lt;br/&gt;     New person: Curtis Sloan, &amp;quot;Encyclopedia Salesman&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;     A Guide to New England's Petroglyphs and those found in Lovecraft Country&lt;br/&gt;     A short encounter - Mr. Picket Goes a Huntin'&lt;br/&gt;     **NEW** A scenario seed - The Phantom of the Aylesbury Pike&lt;br/&gt;     SCENARIO: &amp;quot;The Chapochaug Tunnel Haunting&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;     An annotated list of scenarios set on or near (or are otherwise connected to) the Aylesbury Pike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A conversion guide for using this material with the 7th Edition Call of Cthulhu rules is forthcoming, as is a separate PDF of this issue's handouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
