			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Monkey Dice is a fun, &amp;quot;press your luck&amp;quot; dice rolling game for the whole family to enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes their dice and tries to roll the most monkeys. AVOID THE POOP! If a player rolls 3 poops, their turn is over and they get NO points for the monkeys they have collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monkeys can be rewarded with bananas to clean up poop for you, increasing your chances of winning.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are twelve identical dice in Monkey Dice. There are three results on each die: Monkey (3 sides), poop (2), and banana (1).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, they will roll three of the dice. After rolling they keep monkeys and poop, then decide what to do with the bananas: they can re-roll them during the next set or keep them. If a player keeps a total of three bananas they can eliminate one poop they have collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player continues by rolling another three dice, or stopping their turn. When they stop, they count the total number of monkeys they have collected and add that to their score. If they rolled three poops, their turn is over and lose the points they currently collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player reaches 50 points, the current round is finished, and they player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
