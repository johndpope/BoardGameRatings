			<description>The game ego pictures consists mainly of photo cards, task cards, word cards and number chips. Six photo cards are placed on the table and an active player is selected. She draws a task card and follows the instructions on it. These can be:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Match two pictures: The player draws a number chip, marks the respective photo card, then everyone picks a number chip which corresponds to the photo that matches the selected photo card best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. A word on a word card is randomly selected. Players now mark which photo matches that word best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. A photo is randomly selected. Players now mark which word on a word card matches the photo best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Players choose which of the photo cards matches the active player best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Afterwards, points are scored: The active player gets a point for each other player making the same choice as s/he. The other players who guessed correctly also score one point each. If nobody guessed correctly, the players get a point for each other player making the same choice as them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are marked on a score track. The first player to reach 16 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Danish (Original) version plays slightly different:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are only 3 pictures shown at start of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 10 tokens, and 10 tokens are placed in the common area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players bet any number of tokens on their answer. Wrong and you loose your tokens to the common area. Right and you gain a number of tokens from the common area equal to your bet. The active player gains a number of tokens equal to the players who guessed correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when there are no more tokens in the common area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most tokens is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
