							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anima Tactics: Grey Rhodes</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grey Rhodes is a living shield. Protecting innocent lives is all that matters to him. A former agent of the Inquisition, legendary for his cold-blooded ruthlessness, he left that position to join the Knights of the Holy Order. Now, in penance for the lives he snuffed out, he has vowed to protect the innocent multitudes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warrior - Light Church - Level 40&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exaltation: If at least one friendly Unit within Grey's Control Zone is below half of their starting Life Points, he gets +1 Attack and +1 Defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guardian:Grey can Intercept a Charge or Ranged Attack from up to 4 inches away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Promise:Grey cannot destroy enemy Units. If any of his Attacks would reduce an enemy Unit to having less than 1 LP, it is left with 1 LP instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final Protection (Ki, Effect, Reactive) - Activate this ability at the end of the Maintenance phase. For the rest of the Turn Grey can Dodge for free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lightning Retribution (Ki, Attack, Reactive) - Attack +5. This Attack can only be used when an enemy Unit engaged with Grey makes an Attack against a friendly Unit other than Grey. This Attack is made after the enemy Unit rolls for its own attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My life for Thine (Subterfuge, Effect, Reactive) - When a friendly Unit within Grey's Control Zone is reduced to 0 or less Life Points, you may remove Grey from the game as a casualty to return the friendly unit to 1 life point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pewter figure is unpainted and unassembled. Requires additional Anima Tactics figures to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
