			<description>The playing board contains two tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The external track represents the weeks of the Church Calendar.  It also has five &amp;quot;bullseye&amp;quot; spaces... special targets (such as Christmas and Easter) that must be obtained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The internal track represents the 'Days of the Saints' and is used to complete the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll dice and move around the track, trying to get five markers on the different &amp;quot;bullseye&amp;quot; spaces.  Once they have completed this portion of the game, their markers are moved to the inner track to begin racing for the finish.  Movement may be clockwise or counterclockwise, however once you reach another player's token you may only move further by the same number of spaces as it took you to get there (allowing for some blocking strategy).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inner track is a simple race game.  It contains 42 squares to the finish box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to move all five of his tokens through the inner track past the finish space is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
