							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Things to Find in the Wild West</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 19th century list of 100 different things, as well as some possible variations, that could be found in America's Wild West, including other genres set in the same location and period, such as Weird West and steampunk. They could also be found in the modern day as relics of the period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the items may be useful or valuable, others are simply clutter. Some have been inspired more by cinematic portrayals of the Wild West than historical fact, and are usually noted. For certain items, the date when they became available is also listed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;66. Playing Cards (Not in a cardboard box, possibly in a wooden one, they may be marked using trimmed edges, rounded corners or depressed spots)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover, one page front matter and blank space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
