							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Factory Filler: The Filler Game</name>
									
			<description>In this filler game, filled with luck and logic, all players try to store their factory stock the most efficient. Especially the pipelines in different lengths make it a challenge to fit everything in your storage hall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a different storage hall, which is a grid with a pillar in the middle and lots of stuff already stocked. Each round a new thing must get stored on your floor. One die roll determines for all players if this is a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 spaces straight pipeline to store. Players use a pencil to draw it on their floor.&lt;br/&gt;As soon as you can't place the new piece, your game ends and the unfilled spaces are your minus points.&lt;br/&gt;But you have 4 &amp;quot;escapes&amp;quot;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Once you can bend a new piece and store that.&lt;br/&gt;     Once you can break a new piece and store the 2 parts.&lt;br/&gt;     Once you can crunch a new piece to store it as a compact piece.&lt;br/&gt;     Once you can refuse a new piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of storage hall sheets, pencils and 1 die. With enough pencils, the number of players is unlimited, making it a filler game for each filler situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
