							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">InuYasha TCG</name>
									
			<description>From the Inuyasha TCG website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has 4 card types: characters, items, locations and events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Characters (white) are personalities in the Inuyasha storyline.&lt;br/&gt;        Items (red) are the things that they use.&lt;br/&gt;        Locations (green) are the places they go.&lt;br/&gt;        Events (blue) are the plot twists that push the story and game along. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two Ways to Win:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     STEAL ALL 10 SHIKON JEWEL SHARDS! &amp;mdash; You win the instant you control all 10 Shards. Shards are facedown cards that you both set aside when the game begins. You steal shards by defeating characters, attacking your opponent directly, and by using game effects.&lt;br/&gt;     EMPTY YOUR OPPONENT&amp;rsquo;S DECK! &amp;mdash; You win the instant your opponent tries to draw or discard a card from his or her deck and cannot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GETTING STARTED: First you need a deck of exactly 60 cards. The rules for deck building are easy: Unless the card restricts itself, you can have as many copies of a card you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
