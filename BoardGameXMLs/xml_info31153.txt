			<description>Gimme A Ruling is a golf-themed sports trivia/question and answer game that focuses on the rules of golf.  The game contains 550 questions that present actual on-the-course situations and challenges the players to provide the correct ruling.

The winner of the game is the player with the lowest score after 18 holes/questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game includes: 550 question/answer cards, 3 20-sided dice: 1 Category, 1 Birdie, 1 Bogey, 2 official score pads, and 2 golf pencils&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
