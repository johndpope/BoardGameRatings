			<description>As in standard chess, White moves first in Wolf Chess and the winning objective is checkmate, but the game is played on a 10x8 game board that contains a number of special pieces. The king, queen, rook, bishops, and pawns move and capture the same as they do in chess. Special pieces and changes to normal chess rules are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The wolf moves and captures as a chess rook or a chess knight.&lt;br/&gt;    The fox moves and captures as a chess bishop or a chess knight.&lt;br/&gt;    The nightrider moves and captures as a chess knight extended to make any number of steps in the same direction and in a straight line.&lt;br/&gt;    The sergeant moves and captures one step straight or diagonally forward. A sergeant can move, like a chess pawn, a double-step straight forward on its first move.&lt;br/&gt;    A pawn (but not a sergeant) may capture an enemy pawn or sergeant en passant.&lt;br/&gt;    Pawns and sergeants promote on the last rank to queen, wolf, fox, rook, bishop, nightrider, or knight. Pawns (but not sergeants) have an additional option of promoting to an elephant; the elephant piece, not present in the starting setup, moves and captures as a chess queen or a nightrider.&lt;br/&gt;    Wolf Chess has no castling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
