							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Trek Judgment Rites</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;User sumary&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Trek Judgment Rites is a stand alone expansion of Star Trek 25th Anniversary edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A scroll adventure that divides into two parts, on board USS Enterprise where combat with other ships may occur, and on the landing party (that might be another ship, a planet or starbase) where the objective will be to solve and face any problems for the completion of your mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike 25th Aniversary here you will be able to have all crew members available to you. Although you only control Kirk, the landing parties are always composed of 4 members, and this time you will be able to have by your side Sulu, Chekov, Uhura and Scotty. Even if you dont have their voices. This time, at least the version I own, doesnt have the voices of the crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
