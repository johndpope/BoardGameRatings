Winning this game will require that you master all of these skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game round represents a year where you have the opportunity to make investments and maximize profits. The investments are kept from year to year, and when one players cash reserves reaches $99 million the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameboard consists of three fictive african countries where investements can be placed. Each country has a conflict scale from 1-6 (1-2=peace) (3-4=unrest) (5-6=war). There are nine types of investments and they pay out differently depending on the conflict status of the country. Some of the investments also affect the conflict status in the country where they are located.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game round is divided into six phases: 1. Each player can either buy or boost one investment. 2. An event card is drawn for each country and its conflict status might be affected. 3. Each player can move one investment from one country to another. 4. Return on investments are given to the players. 5. Mark investments in competitive situations 6. The &amp;quot;First Mover&amp;quot; token is passed on clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
