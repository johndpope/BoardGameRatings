			<description>This 1978 educational firefighting game has a playing board, a deck of 34 Fire cards, a deck of 32 Result cards, four Patrol Piece tokens, four badge cards (Chief, Captain, Engineer and Rookie), a D6 with a fire symbol over the 1, and an unpainted lead firetruck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has a white track running around the edge, and an inner pattern of six vertical and two horizontal streets, connected to the fire station in the middle. In between the streets are numbered houses, retail outlets and industrial locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts on a different corner of the board and rolls the die to move along the white track on the outside of the board. Each time he passes his starting station, he completes one patrol. The last player to complete his third patrol gets stuck with the Rookie badge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a player lands on a &amp;quot;fire&amp;quot; space, he draws the top card from the Fire deck, which illustrates the cause of the fire and gives a location. The player then has four rolls of the die to move the fire engine from the station to that location to put out the fire. If he succeeds, he draws a Results card and follows directions; if not, he moves his piece back one space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is said to have been designed by a firehouse in Scottsdale, Arizona, and the box shows it was distributed as an educational tool through other fire departments. (One copy has a label saying &amp;quot;Compliments of Roy L. Parrish, Fire Chief, Clark County Fire Dept., Nevada&amp;quot;.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
