							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death Ride Salerno: Herman Goring/15th Panzer Grenadier</name>
									
			<description>This game is the fourth and last installment in the Death Ride Salerno game set.  It is set in the Salerno city area and the passes heading north toward Naples.  The Herman Goring Division moved south to help 16th Panzer as did 15th Panzer Grenadier and held the British back from moving north.  While they tried to push the British back the British were too well supplied with heavy weapons and naval gunfire support.  The British were funneled into the passes between the hills leading north and a heavy attack could not be sufficiently concentrated to be successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are written using the Seven Battlefield Operating Systems as a framework.  They are Maneuver, Command and Control, Fire Support, Mobility and Survivability, Combat Service Support, Intelligence, and Air Defense.  They are not complex and make the game easier to understand than most large games.  Putting all 4 games together creates a monster of monster games.  All together having 4 Allied divisions at company level and 5 German divisions at platoon level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
