			<description>Greetings to ya. Let me take your coat and hat, pilgrim &amp;ndash; then pull up a pew while I have fetch ya some sarsaparilla to chase away the bitin' cold, but mind, I don't take me any sass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shucks, I don't get me many visitors this far up the creek, especially when accounting for the &amp;quot;injuns&amp;quot;. Could be that hereabouts I'm as popular as a wet dog at a parlour social. I've been up here in the mountains so long that I know all the bears by their first names.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, you folks wanna hear me talk about this newfangled card game expansion? Must be crackers &amp;ndash; I doubt you could cut a lame cow from a shade tree. You'll not live long in these wicked parts. Saying that, prolonged life has ruined more men than it ever made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Spits, just missing your boots]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, unless you is planning on joining me for a rendition of &amp;quot;Green Grow the Rashes&amp;quot;, I suggest we get started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revolver: Vengeance on the Frontier &amp;ndash; the third in a series of expansions for Revolver &amp;ndash; gives both players the option of buying cards from a separate, neutral Frontier deck with dollar coin tokens earned during the main game. Many of these cards feature a choice of useful options. Others are threats which can be played by either player, such as &amp;quot;Old Three Toes&amp;quot;, a monstrous grizzly bear that is particularly difficult to kill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion further elaborates on the new winning condition added for McReady in Revolver: Hunt the Man Down, and many of the cards are also useful to both players at the San Manzanillo prison location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revolver: Vengeance on the Frontier also includes new cards for both players that give them the opportunity to customize their decks, bringing new variety and replayability to each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
