			<description>(from the publisher:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a war that blazed across most of the world, there was only one place in North America that was invaded and occupied by the Axis. The hard fighting that took place in the freezing fog and the logistical nightmare of getting there in the first place doesn't get the place in the history of the Second World War that it deserves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a strategic simulation of the fighting in the Aleutians between Japan and the United States from June 1942 to August 1943.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most game turns represent one month of real time. Winter turns represent two months. &lt;br/&gt; Contents: two 11 x 17-inch game maps, 247 counters that have to be mounted and cut-out, charts and tables, English rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
