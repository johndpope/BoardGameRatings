			<description>A football game for two players played on a checkerboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has three pieces to represent his team. There is a ball. A goal is scored when a team successfully lands a piece carrying the ball in its opponent's end zone. The game ends when one team has successfully scored five goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, pieces of the team with the ball -- the offensive team -- can either move or pass the ball. The defensive team's pieces can only move in an attempt to take possession of the ball. If the defensive team takes the ball, it becomes the offensive team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moves and passes are declared in secret and then simultaneously revealed. Pieces move simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Official Rules: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://boardgames.about.com/library/games/on/bl-simul-tortellinifootball.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://boardgames.about.com/library/games/on/bl-simul-tortel...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
