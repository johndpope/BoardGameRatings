			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life is sometimes unfair. Now, at the moment you are attaining your nomination into the elite paladins of the Holy Order of St. Carminius, your stepfather requests your help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life can be unfair, but as a paladin, you have a single duty: help the poor and suffering people; and if those people are close to be family... well, you can&amp;rsquo;t refuse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nomination can wait.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ancient tales, stories used to scare the children, are now coming true.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A minotaur, which no one has seen clearly before, has gone mad and has begun kidnapping young boys and girl from the simple farm community near his lair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The thing is that this monster has lived in his maze for 80 years and never hurt anyone before. What is behind these events, and what is driving the minotaur?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a paladin, and you must find the truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Minotaur is a 3.0 double adventure, as a one-on-one adventure which features a bold adventure for a 6th level paladin, this adventure is a dungeon crawl, which will not spare few role playing opportunities and little mysteries to solve. This adventure may also be played with a standard four 3rd level characters group and can be placed with ease in any campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
