			<description>As the manager of your vineyard, you will try to carry out all the operations making up a year in viticulture, from winter pruning until grape harvesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each task you perform will be represented either by expenses in personnel for manual tasks (pink tokens), or in equipment for mechanical tasks (grey tokens). Each operation will enable you to earn either grape cards or maturity cards, and you&amp;rsquo;ll have to collect these cards in pairs in order to harvest ripe grapes. &lt;br/&gt;The more pairs you gather, the more points you&amp;rsquo;ll score!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be careful! The weather, vine diseases, accidents and even hiring strategies between players may complicate your harvesting plans. &lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s all a matter of risk management... your passion will transform you into a winegrower!&lt;br/&gt;...and the accompanying booklet (Lexicon and winegrowing notes) will instruct you to become &amp;ndash; who knows ? A real winegrower!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the players choose and separate into the two styles of cultivating their vines, they will enjoy playing the &amp;ldquo;Traditional&amp;rdquo; style against the &amp;ldquo;Conventional&amp;rdquo; way &amp;ndash; and throughout the game, they will learn the details of the job of winegrowing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not a matter of performing each operation in just one trip around the board : this is not a game of &amp;lsquo;snakes and ladders&amp;rsquo; ! The secret is to make as many trips as required in order to utilize all of your talents and resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A management game requiring luck and strategy, THE GRAPE GAME enables anyone with or without prior knowledge of winemaking to discover the true nature of this profession and to enjoy the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
