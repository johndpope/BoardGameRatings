			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Inheritance is set in an age where legend and prophecy collide with an unstable world. A world of political wrangling, of shared power between the wealthy, strong and influential, all pursuing their own agendas. And to this backdrop the shields of immense armies collide at the whim of their leaders, as heroes with unique and exotic Powers clash with cunning monstrosities upon the battlefields, with force of spear and strength of will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players, alongside the Gamesmaster, shape these heroes and live out their legends, their Inheritance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Inheritance is based on the Powergame 6.05 system by Mikko Kauppinen (2002).  It is intended to be as simple a system as possible, bypassing complicated roles in favor of basing almost all actions on the same scale and measuring success and failure with modified (d6) dice roles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
