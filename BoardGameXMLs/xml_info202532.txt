			<description>From the magazine:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supernim is a tactical game of skill which goes one better than the old traditional game of Nim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ideal candidate for computerisation, Nim has roots stretching back far into the Middle Ages. From a line up of pieces two players take it in turns to remove 1-3 from the board. However if more than one is taken then they must be removed adjacently, either horizontally or vertically. The player with the last piece on the board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nim has already proved a popular computer game with the machine a worth opponent, taking pieces from a screen display. Howver it is normally played in one dimension. In Supernim another dimension is added to make the game a great deal more thought-provoking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
