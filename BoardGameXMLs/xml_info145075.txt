			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fan-created mission for Orpheus.&lt;br/&gt; From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MISSION TYPE: Intelligence Gathering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LOCATION: Roanoke, VIRGINIA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting at about 20:45 Eastern time yesterday, the municipal police in the town of Lynchburg, Virginia were confronted with a torrent of reports from terrified motorists reporting that the nearby town of Roanoke had 'vanished from the face of the earth.' Travellers on Highway 220 have reported thick low-lying fog banks cloaking the surrounding countryside. This fog seems to be at its thickest in the area surrounding the Roanoke townsite. Passers-by on the highway also reported sighting several vehicles stopped at various points along the road with their lights on, doors open and engines running, but with no sign of driver or passengers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Local authorities report that there has been no indication of any communication with anyone or anything inside Roanoke since before 19:00 yesterday, although there was no indication of abnormalities before then. The Virginia National Guard has deployed to the area, although they have received orders from the top to form a cordon area around Roanoke and detour Highway 220, but not to enter the townsite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
