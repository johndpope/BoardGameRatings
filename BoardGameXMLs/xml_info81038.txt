			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Embark on a quest to build your all-time fantasy hockey team by competing against opponents while managing a salary cap to become the best General Manager in hockey history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build your fantasy team with the roster of trading cards provided or use your own trading cards from any era to enhance your roster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play:&lt;br/&gt;Players pick up challenge cards in the categories they are trying to advance in, example &amp;quot;Assists&amp;quot;, a sample of one question would be &amp;quot;how many career assists does your opponent's Center have? Your opponent will then tell you who their Center (trading card) is and the last year of statistics on his/her card. For Example, &amp;quot;My Center is Mark Messier and the last year of stats is 1998/1999. You must then make your best guess as to how many assists you think Mark Messier had by the end of the 1998/1999 season. The closer you are to the correct answer, the further up the fantasy charts you go in the assists category. So....the more you know about Mark Messier and how many assists he averaged per season, the better guess you can make as your answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't ever have to be exact, but the closer you are, the faster you move up the fantasy category charts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
