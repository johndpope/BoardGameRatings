			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What follows is an assortment of fantasy maps and illustrations that can easily be dropped into any medieval campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ranging from full color villages to black and white town illustrations, each is hand drawn and original. If you would like your world to have an old-school gaming feel then this supplement should fit right in. Several maps have a description included that could serve as inspiration for a setting or be used for an impromptu night of gameplay. Each map can be used separately, as a series, or as a part of a complete setting. They are yours to populate and fill out as you see fit. Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
