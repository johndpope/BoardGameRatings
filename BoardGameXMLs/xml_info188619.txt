							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Powerplay: The Game of the Gods</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An original quiz game, for one to four players, that transforms you and your opponents into the mighty Greek gods Apollo, Hermes, Hecate and Aphrodites. Each god controls four warriors fighting to the death within the Temple of Apollo. To guide your warriors through the battle, you must demonstrate your wisdom by answering questions posed during the game. To eliminate your opponents' warriors, you must force them into a challenge - where their strength and agility will be tested to the limit in battlegrounds from the heights of Mount Olympus to the very depths of Hades. To win the game you must prove your leadership, as even the best warriors can have a will of their own. Powerplay comes with over 2000 questions and is illustrated in colourful 3D graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powerplay is set on an 8x8 grid. Each player controls the family of a god. Each family has four grades from weak to strong. The player starts with four pieces at the lowest grade. When moving a piece, the player needs to answer a trivia question. If successful, wisdom points are added to their score. Wisdom points allow pieces to be upgraded to a higher grade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When two pieces meet on the board, a challenge occurs with both players being asked the same set of questions simultaneously. The first person to answer correctly gets a point and the aim is to pull out a three point lead over the opponent to win the challenge. The loser of a challenge loses a grade. If the piece is already at the lowest grade, it is eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to eliminate all the pieces of the opposing players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
