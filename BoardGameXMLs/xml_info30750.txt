			<description>Based on a German television series of the same name around the time. Players were travelers parachuting into various adventurous locales such as making an accuracy jump, saving another skydiver by bringing him a parachute in freefall, firefighting as smoke jumpers, a demo jump before air force officers, incidentially saving one of them from drowning and finally saving some lost children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
