							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ember: Light and Dark â€“ Prismatic Pack</name>
									
			<description>LIGHT AND DARK is a pair of expansions that supercharge your game with twenty new cards across two exciting packs - each packed with game-changing mechanics. There's a lot to deal with in Light and Dark!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Prismatic Pack boosts your creatures' abilities and adds a whole new collection of magical monsters to Conjure. Prismatic cards are creatures of divine light; each card has two magical abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Prismatic Pack contains the cards of light, the healers and protectors of the Emberverse. The cards are all designed to protect play, to mitigate card effects and card loss. All the standard cards have two powers - a first in the Ember universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three of the Prismatic cards provide 0 VP (Victory Points) on their own, but their VP are instead dependent on the cards you have in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then you have Iridia, the Elemental Prismatic Dragon, whose powers focus on protection, of increasing your powers, and defending your forces against the powers of the Spectral. Each Elemental Dragon has an legendary power which can be used if you control all three parts of that dragon, in this case, Irridia's ability allows you to give a creature you control +1 VP whenever any other player modifies a creature with a +1 VP or -1VP token. Powerful!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains:&lt;br/&gt;6 Creature cards&lt;br/&gt;1 Artifact card&lt;br/&gt;1 Three-part Dragon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
