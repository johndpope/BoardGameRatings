							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Squared Circle Wrestling RPG</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book you are holding is a tabletop roleplaying game about the wrestling industry. In creating this book I have attempted to take the hobby of e-wrestling from the Internet into a format that could be played at the table with some friends or even alone.&lt;br/&gt;During game-play you will create your own wrestler, rolling up stats and choosing between 5 classes for your wrestler. You will also choose skills that will make your wrestler truly unique and a force to be reckoned with in the ring. You will then take your wrestler through the ranks of the wrestling industry in the hopes of reaching the top of the business. Capturing titles and getting involved in feuds, storylines and angles as you go.&lt;br/&gt;This game is best enjoyed with your friends; it has two modes of play, one where each player controls a wrestler and the second is a promotion management type game where each player runs their own promotions as well as their own wrestlers. For those who enjoy promotion management type games will also be able to play this game alone, it isn't quite as entertaining as playing with others but it can be if you like management style games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
