							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Champions of the Spheres</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spheres of Power changed the way casters worked. Spheres of Might did the same for martial combatants. In Champions of the Spheres, both of the &amp;lsquo;Spheres&amp;rsquo; systems are married together into a unified whole to provide players with a plethora of options to craft a multitude of characters to fit whatever concept they want to roll!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within Champions of the Spheres you&amp;rsquo;ll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     3 New Classes: The Prodigy, who can do just about anything he puts his mind to, the Sage, who mixes ki powers and magic prowess to great accomplishment, and the Troubadour, who can change his face, and his powers, to whatever the situation requires.&lt;br/&gt;     Player Options: New archetypes, new feats, and other class options to better mix the Spheres of Might and Spheres of Power systems.&lt;br/&gt;     Unified Traditions: Unified Traditions mix casting traditions and martial traditions into a single whole, reducing character creation time and better generating a complete character concept for players both new and old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
