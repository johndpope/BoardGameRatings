			<description>A world so big, a cat so small&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Arielle and her cat, Bast, are spending a pleasant afternoon in the forest.&lt;br/&gt;Bast, free from the usual four walls of their home, can't stay in one place. He runs around, playing with everything that moves. In his haste to enjoy everything, he ends up getting away from Arielle.&lt;br/&gt;He hears her calling for him, but the forest is such an interesting place. There are so many things, so much space. Some little creatures challenge him. Bast pursues them. It feels great to run in the forest.&lt;br/&gt;He is about to catch one of them. He jumps to grab it but misses. He falls on top of some old stones. Something breaks under him. A cold breeze ruffles the trees chilling him to the bones. A smoke rises forming a shadow. Someone, something, hovers above him. Some ancient foul-smelling thing that nails him to the ground. Bast is unable to move.&lt;br/&gt;Nearby, Arielle calls for him. The thing, the Spirit, turns around. As Arielle comes closer, the Spirit flies in her direction and envelops her. Bast hears the muffled screams of Arielle. They grow fainter as the spirit disappears in the forest.&lt;br/&gt;Bast is alone. The sounds of the night emphasize that feeling. Arielle is gone and it&amp;rsquo;s his own fault. He realizes that the once pleasant forest has become a strange and dark place.&lt;br/&gt;He starts running hoping to help her. He fears it might be too late.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And so it starts&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Walk in the Dark is an indie game being developed for PC.&lt;br/&gt;In this action platformer you play as a cat, Bast, running through a dark fantasy world.
