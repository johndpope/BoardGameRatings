			<description>This expansion will include quite a few additions to the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dropped/Deployed Weapons. Sometimes there's no better way to get away than to put something in your opponent's path, like oil, smoke, caltrops, mines, cinder blocks ... you get the idea - this expansion includes passive and deployed weapons with expanded rules to incorporate them. But that's not all ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Auxiliary Weapons. Sometimes there's no better way to finish off your enemy than with something explosive, like rockets - This expansion brings with it new goodies that can take the place of your secondary weapon slots. So say goodbye to Mr. peashooter and say hello to Mr. flamethrower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contact Weapons. Who said auto-combat wasn't up close and personal? For those who prefer ramming to shooting, this deck will include a wide range of options of Rams, blades, snares ... if it's vaguely pointy, it's in here&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
