							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SciFi Diner</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SciFi Diner is a full-color, 48 x 20 inch, floor plan of a SciFi Diner, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sci-fi Diner module includes two maps of a science fiction diner. The first map is the main diner and the kitchen. The second map is the bathroom, which can be placed to the north or south of the bar as a unisex bathroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sci-fi diner is appropriate for near or far future science fiction games. The airlock doorway means that it can be used as part of a starship, star port, or space station, or as a set location on a planet, moon, or asteroid. It has open view windows at the booths that can see the outside of the diner, so it can be disconcerting for someone who gets space sick to eat at the booths. Some of those customers might prefer the swivel chairs next to the bar, since there are no windows there, making them the best seats in the house as it were for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventures at the sci-fi diner might start with some strange food poisoning at the diner. The Player Characters are brought in as detectives or as security on a ship or station to figure out the cause of the food poisoning. They might find that the refrigeration system has been damaged which has caused most of the food to spoil by this point. They find what look to be teeth and claw marks in the wiring in the back of the refrigerator and more claw prints lead into the air ducts of the ship. Then the Player Characters need to crawl into the ducts and exterminate these creatures before they cause more damage to the diner or even worse spread throughout a star ship, star port, or space station, causing massive panic. For a fight in the diner, have them crash through the ducts during the investigation into the main dining area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
