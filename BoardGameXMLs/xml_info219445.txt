							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ciphoid 9</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ciphoid 9 has been designed to exploit the graphic capabilities of the Commodore 64 to the full. All scenes are in hi-resolution multi-colour graphics and particular attention has been paid to perspective and visual effects to make ciphoid 9 the most realistic 3-dimensional space game yet.&lt;br/&gt;You will see the hi-res screens scrolling to show different sectors of the lunar base. The alien fighters execute complicated flight paths as they try to evade your phaser bolts. You will see the ships phasers and nuclear shells get larger, as they hurtle towards you, just as they would in real life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the instructions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2045 and earth radar stations have detected numerous fleets of alien ships, bound for earth.&lt;br/&gt;The ships have refused to identify themselves and have destroyed a cargo vessel en route to Uranus. Their intentions are presumed hostile.&lt;br/&gt;One last defensive position stands between the aliens and Earth. This base is situated on the moon, just to the south of the Sea of Tranquility.&lt;br/&gt;The lunar base is under partial computer control but the actual task of destroying the alien ships is your responsibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Ciphoid 9, you play the role of a gunner in a phaser turret on the moon, tasked with shooting down alien ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The computer controls the facing of the turret and the player controls the cross-hairs of the guns. 10 shots can be fired in rapid succession, before the guns overheat. At this point only single shots can be fired until they cool down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Occasionally motherships appear which require 10 direct hits on their central section. Destroying these recharges your shields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
