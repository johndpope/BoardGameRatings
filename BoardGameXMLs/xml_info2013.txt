			<description>Till Eulenspiegel is a memory game for 2-5 players Ages 5 and up. The theme of the game is based on one of the legendary pranks of Till Eulenspiegel, a jester well-known in German oral tradition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board shows a rope with 15 spaces for placing wooden tokens showing 5 different types of shoes. &lt;br/&gt;The same shoe types are also depicted on the 16 cards that come with the game. Players try to cross the rope by finding the show cards corresponding to the shoe tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set the game up, the 15 shoe tokens are shuffled and placed face down on the 15 spaces on the game board. Each player receives a number of cards which they place face down in a row in front of them. Each turn, all players turn their leftmost card face up and then pass them on to their left neighbor who places them face down at the right end of their row. The active player then tries to find the shoe card that shows the same shoe as the current shoe token. The further the player is from the start of the rope, the more cards he/she has to find. The first player to reach the end of the rope is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
