			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Time Card Wars is the most epic card game ever found in the Land of Ooo, or anywhere for that matter! In the Adventure Time episode &amp;quot;Card Wars&amp;quot;, Jake begs Finn to play his favorite trading card game. Finn accepts, despite warnings from Beemo on how very competitive Jake can be while playing the game. Finn and Jake battle against each other to decide who will be the Dweeb and who will be the Cool Guy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now fans can play the actual Card Wars game in Adventure Time Card Wars: Lemongrab vs. Gunter, with all of the action taking place in four combat lanes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player has two Action Points to spend on Creatures, Spells, and Locations, and cards cost between 0 and 2 Action Points to play. When you summon a Creature, you choose which lane you want to place it in; some Creatures have FLOOP abilities that allow you to use their special abilities. When you attack with a Creature down a lane, you might find an opposing Creature, or you might get to deal your damage straight to your opponent's Hit Points. Reduce your opponent's Hit Points from 25 to 0 and you're the Cool Guy (and you win the game)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Adventure Time Card Wars: Lemongrab vs. Gunter, The Earl of Lemongrab and his sour disposition take on the cool as a cucumber penguin, Gunter! Lemongrab's deck contains cards that utilize SandyLands and Cornfield Landscapes. His new strategies include giving his opponent bad Creatures that take up space and mess up his opponent's combat phase. Keeping your opponents Creatures alive might just be your key to victory! You will also find new &amp;quot;bounce&amp;quot; Creatures that can enter and leave play at a moment's notice. And this deck can mess with your opponent's Landscapes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gunter&amp;rsquo;s deck utilizes IcyLands and Blue Plains Landscapes. As a penguin, Gunter likes to hang out on the ice. Now he can! His deck has brand new ways of putting Frozen tokens on Landscapes...and this time, he might want to freeze his own! When his Creatures occupy Frozen Landscapes, they will be much more powerful. Of course, if he wants to get rid of the tokens he will need a lot of cards in hand. Blue Plains is still the king of card draw. Blue Plains is also the best at moving Creatures between Landscapes. You will find that ability very useful with Frozen tokens hanging around! You will also find some very powerful Blue Plains Creatures that must move each turn, or suffer the consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Card Wars starter set has a pair of different forty-card decks and is ready to play right out of the box. Mix the decks together to come up with your own righteous combos!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
