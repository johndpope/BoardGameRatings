			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CentralComputer XB024 has ordered you, a Cybor model JMT61, to destroy the thermonuclear reactor RAZ as it's used by the RebelComputer. You must evade or destroy other robots, as they have been reprogrammed to defend the reactor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a classic 8 bit arcade adventure. The player must find the reactor and destroy it, while using the few detonators scattered around the complex to destroy opposing robots. The player must also monitor the Cybor's Energy, Oil and Rust-proofing levels (they can be replenished by picking up the appropriate bonuses).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
