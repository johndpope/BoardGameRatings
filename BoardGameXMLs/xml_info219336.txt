							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ninja All-Stars: Jorogumo</name>
									
			<description>Jorogumo is a mercenary ronin for Ninja All-Stars. Ronin bring potent new abilities to a player&amp;rsquo;s team that are entirely unique to them. As mercenaries, ronin may be used by any player, on any team. This makes ronin invaluable assets for every team, regardless of clan, since they may be used to supplement a team&amp;rsquo;s weaknesses in battle or further augment their strengths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A horror, a cautionary tale, and a powerful opponent, the spider women called Jorogumo are useful, if questionable, allies. They descend from a witch of Kagejima that rescued the unwary or unfortunate from drowning in lakes and rivers. Claiming to rehabilitate them, she actually slowly poisoned and paralyzed them for use in dark and terrible spells. As her magics grew too much, Kagejima itself cursed her with a shape that evoked her horrid nature. This terrible judgment carried to her offspring who came to bear her form and her name. None trust the Joromugo, but a few unscrupulous warriors will employ them for their speed, strength, and enticing song.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highlights:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduces Unique Abilities&lt;br/&gt;    Fully Assembled Model&lt;br/&gt;    Speedy, Spidery Mercenary Ronin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
