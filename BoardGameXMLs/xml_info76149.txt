							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Field of Battle: World War II</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field of Battle: WW2 covers the World War 2 era from 1939 through 1945. Field of Battle: WW2 is a stand alone game - no additional supplements are necessary for play. Field of Battle: WW2 includes ratings and organizational charts for the British, French, German, Polish, Italian, Japanese, Soviet, and United States armies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field of Battle: WW2 is designed to give players the feel for commanding battalions, regiments, divisions, and more in a miniature WW2 environment. Games with a division per side can easily be resolved in 2 to 4 hours. Field of Battle: WW2 is designed using game processes used in the popular Field of Battle rules that gives all players an equal opportunity to act during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field of Battle: WW2 is not a game of skirmishes or low level actions, but rather one of battles of up to Division size or larger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field of Battle: WW2 uses companies as the combat element, and battalions as the maneuver element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only troops represented as units on the tabletop are maneuver and combat elements - infantry companies, armor companies, and anti-tank gun/artillery companies. There are no Heavy Weapon companies &amp;ndash; no separate machine gun or mortar units. The effects of supporting machine gun and mortar companies are abstracted in the game mechanics and card system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
