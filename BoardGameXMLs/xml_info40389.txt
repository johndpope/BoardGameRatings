			<description>Penny Push Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A very simple but enjoyable game that combines&lt;br/&gt;basic physical agility and strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use 6 pennies or dimes on a smooth tabletop (great for playing at a cafe).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player on opposite sides of the table places&lt;br/&gt;3 coins on the table in a triangle, approx. 3 inches&lt;br/&gt;apart (one player can be heads and the other&lt;br/&gt;tails).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes turns flicking a coin with his&lt;br/&gt;finger so that it passes in between his other two&lt;br/&gt;coins, thus moving his triangle step by step&lt;br/&gt;across the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No coin can be moved twice in a row, so with each&lt;br/&gt;move the coin must pass far enough between the&lt;br/&gt;other two coins to leave enough room for the next&lt;br/&gt;move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can end in four ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player moves a coin, that player loses if:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The coin fails to pass completely between the other two coins&lt;br/&gt;     The coin falls off the edge of the table, or&lt;br/&gt;     The coin touches any other coin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That player wins if none of the above occur, and&lt;br/&gt;the coin passes completely through two sides of&lt;br/&gt;the opposing player's triangle of coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strategy of the game is to move your coins&lt;br/&gt;cautiously into range of the other player's&lt;br/&gt;coins, putting them in position to take a shot&lt;br/&gt;through your opponent's triangle without leaving&lt;br/&gt;your coins too far apart and vulnerable to&lt;br/&gt;attack. You look for an opening without leaving&lt;br/&gt;yourself open. The edge of the table can be used&lt;br/&gt;as a defensive position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played in matches, playing up to&lt;br/&gt;a predetermined number of wins, or best of a set&lt;br/&gt;number of games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
