			<description>The official board game of Bake off TV Show.&lt;br/&gt;In turn the players play the role of judge, while the other players are competitors and perform 2 tests:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Technical test: each competitor receives a card depicting a sweet and must put on his plate the ingredients that he thinks are appropriate to realize, quickly taking them from those places in the center of the table. The first to complete their own sweet takes the whisk on the table. Depending on the correctness of the collected ingredients, players gain prize chips and cards for the next test.&lt;br/&gt;     Creative test: each competitor creates a sweet using the ingredient cards in your possession. The best recipes according to the current judge gain prize chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players insert their chips within their paper cups.&lt;br/&gt;When everyone has played the role of judge the game ends: who has the most chips is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
