			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today I did something I never dreamed I would do. I met the Emperor himself. Although the rumors are true that his health is deteriorating, I could clearly see from the way he presented himself that he was a descendant of the great Tiber Septim (may he live forever among the gods).&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;The Elder Scrolls is an epic video game series set in the vast world of Tamriel. Players have dealt with the unstable politics of Daggerfall and its neighboring provinces, battled blight-stricken monstrosities on the slopes of the Red Mountain of Morrowind, charged forth into the utter chaos of Oblivion, and saved Skyrim and the rest of the Tamriel from the annihilation of Alduin the World-Eater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the world is vast and as incredible as Bethesda&amp;rsquo;s games are, they are no match for the creations of your imagination. Tabletop roleplaying games allow you to harness that imagination to continue to create epic stories set in Tamriel. You can further explore locations already described in the games or even create scenarios set in places and times that we have yet to see. More dangers lurk in Tamriel and more stories are to be told. The limit is the extent of your imagination...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
