							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of the Crater</name>
									
			<description>Part of the series of tongue in cheek games &amp;quot;Kombat Klassics&amp;quot; published in the magazine La Vivandiere back in the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game on the siege of Petersburg is from vol 1 #3 of the magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THIS IS A JOKE GAME not really intended for play, though you could... the humor mainly is in the rules writing and social commentary therein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The union player has three Negro units and one regular infantry unit, the regulars can only enter the crater on turn one, afterwards, only the Negro units may enter the crater and I suspect Burnside since the only way he can get killed is to move into it as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The confederate players one and sole action is to choose whether or not to remove the dead unit from the crater. The confederates can not move or take any other action in game terms. I suspect he might find some fun in waiting for the union player to figure out how to get Burnside killed and win a decisive victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It looks like the object is to enter the crater and stay there after the big explosion rocked the confederate line. Now the funny part. It's impossible to do with all combat results being elimination or back two!  However, the Union wins a decisive victory if Burnside is killed.....Hmmm....I wonder what the astute union player will do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
