							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Romance of the Perilous Land</name>
									
			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ROMANCE OF THE PERILOUS LAND is a game very much inspired by the oldest fantasy roleplaying game created in the 1970s,  but it is also its own creation. Rather than mixing lots of fantasy tropes and world folklore like the original game, Romance of the Perilous Land is firmly set it the world of British folklore, from the stories of King Arthur to the wonderful regional tales found throughout this green and pleasant land. As the name suggests, this is a world of romantic chivalry, but also of great danger posed by thieving brigands, evil knights and greedy giants. Creatures are quite rare and often hidden until they are angered by the machinations of humanity. In the Perilous Land you won&amp;rsquo;t find hundreds of dragons flocking the sky, but legends of a single Long Worm who has existed since time immemorial. Monsters are beings of wonder and terror, where just a group of mischievous boggarts can be the reason for an entire quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
