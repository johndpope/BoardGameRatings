			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FPosthuman: The Definitive D20 Guide to Human Augmentation is a 29-page resource that expands the options for technologically enhanced characters. The new rules here are designed to be compatible with the standard rules for futuristic D20 roleplaying, and you should have no trouble adding them to your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's what you get:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Posthuman Template Class: Instead of using a fixed template that adjusts a character's effective level, we present the concept of a template class: a five level option that allows you to choose how powerful you want posthumans to be and whether or not you want to abide by the standard drawbacks for augmented humans. If you don't like the idea of penalizing characters for their enhancements but you don't want to trash game balance, this is the section for you.&lt;br/&gt;     Biotech: Next, we'll look at biotechnology and how it can replace or augment characters' natural abilities. You can use these rules with characters from standard classes. Like cybernetics, biotech comes with its own complications, keeping biologically engineered characters from running roughshod over play balance. To transcend these drawbacks, just plug in the Posthuman class.&lt;br/&gt;     Nanotech: Nanotechnology seems to have an unlimited potential to augment human ability. The rules in this section present a modest array of nanotech enhancements that, like biotech, come with drawbacks to balance out their benefits. Again, you can plug in the Posthuman class to mitigate or remove these restrictions.&lt;br/&gt;     Posthuman Characters: Finally, we present three enhanced characters as a proof of concept and to give you ready made enemies, allies and player characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Posthuman: The Definitive D20 Guide to Human Augmentation is written by Malcom Sheppard (author of several supplements for White Wolf's Mage: The Ascension, among other products) and is the premiere release in Adamant Entertainment's TERMINAL IDENTITY line of Cyberpunk-genre products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
