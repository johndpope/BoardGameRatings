			<description>schei&amp;szlig;e is a card game, played with a standard 32-card French deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting the first round with one card, the second with to cards and so on up to 7 cards each player. Then it goes down to one card again.&lt;br/&gt;After examining your cards you state the number of tricks you will win. The number of statet tricks is not allowed to be equal to the number of cards dealt to each player. So at least one player has to be wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round each player puts down one card.&lt;br/&gt;Colour order is Clubs -&amp;gt; Spades -&amp;gt; Hearts -&amp;gt; Diamonds. If you have the starting colour of a round, you have to play it. Otherwise you're free to play whichever colour you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turns with just one card per player, you have to place your card, such that everybody else can see it, and state if you make the trick, according to the other cards you see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will recieve 10 points if you statet your number of tricks correctly and 2 additionaly points for each trick, otherwise you will loose 2 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
