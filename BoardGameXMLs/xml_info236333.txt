							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Treasure House of Jaizin Kaa</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jaizin Kaa claims to be the wealthiest merchant in Zamora. And, if he isn&amp;rsquo;t quite the wealthiest, he can reliably be called the most ferocious and protective of his wealth. His Treasure House &amp;mdash; an enormous fortified mansion, heavily guarded and filled with the collected loot from a lifetime of bartering and trading &amp;mdash; is among the most coveted prizes in the whole of the Western kingdoms. This is partially due to the fact that no one has ever managed to successfully steal from Jaizin Kaa. It is said that no thief has ever managed to filch even a single copper coin from the Treasure House&amp;rsquo;s vast stores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mangled corpses of more than a dozen unfortunates whose heists failed offer a silent guarantee of the treatment Jaizin Kaa reserves for those who abuse his hospitality. Guards patrol the mansion&amp;rsquo;s walls and the grounds beyond them, concealed lethality lurks behind doors in the form of deadly traps, and, so it is rumored, darker and deadlier things haunt the inner reaches of the Treasure House.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And yet, the riches, which await those bold enough, fast enough, clever enough, to reach them, are said to be beyond even a master thief&amp;rsquo;s wildest imaginings. Getting in and out might not be easy, but the rewards &amp;mdash; measured in gold and fame &amp;mdash; are enough to seal a young thief&amp;rsquo;s reputation or provide the means by which an older thief might retire. All they have to do is survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gen Con 2017 adventure, provided free to backers of Robert E. Howard's Conan RPG Kickstarter campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
