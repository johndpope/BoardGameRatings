			<description>This is a roll-and-move game, where each player is a speed skater running for the best time on the natural ice skating field in Davos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The distances are 500m, 1500m, 5000m and 10000m. Each player rolls a die and moves spaces forward. Lane changes are done once per round during the three longest distances, and the skater changing to the inner lane has priority. On some of the fields there are events happening to the player who lands there, like &amp;quot;Fall! You must pass on two rolls&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Nice rhythm on the long side - move two fields forward&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each roll, the timer clock (on the board) is moved 1/10 second.&lt;br/&gt;All finishing times are calculated to averages per 500m which is the final score. The player with the lowest score win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is probably from the end of the 1950s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
