			<description>Follow That Car is a fun transport-themed matching game which can be enjoyed by all the family! Build a road by matching either the colour, animal or vehicle type and be the first to get rid of all your cards. However, watch out for roadblocks, which other players can put down to block your path! You can also use roundabout cards to extend the road layout and add more cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a great game not only to develop matching skills but also colour recognition as children can be encouraged to name and match the brightly coloured vehicles. Children will also love the fun animal transport illustrations, from elephants driving cars to sheep riding tractors!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;36 vehicle cards&lt;br/&gt;1 roundabout card&lt;br/&gt;3 roadblock cards (police car, flood, roadworks)&lt;br/&gt;1 instruction leaflet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
