			<description>Moon &amp;amp; Sun Druids select a new leader by moving around the circles of stones. A mix of cards and dice and symbols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Druids start from the Grove, in the centre of the Stone Circle. When a player begins his turn, he must move his druid, firstly, onto one of the 6 stones showing a Pentagram. This is the only space that may be moved to, from the centre area. The player throws both dice. At the beginning of the game each player has only one piece available (his Druid), therefore only one of the dice is used to determine movement. The second dice is unused until such time as the player has other game-pieces available for him to move. The meaning of the symbols on the dice dictate the type of movement allowed.&lt;br/&gt;The space on which a Druid lands also affects further events. After the player has carried out all necessary actions then his turn is over. If a Druid lands on a blank stone then his turn is immediately ended and play passes to the next player.&lt;br/&gt; Once a player has taken control of two or more pieces then he may apply the dice to their full potential. In this case a player can, for example, move two Spirits or one Spirit and one Druid. Naturally he will choose the optimum moves, considering the symbols on the stones and the location of other game pieces, which each piece can land on.&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points, overall, wins the game and is proclaimed the new High-Druid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
