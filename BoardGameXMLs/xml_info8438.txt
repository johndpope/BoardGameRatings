			<description>CONTENTS:&lt;br/&gt;3D playing board, Dragon, Throne,&lt;br/&gt;4x Elf pieces (each made of 3 parts which fit one inside the other like Russian dolls)&lt;br/&gt;Crown&lt;br/&gt;3 dice of different sizes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECT&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to be the first elf to get to the throne with the crown on its head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very cute children's game which uses some magnetic gadget under the board. Nice bits. Elves start being of big size, but when the Dragon casts his spell, a magnetic device will act causing some elves to topple over. Those affected by the spell will loose power, and turn smaller by taking out the biggest playing piece out and showing the next one in size, being the medium size on a first spell. From now they will use the medium size dice.... and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player looses all his/her 3 lives, s/he will have to start again, but recovers the full size&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
