			<description>From publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will win this never ending battle between light and darkness?  Out of the Shadows and Mayhem, these warriors have come to battle for you.  Arm them with equipment and magic to win this battle.  It will be the difference between you defeating your opponent and your last life tower being cut down.  Sound good?  The Shadow Chaos starter pack comes with two ready to play decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin each game, hand your deck to the other play to shuffle each other's deck.&lt;br/&gt;Next, draw seven cards from your deck.  Be sure that you have at least one Warrior card and one Life Tower card.&lt;br/&gt;If you do not have one of each, then shuffle your hand back into the deck and draw another seven cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning the Game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, you must simply destroy all of the opponent's life towers.&lt;br/&gt;If your opponent has no life towers on his side of the field, you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;It is not necessary to go through the entire deck and destroy every one of his life towers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for each turn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each turn, you must draw one card.&lt;br/&gt;If you have no deck to draw from, shuffle your graveyard, draw the first 20 cards, and shuffle the deck.&lt;br/&gt;This will be your new deck.&lt;br/&gt;Each warrior may attack an opponent's warrior only once unless otherwise stated by that warriors effect or equipped card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
