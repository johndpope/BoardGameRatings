							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Vacuous Grimoire Volume One</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vacuous Grimoire is an expanded edition of the former SRD of the All Mind. In one volume the grimoire combines various home brew rules adopted from the variety of influences with the Open Gaming License &amp;quot;System Reference Document&amp;quot; to present a unified rulebook for players that supplants character skill points with old school attribute checks along with racial and class abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of using these ability checks we have found most often is speed of gameplay. D6 &amp;quot;party&amp;quot; initiative resolves encounter surprise and initiative with a roll of two dice. Expertise such as picking locks or tracking creatures in the wilderness are race or class abilities, which isolates these abilities to discrete characters rather than having everyone and their aunt making a roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combining Knights of the All Mind for players with the System Reference Document also adds new rules directly descended from our old game such as for critical hits, fumbles, morale, divine interventions, technological weapons, insect, amphibian, and reptilian races, and new character classes. All fixed to accommodate the style we ran with fun and thrills over three decades of gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But wait, THERE'S MORE! New rules on mana, arcane spell bumbles, and dex adjustments to speed that break conformity just enough so that characters seem more grittier realistic heroes than homogenized stats where most every humanoid creature can move exactly 30' x 4 in a full-out run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus the complete directory and entries for the mechanical effects of common spells from Words of Spells is included, so this tome is indeed all a player needs to play. (Volume 2 in this series combines material from Knights for game judges.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taken together, this new venture hopes to continue &amp;quot;wild west&amp;quot; flavor from this pastime's classic age while being compatible in an unbalanced fashion with more modern gaming devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
