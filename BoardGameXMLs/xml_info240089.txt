			<description>Heromaniacs: A 2-Bit Dungeon Adventure Card Game (3rd Edition)  is a standalone light-hearted fantasy themed dungeon crawling card game for 2-4 players. The goal is very simple: be the first player to get from Level 1 of the dungeon all the way up to and out of Level 5. To do that, players must gain enough Experience (EXP) to advance through the various levels. To gain EXP, players must defeat monsters. To defeat monsters, players need to recruit Heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in turns. During a player's turn, that player takes one of the following actions: 1) Recruit a Hero, 2) Attack a monster, or 3) Level Up. RECRUIT: To recruit a Hero, the player chooses any number of Heroes from the available pool whose total Strength is 10 or less and adds them to his or her hand, OR a player may choose a Hero card, flip it to the opposite side, and recruit the Hero on the flipped side. ATTACK: To Attack a Monster, the player chooses a monster in play to attack, and then deploys at least one (1) Hero  to that monster. If the total Strength all of the Heroes deployed to that monster is greater than the level of the monster, the monster is defeat and the player collects that monster. If the total Strength of the Heroes deployed to the monster is equal to the monster's level, the monster is defeated, the player collects it, and the player can take an additional action during the turn. LEVEL UP: To Level Up, a player must cash-in a monster in his collected pile whose level (which also serves as EXP once the monster had been collected) is greater than or equal to the EXP requirement of the Dungeon Level that player is currently on. After a player has taken all actions for the turn, play passes to the player on the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues in this way until one player on Level 5 of the Dungeon gains enough EXP to escape. The first player to exit the dungeon, wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
