			<description>From the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;THIS IS THE HOME EDITION OF THE EXCITING T.V. GAME-BATTA HAI. BATTA HAI WAS DEVELOPED BY LYON S. WEIR OF HOLLYWOOD FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY, BUT THIS PARTICULAR EDITION HAS BEEN DESIGNED BY HIM WITH HOME ENTERTAINMENT IN MIND. YOU, YOUR FAMILY, AND YOUR FRIENDS WILL ENJOY PLAYING IT OVER AND OVER, FOR EACH GAME WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM THE PREVIOUS ONE.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Batta Hai is a Bingo-like game with endless variations: Twelve different boards, forty nine different calls. Each board can be played in different ways, finding the way is the key to victory.&lt;br/&gt;Once a piece has been called it may be arranged on the player's board, or set aside. Only the first piece called must remain in position for the duration of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who correctly covers all the numbered and arrow squares and calls out &amp;quot;Batta Hai&amp;quot; wins the game because the same play piece, when called, may complete more than one board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
