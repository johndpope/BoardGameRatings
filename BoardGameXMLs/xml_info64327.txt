			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Need to deal with one player's questions, settling an argument, or a split party, while making sure the rest of the group doesn't resort to dice towers or random destruction? We've all been there, on one side of the screen or the other. That's what 5 Minute Mini-Games is for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 Minute Mini-Games contains thirteen games for characters in any d20 system, easily portable to other systems. Challenge each other to a quick game of of Castles and Cornerstones to see who's more intelligent. Spend your downtime in a tavern playing Tall Tales, or show off your toughness with Thrag's Great Idea. There are games based on every stat - some that fighters will dominate, others that rogues will clean up at, and even more that everyone has a chance at winning. Let players entertain each other, or have an NPC challenge the party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
