			<description>It was announced as a remake of &amp;quot;Panzer Division Kommandeur&amp;quot; from Ad-Technos in 1985.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, it is not a remake. From different designer, with different component, with different combat system, with different scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;Actually, it is just a different game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version covers only the Eastern front in 1944.  This is another important difference.&lt;br/&gt;One player must play a game as a German Panzer Division Kommandeur.  The other player controls the enemy Soviet army leader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a random scenario creation system. The map area and each force are determined by dice.  The most important point that the goal of each army is given by randomly drawn chits.  There are 6 mission chits in the game and each player draw 2 of them secretly.  So, each player now know his goal and some information that his opponent might have.  The missions, are breakthrough, conquer, defense and so on.  Each mission gives each player victory points. At the end of the game, victory points are calculated for each player and compared to determine the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;components:&lt;br/&gt;one map, one countersheet, one rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
