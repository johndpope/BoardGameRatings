							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Canine Remains</name>
									
			<description>This expansion adds the Canine Remains to the Malifaux universe. Canine Remains are zombie dogs that work as minions for the Resurrectionsts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undead Dogs come in 4 breeds of your choice (5 if you include Chihuahua) and are the cheapest minion model available to the Resurrectionists (2-Soulstones each). Many Resurectionist masters use them as cannon fodder, to then later use their corpses to &amp;quot;raise&amp;quot; something nastier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buy Canine Remains in bulk; if for no other reason than to gain an activation advantage. Remember also they lose their insignificant characteristic if they are in close proximity to other Canine Remains, so good for grabbing or contesting objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For You, Master:Hounds can scoop up as many corpse counters as they can touch during a move or charge, then send them back to their master for a (0) action. Don't let those corpse counters sit around waiting for enemy Graverobbers or Corpse-Counter-eaters to steal them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unleash the Hounds! This works really well against living opponents, not so much others. Ideally you start within charge range of a living model you want to kill. Canine Remains #1 charges target, damaging it (and attacks again if it was able to (1) Bloodhound). CR #2 uses (1) Bloodhound and attacks (target is now at -2Df for 2+ dogs in melee range), and follows it up with a melee strike. Repeat with additional dogs where necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suicide Rocket Dog. These pups aren't very hardy and being cheap, are cannon fodder (or is that &amp;quot;canine fodder&amp;quot;?). Maximize their actions by having a Nurse pump some doggies with a load of drugs and watch them &amp;quot;go fetch&amp;quot;. They will die by its end, but you expected them to play dead - right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Man's Best Friend: Canine Remains can mass companion under a couple of circumstances but you will have to judge for yourself whether or not it is worthwhile to do so. Will it leave you in a bad position for counter attack? Will a mass companion allow you to grab an objective or tie up important models from the other crew? As it stands at the moment either Mortimer or Sebastian activate and either use (0) Zombie Companion or (0) Here Boy!. Where this gets fun is that each dog then activates in sequence and only has to be within 6&amp;quot; of the Canine that activated before it, so it is possible to setup a whole lot of different approach angles and not have to be clustered all in one place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
