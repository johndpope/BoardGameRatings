			<description>This is a memory variant. 15 picture tiles are placed on a game board which shows a castle. Everyone can look at them briefly, then they are covered up. Afterwards, a tile is drawn from a pile and the player whose turn it is must try to find the hidden tile with the same picture. If successful, he or she gets the tile from the pile, the one on the castle is covered up again. Whoever has most tiles in the end, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
