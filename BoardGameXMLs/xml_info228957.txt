			<description>A One-round Living City Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you sit in the tavern you wonder when your boredom will end. With out much action around the city recently your up for about any job. The taverns have all been quiet with no little boys running in with scrolls in hand have seemed to find you recently. Sitting two tables over however is a spice merchant talking excitedly to a couple of men. As there negotiations seem to break down, he drops his head into his hands. The men get up to leave with a snicker, and head off towards the bar for a round of drinks. After a minute the man finally raises up his head and scans the bar, seeing your table his mood changes and he walks over to the assembled group. &amp;ldquo;Hello my name is Toby Wartwarden, I am a in the city visiting from Hillsfar. I came down looking to obtain a spice that grows in the region. The two men over there wanted a outrageous price for such a easily gotten spice. If you would be willing to go gather this spice for me I would be willing to pay you each a sum of 200 gold pieces for your troubles.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
