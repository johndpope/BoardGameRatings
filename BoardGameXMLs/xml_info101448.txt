							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">His Due</name>
									
			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine if you woke up from a troubling dream somewhere other than in your bed, to see a strangely-coloured animal next to you. And it talked. And it told you that you now had a battery of magical powers that could shake the ground and bring down buildings. Imagine that these powers had come at the cost of something, but the deal you struck with that animal to gain them is excised from your memory so you can't remember what that was. 'His Due' is a game about a hidden war taking place in the world around us, and the reluctant participants who must kill each other if they want to find out how they were drawn into it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
