							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">High Valor (Revised Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Black Gate has fallen. The long night begins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Free Kingdoms struggle to leave their Dark Ages behind just as their deepest fears are realized. The enemies of mankind, demonic Fane-Lords who once enslaved man, have destroyed the Black Gate that held them in their own lands. Now all of the races of man -- Dvegr, Humans, Sidda, Sidhain, and the Fane-created Fomoradgh -- must stand together or fall before them and become their slaves once again. &lt;br/&gt;Glory in battle and die for your cause. Face evil and kindle a light in the onrushing dark. Rhyme your spell words and sing songs of magic. Rely on will, faith and valor as you risk damnation, death, and terrible ends for the needs of others. Can you shift the tide?&lt;br/&gt;High Valor uses a custom system based around FEAT pools. Small dice pools of Will, Faith, and Valor are drawn upon to add game results to traits you describe yourself or the many examples provided. Make your choices matter. Make these traits what you want them to represent and leap into the dangerous world of Aeia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
