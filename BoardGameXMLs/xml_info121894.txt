			<description>Players take turns adding wooden pieces of different shapes to a fragile tower. They also need to get their two playing pieces onto the tower. One piece is lighter the other heavier. Once in a while (the length of this while is determined by a random element), there are scoring breaks. The players then check the positions of their pieces and multiply the number of levels one piece is up with the number of levels the other piece is hanging over the edge of the board. When all pieces have been built, the game ends and the player with most points wins. If a player topples the tower before that, that player is the sole loser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
