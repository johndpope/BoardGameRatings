			<description>Tomba! (Tombi! in Europe and Australia, Ore! Tomba in Japan) is a side-scrolling adventure game created by Whoopee Camp Co. Ltd. for the Sony PlayStation. Tomba! was followed by a sequel titled Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return. The imaginative atmosphere and innovative gameplay of Tomba! has continued to keep it nostalgically popular with gamers. The series is the brainchild of Tokuro Fujiwara, who also created the Ghosts 'n Goblins and Mega Man series. It was also one of the earliest Playstation games to take advantage of the Dual Shock feature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tomba! is set on a group of islands in the middle of an ocean which do not appear on any map. Formed with large provinces in the north and smaller islands in the south, the region was home to a peaceful people who lived in tranquility for many years. The island was once a beautiful place, home to birds and plantations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The protagonist is an energetic pink-haired youth named Tomba. One day, seven evil pigs appeared, and using their magical powers, they mutated the surroundings into a bizarre landscape. The underlings of The Evil Pigs, called the Koma Pigs, stole Tomba's grandfather's bracelet and a plethora of gold through a strange lust for it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tomba's quest is to retrieve his bracelet, which requires trapping the Evil Pigs along the way. Trapping them involves finding the Evil Pig Bags, which are keys to entering each realm of each Evil Pig. He must also complete missions for other people to get items and the Evil Pig Bags. Some side-missions are purely for fun and irrelevant to the main storyline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tomba!&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
