			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primordial Spawning Ground of Civilization!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plumbing ancient ruins in search of long-forgotten secrets and the power of lost civilizations is nothing new to adventurers. Few fantasy settings are without some lost civilization from ages before, which boasted magic or technology far more advanced than anything seen today. But if you&amp;rsquo;re going to go after mythical cities from bygone eras, you may as well go after the best of the best. Each installment of Weekly Wonders: Archetypes of the Ancients takes a single real-world mythological city, lost continent, or hidden kingdom and provides six archetypes specifically designed to invoke the themes and elements that that place is known for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this book, we focus on the continent of Lemuria. Originally theorized to explain the geographic disposition of lemurs and similar small mammals by postulating a missing land-bridge that once connected areas where they are found, Lemuria eventually became the topic of much occult interest. Said to have been inhabited by a strange and alien race of proto-humans, the archetypes in this book grant the traits attributed to this progenitor race, and have general themes of evolutionary surges. This book includes the following archetypes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Lemurian bloodrager bloodline, which allows the bloodrager to mutate his own body, open his third eye, and gain spiritual clarity.&lt;br/&gt;    The seeker of Lemuria, an investigator archetype trained in unusual biology and ancient practices of meditation.&lt;br/&gt;    The Lemurian scion, a medium archetype with several powers relating to a mystical third eye, which allows them to see things others cannot.&lt;br/&gt;    The Lemurian mentalist, a mesmerist archetype that can temporarily mutate others with a touch, and can radiate a calming aura.&lt;br/&gt;    The Lemurian oracle mystery, offering a wide variety of powers relating to Lemuria, its ancient race, and evolutionary mutation.&lt;br/&gt;    A bonus wild surge type for the wilder, from Psionics Unleashed by Dreamscarred Press, the Lemurian surge causes her body to physically mutate when she invokes a wild surge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're about to embark on an archaeological campaign (such as the official Paizo adventure path dealing with seeking out the secrets of a lost and ancient civilization), or you just want to play a character with a connection to the ancient past, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer. Even GMs can get in on the fun, as several of the archetypes here are perfect for NPCs tied to mythical places as well, and can make for exciting and memorable encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
