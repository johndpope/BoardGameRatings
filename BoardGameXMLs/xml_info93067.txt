							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ALF</name>
									
			<description>The game represents an action-adventure video game similar to Maniac Mansion or King's Quest. The player, playing as ALF, must collect the necessary items and solve some simple tasks to help the protagonist to repair his spaceship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific levels in the ALF that are directly based on the television show simply do not exist. However, the game consists of several locations, which the player can move into at any order: Alf's house, street, basement of the house, Alf's backyard, and a pond in the backyard. As in any quest for the passing game must collect various objects: a stick of salami, which can be used to deal with the bats, scuba gear, allowing to plunge to the bottom of the pond, etc. Some items can be found as you progress through the game, part - buy in stores, selling before this treasure trove.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opponents in the game a bit and most of them, except bats, it is impossible to destroy, but instead to avoid contact with them, jumping them or dodged to the side at the right time. At some points the game becomes a typical arcade-style video game, for example, when Alf eluded cyclists on the street or scuba diving and predatory fish in the pond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Alf (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
