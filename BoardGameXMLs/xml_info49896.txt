			<description>Supplement for the WoTG rpg. Provides a city setting, large scale conflict rules, new divine weapons and a system for the creation of martial arts styles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...In the Kingdom of Yang, there grows a poison garden...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In which is detailed the Wuxia City of Thrashing Minister, Capital City of Yang - wherein players may visit, secure things they may need, or build a power base of their own. Comes with full maps and descriptions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...which grows within a palace that holds coveted Weapons...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Weapons of the Gods - both to be found in Thrashing Minister or elsewhere - and also those designed by the fans and published in book form for the first time. Suitable for use in any game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...from which the powerful and corrupt King plays the Greatest Game of all...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great Game is a scalable ruleset that allows you to play out large battles in Weapons of the Gods. Much like the Secret Arts for magic, it is the central system for not just mass combat but also high-stakes political and diplomatic combat - it's exactly as detailed as you need it to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...while in Heaven the Minister of the Wulin places the last stone of the Million Style Manual - learning of the new martial arts being devised to stop the king and his plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given into your hands is the ruleset by which you can freely create your own martial arts - players can use it to devise their own personal martial arts, while the Sage can develop new and interesting kung fu for rivals, allies, or enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
