							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Little Ghost Game</name>
									
			<description>'An exciting game for boys and girls' says the box. The subject matter is probably related to the appeal of the comic book character Casper the Friendly Ghost without being an actual Casper linked game. Dates from the early 1960's.&lt;br/&gt;A spinner regulates players' movement and also indicates which part of the house is being haunted. The board represents four floors of an old house, from the cellar to the attic.&lt;br/&gt;Wooden pawns and a built-in spinner (next to the play-area of the board).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
