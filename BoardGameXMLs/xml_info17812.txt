							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strawberry Shortcake Card Game Double &quot;Berry&quot; Talk</name>
									
			<description>Everyone who knows about Strawberryland knows about the Berry Birds. They're the feathered friends of the Purple Pieman, and they repeat everything they hear! Be a Berry Bird by matching each of the Fruit cards that are played. Then use that fruit to make up your very own recipe. The one with the fewest Fruit cards at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a matching game like Uno but the only special card is a wild. If you cannot match a card on your turn, you add the entire discard pile to your hand. The game ends when there are no more cards in the draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
