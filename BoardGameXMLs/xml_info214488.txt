			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the twenty third battle in our series of the American Civil Wargames in 3D. The Confederate Army have been caught attempting to cross the passes over South Mountain in to Maryland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historically the Union came into possession of the Confederate Special Order 191 which showed the disposition of the Confederate Army in the Maryland Campaign. Acting of this information General George B McClellan sent the Union Army to attack them at the passes of South Mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;South Mountain is a single day battle that has a time limit of 7 bounds, 13 with extended play option. The Union must capture the six marked objectives. The games design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game within a 1-2 hour period of continuous play. The game gives a flavour of the American Civil War period and a simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game, keep the chain of command together and everything is fine, lose it and it could cost you the game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit. You don&amp;rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&amp;rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion. The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included with the download is the 3D Game Board in two halves, the South Mountain seven page Battle Rules, the Gaming Counters, a simple guide on how to build a 3D Game Board, the Brothers At Arms twenty one page Rules Booklet with Playsheet, a twenty four hour Timeline Table and finally a set of Tile Dice. The game rules are fast and easy to learn and will be the same throughout the full series of American Civil War in 3D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you continue this great series of battles with another victory? Play North or South in this the twenty third game of the American Civil War in 3D series of board games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
