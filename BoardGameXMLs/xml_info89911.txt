			<description>Bit.Trip Runner is the fourth installment of the Bit.Trip series. Runner features over 50 levels. The gameplay involves players controlling Commander Video and making him jump, slide, kick, and more through various obstacles in his path. The special guest band Anamanaguchi provides menu and credits music. Though it has over 50 levels, breaking the 3 level norm of the last games, these levels are divided evenly amongst 3 zones, which each have their own distinct background and musical feel; each zone houses twelve levels, including a boss level. For every level (except boss levels) there is a retro challenge awarded should the player collect all gold bars in the normal level. Each retro challenge is harder than the normal level and usually has more gold bars. The perfect completion of a retro challenge will award players with an exclamation point beside the stage and the word &amp;quot;PERFECT&amp;quot; beside the score in the scoreboard, but only if they have done everything &amp;quot;extra&amp;quot; (i.e., jumping on top of springboards that they do not need to in order to finish) in the level beforehand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bit.Trip Runner&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
