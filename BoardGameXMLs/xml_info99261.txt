			<description>The Tick was a side-scrolling beat 'em up video game developed by Software Creations and released by Fox Interactive in 1994. The game was released on the Super NES and Sega Genesis systems and was based on the comic book and Fox Kids animated series of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's style was very typical for this side-scrolling genre. The Tick's signature humor is also present in various parts of the game, such as his unorthodox gestures and &amp;quot;Spoon!&amp;quot; battle cry after completing a level (and starting a level in the Genesis version). 44 levels make up the game with &amp;quot;wobble&amp;quot; environments and arcade style graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, in contrast to the popular animated series it was based on, the game was panned by critics. While the accurate graphics and jazzy background music were moderately well-received, the game was criticized for having seemingly generic hordes of ridiculous look-a-like enemies to combat and the limited punch-and-kick style. The game ending is also widely regarded as being empty and unrewarding. Brett Allan Weiss of Allgame had rated and evaluated The Tick as being &amp;quot;repetitive&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;boring.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Tick (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
