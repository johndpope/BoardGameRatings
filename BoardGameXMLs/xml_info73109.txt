			<description>&amp;quot;Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy is a video game developed by Midway Games for the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows PC platforms. It was also being developed for the Nintendo GameCube titled ESPionage but later cancelled. The game was released in North America on June 14, 2004; the European release followed on October 1, 2004. On June 9, 2008, the full version was offered as a free download hosted by fileplanet  with in-game advertising, but also allowing to purchase the game in order to remove the advertising. A FilePlanet  subscription is required to receive the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A traditional shooter in many respects, Psi-Ops banks on its ragdoll physics (by way of Havok 2.0) and variety of psychic powers to differentiate itself. In Japan and Southeast Asia/East Asia, the game was marketed by Capcom as Psi-Ops: Psychic Operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the player is Nick Scryer, a &amp;quot;PSI-Operative&amp;quot; whose mind has been wiped to allow him to infiltrate a terrorist organization. However, he is captured and must fight his way out with the help of Sara, a double agent. As he progresses, he regains his PSI powers.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Psi-Ops:_The_Mindgate_Conspiracy,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
