			<description>Four different letters games can be played with the components included in the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Letter puzzle - longest possible word  (Deal 9 letters onto table and all players use these letters to find the longest possible word.  Players get 1 point for every letter in their word.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Word builder - create as many words as possible using 3 random letters  (Deal 3 letters onto table and players have 1 minute to create as many words as possible containing these letters.  Players get 1 point for ever unique word they come up with.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Word paths - search for words in a four by four grid  (Create a random 4 by 4 grid of letters and players then find as many words as possible in the grid, similar to Boggle.  Players gain 1 point for each unique word they find.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) Word crossing - use as many letters to make a crossword layout  (Players are dealt 21 letters and have 5 minutes to create a crossword grid using these letters.  Each player scores as many points as letters they use.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
