			<description>A micro-game style hex and chit conflict game that pits genetically mutated insects against each other. The players start with a Queen and a few eggs that can hatch to become one of a number of basic insect types. Each insect type has basic strengths and weaknesses. There are basic drones good for moving objects, warriors for fighting, fliers for scouting and arachnids whose speed comes in handy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the course of the game killed opponent bugs can be dragged back into the hive and used to feed the Queen who can then lay more eggs that can in turn be spawned into new creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are short but the game can unfold in many ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similarity links: Hive&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
