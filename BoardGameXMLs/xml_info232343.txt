							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Bodak</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bodaks are a thankfully rare branch of the world's known undead. Unlike skeletons and zombies, which are remnants of necrotic magic, bodaks are created by a direct intrusion of Chaotic Evil into the material world. They usually are a sign of that the boundaries separating dimensional planes have worn thin, and may eventually attract demons and other abyssal creatures if their presence is allowed to fester.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While not physically imposing compared to most warriors, bodaks pose a real danger to all races. Their greatest power is an ability to inflict their undead condition on other humanoids with a single glance, dooming that creature to a slow death. They cannot be reasoned or bargained with, seeking only to spread their contamination across the material plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this reason, good and lawful evil heroes of the material plane formed a temporary alliance generations ago to purge the bodaks from existence. Their efforts appeared successful, but now bodak sightings are being reported once again. One benefit to the reduced infuence of Chaotic Evil is their legendary Death Gaze - a key ability in creating more bodaks - has been reduced in power. But unchecked, they still threaten all civilizations, and may require new heroes to stand against them once again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
