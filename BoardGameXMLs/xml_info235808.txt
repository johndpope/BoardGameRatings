			<description>Hoksaa! is a quick pattern recognition game. Game board is a circle built on puzzle pieces with easy and harder side. The game play consists of rolling a special die that will tell players what to search this round. Some examples: blue things, loud things, square things. Sandtimer is flipped, and players try to find as many of matching things during that time and mark them with their pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
