							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dino Shoot</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Attack the Dino by shooting as many balls as you can!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is what the box claims. In this game there is a central Tyrannosaurus Rex Head that spins around and as it does there is a series of blocking pieces of plastic that also rotate. As they do each player need to shoot his or her balls through the gate at the end of each of their ramps to try to get it in the middle. The person who wins is the one who gets all their balls in the middle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
