			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the War, some folks chose a side and others pitted the Alliance and the Independents against each other for fun and profit. Well, mostly profit. Enter Templeton Steele, a powerful weapons designer whose bride-to-be is none other than the lovely Liliana Fairchild. Now, on account of these two lovebirds getting hitched, you and your crew are hired to transport Lilly to a fancy ship called the Rim&amp;iacute;s Dream. Sounds easy enough, right? Unite the happy couple and they'll get paid? Only thing is, this Princess ain't exactly happy about the wedding. The more you find out, the worse this job gets and the less chance you have of getting paid.&lt;br/&gt; The Wedding Planners Classic Set is part of the ECHOES OF WAR role-playing adventure series, which is centered on a common theme: the Unification War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything you need to play this adventure is included in the set. When you download, you'll receive the following four PDFs:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Wedding Planners Cortex Classic - This adventure was written by Margaret Weis as a love letter to fans of the company's original game rules system.
