			<description>What&amp;rsquo;s in a name? Winning the game! This game challenges you to get your team to guess the names of famous people and places on three levels of play: say anything, say one thing and say nothing. Otherwise known as shouting out everything you can think of, carefully choosing one word and charades. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s easy (you draw Daffy Duck and shout &amp;ldquo;Thufferin&amp;rsquo; thuckatash!&amp;rdquo;), but sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s sure not (how will you get your team to guess The White House without talking?). The cool game unit shoots cards to you and keeps track of the time, too. Game comes with Name Dropper Unit (electronic card dispenser with a 30-second timer), 400 cards, 1 score pad and instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
