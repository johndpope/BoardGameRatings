			<description>This is a set of rules for Minatures in the Napoleonic era. Originally published in 1971 as Napoleonique, it was revised and reissued in 1992 as Napoleonique Encore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is the description from the back of the Encore edition: &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Napoleonique /Encore covers the wars of the French Revolution through the many campaigns of Napoleon and to the final battle of Waterloo in 1815.  You select the battalion or regimental game from scales set up to accommodate your current mounting scheme.  The focus on simplicity will have you finishing a turn in twenty minutes with armies of a thousand or more.&lt;br/&gt;The original rules called Napoleonique, set battalion level games at a scale of thirty men per casting, a ten minute time scale and twenty yards per inch.  Napoleonique/Encore offers 5 game scales with casting representing 30 men in some scales up to 90 men in the regimental version.  These rule shave a history of being the beginners friend and the veteran's &amp;quot;first car&amp;quot; in wargamming.&lt;br/&gt;Napoleonique/Encore is a product of the team of Jim Getz and Glenn Davis.  Over 20,000 copies of the original Napoleonique were sold since its release in the early 70's.  Some of you may buy Napoleonique/Encore for nostalgic reasons while others will find the simplicity to be a pleasant change.  Either way we know you'll enjoy these rules.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
