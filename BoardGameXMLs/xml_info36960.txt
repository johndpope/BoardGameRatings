			<description>Nova Glory is a boardgame of starship fleet combat.  It uses a unique mechanic so the playing pieces do all the record keeping for you. Large fleet battles play quickly and the space map tiles allow for easy placement of various terrain features such as asteroids and planets.  There are four races in the game each with their own back story and distinctive play style.  Strategy cards simulate lucky shots or other special situations that add an element of surprise to the game.  The turn sequence keeps both players involved throughout the entire game.  Game includes several scenarios in addition to basic straight up fleet duels.  Rules are easy to moderate to learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publishers website:www.NovaGlory.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
