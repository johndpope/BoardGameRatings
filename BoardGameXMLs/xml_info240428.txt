			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clay Town is an impoverished city on the far edge of a great empire, founded in hope but fallen on hard times. It&amp;rsquo;s rife with crime, corruption, and a dark cult that hopes to use its seclusion&lt;br/&gt;to further their evil ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can your heroes save Clay Town from itself (or alternately, can they profit off its misery and get away before the whole thing comes down on them)?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clay Town includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A complete and detailed description of the town and its environs&lt;br/&gt;    A map of Clay Town&lt;br/&gt;    Two dozen NPCs - friends, foes, and ordinary people who make Clay Town their home&lt;br/&gt;    Ten short plot seeds&lt;br/&gt;    A full-length adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cities of Wonder is a line of books envisioned by Bill &amp;quot;teh ebil bunneh&amp;quot; Keyes, each describing a city, town, village, neighborhood, fortification, space station, caravanserai, or some other place that people live, play, and work. They&amp;rsquo;re system-neutral with a focus on people, places, and adventures, so no matter what you play you can use them. You can effortlessly slot them into an existing campaign world, either your own or a published world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
