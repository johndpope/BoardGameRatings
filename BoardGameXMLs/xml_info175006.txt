			<description>The Second Sky is the fifth major title in the DROD series and the climactic chapter in Beethro's adventures in the Great Beneath. This game is the culmination of years of development and evolution of the DROD formula. It is designed as a tremendously rewarding experience for the hardcore gamer. We are making this game especially for those who love puzzles and dungeon delving. It features a plethora of novel game and puzzle elements that you have not seen anywhere else, placed onto a backdrop of a unique and epic story full of peculiar characters and engaging locales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guide Beethro Budkin, professional dungeon pest exterminator, as he goes up against the Rooted Empire in a race against time under the looming Grand Event. Beethro is always fond of saying &amp;quot;there is no problem that can't be solved with a really big sword,&amp;quot; but he will need to use a variety of fresh new weapons and tactics to win the day this time against a dire threat. You won't believe what's in store!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
