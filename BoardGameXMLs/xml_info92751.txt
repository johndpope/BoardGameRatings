The home versions makes use of a revolver-shaped light gun known as the Konami Justifier, which came packaged with the game. A standard controller can be also used in lieu of the light gun in these versions. A second-player Justifier light gun, pink in color, was available only by mail order from Konami, and is very hard to find today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lethal Enforcers was followed by Lethal Enforcers II: Gunfighters. The Japanese arcade game Seigi No Hero was localized to Western markets as Lethal Enforcers 3.
