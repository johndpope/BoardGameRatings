			<description>More tanks, more robots, more war!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LaserStorm is 6mm science fiction on a massive scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each troop stand is one vehicle or a 4-6 person fireteam. Units are platoons and the game can scale up to an entire battalion on the board, if you have the table space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Card driven turn sequence, using a very small card deck.&lt;br/&gt;     Not a single counter, marker or indicator placed on the table, ever.&lt;br/&gt;     No record keeping or tracking for any units, ever.&lt;br/&gt;     Combat rules are quick and straight forward. &lt;br/&gt;     Units are distinctive in play: Tanks are durable but vulnerable to close assault, super heavy tanks are mobile bunkers and massive behemoths can stride right through a defensive line, crushing and terrifying enemy troops as they go.&lt;br/&gt;     Morale system sees units driven off the table and brought back to resume the battle again. You can actually reorganize and redeploy during a game, to open up new fronts or outflank the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;     Army commanders provide special deployment and combat options to their troops.&lt;br/&gt;     Choose from 25 ready-to-play units, put your own together using a fast &amp;quot;Assembly Line&amp;quot; where you simply match up vehicle hulls and guns or use the points system to build your own troops from scratch.&lt;br/&gt;     Unit types that can be built include infantry, tanks, grav vehicles, cavalry, field artillery, giant robots, heroes and many more.&lt;br/&gt;     A standard objective-oriented scenario to get to grips with.&lt;br/&gt;     Unit traits included to customize and build unique troops, such as scouts.&lt;br/&gt;     Fully featured map-driven campaign rules, with troop upgrades.&lt;br/&gt;     A small quick-play scenario that should be playable with almost any scifi figures on your shelf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
