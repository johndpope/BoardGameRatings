							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Awkward Family Photos Movie Line Caption Game</name>
									
			<description>Players will attempt to caption images from the website AwkardFamilyPhotos.com.  The game consists of movie line cards and photo cards.  Game play is very similar to that of &amp;quot;Apples to Apples&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt eight movie quote cards.  These cards consist of movie quotes from a variety of genres (including comedy, horror/thriller, drama, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player, called &amp;quot;The Critic&amp;quot; will select an &amp;quot;Awkward Family Photo&amp;quot; card which depicts an image from AwkwardFamilyPhotos.com.  That player places the card for all players to see the image.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other players will then choose the caption card that they feel best fits the picture.  They place this card face down on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Critic&amp;quot; player then takes the caption cards and reads the captions aloud.  He/she will then select the caption that they feel is the best.  The player whose caption card was selected wins the round.  Play continues with a new player taking the role of &amp;quot;The Critic&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
