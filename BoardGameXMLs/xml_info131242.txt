							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">King of Crime card game</name>
									
			<description>2-4 player game, 15-20 minute game play. Players are the bosses of their families in the 1930's gangster era. Players hire thugs, bookies and torpedos to help them gain control of the various rackets in the city. Card play weakens/enhances family strengths duing the game. The major twist is the HIT die, played during a racket round, where every character is a target!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mature themes (nothing you couldn't read about in any Time-Life book from the library), recommended for 12+ years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the designer of Battle of the bands, Backstage Pass and Portable Adventures card games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players (families) battle each other to control a set number of rackets, 2 of one kind of racket or 3 of any kind racket.  You build your family using thug, bookie and torpedo cards, collectively known as mug cards. They're point value is your power during rackets. When a racket card is being fought over, the players all roll a HIT die (1d6),any opponent mugs in play that match your die roll (a die is printed on the mug cards), those cards are eithered flipped-unusable during this round, or discarded. The die roll is then added to the remaining value of your mugs in play, highest score wins the contract. But, you must have a mug who can control that racket, otherwise it is discarded. Family cards are played during non racket rounds to help your family or hinder the opposition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
