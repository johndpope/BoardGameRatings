							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Spell-Works Compendium Volume III</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the third installment of the Spell Works Compendium.  Under the direction of Milnizer the Maligned--I mean Magnificent--we have compiled a list of more than sixty spells for your spell casting pleasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this installment we look at spells that pack more of a punch, spells that linger until it is triggered, and spells that may be delayed while temporarily stored in a small object. Unshackled spells do more damage, have larger area of effect, and may be harder to resist than normal spells but at a cost of two spell slots. Trigger spells lie dormant until activated by an unknowing trespasser, some may be cast in doorways or portals while others may be cast in an area or on an object. Delayed spells allow the caster to impart the spell effect into a containing object until it is released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We also have a few new spells from the good witch Sara including bubbles that flash when they pop and spells that create temporary shelters while out in the wild. Of course, we have several new spells from our new benefactor Milnizer, the arch-mage from the Lost Island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
