			<description>From the Avalanche Press website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Finns relied on large-caliber coast-defense guns to protect their long, rocky coastline with its countless small islands and skerries: over 1,200 kilometers&amp;rsquo; worth. To support the powerful but immobile big guns, Finnish strategy called for small, armored coast-defense ships that could slip between the islands and torpedo-armed ships to dart out and sink attacking enemy warships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That never came to pass: the Finns built two top-heavy armored gunboats which they called &amp;ldquo;battleships,&amp;rdquo; but never funded the third member of the class. A handful of motor torpedo boats would be fielded during the Second World War, but plans to build or buy a group of six small destroyers repeatedly failed to win Parliamentary approval.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Daylight Savings 2017 Golden Journal comes with 20 new laser-cut and mounted playing pieces representing Finland's Fantasy Fleet composed of these new ships, plus a couple of new Sea of Iron scenarios for their use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
