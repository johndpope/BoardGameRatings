			<description>Every player tries to get as many token (pairs) as possible. The token are stacked to build a tower at the beginning of the game and only the top token can be turned. The scope is to undo the tower as quickly as possible and distribute the token on the surface of the table. By playing clever and strategically the token can be re-covered with other token and  that it will be impossible to unveil them. The difficulty of the game consists of memorizing the position of the wandering token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
