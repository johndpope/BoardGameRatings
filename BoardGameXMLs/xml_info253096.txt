							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Veiled Council of Yzeem (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monarchs and rulers of the Known Lands are heroes and villains of the highest order, known far and wide for their deeds as well as their character, or lack thereof. In the nation of Yzeem, however, those who hold power rule in anonymity, but out of necessity, not desire. The Veiled Council was convened to free Yzeem from corruption and criminal influence, and it is a system that has prospered for centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the seven members of the Veiled Council has certain responsibilities and commands their own forces, each with its own focus and requirements. Within these pages you will learn what is known about each of the Councilors and what manner of agents they employ, which can lend itself to player involvement in a campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
