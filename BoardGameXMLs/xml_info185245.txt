							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fifth Element</name>
									
			<description>A Role-Playing Scenario for Cyno's Role-Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fifth Element adapts the setting from the 1997 Luc Besson film The Fifth Element into a setting and adventure for Cyno's Role-Play.  The product is nominally referred to as an &amp;quot;RPG&amp;quot; but it is, instead, clearly an adventure as no mechanics or rules are presented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario itself is quite brief, essentially little more than background information and an introductory scene.  The remainder of the adventure will either be up to the GM or will need to follow the film script (links to various film resources, including an online script, were provided but are no longer active).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from the scenario itself, included DM resources are:  two races, four professions, five skills, seven items (mostly weapons), six vehicles, and ten major NPCs (Korben, Leeloo, etc.).  The detail provided is uneven even within a category.  All items conform closely to the film portrayal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
