							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bases Loaded Baseball</name>
									
			<description>Bases Loaded Baseball is a game from the APBA genre of table top, dice rolling, statistically accurate sports  games. The benefit of playing this game was that it was less costly than it's bigger named brothers and sisters in the genre. Problems with this game include rules that were lengthly and sometimes convoluted, game actions that seem to require two players (base stealing) and in some cases many, many die rolls to resolve a particular play. I have the 1961 season. It features every player that had 30 at bats or 10 innings pitched, so as far as having completeness of each team, the game excelled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But having to roll the dice to check if the batter was HBP, or walked then roll the dice again to see is there was a hit, then again to see if it was a single , double, triple or home run, then roll the dice to see what field the ball went to, which fielder caught it, whether or not the fielder committed an error, roll the die to see if the pitcher holds the runner, roll the die to see if the 2nd baseman was able to turn the double play, roll the dice.......well you get the idea. The designer states &amp;quot;....There are some plays which require a lot of die rolls, but as you play the game you will realize an increase of play time and these extra rolls make the game realistic.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
