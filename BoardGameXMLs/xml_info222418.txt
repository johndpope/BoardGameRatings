							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ends of War</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ends of War: The civil war in Daol has gone on for two, nearly three, decades now, barring a brief one-month respite when there were peace talks back in '79. It's one of the longest wars on record. Some people even started to think the war would never end. But the PRO faction suddenly collapsed. The ARST, who were working for the PRO at the time, are on their way out of country when they are offered one more job in the area at a pay rate that just can't be refused. That job: rescue a number of PRO officials still trapped in country who have been deemed too important to allow to fall into enemy hands. But, it will mean snatching those officials right out from under the nose of an advancing enemy army&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
