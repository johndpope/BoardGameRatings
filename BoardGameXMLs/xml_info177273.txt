							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shootout</name>
									
			<description>At the beginning of Shootout players receive an identity: sheriff, deputy, gunfighter, outlaw, etc. Initially, only the sheriff is known to the other players. Before each round, every player chooses a weapon and then all players simultaneously &amp;quot;shoot&amp;quot; other players by pointing at them. Shots can be deflected or dodged; players take wounds and get healed and take more wounds. Identities become easier to figure out. The sheriff and deputies win by killing the outlaws and vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
