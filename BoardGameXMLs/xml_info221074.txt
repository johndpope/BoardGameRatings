			<description>Based on an online word game, 'Text Twist' challenges players to make as many words as possible out of a given set of letters within a 2 minute period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game consists of 5 rounds.  During each round, a card is drawn which lists a series of letters.  Information is given on the card detailing how many possible 3,4,5,6 and 7 letter words can be created from that specific mix of letters.  Players write the letters on their individual dry erase board, then the timer is flipped and players have 2 minutes to produce as many words as possible.  At the end of the 2 minutes, players score points for valid words created (a booklet is included listing all possible words from each combination of letters).   The score for that round is recorded, and the next round begins with a new set of letters.  After 5 rounds, the player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played as a solo puzzle challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;4 wipe-off Answer/Score boards&lt;br/&gt;1 Instruction/Solutions booklet&lt;br/&gt;144 cards (864 challenges!)&lt;br/&gt;4 dry-erase markers&lt;br/&gt;1 2-minute timer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
