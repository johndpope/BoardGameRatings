			<description>A fast-paced family game of choice and chance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up North is a linear game for 2 to 5 players, where people of varying backgrounds race to the finish with the most money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a simple linear style path with a few shortcuts, allowing players to choose a more profitable or quicker path to the finish.  Each player has a deck of event cards they draw from when they land on a &amp;quot;tree&amp;quot; space.  There is also a universal events deck that is drawn from when a player lands on a &amp;quot;loon&amp;quot; space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The event decks are themed per the character the person is playing.  Some event that may be good for the Outdoorsman may not be good for the Business Tycoon.  This provides solid replayability and varied outcomes based on the characters in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
