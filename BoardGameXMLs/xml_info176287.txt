			<description>The board represents a swimming pool, made up of 25 squares. Shuffle the tiles and place them face-down on to the board, one tile per square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your turn, roll once with one of the two dice (the other is only needed for the 2nd version of the game). The diced colour shows where you can take a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is very simple: Each of the dice colours can be seen on the board edge. One line of colours runs along the top and one on the side. If you have thrown red, for example, you take any cards, which lies in the range below or beside the red box. If you are lucky enough to roll White, that is a Joker and you are allowed to take any tile from any of the game board squares plus you can take any one tile from an opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You keep your tiles concealed and you lay them face-down in front of you but shhh, no one will know if it has a rubber ring or not. If you roll a colour which is empty of rings, you are out of luck and you don't get a tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the board has no tiles left on it, the game ends. Whoever has the most cards with a ring has won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a variant which is intended for slightly older children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
