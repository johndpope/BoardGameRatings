			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;Wild West&amp;rdquo; conjures up images of square-jawed cowboys on horseback, watching over a cattle drive; steely-eyed lawmen facing down desperadoes; painted saloon girls carousing with rowdy guests; and stoic Indian tribesmen, watching their world slip away. The Wild West &amp;mdash; that period of America&amp;rsquo;s history during its westward expansion in the latter half of the nineteenth century &amp;mdash; was all that, and much more. Now, players using the 2D6 system can visit those thrilling (and often dangerous) days of yesteryear. Under Western Skies is an RPG supplement based on the Mongoose 1st Edition 2D6 OGL system (which is itself based on The Original Science-Fiction Roleplaying Game first published in the 1970s) and adapted to create heroes and adventures suitable for an Old West campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to &amp;ldquo;get out of the way and let you play&amp;rdquo;, the rules are minimalist and leave most of the creativity to the referee. Included are rules for character creation (using a now-familiar lifepath and skill acquisition mechanic); Indian tribe creation; equipment and weapon tables; a selection of vehicles and animals; and fast town creation. There are even rules to help you choose skill specialties, run the inevitable showdown at high noon, and determine what happens when you just as inevitably get sick or see that twister coming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under Western Skies. When bravery, toughness and grit made all the difference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
