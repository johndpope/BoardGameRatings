			<description>マモノレイド (Mamono Raid) is a party battle management game in which players control the attacks, healing, leveling-up, and item acquisition of their four-character parties as they battle the enemy Mamono. Each player begins with an identical party of a level-zero Warrior, Cleric, Sorceror, and Thief, but parties develop differently over time as players make skill- and item-purchasing decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players' parties work together to defeat the Mamono, a chimerical monster whose five-parted body changes randomly from game to game. Players compete, however, to obtain larger shares of the rewards for successfully destroying monster parts and, ultimately, more victory points then their fellow adventurers. Most games end with the Mamono's defeat, at which time the player with the most VPs wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player's party has a single hit point count, which is both the party's life and its available action points. Individual characters do not die, whole parties do, and incur a victory point penalty. Damage dealt to the party is based on hate markers, which accrue to players in proportion to their success against the monster. Dealing more damage to the Mamono will mean greater incoming damage to manage. Key to victory is handling increasing damage while defeating the monster to earn VPs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
