			<description>Bedlam is a card-shedding party game with ever-changing rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt a hand of cards at the beginning of the game and play same suit or number onto the discard pile if they can. However each player has their own rules card (e.g. When playing a red card, players must say 'better red than dead!') which they enforce by giving penalty cards to players who do not abide by them. There is also a shared rule card visible to all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get rid of all their cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
