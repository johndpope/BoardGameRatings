			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STAR SHIP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're sitting in your Star Ship cockpit. And your television screen is suddenly transformed into the window of your Star Ship. Steer the ship deep into space. A constant barrage of meteors whiz toward your window. Eerie Enemy Space Objects float from the darkest parts of space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your mission in space is to destroy Enemy Space Objects to score points. You are helpless against asteroids -- they can NOT be destroyed. Lose one point when an Enemy Space Object or asteroid crashes into your ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two-Player Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are sitting in your Star Ship cockpit. Use the right Joystick Controller to guide the Star Ship. The opponent uses the other Joystick Controller to steer the Space Module that appears through the Space Window.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Module Commander, you must avoid collisions and laser missiles from the Star Ship. The Module's main defense? The ability to become invisible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WARP DRIVE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are sitting in your cockpit watching space whiz by. Steer your ship past the indestructible asteroids. Your mission? To cover as much distance as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your space meter ticks away each parsec (a measure of space distance which equals 19.2 trillion miles) of distance in the upper right corner of the Space Window. You lose one parsec each time you collide with an asteroid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LUNAR LANDER&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've explored space.  Now your mission is to explore the moon. You control the Lunar Lander on the Space Window with your Controller Joystick. The game or another player controls the movement of the moon. Score one point for every successful landing your Lunar Lander makes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One-Player Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each one-player game lasts 2 minutes and 16 seconds. The computer controls the movement of the moon. You control the movement of the Lunar Lander. Score one point for every successful landing your Lander makes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two-Player Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control the Lunar Lander with the right Joystick. The other player controls the moon with the left Joystick. Only the Lunar Lander Commander can score one point for each successful moon landing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two-player games last 4 minutes and 32 seconds. After the first half of the game, the Lunar Lander changes from blue to orange, and the right Joystick controls the moon's movement; the left Joystick then controls the Lunar Lander. That way, both players have a chance to score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
