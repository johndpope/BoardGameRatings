							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Children of Zodiarcs</name>
									
			<description>The story of Children of Zodiarcs will take you through a tale of rebellion, familial bonds, and unexpected wonders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infiltrating the chambers of a decadent noble, Nahmi and her fellow thieves intend to steal a priceless relic. But what awaits them is more than anyone bargained for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relentlessly pursued by city guards heavily armed with deadly Zodiarc weapons, they are forced to make a desperate escape through gilded palace chambers, sun-drenched slums and dank underground catacombs. As they battle rival bandit gangs and even a clan of subterranean cannibals, it becomes clear that they have only each other to depend on. To emerge victorious, they will need to trust one another and use everything at their disposal, making choices that no one should have to make.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can a motley crew of outsiders survive this vicious world without sacrificing their own humanity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(from the official website)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
