							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Wanderer in the Forest of Wyr</name>
									
			<description>In Wyr you wander, searching for the spellshards of your magic which have become ravens. Will you recover all eight shards and win your way home or will you ever roam among the dark trees of Wyr?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A solitaire game using a one page board, 9 markers, 1 deck of playing cards and 1 six sided die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Win: You must free each of the 8 Ravens, reclaiming their spellshards of magic before the remaining ravens reduce your health to 0. &lt;br/&gt;Each Raven you free will allow you to draw a Recovered Spellshard card from its deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Play: Each round of the game has 3 phases which are played in cycles until all Ravens are freed or your health is lost:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 1. Raven Flight - Draw 1 card from the Raven Flight deck and discard it face up to the bottom of the game board. The card drawn equals the number of spaces 1 or more Ravens will fly (i.e. move) this turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 2. Raven Attack - Each Raven that ends its flight on a space your marker occupies will attack you in turn. For each Raven draw 1 Raven Strength card plus 1 additional card for each freed Raven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, play cards from your hand into a discard pile in front of you, adding the values of each card together for your defense strength. If your defense strength is greater than the Raven&amp;rsquo;s attack strength you have freed the Spellshard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 3. Wanderer Movement/Freeing -&lt;br/&gt;The cards in your hand are used both for defense and movement. Each card you play will go in a discard pile in front of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recovered Spellshards Deck -&lt;br/&gt;When Ravens are freed they become Spellshards you have recovered. You may use a Spellshard at any time during a round, playing them from your hand, but once a Spellshard is played it is removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is part of a series: The other two games are Seeker in the Forest of Wyr and Land of Enin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
