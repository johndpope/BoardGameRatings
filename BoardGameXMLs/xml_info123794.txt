			<description>Last Hope: Pink Bullets is a heavily revised version of the original Last Hope game released for the Sega Dreamcast and Neo Geo AES and CD. In response to criticism of the original game's extreme difficulty and hard to see bullets (and that the Neo Geo CD had easier to see pink enemy bullets), NG:DEV.TEAM released a revised version of the game that has the following features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six credits including an instant respawn instead of starting the level over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Higher player ship speed at the start of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The protection unit stays with the player ship throughout the game and can destroy enemies in this version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are now five difficulty settings and an overall lower difficulty level for the entire game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pink enemy bullets and altered stage colors for higher visibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VGA support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combo based scoring system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The addition of these features act to make the game much more accessible to non-diehard shmup players and for a rather different gameplay experience on the whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
