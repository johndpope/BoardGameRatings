							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oakhurst (System Neutral Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The village of Oakhurst squats deep in the gnarled boughs of the Tangled Woods. The Lonely Coast&amp;rsquo;s smallest and most isolated village, only the most daring or the most desperate call it home, surrounded as it is on all sides by  monstrous denizens and half-goblin tribes. Its dilapidated buildings sink into the squalor of the streets, presenting a loathsome and unwelcoming appearance. Oakhurst&amp;rsquo;s villagers are no better. Mostly trappers and hunters, the grim folk of Oakhurst distrust outsiders and keep to strange ways and customs. Visitors are strongly discouraged from overstaying their welcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet, Oakhurst&amp;rsquo;s darkest secret lies in a cave situated in a nearby cliff. On full moons, the villagers lock their doors and shutter their windows, pretending they do not hear the incessant flapping of wings in the sky overhead. Oakhurst&amp;rsquo;s oldest family, the Wearnes, long ago made a pact with a fell god, gaining the power of lycanthropy. Years of inbreeding to keep the line pure have driven the family of werebats to the brink of madness. High in the cave, the Wearnes participate in vile rites to their dark god, offering worship to one of its hideous servants. As the family slips further into insanity and their devotions more heinous, Oakhurst has become more dangerous for the unwary than it ever has before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
