							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ruined Tortoise Temple</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 48 x 30 inch, full color battlemap of a Ruined Tortoise Temple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions, the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT) and a 360 degree view from the centre of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;There are all these corpses with bite marks but I don&amp;rsquo;t see any predators&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Stranded Survivor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ruined Tortoise Temple is a single level exterior map of a ruined temple on a high cliff deep in the jungle with tortoise images embedded into columns, half of them toppled, and a giant tortoise statue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ruined Tortoise Temple is intended for fantasy, pulp, horror, modern, or post-apocalyptic games.  This could also be used as a location in a science fiction game. Perhaps this is on a planet with a sophont evolved from tortoises. A slow moving, long-lived, highly armored tortoise species with omnivorous tendencies perhaps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Secret of the Tortoise Temple:  The player characters are either stranded on an island after a ship crash or are exploring an island (for treasure or for survival reasons such as a need for food, fresh water, timber to repair their wounded ship, ship beached for careening and not much else to do, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually the group finds their way to the ruined tortoise temple. The group finds a lot of corpses with teeth marks as they explore near the temple. Many tortoises inhabit the island but there are no natural predators. As they approach, the tortoises which had held their distance get closer and closer. If the group enters the temple, they surround the giant center statue, trying to bar their way with a shield made of their armored bodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the group makes it past the tortoises on the outside, they find tortoises inside the shield wall perfectly willing to bite them to prevent them from reaching the statue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If anyone in the group reaches and touches the statue, the island shakes and sways and the tortoises simply stop fighting them, staring at the one who touched the statue blankly. The rumbling continues to intensify until the island itself seems to rise when a giant tortoise head comes into view staring blankly at the person touching the statue as well. The group is on an island formed on the back of a giant tortoise shell! The person who touched the giant tortoise statue can give orders to the tortoises, even the giant one. The tortoises tried to prevent this mind control from happening again and the awakening of the slumbering tortoise god.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player character can only maintain control as long as he or she is touching the statue. And everyone has to sleep eventually&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
