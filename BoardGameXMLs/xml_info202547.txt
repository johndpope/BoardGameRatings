			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I Was the Beginning. I Shall be the End.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thousands of years ago, a strange young man named Fitsum rose to power among the warriors of Kush. One of the first Metas of this world. He ate the flesh and blood of his enemies to gain their powers. Establishing himself as a god among men, his cult grew. They called him the Omega (PL 13), as he proved the end to many things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omega finally met his match in Princess Sthenia, who fought him to a standstill.The Cult of Omega locked him in stasis to heal. Here Omega remained until recently freed by the last member of his old cult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omega now seeks out the most powerful metas to assist him in reforging the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powered Legends. Because sometimes you a need a character everyone knows, even if they're meeting them for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
