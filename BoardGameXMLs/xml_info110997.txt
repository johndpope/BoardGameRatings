			<description>LightFish is a highly addictive arcade game, where the user controls a small fish who lives in the abyssal deeps of the ocean... surrounded by deadly creatures. His objective is to destroy all the monsters who inhabit those dangerous zones by drawing lines onto unexplored territory. However, any enemy who manages to touch the Lightfish will kill him instantly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LightFish is a classic concept evolved into something new and exciting, with unique features and an original soundtrack. Immerse yourself in a colourful world full of beautiful yet deadly sea creatures and progress through the numberous levels the game offers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is going to be released as a downloadable title in all major distribution platforms, starting with Steam (PC &amp;amp; Mac) on October the 19th. A Xbox Live Indie Games version will follow on October the 25th. Other platforms will follow later on this year most probably (iOS, Android, WP7). You'll hear more from us soon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
