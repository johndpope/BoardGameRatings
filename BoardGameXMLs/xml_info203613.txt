							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Token System</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by a group of players, who each take the role of a character, and a single game-manager, who presents scenarios, obstacles, and opponents for the players to interact with. Each character has a pool of resources, represented with tokens, which are used to determine the success and effects of actions taken throughout the game. These tokens represent an intrinsic quality; they cannot be traded between characters. The game-manager also has a pool of tokens to oppose the characters' attempted actions. The sizes of these token pools fluctuate during the course of the game, but return to their starting numbers at the start of each game-session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
