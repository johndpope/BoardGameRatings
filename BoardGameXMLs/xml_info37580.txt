			<description>From the box cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Cadbury's Milk Tray MAN IN BLACK Game - an exciting and sophisticated game of skill, nerve and strategy for 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players become the mysterious 'Man In Black' and:&lt;br/&gt;- encounter landslides, avalanches and floods!&lt;br/&gt;- block your opponents and deliver the box of Milk Tray&lt;br/&gt;- make incredible get-aways by car or helicopter&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was produced by Waddington's games in the UK as a promotional item for Cadbury's &amp;quot;Milk Tray&amp;quot; chocolates. The advertising campaign for Milk Tray featured arguably the most famous advertising character in British TV history, the Milk Tray Man, a pseudo James Bond character who performed several death defying feats in order to deliver a box of chocolates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game contents:&lt;br/&gt;- 1 plastic playing area, in two parts&lt;br/&gt;- 76 hexagonal route tiles&lt;br/&gt;- 4 &amp;quot;Men In Black&amp;quot; playing pieces&lt;br/&gt;- 4 helicopters&lt;br/&gt;- 4 getaway cars&lt;br/&gt;- 6 getaway route tiles (double sided)&lt;br/&gt;- 4 landslide markers&lt;br/&gt;- 4 tree markers&lt;br/&gt;- 1 &amp;quot;Man In Black&amp;quot; trump tile&lt;br/&gt;- 1 &amp;quot;Lady&amp;quot; tile&lt;br/&gt;- 1 &amp;quot;Start&amp;quot; tile&lt;br/&gt;- dice and shaker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is for each player to race their individual &amp;quot;Man In Black&amp;quot; piece from the Start hexagon tile, across the playing area, and to the Lady hexagon tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 5 route tiles, a &amp;quot;Man In Black&amp;quot; playing piece, a getaway car piece and a helicopter piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, each player has the choice of either placing a Route tile on the board, or throwing a dice to see how many squares they can move their piece along already placed Route tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each route tile features a different road segment marked with squares. Some squares feature hazards which delay the player. Route tiles can be placed in any position, at any time throughout the game, on each players turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The getaway car, helicopter, landslide and tree markers can be used to move the players piece further, or to obstruct other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components consist of quality heavy duty card tiles, a moulded plastic board, and hand painted pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is notable for being one of the earliest examples of a tile laying game, with each game producing a new road layout for players to travel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
