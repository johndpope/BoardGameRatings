			<description>Oktagrid is a game for up to four Wizards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was created by the Archmage Pedramor the Wise, trying to find a peaceful way to resolve magical duels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oktagrid is played on a octagonal chessboard.&lt;br/&gt;Every player controls a Wizard: moving it on outer part of the board, the miniature activates the magical Runes, which can create and move the Oktawoods, the enchanted pieces of this ancient game.&lt;br/&gt;The player that scores the higher number of Oktawoods, moving them to the center of the board, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has two set of rules, basic (suitable for children) and advanced, for more experienced players. &lt;br/&gt;The game is entirely language independent; all the pieces are made of wood, except the four miniatures of the Wizards, made in Kerasin-S and hand painted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
