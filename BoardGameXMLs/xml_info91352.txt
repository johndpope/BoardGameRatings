			<description>Each player has a deer which was bewitched - it has several pink spots and wants to get rid of them. The spots are chips placed on the deer &amp;quot;boards&amp;quot;. &lt;br/&gt;In the center of the table there is a spellbook which contains spell cards. The active player has to cast the spell on the top card. For this, she flips over one of the 13 tiles placed around the book. If the symbol under it matches that on the card, she can remove one of the spots on her deer. Some spells are variations of this basic mechanism. One spell type also brings a punishment if mistake is made - the deer of the erring player gets a new spot.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get rid of all the pink spots on her deer is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
