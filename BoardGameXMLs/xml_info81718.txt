You and your pilots possess the overwhelming firepower of the General Dynamics F-16 Falcon, but your enemies will counter your attack with a lethal lineup that includes Mirages, Hind helicopters, Su-25 &amp;amp; Su-27 fighter jets, plus a full series of Migs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fly Falcon 3.0 through three explosive campaigns in Panama, Kuwait and Israel or train for combat in the Saudi Arabian desert.
