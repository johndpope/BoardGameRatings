							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gaelic Games: Hurling</name>
									
			<description>Gaelic Games: Hurling was released as a separate game on November 17, 2007, but was also simultaneously released as part of the video game Gaelic Games: Football 2 on the same release date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first hurling game released where the player takes control in the game. It has been officially endorsed by the Gaelic Athletic Association but not by the Gaelic Players Association meaning the jerseys and stadiums would be a photo realistic but the player's names and faces would not be real. However, the names and appearances of the players can be changed in edit mode. M&amp;iacute;che&amp;aacute;l &amp;Oacute; Muircheartaigh provides commentary during the matches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Gaelic Games: Hurling&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
