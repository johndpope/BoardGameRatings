							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strange Voyages</name>
									
			<description>From the Kickstarter page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new Fate Core supplement from Occult Moon president Quinn Conklin. Created and co-written by Emlyn Freeman, co-written by Jennifer R. Povey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1575, in the reign of Elizabeth I. All of Europe is eager to find new lands, new sources of fame and wealth, and belief in myth and legend is still alive. STRANGE VOYAGES will tell the story of a grand ship and a crew gathered from the furthest reaches of known geography. Their travels take them to lands that no one has ever recorded: a sea made of gravel and sand; the mythical country of Faerie; the Cyclopes' caves; and even venturing into the land of dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mood of Strange Voyages is one of high adventure and exploration, a fusion of classical mythology, swashbuckling action, and Star Trek on the high seas. However, along with the explorations come dangers, primarily in conflict with the tyrannical kings of Atlantis, who have ruled over many hidden mythological lands for millennia. The ship itself is not free from conflict, as religions, cultures, and sexes clash at the rise of the modern age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strange Voyages is a setting for the award-winning Fate Core roleplaying game. Combined with a copy of Fate Core (available as a pay-what-you-like pdf from evilhat.com), it provides all the rules you&amp;rsquo;ll need to turn your Fate Core game into a swashbuckling adventure in the lands of legend. Additionally, it provides background information about the Renaissance world, its sailors and the many worlds of legend, as well as a toolbox that will allow you to make any kind of legendary adventure you can imagine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
