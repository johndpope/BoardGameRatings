			<description>A Werewolf/Mafia type game with a Christian theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Jerusalem the population, consisting of Israelites, Romans and characters from the Bible are trying to defend themselves against a group of fanatics trying to seize power.&lt;br/&gt;Each player is randomly and secretly assigned a role card. Players try to keep their identities secret, which leads to everyone becoming suspicious of being a fanatic. The population can only be kept safe if the fanatics can be found out and evicted from the city as soon as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in alternating rounds of night (when the fanatics decide on a victim to murder) and day (when court hearings and evictions take place). Each fraction (Israelites and Romans versus fanatics) tries to eliminate the other. Once all the night activities have taken place, the player whose character has been killed that night is eliminated from the game. The remaining players decide on a player they want to evict from the city. That player is eliminated from the game as well. The game is played until only one fraction is left, which then wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 32 cards. Among the role cards are characters from the Bible with special skills: Jesus can convert a fanatic if he identifies him/her correctly. Maria can protect a person against the fanatics. The necromancer can bring back a dead character by taking over his/her identity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
