							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ExteriorWorks: Swampwoods Village</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;West of the Hinterland lies a murky swamp where few dare go. Ancient totems stand as grim warnings to those who would trespass into this misty realm. Anyone foolish enough to proceed is likely to never be heard of again. It's said they disappear into the trees themselves...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exteriorworks: Swamp Woods Village contains everything you need to get down-n-dirty in the table-top mire! Stackable huts and independent bases give you the freedom to build what you want, how you want, from a simple ground based village to a massive city in the trees, all the way up to (and on to) the leafy canopy itself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perfect for forest Elves, woodland Goblins, the savage tribes of forgotten lands or cuddly clans of arboreal teddy bears! Mark your territory with spikey fences, impaled skulls, hanging cages or towering totems! Navigate through the muck past drooping swamp trees in bark canoes or just bang on the drum while the cauldron boils (I hear adventurers taste like chicken).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exteriorworks: Swamp Woods Village contains all of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* 10 swampy ground tiles (including Hinterlands river transition) in 1&amp;quot;, 1.5&amp;quot; and gridless formats&lt;br/&gt;    * 6&amp;quot; walkways with optional raillings in 1&amp;quot;, 1.5&amp;quot; and gridless formats 9&amp;quot; walkways with optional railings in 1&amp;quot;, 1.5&amp;quot; and gridless formats&lt;br/&gt;    * Ring walkways with railings in 1&amp;quot;, 1.5&amp;quot; and gridless formats&lt;br/&gt;    * 3&amp;quot; high intersections 1&amp;quot; and gridless formats&lt;br/&gt;    * 6&amp;quot; high intersections 1&amp;quot; and gridless formats&lt;br/&gt;    * Tree huts with optional ringed walkways in 1&amp;quot;, 1.5&amp;quot; and gridless formats&lt;br/&gt;    * Adaptable, removable hut roof&lt;br/&gt;    * 3&amp;quot; and 6&amp;quot; high trees with stacking option&lt;br/&gt;    * Tree bases (two types) in 1&amp;quot;, 1.5&amp;quot; and gridless formats&lt;br/&gt;    * Canopy platform with optional branches in 1&amp;quot;, 1.5&amp;quot; and gridless formats&lt;br/&gt;    * 2&amp;quot; and 3&amp;quot; high fences&lt;br/&gt;    * Totem poles&lt;br/&gt;    * Canoes&lt;br/&gt;    * Spear stands&lt;br/&gt;    * Skull spikes&lt;br/&gt;    * Wicker baskets (fish, apples, peppers and empty)&lt;br/&gt;    * Ceremonial drums&lt;br/&gt;    * Hanging cages (with and without occupant)&lt;br/&gt;    * Swamp tree (simple type)&lt;br/&gt;    * Ladders (with and without arms)&lt;br/&gt;    * 3D torches&lt;br/&gt;    * Stone oven with removable door&lt;br/&gt;    * Big, bubblin' cauldron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
