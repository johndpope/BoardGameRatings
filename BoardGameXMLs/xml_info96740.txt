			<description>game introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Adventures into the new world is a role-playing game where the characters are  explores of a new continent.  The players are from a 1700's style setting.  The characters  walk on a map made by the GR (game runner), and the GR tells them what they see in  words.  The characters name things and make maps, but the action comes mostly from  the players dealing with the inhabitants( who could be Indians, or oriental or anything).   The GR makes the whole thing before hand, and the players choose where to go and what  to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment:&lt;br/&gt;This game is available as a free download from 1km1kt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
