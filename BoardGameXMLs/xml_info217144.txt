							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen, Revised and Expanded</name>
									
			<description>From back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you keep up with Baron Munchausen&amp;rsquo;s extraordinary adventures as he travels to the Moon and the Sun, rides cannon-balls, defeats armies single-handed, meets the gods, and escapes from bandits on half a horse?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stories of the legendary nobleman come to life as players battle to outdo each other&amp;rsquo;s fantastic feats and amazing accomplishments. It&amp;rsquo;s a role-playing story-telling game of outrageous originality and swashbuckling exaggeration, stretching the bounds of truth until they twang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How is this possible? If Baron Munchausen is involved, anything is possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen contains full rules, more than two hundred adventures ready to be played, mechanics that replace dice and pencils with money and fine wine, and many insults against the inhabitants of various nations, but principally the French.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expanded edition is a facsimile of a suppressed volume originally released in 1808. It contains additional rules for playing in an Arabian style and a complete supplementary game, &amp;lsquo;My Uncle the Baron&amp;rsquo;, designed for children, the inbred and those who are very drunk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
