			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The awesome eldritch energies harnessed by those who can summon allies from thin air should never be used for deeds as frivolous dungeon-crawling expeditions unless there is the promise of really good loot. Dungeon Fantasy 9: Summoners details the amazing abilities of those who can bring powerful beings into the world. Anyone who seeks to tap the natural and unnatural realms in a Dungeon Fantasy game will find much to covet herein:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Four new templates for those more than able to delve into dungeons: the demonologist, the elementalist, the necromancer, and the shaman.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Detailed stats for spirits and servitors that can be brought forth: ghosts, guardians, undead, elementals, angels, demons, and more 18 in all.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Dozens of lenses and customization notes for most of these otherworldly allies. Learn how the &amp;quot;Lord of the Tides&amp;quot; differs from a regular water elemental!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Detailed campaign advice and adventuring ideas that help the GM fully incorporate summoners into the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;New rules that better reflect the power and peril of summoning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These fundamental forces of the universe are waiting to be commanded by anyone willing and able to seize them. But be careful: With Dungeon Fantasy 9: Summoners, the difference between life and death could be in keeping good spirits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
