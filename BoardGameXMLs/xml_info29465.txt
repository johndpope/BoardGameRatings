			<description>Betsy Ross and the Flag is a game from Transogram that is advertized on its cover as a &amp;quot;Thrilling Historical Game&amp;quot; and as being part of the Landmark Games Series. Ages 9 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is Betsy Ross carrying a sewing basket with which to &amp;quot;sew&amp;quot; the original flag. Players obtain 13 flag pieces by visiting the Town Hall in each of the 13 Colonial States. When the flag is completed, the player races to deliver it to the Flag Committee. The first player to enter the blue circle and greet the Flag Committee with a completed flag wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
