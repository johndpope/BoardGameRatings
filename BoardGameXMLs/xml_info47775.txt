							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Supporting Cast: The Daily Standard</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with any roleplaying game, the players&amp;rsquo; characters are the center of attention. It is a trapping of the genres that roleplaying games emulate, stretching back to the most basic myths and legends. Though the heroes remain the focus of the stories told in comic books, the ancillary characters, the supporting cast, are often just as important and iconic as the heroes themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether it is a hero&amp;rsquo;s trusted butler, love interest, or professional rival, these supporting characters serve as an important part of the hero&amp;rsquo;s mythology. They become part of the fabric of the hero&amp;rsquo;s life and the dual nature of any costumed crimefighter serves to complicate those relationships. An employer in the hero&amp;rsquo;s civilian life might also serve as a powerful antagonist to that same hero&amp;rsquo;s costumed identity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Supporting Cast series of short supplements from Big Finger Games provides a plug-and-play solution to a hero&amp;rsquo;s need for dramatic resonance with the incidental characters he or she deals with on a daily basis. The supporting characters contained within can be plugged into a new hero&amp;rsquo;s background or be introduced into an existing campaign. They provide a useful story base and infrastructure and can be used to flesh out a setting even if they aren&amp;rsquo;t directly tied to any of the heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supporting Cast: The Daily Standard details a major metropolitan newspaper and its staff. Included are backgrounds and stats for three of the major characters at the Standard, brief write-ups for five other staff members, a Heroic Reporter template, eight adventure hooks, and ideas for incorporating the Daily Standard into your campaign and using it as a springboard for drama and adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
