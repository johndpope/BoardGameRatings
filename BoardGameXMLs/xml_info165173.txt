			<description>BACKGROUND: Blades of Honor is an adventure game for 1-4 Players, where the players assume the roles of young Samurai in Late Medieval Japan (1450-1600). Each Player creates a Samurai Character in the service of a minor Lord called a Hatamoto. As a loyal retainer, the Player-Samurai must complete various assignments for his Hatamoto such as escorting envoys, participating in Battles, dueling rival Samurai, framing rival Hatamoto, and assassinations. As your Samurai gains experience and renown they can improve their attributes and eventually prove their worth in order to one day, become a Hatamoto himself and possibly the Provincial Lord or Daimyo!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OBJECTIVE: The Objective of each Player-Samurai is to become the Daimyo of his Province. In order to become a Daimyo, the Player-Samurai must accomplish the following:&lt;br/&gt;1. Samurai must complete Assignments to earn enough Renown Points to be selected as Hatamoto during the Dynasty Phase of the Player Turn.&lt;br/&gt;2. Once he is a Hatamoto, the Player Samurai must earn enough Renown Points to be selected as Daimyo during the Dynasty Phase or after all Rival Hatamoto have been conquered or eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME FEATURES: Blades of Honor features a flavorful Large-Hex Map with Villages, Castles, Mountains, Paddies, Forests and Rivers. Also, there are many, many colorful counters of Samurai, Ronin, Bandits, Bushi Warriors, Monks, and various mythologcal creatures and monsters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is basically a Role-Playing Boardgame of Epic Adventure. If you are a fan of Samurai movies and legends, then this is the game for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
