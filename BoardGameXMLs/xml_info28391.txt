			<description>The Dolphin Training Game... The title says it all.&lt;br/&gt;Teach your dolphins many tricks like a Tail-walk or a goodbye wave and become the best dolphin-trainer of the bunch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on and uses actual dolphin names from the Dolphin Academy in Curacao. The game is actually a trivia game for the most part with over 200 cards with questions and assignments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action takes place on a board representing the island of Curacao, home base of the Academy, and features several basins where you can teach your dolphins new tricks and collect fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a little extra for (beginner) puzzle fans: The board is divided in 13 pieces, with a large dolphin-picture on the back, making the game also usable as an old fashioned puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
