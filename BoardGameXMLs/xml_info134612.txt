			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to ION Guard, the first issue of ION Space, a series of licensed supplements for BASH! Ultimate Edition by Basic Action Games!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intergalactic Ordinance Network (ION) Guard is a heroic peacekeeping organization that has served to protect and defend the intelligent species of the many sectors of the Universe for the last billion years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Guardsman - wearing the iconic golden ION Fist that has become synonymous with justice for many intergalactic inhabitants - is a cosmic powerhouse, capable of bringing the vast forces of an artificially harnessed singularity to bear against the enemies of peace, justice, and life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the Universe they strive against evil and darkness. Though powerful, they are spread all too thin: they are but small lights, beacons of hope in the vast darkness enfolding the stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ION Space will introduce alien species and empires, interplanetary organizations, and galactic empires, and cosmic threats. Each ION Space issue may be slotted into your existing BASH! campaign individually, or woven together to provide a vast and expanding outer space setting for your heroes to explore...and defend!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
