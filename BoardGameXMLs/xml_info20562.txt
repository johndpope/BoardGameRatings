			<description>Robinson &amp;amp; Freitag (Robinson &amp;amp; Friday) is a bluffing, bidding and building game by Michael Palm. As Robinson, landing on an isolated island, the players try to collect materials to build various things on their islands. Eventually, events such as wild animals, droughts, tidal waves (even Robinson had to deal with natural disasters) occur. The player who is best prepared for these events is ahead, and when Friday comes for the second time the day of departure for the player with the biggest raft is nigh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
