			<description>An innovative deck-building cider production game where players race to produce the most money from their deck-building exploits efficiently converting apples and wood into cider and barrels, all the time ensuring they don't over-stockpile and lose the actions they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays differently to most deck-building games in two key ways. Firstly, cards in a players also serve as the resources that can be produced (Wood, Apples, Barrels and Cider) secondly, cards can be kept active drawing fewer cards each turn. Each turn, a player draws up to 5 cards, including the up to 3 currently active cards. After activating 3 cards the player chooses to discard just the remaining two cards in their hand or to discard active workers who have completed their tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will strive to efficiently produce cider in bottles or more valuable cider in barrels and sell it as efficiently as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
