			<description>The hunt for green January&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction of the book:&lt;br/&gt;Since the day the world ended, maybe the multiverse hasn't finished with you. Some of you claim to know, but who's to say, really? Whatever the case, as the cold closed in, each of you reached out, from some resource you never knew you had, for any way to go on.&lt;br/&gt;Your world died, but you coursed elsewhere, scattered around a happy and unsuspecting new variant with different lives and different names. Over the years, you found each other, those who wanted to be found, and another thing: a purpose.&lt;br/&gt;Players take the roles of refugees from a destroyed universe - not destroyed by accident: they've come to realise that the consumption of their world and countless others fueled the establishment of a far distant utopia, a place of endless spring and the best of good fortune. What the players choose to do in this green January, if they ever find it, is up to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
