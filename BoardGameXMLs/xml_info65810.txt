							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sisyphos</name>
									
			<description>Two player game in which one player plays Sisyphos and tries to roll stones into the other player's corner, while the other player plays the mountain spirits that try to prevent Sisyphos from achieving his goal.&lt;br/&gt;Movement is limited to moving one square ahead in one of three directions. When a piece lands on an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is temporarily out of the game, but can later re-enter in the corner square, or near it.&lt;br/&gt;The spirits win when one of them reaches the opposing corner square, or if Sisyphos cannot move one of his stones into their corner within 50 turns. If Sisyphos manages in time, he is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
