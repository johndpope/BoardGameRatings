			<description>Deft-initions&amp;trade; is the great, new, anytime anywhere word-guessing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the fact that many English words have disparate, widely distinct definitions &amp;mdash; all of which are correct!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of 300 cards has a word to be guessed, and eight different definitions/clues &amp;mdash; all of which are accurate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A reader selects a clue, reads it out loud, and the other players shout out what they think the word to be guessed is. Each of the different clues is read until someone guesses the word, or the reader stumps them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created to be played by people with a 12 year old's vocabulary level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think you know what words mean?&lt;br/&gt;Try to guess what common word the eight definitions/clues below refer to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* A small mistake&lt;br/&gt;    * A piece of paper used as a record&lt;br/&gt;    * A part of a plant used for grafting&lt;br/&gt;    * A place for a ship&lt;br/&gt;    * To slide suddenly and lose one's balance&lt;br/&gt;    * You don't want to get a pink one&lt;br/&gt;    * Of the tongue &amp;bull; one's mind &amp;bull; through one's fingers&lt;br/&gt;    * Rhymes with flip&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Right! The answer is &amp;quot;slip&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Play&lt;br/&gt;A reader selects five clues from the eight shown (at least one must be a red clue) and reads them aloud, one at a time. The other players shout out their guesses. The correct guesser earns points depending on which clue he/she solves. Clues separated by dots indicate phrases or sayings that use the mystery word. An optional roll of the die can add a bonus or a penalty to a score depending on a player&amp;rsquo;s luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Publisher (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.lexogon.com/deftinitions.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.lexogon.com/deftinitions.html&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
