			<description>Stabil-IT (pronounced &amp;quot;stability&amp;quot;) is an IT themed management game where the players aim to generate the most business value. &lt;br/&gt;All players work off two central boards, one featuring the Stabil-IT matrix and the other having the resource roundel. The resource roundel is used to control the availability of resources to the players and also to establish which player is in control of the game at any given time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is managing two IT services, where each service relies upon one application and several technical services (represented in the Stabil-IT matrix).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the course of six rounds, each player performs actions to improve the confidence in their IT services and to life-cycle them to an updated version. Each action takes one or more resources which can be technical specialists, application specialists or analysts/test specialist.&lt;br/&gt;At certain points in the game, stress tests are carried out to find the weakest point in the matrix which leads to a loss of confidence at that point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some actions may result in knowledge being gained which can, in turn, be used to reduce the resource used from the roundel or to give business value at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
