			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A still-screen shoot-em-up where the player controls one horizontally moving craft (on the bottom of the screen), and one vertically moving craft (on the right side). The player must shoot down the enemies on the screen, while not shooting down the baby sheep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally released in 2011, the game saw an enhanced re-release in 2013, with &amp;quot;new graphics, an updated loading bitmap and enhanced gameplay.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;A nightmare has just begun!  The Neon Vortex is under attack from strange and bizarre psychedelic experiences from outer space!  We have transported two micro sheep to fight against the Neon Vortex invaders.  Your sheep are also armed with a deadly SMART BOMB that will destroy everthing on the screen.  Use these wisely as your sheep can only carry one smart bomb per level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits&lt;br/&gt;Richard Bayliss: Programming, gfx, music, sounds&lt;br/&gt;Trevor Storey: Graphics (DX)&lt;br/&gt;Jon Wells: Multi-Screen Construction Kit Library Source&lt;br/&gt;Achim Volkers: Additional Support&lt;br/&gt;Georg 'Endurion' Rottensteiner: Additional support (DX)&lt;br/&gt;Steve Day: Loading screen (DX)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
