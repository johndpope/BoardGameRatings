			<description>&amp;quot;Firestorm Campaign - Operation Bagration, Russian Front&amp;quot; gives you the tools to recreate the 1944 Soviet offensive in Byelorussia. On 22 June, more than 2,000,000 Soviet soldiers stormed the heavily fortified lines of the badly outnumbered German Army Group Centre. The German defences quickly crumbled under several sledgehammer blows. German armoured reserves rushed forward, desperately counterattacking to stem the on-rushing Red tide in the climactic Battle of Minsk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Firestorm Campaign&lt;br/&gt;In Firestorm&amp;mdash;Bagration, you command the Soviet or German forces fighting for Byelorussia in the critical months of June and July 1944. &lt;br/&gt;Put yourself in command on the Eastern Front using your Flames Of War historical miniatures on the table&amp;shy;top. Each battle recreates a major engagement. The outcomes of your battles determine the fate of the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The General&amp;rsquo;s Wargame&lt;br/&gt;The General&amp;rsquo;s Wargame is a fast-paced two-player Board game based on Firestorm&amp;mdash;Bagration that uses all the contents of the box and takes 60 to 90 minutes to play. Can be used stand alone or with your FOW campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Total War&lt;br/&gt;Total War is designed to put big armies on big tables. Instead of a mere company, you can field your entire collection with thousands of points of Flames Of War troops arrayed across a large battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partisans &amp;amp; Polizei&lt;br/&gt;While the generals plan their campaigns, more personal battles are being fought. Vasiliy Kravchenko, a partisan leader, and his Polizei nemesis Dieter von Gaudron wage their own war in the fields and forests of Byelorussia. This presents a small-scale skirmish game for use with your FOW figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;River Crossings &amp;amp; No Retreat&lt;br/&gt;Also included are new rules for crossing rivers, common yet formidable obstacles in Byelorussia. Use these rules to succeed in the new River Crossing Mission and the Crossing the Drut scenario, both found within. Then try holding the line in a second new mission, No Retreat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you can already get some sense this is something never done before and we are excited about what this could mean for the future.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
