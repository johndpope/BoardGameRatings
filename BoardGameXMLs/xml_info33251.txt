			<description>Each player controls six cone-shaped &amp;quot;tops&amp;quot;.  During their turn, players roll two six-sided dice and move one of their tops around the board forward or backward.  The object of the game is to capture all of your opponent's tops by landing on them before your opponents do.  Before the captures are complete, you can unload your captors into your home space.  The rules permit some areas on the board designated as safe zones and the option to trade captors with another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
