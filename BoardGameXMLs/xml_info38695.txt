							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Speedway: World championship formula</name>
									
			<description>This title is presumably from the early 1970's. &lt;br/&gt;Production number 15504.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box cover shows a drawing and signature of Ole Olesen, the Danish world champion in speedway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has borrowed the player pieces from the Swedish Tuppa Speedway, but the actual gameplay and board is very different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has depicted a 4 lane track in an oval form (as is the case in speedway) which are again divided into squares. Some of the squares are coloured in one of 6 colours - and the colours determine what happens if you land on them. One game lasts for 4 rounds, as in real speedway, but there are additional/optional rules for both team and league play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
