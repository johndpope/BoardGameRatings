			<description>Keltis Oracle is the visually appealing sequel to the famous Keltis board game (closely related to Lost Cities: the board game), winner of the Game of the Year 2008! Between 1 and 4 players on the same iPad (or with computer opponents) can play this exciting new board game from one of the world's leading board game developers, Dr. Reiner Knizia. A well balanced mix of strategy and luck, it takes about 30 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Keltis Oracle, you guide your pieces into a spiral of stones, collecting rewards on the way, such as wishing stones and mirrors. Movement is allowed only by creating sequences of specific coloured cards. The stones in the spiral have special effects which enhance the strategical thinking required even further.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Together all these features make an exciting game for everybody!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
