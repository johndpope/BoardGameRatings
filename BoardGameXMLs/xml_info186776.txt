			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is based loosely on Shakespeare's Romeo &amp;amp; Juliet, a lighthearted tragedy, if such is possible, and a good setting for an adventure of this period in which many of the characters should be familiar, though some names and situations have been altered to freshen up the material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The background plot of the action is that of the play, broken down by the days on which the various major actions take place. The position of the characters in this is somewhat variable. The best option is to make them men associated with either the Capuletti or Montago faction, travelling through a number of the notable scenes and events as they happen. Alternatively they could actually assume the roles of the major characters, though that might cause some players to suffer from limiting preconceptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
