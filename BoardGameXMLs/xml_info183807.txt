			<description>Mech Defense  is a cooperative, tower defense inspired, strategy game where a group of 4 players pilot 20ft Mechs and rain down destruction on their foes.  Your squad fends off wave after wave of incoming enemies over 12 missions and permanently alter your battlefield with every decision and explosive attack.  The more you destroy, the more you get paid, but the stronger your foes become.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a Legacy game, with over 20 sticker sheets included in the box, players will permanently upgrade enemies and modify the map with every mission you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes a native application for Windows, iOS, Android, and Windows Phone to help manage progress between missions.  For people who prefer not to have the digital component, players can use a printable sheet to track progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
