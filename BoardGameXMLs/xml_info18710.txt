							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Piquet: Point of Attack II â€“ The Blitzkrieg</name>
									
			<description>The Blitzkrieg is unique in the Piquet system in that it has three different game scales included.  The different game scales allow for a wide variety of scenarios, game sizes, and game types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game Scale Rules section includes unique rules for each of the three scale games included in the The Blitzkrieg game supplement (Squad, Platoon, and Battalion).  Each game scale has its own Weapon Adjustment Table, game play reference sheet, quick rating BDV Tables, and organizational information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This allows a gamers to play everything from a vicious, house-to-house skirmish combat to a multi-division, multi-day battle on the plains of Russia.  The movement, combat, and morale sections of the rules were deliberately developed to fit the &amp;quot;zoom&amp;quot; concept mentioned in the original Piquet rules.  By using a few unique rules, and different troop ratings, a gamer can easily move between the three scales.  The basic rule mechanics are the same, only the details change.  The Squad scale game is new with this version of the rules.  It allows for large skirmish actions, instead of the small, highly individually personalized game typical of skirmish rules.  The Squad game allows skirmish detail in games with a platoon or more of infantry on a side.   The detail players enjoy in skirmish games is still there, but it is imbedded in the game system.  As an example, it would be very easy to just add rules to the basic rule skeleton to handle unique cases.  Consider armor in a skirmish game.   Obviously, there is a difference in the combat readiness of a tank that is buttoned up compared to one which is just moving down a road.  The Squad game easily handles this difference by requiring that vehicles be in a declared status - either march or deployed.  March status indicates a tank or vehicle that is not combat ready, but is primarily intent on moving rapidly.  Deployed status indicates a tank or vehicles that is tactically aware prepared for the uncertainties of the battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Piquet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
