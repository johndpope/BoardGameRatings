			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complete Golden Age Oddballs spotlights obscure characters from the Golden Age of comic books, in many cases collecting the stories in one place for the first time ever. Each issue in the series contain every single appearance of one or more quirky heroes from the founding years of the comic book genre, along with all-new roleplaying game content and an occassional bit of fiction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this volume, we spotlight Kismet, a WW2 Nazi-buster who has the distinction of being the first Muslim superhero; and teenaged detective Penny Parker. In addition to every single Golden Age appearance of both characters, this book contains brief publication histories for each; an overview of how they are being incorporated into NUELOW Games' emerging comic book universe (which will also be featured in Lester Smith's CORE Roleplaying Game); and material for use with ROLF!: The Rollplaying Game. (There's also a bonus expansion to the OGL Modern superhero rules first published in Madden's Boys.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an extra special treat, the book also contains two puzzle games by engineer Stephen M. Elonka.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
