			<description>This Canadian cycling game is about a race in a city (a criterium). The board measures 64x48cm., there are 18 cyclists, 2 dice, 40 lap winner cards, 40 booster cards and 32 chance cards in the game. The mechanism is not difficult. The criterium goes over a number of laps that is agreed between the players (this determines the length of the game). One the map there is a track that gives the players multiple choice to determine the circuit. A number of spaces on the track are colored yellow and blue. When a cyclist is on a yellow space he receives a power card (also when he finishes a lap and starts a new lap), on the blue spaces a player has to draw a chance card. It is also possible that a cyclists takes a wrong route (this can happen with a chance card). There are also spaces that contain a text (for example 'flat tyre'). Winner is the player who's cyclist covers first the total distance of the criterium. With the dice and the card drawing this Canadian game has a high luck factor but the cyclist lover will certainly enjoy it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
