			<description>Say Cheese is a multiplication board game for students of grade 1 and up. It is designed to get them 14 times more multiplication practice than classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns pulling a number out of a bag and places it in the play arena. The next player takes another number, checks to see if it is multiple of four (say &amp;quot;Cheese&amp;quot; if it is) and recites its multiplication fact. If correct, they receive all the tokens in play and puts them in their bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when one person has no more tokens and the person with the most wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
