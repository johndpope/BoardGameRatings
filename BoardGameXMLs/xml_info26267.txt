							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bug Collector Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This game for ages 4 and up has two sets of cards. One contains the characters from the Pixar movie &amp;quot;A Bug's Life&amp;quot;, the other is a series of jungle scenes with the characters hidden in them. The jungle scenes are spread out on the table and the character cards are in a deck. As the cards are drawn from the deck you have to find which jungle card contains the character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also two bird cards which return some bug cards from your collection to the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
