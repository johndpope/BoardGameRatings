			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Babe! It&amp;rsquo;s me, Marty! Have I got a deal for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, no, nothing like that...it&amp;rsquo;s a book deal. Yeah, a real book. It&amp;rsquo;s loaded with stuff that you can&amp;rsquo;t live without!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like what? Let me tell ya babe, this is the real deal. It&amp;rsquo;s got tons of rules. The stuff that you need to make your game the best it can be. Like new rules for Fame that lets you become a legend of The Games, and even spend Fame points to get you some special perks. It&amp;rsquo;s also loaded with guides for sponsorship and endorsements, as well as dealing with the life of the celebrity-which can be a real bear. But I don&amp;rsquo;t have to tell you about that, huh? It even has those hanger-on types like paparazzi, fans, and even groupies written up. Oh, and don&amp;rsquo;t forget all the info on managers and agents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yeah, yeah, it has all those things that you come to expect from a book like this, like new feats, new items and equipment-including some really clever magic items-and even those prestige classes. But let&amp;rsquo;s get right to the heart of the matter, okay?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xcrawl is a sport, right? And what&amp;rsquo;s a sport without statistics? That&amp;rsquo;s right! So, this is the book that tells you how to keep stats in a crawl, so that you know how good you are against left-handed wizards on a Tuesday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, and by the executive decree of Emperor Ronald himself, this book has the complete rules for Xcrawl, all the way from the little kids in Action League to the dead-man-walking running through Unlimited Class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And one more thing: you know what they say, right? If you die, you die. And this is the book that explains it in detail!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, you in? Yeah...I thought you would be...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
