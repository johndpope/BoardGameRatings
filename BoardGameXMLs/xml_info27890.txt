			<description>World War II FlipQuest game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From official website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The briefing room suddenly becomes quiet as the Colonel walks up to the podium. &amp;quot;Men, we have just deciphered a message from the German High Command to the German Commander in the French town of Nancy. A Company of Special Troops will be arriving with a large shipment of Nazi gold coins. It is their job to hide and guard the gold. To ensure the loyalty of the troops, they are to be paid with that gold.&amp;quot; The Colonel stops reading and looks our way. &amp;quot;It seems the Nazis know the war is going badly, and that their Marks will soon be worthless. Your mission will be to relieve the Nazis of as much gold as possible. Unfortunately you will be parachuting into an area that makes extraction quite impossible. You should use whatever resources you have or can find to continue your mission. You may use the gold coins to buy supplies, as long as you keep it from the Nazis. We have contacts in the French Resistance, and that will be how we communicate future missions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;And So It Begins.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www3.sympatico.ca/shadowcraft/Flipww2.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www3.sympatico.ca/shadowcraft/Flipww2.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
