			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Yellow King Roleplaying Game, players take on the roles of young artists studying abroad in Paris in 1895, as the publication of a mysterious verse drama begins to overwrite their adopted city with the supernatural reality of an alien world called Carcosa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And they play European soldiers fighting in the murky War of Reclamation, who come to realize that their endless, inexplicable struggle occurs at the behest of Carcosa&amp;rsquo;s Yellow King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And they play former resistance fighters in the present day, after the overthrow of the tyrannical Castaigne regime, which has held America in its icy grip since the 1920s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And finally they also play contemporary people in the world as we mostly know it - but what is that strange masked creature lurking behind that dumpster over there?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something links these characters across time and alternate realities - a grim destiny that may enable them to unravel the schemes of Carcosa, returning the world to what it was, for good or ill, meant to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Yellow King Roleplaying Game (or YKRPG when only an acronym will do) can be played using this overarching, interwoven structure, or in a simpler, episodic mode featuring shorter incidents of subjective reality horror in any one of its four settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the game, you need this book, which includes both the rules and the central Belle &amp;Eacute;poque Paris setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
