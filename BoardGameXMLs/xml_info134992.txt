							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Logoross: Broken World</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CREWMAN&amp;rsquo;S LOG; AUGUST 4TH, 2846; 1714 HOURS SHIP STANDARD TIME:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Logoross was a colony ship. I say &amp;ldquo;was&amp;rdquo; because she&amp;rsquo;s not much of anything right now. We were on our way to Upsilon Andromedae c to be the pioneers of a new homeworld when something happened. As of this moment, we don&amp;rsquo;t know what it was.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We know that the first cascading power failure shut down most systems, and emergency, automated protocols went into effect to restore key systems. It was the second cascade that caused the most problems. While the first failure might be attributed to an energy burst from any number of expected stellar phenomena, the second was the result of structural damage &amp;ndash; an impact of some kind for which the automated protocols couldn&amp;rsquo;t compensate. That&amp;rsquo;s where it all began.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
