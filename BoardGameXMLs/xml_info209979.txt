			<description>From the &amp;quot;Publisher&amp;quot;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Getting into the Living City is hard. Getting out is harder. Some will go to any lengths for a chance to have their wish granted in the City of Djinn...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Scroll-Keeper and the Djinn bound to her bloodline are racing to escape before anyone notices the epoch map leading to the legendary City of Djinn is missing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Undertaker had no choice after her magickal talent was exposed and she couldn't exactly leave without the Corpse she brought back to (sort of) life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a monstrous curse looming over him, the Assassin has enough to worry about without getting stuck with the target he refused to kill. Unfortunately, that's exactly what happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now crouched together in a hidden passage beneath a smuggler safehouse with automatons of the Brass Forces banging on the door above, it is only a matter of time before they break in and the search for your hiding place begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Getting out of the living city is hard. Surviving the shifting sands, forbidden magicks, exhumed lords, and ancient automatons to find the fabled City of Djinn is harder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
