			<description>Source is rules found on pgs 17-17 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://files.boardgamegeek.com/file/download/4obzn970uj/HistoricalChessVariants.pdf?&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this document&lt;/a&gt; by Nader Daoud Daou (2007).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this is the game from which modern Shogi is believed to have directly derived, the game are distinctly different if the following respects. Sho shogi has no drop mechanism. All pieces used in modern shogi are used in sho shogi and have the same movements and initial positions, but sho shogi also has one additional piece with respect to the modern game-- the drunken elephant which promotes to a crown prince and begins the game directly in front of the &amp;quot;king&amp;quot; (osho or gyokusho). The drunken elephant moves one space in any direction except directly backwards, and the crown prince moves exactly like a king because it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a second king. Namely both the crown prince and the king must be bared, checkmated and/or stalemated simultaneously to win. Baring counting as a draw only if one's own king can be bared the next move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
