							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cosmic Cruiser</name>
									
			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A raiding party from the Rallom Empire has taken over one of Earth's far flung space stations.&lt;br/&gt;The only Earth craft in the vicinity is an out dated Cosmic Cruiser ... and you are the pilot.&lt;br/&gt;A priority signal sends you on what could turn out to be a suicidal mission.&lt;br/&gt;You have been ordered to save the space station crew at all costs. As you hurtle toward your destiny, a daring plan forms in your mind. The only chance you have is to use your exterior laser cannon to blast open the station portals, then by making use of your body propulsion unit you will have to pluck the crewmen form the station and transport them back to your Cruiser. Your plan requires split-second timing and nerves of steel. As you transport your ward back to the Cruiser you must make snap decisions, if you use your hand laser the blast will blow the crewman into space, can you get back to your laser cannon on time to blast the Rallom fighters or will you have to secure the rescued crewman to a nearby satellite to allow you to move more quickly.&lt;br/&gt;You see the space station in the distance, the adrenalin pumps through your body ... will you succeed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
