			<description>&amp;quot;Known in Japan as Dragon Ball: Shenlong no Nazo (ドラゴンボール 神龍の謎 Doragon Bōru: Shenron no Nazo, Riddle of Shenlong), Dragon Power developed by TOSE Software Company and released by Bandai in 1986. The game stars Son Goku and very roughly follows the first two volumes of the Dragon Ball manga, culminating in the first wish from Shenlong. The game consists of 2D overhead areas where Goku must fight many enemies and side scrolling sequences for the boss fights. It was added as bonus feature in the Japanese release of Dragon Ball: Origins 2 in 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the Japanese and European editions of the game used the familiar art and music from the Dragon Ball anime, the US version is stated to be based on Journey to the West with no mention of Dragon Ball. Goku was changed to more closely resemble an Americanized Kung Fu stereotype, being pictured on the box with a white gi and blue headband. Master Roshi has been similarly changed to look more like a traditional martial arts master. Bulma is called &amp;quot;Nora&amp;quot;, Yamcha is called &amp;quot;Lancer&amp;quot;, Oolong is called &amp;quot;Pudgy&amp;quot;, the Kamehameha is the &amp;quot;Wind Wave&amp;quot;, and the Dragon Balls are referred to as &amp;quot;Crystalballs&amp;quot;. The European version, simply titled Dragon Ball, retains the license.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;List of Dragon Ball video games,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
