			<description>The players have to get from the starting space on the main track around the board till they reach the starting space again. At some points they have to leave the main track and use the side trails. If a player reaches a numbered space he has to answer a question. If he gives a wrong answer, he has to go back to the last red space and use the next available side trail. If he gives a wrong answer on a side trail, he has to wait a turn before he may move again. When a player gets on an occupied space, he kicks the other player back to the last red space. The first player who is back at the starting space wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was published in the early 1970s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
