							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ATS: Leatherneck I</name>
									
			<description>The first in a three module suite for use with the Advanced Tobruk System, depicting small-unit actions in the Pacific Theater during WWII.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leatherneck I contains three 11 x 16&amp;quot; non-historic geomorphic maps as well as two new map overlays.  All of the combat and special counters needed for play are included (one is expected to already have ATS system markers) on five half-sized countersheets.  Finally, there are eight new scenarios, all of which employ the provided maps and counters, as well as two sheets of AFV Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamers must also own the ATS System Rules and playaids to make use of these products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
