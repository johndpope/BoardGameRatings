			<description>The stars have not been seen in the night sky for some time. Hereupon brave explorers sought the stars disappeared. You need to compete with other explorers and seek more constellations than them. Let&amp;rsquo;s go to seek quickly~ But, be careful not to collide with other spaceships!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Goal]&lt;br/&gt;Gather as many constellation cards as you can. The player who gets highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Game Play]&lt;br/&gt;ASRUS: Zodiac is a &amp;lsquo;simultaneous action&amp;rsquo; game, so there is no order to play. In each turn, every players play a card from hands. You should play face down not to show to others. After all players have played, open the cards at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;1. Make the closest distance!&lt;br/&gt;Only one player can get stars(cards = points). For this, you need to approach to the destination as close as possible. Basically who makes the closest distance will get stars - &amp;lsquo;Distance&amp;rsquo; means the&lt;br/&gt;gap(absolute value) between the number of your card and the destination.&lt;br/&gt;2. Avoid collisions!&lt;br/&gt;But notice, you should avoid the collision with other spaceships! Even though the closest distance, if several players have made same distances, they all collide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Game Ends &amp;amp; Scoring]&lt;br/&gt;After several turns, when you used up all cards in hands, the game ends. Scoring is as below, and the player who gets highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;1. 1 point per a constellation card you acquired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;+  1 bonus point per a set of 4 colors (red, blue, green, and brown)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. 2 points to the player who has the most energy (if tie, 1 point to each.)&lt;br/&gt;3. Bonus points to the player who has the great explorer prize&lt;br/&gt;But! The player whose spaceship has no energy cannot return from the exploration. 0 points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    This game is second edition of ASRUS, it has the same basic system with ASRUS but there are spaceships and no glass stones - a little more strategic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
