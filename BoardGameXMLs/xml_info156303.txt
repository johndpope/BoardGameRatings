			<description>Welcome to Monster Hero Academy! In this 30-minute game for 2-6 players, you and your friends play as academy teachers. You will select the best student to partake in a major test every season and gain reputation as they excel in it. Gain the most reputation by the end of the year, and you'll be crowned the Teacher of the Year!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster Hero Academy features a drafting mechanism in which each player chooses the best student to represent him. Players also guide their chosen students with numbered cards, which determine the score to earn the rewards in every test. But choose wisely as the numbered cards you select each turn will be removed from the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
