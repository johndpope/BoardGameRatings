			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This an unusual take on the usual Monopoly theme. In Greekopoly the object of the game is for the players to travel around the board collecting colonies (fraternities &amp;amp; sororities), build on these, and force other players to go broke. (Players have to pay dues when landing on other player's properties.) When only one solvent player is left, that player is the Winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several interesting wrinkles in this title. Unlike in Monopoly where the properties for a neighborhood are within a few spaces of each other, Greekopoly Triads (a combination of 2 fraternities &amp;amp; 1 sorority of the same color) are distributed on different sides of the board. In order to start building on these properties all the properties of a Triad must be owned by the same player. There are also Independent Colonies. Players may build on these without owning other properties, but only when they land on them. (This is in contrast to a Triad which may be built on at the rate of one building or upgrade per turn.) Other properties, simply referred to as Independents (like Greek Sportswear, Campus Pub, etc.) can be bought, but may not be built on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's IFC cards and TGIF cards fulfill the roll that Community Chest &amp;amp; Chance have in classic Monopoly. They introduce the role of chance (with positive and negative outcomes) with the draw of a card. There are also some special spaces on the board, some positive, and some negative&amp;hellip; like the Dean's Office, where a player may be stuck so long he has to forfeit one of his Colonies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This title was clearly meant to capitalize on the enduring popularity of the 1978 film National Lampoon's Animal House&amp;quot; while skirting the need to pay licensing fees. Even the cover art, which also appears on the game board, strongly resembles the style and the content of the poster for Animal House's theatrical release. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
