			<description>A simple but fun quiz game where all the questions concern language. It is made up bu a deck of cards. On each card are 10 questions written. They are increasingly difficult (1 easy, 10 difficult). Each player starts by answering a leve 1 question. If that is correct the player gets to answer a level 2 question and so on. If the player are unsure about the answer she can either try to answer or pass. If the answer is incorrect she has to start over at level one next time it is her turn. If she passes she start on the level she passed on. The first to answer a level 10 question wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
