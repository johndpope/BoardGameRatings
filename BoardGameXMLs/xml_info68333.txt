							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Scouring of Gate Pass (OGL d20 3.x)</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dramatic beginning of the War of the Burning Sky Campaign Saga, The Scouring of Gate Pass kicks off a war of epic proportions as a mighty magical empire marches for conquest. Their first stop is the vital mountain road through the city of Gate Pass, where the PCs, not yet aware of the role they will play in the coming conflict, lie in the path of a military juggernaut.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Gate Pass falls under attack, the heroes are tasked with delivering critical intelligence out of the city and to a distant safe haven. First, though, they must deal with agents of the invading empire, spies from other nations, avaricious bounty hunters, and deadly inquisitors. The information they carry may decide the fate of this conflict, the War of the Burning Sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the first adventure in the War of the Burning Sky Campaign Saga. Throughout the course of the campaign saga, a party of heroes will become involved in an escalating war between mighty magical nations, and after many adventures, military battles, and mysterious intrigue, it will be up to them to decide who will emerge victorious and rule in the aftermath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Scouring of Gate Pass is the first adventure in the 12-part War of the Burning Sky Campaign Saga. As the Ragesian Army maches upon the neutral city of Gate Pass, you must retrieve vital war intelligence from a spy and deliver it to the distant wizards' school of Lyceum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But first you must find a way out of the besieged city before it falls and the inquisitors, Ragesia's infamous mage-hunting clerics, find you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you survive The Scouring of Gate Pass?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
