From the fortress-city of Zimar, General Pythareus commands the overwhelming army of Taldor, and one of the most ruthless spymasters the world has ever known. Even with the resources of the legendary Lion Blades beside them, can the PCs hope to outmaneuver a faceless conspiracy and end the War for the Crown once and for all, or will Taldor descend once more into a thousand-year orgy of violence?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;City in the Lion's Eye&amp;rdquo; is a Pathfinder Roleplaying Game adventure for 10th-level characters. The adventure continues the War for the Crown Adventure Path, as players drag a once-grand nation kicking and screaming into the modern day, becoming legendary politicians, spymasters, and nobles in their own right. A selection of new monsters, an overview of Taldor's famed spies, the Lion Blades, and a gazetteer of the military city of Zimar round out this volume of the Pathfinder Adventure Path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
