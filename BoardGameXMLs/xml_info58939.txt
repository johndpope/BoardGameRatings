							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bits of Darkness: Dungeons</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Bits of Darkness: Dungeons&amp;quot; is provided to bring new life to your dungeons by adding short &amp;quot;bits&amp;quot; of description to energize your adventures. It is written to be of use to both experienced and inexperienced Game Masters, particularly those who (for whatever reason) find themselves short on time or creativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is created to be an &amp;quot;on the go&amp;quot; product, which means you don't need to read the entire work before you can use it. The descriptions are designed so that they can be randomly generated as you play or placed carefully ahead of time. For example, instead of saying &amp;quot;The room is empty,&amp;quot; a GM can whip out Bit #47 and read, &amp;quot;You come across a backpack that appears to have been ripped open by a clawed hand and teeth. Its worthless contents have been scattered around, torn, and trampled...&amp;quot; and so on, painting a picture to add spice and interest to your dungeon, crypt, or other dark place. Essentially, nothing in your dungeon has changed. There is still effectively nothing there, but is no longer &amp;quot;just another empty room!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes 100 Bits of description, and 6 Shards. The Bits are small pieces that can be stuck in, anywhere a little description is needed, and are numbered so they can be used randomly. Shards are slightly larger, and may depict a particular place or event, or set a feel for an area. The material is also indexed a number of ways to allow a GM to easily find a description to fit a particular circumstance. Each Bit is also provided in index card format for ease of use by Game Masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a special bonus, we have included 8 descriptions that could be used in a catacomb area, and some &amp;quot;Bits of Trouble,&amp;quot; a few tricks or traps to keep players on their toes. In addition, some descriptions are graphically depicted in the excellent interior art by the Carmona Brothers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Bits of Darkness: Dungeons&amp;quot; uses material from the SRD, but could be used in any fantasy setting with very minor modifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
