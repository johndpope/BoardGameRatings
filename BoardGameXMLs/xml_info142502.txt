			<description>A single-player roleplaying video game where your weapons are words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the guys who made The Kingdom of Loathing comes a new  game, this time with graphics and sounds and music.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Word Realms takes place in an isolated valley being terrorized by a powerful sorcerer. Can you help the poor villagers with their plight?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore the world, meet interesting characters, and fight your way to Nightmare Castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To battle your foes you make words from letter tiles &amp;mdash; combat is fun and challenging, not mindless clicking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features dozens of different enemies, complete with lore for people who like that sort of thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are hundreds of different items that can significantly impact gameplay, adding tons of depth and strategy to each fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect the nightmares of those around you &amp;mdash; each one is a different puzzle or minigame to be mastered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over a dozen NPCs inhabit the world. Meet them all and discover their secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you complete the story arc, an &amp;quot;endless&amp;quot; mode opens up, allowing for unlimited and increasingly challenging play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
