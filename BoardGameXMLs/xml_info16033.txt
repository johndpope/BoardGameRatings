							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chicanery</name>
									
			<description>Another variant in the Dictionary family of games, of which Balderdash is the widest-known member.  Chicanery consists of a deck of 51 cards, each with 5 obscure words and their definitions.  The players form two teams, and each team starts with one card; one word at a time is used, starting with the top word on the card.  Each player on a team makes up a definition for the chosen word, and the fake definitions, along with the real one, are given to the other team, whose players try to guess which is the real one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
