							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">To Quell the Rising Storm</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gnolls are too quiet -- and when they're quiet, it usually means they're up to no good. But their raids have always been poorly organized before. Have they found a new leader capable of using their abilities and ferocity to advantage? And if so, can they be stopped before lives are lost?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like many other towns, Evenfall has just begun to heal from the war that ravaged the countryside for so many years. But although peace now reigns with the country's erstwhile enemies, the folk of Evenfall suspect that a major offensive is brewing in the camps of the evil humanoids who live nearby. If they're right, it will take more than the impoverished town can muster to save its people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Quell the Rising Storm is suitable for 10th-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Preview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the year since the war that ravaged this country ended, the land has been slow to heal. No crops grow in the burned fields around the town of Evenfall, and the locals will be hard pressed to survive the winter, let alone defend themselves from any new incursions. But the evidence suggests that some evil force stands ready to take advantage of the poorly defended villages in the frontier. Gnolls are the most likely candidates, but the fact that these evil humanoids have ceased their usual unorganized raids is an ominous sign. Has someone organized them into a true fighting force? If so, who -- and more importantly, why?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The folk of Evenfall have begun to fortify their town and outposts against the unknown threat as best they can. The town has fielded a few guard patrols to check the area for humanoids, and its citizens have been keeping to themselves. The streets practically roll up at dusk, since no one wants to be out at night. What they need, however, are heroes -- heores who are willing to brave the unknown in search of answers. Are the PCs up to the task?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
