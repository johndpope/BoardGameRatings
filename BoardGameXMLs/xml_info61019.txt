			<description>A game supplement for Dark Dungeon 2nd Edition the Fantasy Role Playing Game.&lt;br/&gt;Includes short Gazetteer to the World of Yaddrin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your hand you are holding a classic supplement for the Dark Dungeon role playing Game. Samaris.&lt;br/&gt;Samaris is part of the Fantasy World Yaddrin, which was the first world the Dark Dungeon game was used with. Samaris was the most central part and as such it is the place where it all started. That&amp;rsquo;s why we want you to have this part for free too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do I use this booklet?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consider this booklet as a treasure trove. Skim it, look through it and read where your eyes lead you. Use what you like to jog your imagination. No need to read it all at once! Pick it up any time you like.&lt;br/&gt;This booklet is arranged in sections. And in each section you&amp;rsquo;ll find adventure seeds. Ideas for stories, characters and special objects. Each story seed has at least four different twists or outcomes you could use. The ideas are not finished. You&amp;rsquo;ll have to do that by yourself. That&amp;rsquo;s exactly where a lot of the fun is! And what&amp;rsquo;s more: even if your players have read this booklet too, they will not know what endings you choose!&lt;br/&gt;If you want more advice on how to run an adventure, you can find some in the free DD2 Lite rules.&lt;br/&gt;Samaris is not limited to use for Dark Dungeon. If you insist you can use Samaris in any other games system (but why would you want to?) And neither is Dark Dungeon limited to Samaris.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
