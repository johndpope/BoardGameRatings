			<description>In Can-Do Roo, players reach into the kangaroo&amp;rsquo;s pouch and pull out a Fun Card that will tell them to hop to a particular shape or color. Or they might have to act and sound like a dog, frog, cow or other common animal. The 96 Fun Cards in Roo&amp;rsquo;s pouch also include letters of the alphabet to help children recognize each letter and learn what words start with that letter. If they pick a number card, they will have fun hopping that number of times while counting. Players who successfully complete their Fun Card keep the card, and the player who collects the most Fun Cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
