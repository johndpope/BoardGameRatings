			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome back to the crazy, upside down, cliched world of The Imp Game with Neo Productions brand new Big, Dumb Heroes! Leave the evil and mischief behind as you create your own epic, bumbling fool! Rid the world of evil monsters, and some not so much evil as they are obnoxious, and steal oodles of treasure, brave fearsome dungeons, and fail more often than not in your attempts to have your name known throughout history!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big, Dumb Heroes is a follow-up title to 2005's Mischief &amp;amp; Mayhem. Players take on the roles of bumbling heroes instead of imps and explore random dungeons, complete mad-lib quests, and more! This product contains not one, but two PDFs, one for screen reading and appreciation, and one for simplistic printing and sharing! Each 46 page PDF details the original Imp Game system, contains rules for creating heroes, random dungeons and crazy quests, and a mini-beastiary of foes to tackle in your exploits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big Dumb Heroes is the perfect title for a light evening of play or as a back-up game for nights when the GM isn't prepared or a player is missing from a serious campaign. Set up and play in less than 10 minutes, game for hours!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
