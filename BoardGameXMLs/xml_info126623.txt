			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep in the heart of the Western Plains, just north and east of Aven, is a gorge. The gorge, known as Eldon&amp;rsquo;s Gorge locally, has served as a place to play for children and a place for romance for young couples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now it is no longer a place of happiness and light. Now, it is a place of shadow, a place of darkness. On clear nights a luminous figure can be seen wandering the bluffs of the gorge, a figure familiar to the local populace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But is it really the ghost of Eldon that many have seen near the gorge, or is something far more sinister?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shades of Yesterday is an adventure for use with the DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS rules set designed for a group of four first level player characters and is set in the Lands of Drel campaign setting. Player characters that survive the adventure advance to second level with good play and teamwork. The adventure can be adjusted to provide a proper challenge for higher-level characters, but is best for beginning players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
