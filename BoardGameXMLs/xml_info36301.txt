			<description>&amp;quot;Solitaire Card Game.You are a POW trying to survive and/or escape. Victory: You successfully escape if your total Escape level is ever +3. If you go through the whole deck and survive, you are sent back Home after the War ends. Death: If your Health level is ever &amp;ndash;3 you die from physical ailments. If your Sanity level is ever &amp;ndash;3 you lose the will to live and die.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player has three characteristics that start at zero: Health, Sanity, and Escape. The cards lists events and activities that positively or negatively impact one of the three categories. Each turn, before drawing a card, a player may choose to adopt one of our attitudes: Early Escape, Good Behavior, Role Model, and Bad Behavior. Each attitude can modify a certain type of card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
