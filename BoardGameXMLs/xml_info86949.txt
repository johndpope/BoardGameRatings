			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the success of the massive space/trading game Elite on other platforms, Codename MAT was a response to bring a more sophisticated space adventure to the spectrum market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play the role of a teenager, given an experimental spaceship, sent out to defend earth from a final assault by the Myons. Written by Derek Brewster, the game moves between tricky arcade style space battles in 3D, and complex navigation tasks to get from one planet to another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a mass of keys to remember, and fairly tricky game-play mixed in with dramatic shooting matches, Codename MAT showed that the Spectrum could overcome its limits and present the player with a detailed experience. But this was at the cost of basic graphics and long instructions, and whilst the game got good reviews, younger players found it too hard to handle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
