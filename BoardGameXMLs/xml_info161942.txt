							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Killer Croquet</name>
									
			<description>Killer Croquet is a thematic arena board game with tactical positioning, risk management, and multiple paths to victory. Fast paced and strategic, Killer Croquet is quick to learn and dramatic enough to match it's absurd theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6 Six of the Worlds Greatest Croquet Players have been kidnapped by a Shadow Organization known as the Pall Mall. Take on the role of an ex-soviet super spy, a time traveling steampunk cyborg, or the nordic God of Thunder as you play for the highest of stakes: your lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Killer Croquet, you control a player piece and a ball piece. You get two actions on you turn that can be split up between moving, hitting your ball, and hitting the other players. When you move you can choose to move to your ball or 3 spaces in any direction. When you hit your ball, you choose a direction and a strength and then roll custom dice to see how far the ball goes: Softly (1,1,1,2,2,3), Fairly (1,3,4,5,6,8), or Wicked Hard (Both dice added together)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pass your ball through each wicket in the correct order and direction and hit the ending post to gain the &amp;quot;Poison&amp;quot; Power Boost. Afterwards, pass your ball through the wickets in the reverse order and direction and hit the start post to win the game. Or simply knock enough players down to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
