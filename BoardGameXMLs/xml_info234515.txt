							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ice Cool: 0.5 Point Cards</name>
									
			<description>Up to this point, the penguins could manage to find only a single ice skate laying somewhere in the school, so they had to hope for the second to do some unexpected ice skate trick &amp;mdash; but now from time to time it's possible also to find a pair and skate away immediately!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ice Cool: 0.5 Point Cards expansion introduces four scoring cards that are each worth only 0.5 points on their own, but you can reveal this card at a time of your choosing and take an extra turn immediately. Shuffle these cards into the point pile, and you are ready to play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
