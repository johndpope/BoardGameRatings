			<description>In this promotional board game by Swedish insurance company Skandia, players move around a Monopoly-style board, drawing various types of event cards. They will get the chance to invest in property like cars, houses or diamonds, hoping to sell them at a profit or else convert them to cash at the end of the game. They may also get to purchase tickets in an intermittently triggered lottery (because winning the lottery and speculating in diamonds are the two surest ways of getting rich, or something).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything and anything in the game is in danger of damage or accidents, although having the right insurance helps with this. Several of the risk vs. reward elements of the game are easily solvable and serve to encourage behaviour that is illegal or economically irrational in reality, like casino gambling or diamond smuggling, which seems a little odd considering the theme. The game is played for an arbitrary amount of time; the rules suggest playing until a point in time agreed upon in advance is reached, after which five more moves are played out. The player with the most money is then declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
