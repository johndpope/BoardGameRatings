							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gunpowder Treason</name>
									
			<description>The perfect game to play November 5, Gunpowder Treason is a game based on Guy Fawkes' attempt to blow up Parliament in 1605.  This in itself is a little spooky, but what's really spooky is that the box says that Aztral Games designed it for Astra Fireworks Company in the UK!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a fairly simple game: move one space on your turn and possibly draw a card.  The object is to be the first to get your four barrels of gunpowder at the edges of the board to Parliament at the center of the board - you can only carry one at a time.  The board has lots of squares, some with text on them and some with tunnels for faster (but riskier) movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About a fifth of the spaces are of each player color, and the other fifth are white.  If you end your turn on a white space or your own color, your turn is over.  If you end on another color, draw a card.  These range from being good for you (&amp;quot;Take another turn&amp;quot;) to potentially bad for you or even for an opponent (&amp;quot;Counterinsurgency agents raid ...&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes games end with Parliament being blown up, but more often one player simply has the last uncaptured piece on the board.  This is actually kind of reassuring, in a real-world sense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
