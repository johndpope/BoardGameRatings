			<description>The sixth title in the Ace Attorney: Phoenix Wright series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spirit of Justice continues the investigation and courtroom of its predecessors, in which players take the role of the defense attorneys Phoenix Wright, Apollo Justice, and Athena Cykes, and try to defend their clients. The game continues the 3D navigation introduced in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney &amp;minus; Dual Destinies, allowing players to navigate environments from various angles. Along with returning gameplay elements, such as the Mood Matrix introduced in Dual Destinies, the game introduces divination s&amp;eacute;ances, in which players are shown the memories of victims moments before their deaths and must find contradictions in their five senses to determine what really happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story of Spirit of Justice once again focuses on defense attorney Phoenix Wright and his two understudies Apollo Justice and Athena Cykes. Phoenix is reunited with his longtime friend and spirit medium companion, Maya Fey, while visiting the island of Khura'in, where lawyers are deemed unnecessary as spirit mediums, such as the young priestess Rayfa Padma Khura'in, are able to conjure up visions of a victim's memories moments before death. As ever, Phoenix and Maya seek to prove out that even a supposedly definitive method of convicting defendants has its own contradictions, while Apollo and Athena stay back home and have their own set of cases to deal with. One of the cases features Apollo defending Trucy Wright, Phoenix's adoptive daughter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Wright%3A_Ace_Attorney_%E2%88%92_Spirit_of_Justice Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney &amp;minus; Spirit of Justice]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
