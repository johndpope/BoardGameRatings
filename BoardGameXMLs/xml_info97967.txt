			<description>To win the game, kids have to earn five out of the ten virtues by completing the tasks described on each card they draw.  For example, a &amp;quot;Thankfulness&amp;quot; card asks the player to hold their breath for as long as they can.  When they are finished, they card asks; &amp;quot;Aren't you thankful to breathe again?&amp;quot; and reminds the player to be thankful for things that we sometimes take for granted.  Tasks often have to be completed cooperatively and require respectful listening to other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
