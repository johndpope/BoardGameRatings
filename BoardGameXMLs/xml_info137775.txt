			<description>The centre of the game is to purchase the best items from several categories during your &amp;quot;lifetime&amp;quot; to gain the most &amp;quot;happiness&amp;quot;. A character card is giving each player an additional secret goal to achieve and add happiness points at the end of the game. Money is tight, though, and &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; cards (accidents, and so on) can cost you a lot of money. There are also cards which cost you a fee each round (mobilephone).&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, players draw the topmost card of a huge draw deck. Either he gets it (the bad cards are a forced purchase) or trades them directly to other players, getting the cost himself. He can also discard a card and take the next one - at his own risk.&lt;br/&gt;At the end, happiness points are added. Money counts a half happiness point for each unit. The player with the most happiness wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
