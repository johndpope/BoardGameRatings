							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cyber.net.ica (The Black Hack Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyber.net.ica takes place in a reality very similar to our own, with some slight modifications of course. Cyberspace is alive and tangible. Humans now have access to &amp;ldquo;jack&amp;rdquo; their brains into Cyberspace and experience it not just in 3D and surround sound but as if it were real life. To some it is just that. All it took for some was a few inexpensive home brew motherboards and computer components, with a bit of hacking. Others found the Cyberspace to be truly alive and could tap into the spirit of that new realm through mysticism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this book is to bring those three games together into a source book or sandbox environment for use with The Black Hack set of rules. There are already a number of great Cyberpunk TBH compatible games out there, so instead of trying to reinvent the wheel the contents and concepts inside this book are meant to be used by Game Masters(GMs) in whole or in part as they see fit. GMs are encouraged to use this material to create their own virtual realities for their players to play in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For use with David Black's The Black Hack and cyber punk variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
