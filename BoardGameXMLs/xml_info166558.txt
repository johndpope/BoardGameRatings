							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Undercroft (Issue 2 - Sep 2014)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Open Up And Let The Devil In&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Undercroft crawls into its second issue, slightly stretching out the legs. It's a tight fit but the number two suits it; the minimum multiple, the difficult second album. Forgive me for parading around for a while. Would you read me? I'd read me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This season we see many hands upon the knife, many names pinned to the board and held accountable for the terrible things we are about to do. And I thank them. It can't be avoided in noting the powers driving this issue. From the cover to the very heart of it, we here at the Melsonian Arts Council have been honoured with a profusion of talent. Please take the time to laggardly draw your weary eye across the pages they so lovingly etched out for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now in the veritable dotage of issue two we start to see the themes of The Undercroft solidify; the Weird is stranger, the Horror is more graphic, and the company ever more refined. Time and willing complicity allowing, this will continue towards a singularity of unpleasantness until one turns from these pages in disgust. Then, oh, then we shall know the true face of The Undercroft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'd read me hard. I'd read me so hard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Issue #2 of the quarterly zine &amp;quot;The Undercroft&amp;quot;. Compatible with Lamentations of the Flame Princess and most old-school RPGs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
