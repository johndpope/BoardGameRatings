							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Treasure Maps</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Treasure Maps is the third in a series of special accessories for the AD&amp;amp;D game.  It provides the Dungeon Master with basic adventure skeletons that can be expanded as he or she pleases, from simple encounters to full-fledged undertakings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treasure Maps supplies two full-color maps for each of its sixteen adventures.  First comes the Dungeon Master's map, with encounter information and background on the revers.  This map is for the DM only and should not be shown to the players.  The second map is a handout for the players' use and generally serves to lead the player characters into the adventure.  It features a full-color map on one side; on the reverse is a brief description of the map's condition (medium, texture, age, state of preservation, and the like).  The players' map may also list rumors regarding the map - why it exists, what treasures it leads to, its probable veracity, and the legends regarding the fates of previous owners.  Some of these rumors contain clues to finding the treasures or avoiding deadly traps that await the unwary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The maps contain herein are not based in any particular world, setting, or campaign in TSR's arsenal and can easily be adapted to any campaign world.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Hunt for lost gold, powerful magic items, and even greater treasure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treasure Maps contains 16 separate adventures that will take player characters from mountaintops to the ocean depths. The player characters can find treasure drowned in deep water, watch the stars for omens, rescue a kidnapped prince, search for a lost mine, visit a very strange restaurant, or explore the sky-temple of a forgotten deity. But beware! The greater the treasure-hoard, the greater the danger from its guardians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each adventure comes with two beautifully rendered full-color maps, one for the players and one for the DUNGEON MASTER. Also provided are rumors associated with each map and encounter notes for the DM. These adventures are adaptable for play in any AD&amp;amp;D game world, either as a brief encounter or as the start of a full-fledged campaign. The DM can also use any of the 32 full-color maps to create adventures of his or her own.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
