			<description>In the Nintendo DS version, gameplay features are greatly reduced. The Scout class is unavailable and mounts are non-existent. In addition, the playing perspective is isometric and only 6 maps were shipped with the game. All classes start out relatively weak, but fallen enemies will drop orbs that allow the player to power-up their current character&amp;rsquo;s attack power and speed, resetting after the player respawns. After a level is over, a post-game statistics screen will appear to show the player&amp;rsquo;s performance and to award them in-game achievements for their accomplishments (not allowing allies to die, for instance).[9]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The lord of the rings conquest&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SAVE MIDDLE-EARTH...OR DESTROY IT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight for Good or Evil as one of three classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
