			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will You Step Up?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highdelve is in danger, and only true heroes can save the day!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young human cousins Brialla and Meraina, as well as Kiliuk the tempestuous half-orc and Torgen the stoic dwarf, find themselves engrossed in Highdelve's joyous summer festival, the Brightbloom Jubilee. But all is shattered when the youths being honored return to town battered and bloodied. What's more, bullies robbed them of an amulet that's precious to the townspeople as well as to the regal gold dragon who protects them. As the visitors venture up a mountain to confront the culprits, they find that the situation is stickier than it appeared. Can the heroes stop a tiefling mastermind and his plan to unleash an ettin upon the festival? Or will mayhem win the day?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes for Highdelve is an adventure for the four pregenerated 1st-level heroes in this volume, written for the award-winning Pathfinder RPG. The adventure takes place in Highdelve and surrounding areas of Brevoy in the official Pathfinder campaign setting, and is the perfect introduction to the game and its world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
