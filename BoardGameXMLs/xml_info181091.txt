			<description>The little ladybug wants to dress up. She&amp;rsquo;s bored with her black dots today and wants to try on something new and colorful. Do you think you can help her out? Together, gather colorful dots for her new outfit. And whoever has the ladybug at the end of the game wins and gets to fly around the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Getting started:&lt;br/&gt;Put the 12 colored dots on the leaf and place it in the middle of the table well within everybody&amp;lsquo;s reach. The youngest player receives the plush ladybug and die. That&amp;lsquo;s it! Now you can start the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take turns in a clockwise direction. The youngest player slides on the plush ladybug over his or her right or left wrist. Then roll the die. Depending on what is showing on the die, here&amp;lsquo;s what happens next:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Hurray! A new color!&lt;br/&gt;Pick up a matching colored dot from the leaf and stick it on any free circle on the plush ladybug. It doesn&amp;lsquo;t matter who has&lt;br/&gt;the ladybug around his wrist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Oh, oh. There are no more dots of this color!&lt;br/&gt;Are there no more dots on the leaf maching the color you just rolled? No problem. The player to your left tries his luck and rolls the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Ladybug, change hands!&lt;br/&gt;You already have the ladybug on your wrist? Great! You can keep it! You don&amp;lsquo;t have the plush ladybug? Then the player who has it has to give it to you. Slide the plush ladybug over your wrist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- End of game:&lt;br/&gt;Have you attached all the colored dots onto the ladybug? Then the game is over. If you have the ladybug around your wrist, you&amp;lsquo;ve won the game and get to fly once around the room! Ladybug, ladybug, flyyyyyy!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
