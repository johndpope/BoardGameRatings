							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Moto Racer World Tour</name>
									
			<description>In Moto Racer World Tour, the player drives a motorcycle in races against opponents. A large portion of the game centers on the World Tour Championship game mode, which tasks the player with completing a series races against the AI. The game received above average reviews from critics, who felt it was a good arcade motorcycling simulator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game places the player in motocross races against opponents on various terrain. The game plays as an arcade racer, where it does not attempt to perfectly simulate actual motocross. The main portion of the game is featured around the World Tour Championship mode, which places the player in races of varying degrees of difficulty, and requires the player to beat their opponents in sequence. An arcade mode allows players to choose any event for single races. Once the player has completed some championships, the game opens up new modes for the player, including traffic (where the player races through incoming traffic), dragster (drag racing), and freestyle (freestyle motocross).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Moto Racer World Tour&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
