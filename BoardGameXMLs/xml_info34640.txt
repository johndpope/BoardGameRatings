							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Schwerpunkt! Decline and Fall of the German Armour Weapon, East Front 1944-1945</name>
									
			<description>Schwerpunkt! is a tactical game of combat on the East Front in the last two years of World War 2.  Units are squad-sized, hexes represent about 100 meters across, and game turns are 60 to 120 seconds of real time.  Six small scenarios are provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are short and succinct, with no real surprises from the standard igo/ugo practice, with one exception ... players alternate, not in taking their full turns, but in initiating combat until all combat is completed, and then in moving until all eligible units have moved.  This tends to slow the game down somewhat, but the benefit is the ability of the players to respond to threats in a more timely manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components include four geomorphic map sheets, each 8.5&amp;quot;x11&amp;quot;; six pages of rules; and 166 uncut counters.  The production quality is low as the game, as well as the magazine in which it came (more on that in a moment) is photocopied.  Photocopied, remember, using 1977 technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The magazine is Volume 1 Number 1, and therefore Issue 1, of Combat!, the International Magazine of Conflict Simulations.  It's published by Wellington Wargames, also known as Swedish Games Productions, the brainchild of Fredrik Malmberg, who is himself a bit of a prodigal.  He began his wargame producing career in earnest when he was 14 years old (see his design 'Fight for Tobruk!')  Only 200 copies of The Combat issue 1 were printed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
