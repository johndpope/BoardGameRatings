			<description>From the back of the cover:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Russel Corey was a respected authority on Occult mysteries and phenomena. For some time he had been investigating the possible links between an old shipwreck in the South Atlantic, and a sect practicing human sacrifice in the 1920s. Corey was haunted by the visions of some arcane evil coming back through time to wreck havoc today... but his death on the verge of a major breakthrough could mean that all his work is wasted. You knew Corey slightly, and are a little uneasy about his death; after all, he was not an old man...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Call of Cthulhu Adventure for 2-5 inexperienced player characters set in the present day. Includes an introduction to modern investigating with new skills, rules, etc.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
