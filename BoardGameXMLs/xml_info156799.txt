			<description>Dice driven game for very young kids. The game &amp;quot;board&amp;quot; consists of five meadow tiles which are placed in a circle. On each of the tiles, there is one character: A dragon, a knight, a king, a princess and a horse. The active player rolls a die. If the result is a number, the player moves any character forward by that number of tiles. If it shows the dragon, s/he moves the dragon by one tile. If the dragon ever reaches the princess, the two of them move together from now on. If the black hat is rolled, a card is flipped over: It shows the character that has to move one tile forward. The six cards form a puzzle of the evil count. If the players manage to get all characters onto the same tile before the puzzle is complete, they win; if not, they all lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
