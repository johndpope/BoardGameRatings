			<description>Siberian Dawn is a deck building game set in a grim, industrial future where you play the part of an Overseer, one of the tactical experts of the Union who are responsible for quickly dealing with troubles as they arise using a limited resource pool, controlled squad level force, and possible support from the Guilds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recruit and buy resources to increase the power of your resource deck and tactics deck. Use those resources to command your units and deal with hostile forces and events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complete a series of objectives to finish the mission, but watch your Vitae for if it reaches 0 then you have failed and will have to face the shame of letting down the Union&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story of Siberian Dawn unfolds over a series of missions that challenge with different goals. Contain angry mobs, rescue captives and bribe untrustworthy informants to progress on this mission to combat the Dawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
