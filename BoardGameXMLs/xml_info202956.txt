			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player characters are common people who have received a spark of knowledge of things that no longer exist. They must restore the missing pieces of reality by somehow reinserting them into the common cultural landscape, before they are lost forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is implemented as a sort of object properties map, nearly like a flowchart.  Accessibility is quite good though the presentation is very unusual.  Although the game is provided on a single sheet of A4 paper (one side), it needs to be greatly zoomed (300-400%) to be readily legible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
