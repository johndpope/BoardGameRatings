			<description>INTRODUCTION&lt;br/&gt;Huscarls is a semi-historical game where one to four Players assume the roles of minor Saxon Warlords in Britain during the Dark Ages of around 980-1080 AD. There are many rich pastures, thick forests with deer and boar and rolling hills, all ready for the taking as the riches of Medieval Britain can be yours. All you need is to demonstrate a firm hand and fruitful estates. A strong sword and loyal followers are also required to maintain your lands and ensure the villagers are providing the proper taxes. You must also be able to defend your territories from rival Lords and invading Normans and plundering Vikings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OBJECTIVE&lt;br/&gt;Players assume the roles of Saxon Warlords in Dark Ages Britain (AD 980-1080) with the goals of expanding and improving their territorial control. Warlords do this by raising Retinues and conquering neighboring territories. Warlords can, also, improve their holdings by building Hamlets, Manors and Castles. A Game consists of up to 10 Campaign Seasons. Players may agree to play fewer or more as desired. The Player, who at the end of any Campaign Season (Spring, Summer or Autumn) controls the greatest Settlement Value from their Hamlets, Manors and Castles, is the Victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
