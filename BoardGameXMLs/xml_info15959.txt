			<description>DTP effort from 1989, can be played solo.  Baby has a gun at the end of the hallway.  Try to get Mom, Dad, or Officer Bill down the hallway before baby (actions determined by die rolls) bumps them off.  I think this is an attempt at black humor, but it's kind of disturbing, and pretty random.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;OH NO!&lt;br/&gt;   Too late you realize your toddler has found your fully loaded Krup 9000, 16 shot, Near Silenced, Semi Auto pistol.&lt;br/&gt;   Sitting at the end of the hall baby is playing with a lethal weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baby is about to have a lot of fun.&lt;br/&gt;   The dog was the first victim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be next?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BABY BOOMER is a solo or group board game that keeps everybody on their toes as they race down the hall to disarm the toddler.  Six sided dice, and Diapers not included.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
