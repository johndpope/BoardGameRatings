							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crush! Kill! Destroy!</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the summer of 1953, and a typical family is having a lovely picnic. Mother has made a lovely lunch. The oldest daughter has brought her fiance. The younger children are running around playing in the sunshine. Then alien robots invade the Earth! As mushroom clouds rise in the distance, the family must learn to survive in a post-apocalyptic wasteland and find a way to defeat the invaders once and for all! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crush! Kill! Destroy! is a stand-alone adventure for Fate Accelerated Edition. It has 6 pregenerated characters, and is perfect for a game day, convention game, or a break from your regular ongoing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crush! Kill! Destroy! is also a supplement for your regular game, regardless of the setting, genre, or rules system. In the same way that the farm hands in 1939's Wizard of Oz doubled as characters in the magical land over the rainbow, the characters in Crush! Kill! Destroy! are based on your player characters. It may or may not all be a dream, but you have to survive to find out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
