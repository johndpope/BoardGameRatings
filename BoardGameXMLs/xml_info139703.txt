			<description>The game consists of a wooden board with 8 by 8 hollows (or 6 x 6 in the smaller edition for two players). These are randomly filled with marbles: Orange for carrots, green for salad and yellow for dandelions. Each player also owns a hare (a marble in a unique color) on the field.&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns hopping two fields forward and one to the side, picking up (&amp;quot;eating&amp;quot;) the marble on the field they land on. The food marbles are worth 3, 2, and 1 point respectively; and landing on an opponents hare eliminates the opponent (and is worth 4 points). When no more hare can move, the players count their points; the player with most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
