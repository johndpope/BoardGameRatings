							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chloe, the Martial Artist</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Her name is Chloe Barbosa.  She was born in Russia, orphaned young, and adopted by a family of Ju Jitsu instructors.  It wasn&amp;rsquo;t an easy life, but it got harder.&lt;br/&gt; She&amp;rsquo;s not entirely sure how it came to pass that she started fighting the supernatural.  Aliens, demons, cyborgs... now it&amp;rsquo;s all a blur of one fight after the other.  That&amp;rsquo;s what happens, though, when you&amp;rsquo;re in the world of HOT CHICKS.&lt;br/&gt; This is the first in a series of Character Studies... detailed examinations of characters that occupy the back alleys and shadows of the world of HOT CHICKS: The Roleplaying Game.  Included are over forty images of Chloe in various stages of dress, including none at all.  She&amp;rsquo;s quite proud of all the tattoos...&lt;br/&gt; Read her history, study her form, and view her statistics.  She makes an ideal NPC companion, ally, and is also perfectly suitable as a Player Character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
