			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Les Petites Choses Oubli&amp;eacute;es is an [English-language] game for two players whose goal is to narrate, using everyday life pictures, some of the bitter-sweet memories of a couple. A play lasts for about one hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into three movements. The first is used to picture the meeting of the soon-to-be couple. Each player unveils their character by portraying some of their particularities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At some point, their relationship becomes flawed somehow and they decide to break up. This is so painful that they willingly decide to undergo an erasing procedure. Each player takes turn in describing some memories of the relationship. They use pictures as inspiration and the partner may react to this by providing some nuance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
