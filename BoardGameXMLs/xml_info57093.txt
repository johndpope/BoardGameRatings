			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CITY OF ANGELS&lt;br/&gt;... AND ALIENS &lt;br/&gt;... AND DIN0SAURS &lt;br/&gt;... AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN THINK OF....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NEXUS LIFE is the first sourcebook for the NEXUS: THE INFINITE CITY roleplaying game. It introduces players and GMs alike to the wildest, hippest neighborhood in Nexus: Angel City. Before it got ripped away from its own reality and plunked down into the middle of the reality melting pot, Angel City was a place called Los Angeles. Ten years later, after a series of devastating riots, waves of immigration from countless dimensions, and a period of frenzied rebuilding, it is a vibrant, crazy urban stew where the recognizable collides with the fantastic on a daily basis. The book is presented in the form of a popular lifestyle magazine published in Angel City. This format makes it ideal for GMs and players alike. See the neighborhood through the eyes of its residents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Check out a new archetype &amp;mdash; the Hobbycop, a part-time vigilante who tries to bring order to a lawless town.&lt;br/&gt;- Cruise the Internex, Nexus' infinitely snarled version of the Information Highway.&lt;br/&gt;- Read about nine of Angel City's Neighborhood heroes. Do your player characters match their accomplishments?&lt;br/&gt;- Scam the secrets of making money fast in the jacking biz.&lt;br/&gt;- See which realities are in, and which are phasing out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus letters, columns, reviews, and more atmosphere than you can shake a semi-automatic magic wand at!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
