			<description>Legacy Unbound is proud to present a family-friendly game that is easy to learn and easy to master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You take on the role of an ancient enchanted Couch Potato. All you want is to kick back and watch old movies over the weekend. You compete against your Couch Potato roommates for control of the old school film projector and 20 of their Movie Reels. Sound like a lot of work for a Couch Potato? You're right! So you are gonna have your enchanted Pillows do the fighting for you. These Pillows can use anything they find around the house as a weapon, including your pets! To the victor go the spoils, but the only way to be the Best Spud, is to beat your best buds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For added fun or just to have cool fan merchandise, you can purchase the Best Spud Promo Playing Card Deck. Each Ace in this deck is an exclusive, powerful Weapon Card you can add to your copy of Best Spud! Each of these are available on The Game Crafter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
