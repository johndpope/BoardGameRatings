			<description>Waurie is a Mancala game played on the Cayman Islands where it is traditionally played with nickernuts.  It is also known as Island Wari. Unusually for a Mancala game the aim of the game is to empty your side of the board rather than win the most seeds.  It is played on a board with 2 rows of 6 holes and a storehouse at each end, starting with 4 seeds in each hole.  Turns must start on your side of the board, there is no capturing, but seeds are sown in a player's own store.  Sowing the last seed in the player's store gives that player another turn.  Waurie can easily be played with a Kalah set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
