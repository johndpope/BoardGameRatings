			<description>Each player gets a grid on which each will write one's words. A specially designed roulette wheel that has seven balls is spun. Instead of the usual numbers, the roulette wheel has letters of the alphabet. Each letter of the alphabet has been assigned a value from one to ten points. Once the seven letters for the round have been determined, the players have a time limit to use those letters in words on their individual grids crossword-style. The player with the most points after a predetermined number of rounds is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the official rules in the box-lid, it there is a single crossword grid that is shared by all players, each player taking turns adding to the grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
