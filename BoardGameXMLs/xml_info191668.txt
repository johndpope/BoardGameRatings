			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built high on cliffs overlooking the confluence of two rivers, Gurthap Keep was a bastion of strength and a haven for the Cult of the Red God. Here, priests of old sacrificed over the tomb of long dead Kha M Thir, honoring him for his long service to the Red God.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They added bastions to the keep, walls, temple and barracks. From there they terrorized the surrounding country, raiding the villages of Alice, Greenbriar and Ends Meet until at last the rangers gathered against the Cult and overthrew it. They drove them from their walls and those they did not slay, fled into the Darkenfold to the south.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The castle has sat thus ever since, a grim testament to the gods of the old world. The forest has consumed it and only the memories of men keep it alive. But beyond its abandoned walls lie the shadows of yesteryear. For the tomb of Kah M Thir was never found and the secrets of the priests of the Red God never fully revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is a set piece adventure, taking place entirely in and around the Falls. The adventure can pick up after C4 Harvest of Oaths, however it is not necessary to play that adventure in order to enjoy Falls the Divide. Other adventures may enhance play but are not necessary: C1 Mortality of Green, C2 Shades of Mist and C3 Upon the Powder River.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
