							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Holowczyn: Battle of the Moscow Road</name>
									
			<description>Battle between Swedes and Russians on the road to Moscow 1708. Swedish Game Production Combat Series No. 1.&lt;br/&gt;Production qualities are fairly low but the 17&amp;quot; by 12&amp;quot; map is workmanlike in 5 colors and the counters are clear with Swedes in light blue and Russians in green.&lt;br/&gt;The Russians are on the defensive in prepared positions but are surprised by a sudden Swedish attack through the marshes on the flank of the position. The Swedish units are much better than their opponents but there are few of them. The fight is therefore fairly evenly matched.&lt;br/&gt;The Rules use a standard sequence of play of Move, Defender fires, Attacker fires, Melee and then Rally. Losses are taken to attack strength necessitating the use of loss markers but stacking is limited so the stacks do not get too high.&lt;br/&gt;Special rules include Leaders, Pontoon Bridges, Surprise, extra reinforcements etc.&lt;br/&gt;Same rules as Peter the Great by the same Designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
