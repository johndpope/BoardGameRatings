			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rome, A.D. 1296.  While in the service of Count Renzo, you are awakened one night by a soldier bringing terrible news- the count has been kidnapped!  You track the kidnappers to an ancient monastery in the mountains, where they are holding the count captive.  On your jouney you meet a mysterious stranger named Cipango.  He offers to help you rescue the count tonight, but can you trust him?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What happens next in the story?  It all depends on the choices you make.  How does the story end?  Only you can find out!  And the best part is that you can keep rereading until you've had not one but many incredibly daring experiences!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
