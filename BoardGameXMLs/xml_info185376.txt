							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Wars: Galactic Connexions</name>
									
			<description>A Star Wars themed collectible disc game. Players use character discs and their Star Wars knowledge to battle for points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each disc has four abilities (Attack, Honor, Deceit, Intelligence) and an ability level from 0 to 5. Players can connect their disc to another on the board if their disc's ability level is higher. The player earns points equal to the ability level marks on both sides of the connection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing with the Star Wars Story Connexions rules, additional points are awarded depending on the rim color of the new disc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
