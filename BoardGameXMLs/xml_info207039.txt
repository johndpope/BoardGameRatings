			<description>The goal of the game is to avoid finishing the game with thee sunken ship token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins with a hand of 9 cards; the rest of cards are left in a face down stack and the first one is revealed; and ship tokens are dealt (one with a sunken ship, the others with a floating ship). In a UNO-ish fashion, a player in his turn can play a card from his hand only if it matches the revealed card in color, number or action, and some cards perform actions on the ships. The game ends when a player gets rid of all his cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
