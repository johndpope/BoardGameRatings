							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Final Flight of Santiago</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2258 is an election year, and Luis Santiago is fighting for his political life. Ten years on from the Earth-Mimbari war, the Alliance is divided. The colonies push for more independence, Earth worries about alien influence, the megacorporations are turning EarthGov into an oligarchy, the post-war expansion boom is petering out... and the Mars question isstill political poison. In a desparate attempt to turn his re-election around, Santiago takes EarthForce One out on a tour of the Alliance, promising to solve all these problems and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's where you come in. As Santiago's advisors and experts, the players will have to grapple with some of the thorniest issues in the Babylon 5 setting, all the while pushing their own political agendas. Who do they serve and who do they trust - and which of them is the traitor working for the Shadows and Vice-President Clark?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
