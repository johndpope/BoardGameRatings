			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;This is a modern list of items that could be found in the mail. This includes in post boxes, in houses and commercial property, in the possession of postmen or delivery drivers, or at delivery offices and post offices themselves. The items could be used to flesh out a location, to hide more important material amongst or as loot following an apocalyptic event. Some of the items may have an immediate use, whilst others will not. Some are also perishable, and so could be rather unpleasant if left for some time. Some are actually items of mail whilst others are simply pushed through letterboxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Identity Document (Other than documents such as driving licenses and passports, such as proof of age or proof of identity cards, with a photograph of the recipient)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
