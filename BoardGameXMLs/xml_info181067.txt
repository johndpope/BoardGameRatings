							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sur les traces des animaux de la Ferme</name>
									
			<description>Designed for 2 to 6 players, players have to recognize animal prints in this educational game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no need to refer to an instruction manual to determine if a player has guessed correctly: the publisher has developed a system that shows the result immediately. The footprint of each animal is unique and is shown on the backside of the tile with the depiction of the animal. Innovative and very playful, this system brings very great fluidity to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the youngest, aged 5, a cooperative mode is suggested, which allows to take in hand the prints of each of the 24 animals, allowing for fun and easier gameplay. Then, for older players, the interaction between players is at the heart of the game and greater speed is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
