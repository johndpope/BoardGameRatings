			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AdventureQuest Worlds, more commonly referred to by the staff as AQ Worlds, is Artix Entertainments first true MMO RPG. The game features full player interaction with other players and the gameplay is geared such that players must co-operate to defeat bosses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is diffrent from previous AE releases in some ways, though class skills are costume dependant. AQ Worlds though removes the problem of &amp;quot;cookie cutter&amp;quot; players all wearing the same best gear by making the equipment system based soley on what upgrades you apply. Any weapon of the same basic upgrade level will do the same damage range. This allows a player to outfit their character based on looks rather than what is perceived &amp;quot;best&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Levelling though is divided into two linked groups. The characters level, which determines what upgrades can be accessed, and any class they are wearing's level. A player must wear and gain EXP with a class to level it up seperately from any other classes they might have on hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with all other AE games, it is free to play. But this time paying players must pay a monthly, quarterly or yearly fee to access better upgrades, special costumes, parts of quests and certain shops. Players lose access to any equipment that required a paying account that has lapsed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
