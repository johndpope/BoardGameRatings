			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Want To Go Some Place Really Scary?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a child, you pedaled your bike past its seemingly endless gates -- eyes closed, riding like the wind. The haunted house on the hill. Grandfather went mad trying to solve its mysteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you, joined by an expert team of polter-professionals, are destined to explore this enormous &amp;quot;fortress of fright&amp;quot; and unlock its dark secrets. But remember... don't go alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Picture captions:]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grandpa always said, &amp;quot;Choose your friends wisely.&amp;quot; Select four companions from the 16 para-normal cadets available. Their attributes and talents fluctuate throughout the journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A huge haunted house with monster-laden levels of play. The depth of this game is scary. Explore complex, multi-level mazes as you battle over 100 spooks, spirits, and things that go bump in the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most normal families have watch dogs. This iron door is guarded by a ghoul who'd like to do the monster mash on you face. Fight, flee or fend him off with a magic formula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concoct a spell to send a demon back to hell. What's the recipe for baked banshee? You'll find it on the formula creation screen. If that doesn't work, try a little exorcism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isn't that the ghost of &amp;quot;Mac the Knife?&amp;quot; No, it's a flame sword--and you better grab it before it vanishes. Each level is loaded with inventory that you must collect for your character to grow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meet some truly transparent people. The breakthrough interface gives the beginner a ghost of a chance, yet still challenges the skills of the most experienced role player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
