			<description>Designed by record industry professionals, Supergroup plays with all the excitement of the real record business. You can become an overnight sensation or work your way up the hard way; either way the goal is the same...you want to be a superstar!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just as real musicians do, you start off by forming your own group and &amp;quot;Paying Dues&amp;quot; -- playing those dumb gigs that are the first step to being discovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once your group becomes established you go &amp;quot;On The Road&amp;quot;, getting valuable experience. At the same time you start cutting demo records which you hope will attract an agent and a recording company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you get yourself that agent he helps get your recording contract and you're ready to start working &amp;quot;Studio Gigs&amp;quot; -- right there in front of the microphones, you begin cutting discs that will send you &amp;quot;On The Charts&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then it's a race to the &amp;quot;Top Ten&amp;quot; with the winner walking off with the prized gold record.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyone can come up with the right combination of talent and luck that will take them from obscurity to stardom. The more you get into Supergroup, the more you'll dig it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
