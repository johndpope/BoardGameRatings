			<description>Time to hit the open road!  Visit scenic locations around the USA.  Earn a point for each Destination you visit, and bonuses for collecting sets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 4 Destination Cards, chooses one of them for a starting location, and places their car pawn on that city.  On a player's turn, their car pawn can move three times using the roads or airlines.  Events or Bonus Cards may give additional moves.  Announce the names of each city you visit, so other players are aware which cities have been visited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time a player stops in a city shown on a &amp;quot;public card&amp;quot; or one of their Destination Cards, they add that card face-up in their scoring area and move up the scoring track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Always pay attention during other players' turns.  If another player visits a city that matches one of the cards in your hand, ask them to send you a postcard!  They score the card you were holding, but you receive a card from the Postcard Deck, which is also worth a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After finishing your turn, draw cards from the Destination Deck to replenish your hand back to 3 cards.  If an Event Card is revealed while drawing, follow the instructions on the card first, then draw a new Destination Card to replace it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any time a player completes a set of 3 Destination Cards and/or Postcards of the same color, they receive a Bonus Card.  These cards provide bonus points or special abilities that will help you advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT THEY'LL LEARN: Geography, Strategy, State Facts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Sequel to: Let's Jet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
