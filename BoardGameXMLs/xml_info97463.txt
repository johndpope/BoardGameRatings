							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeon Master&#039;s Token Set: Scales Expansion</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created in cooperation with Wizards of the Coast, these sets contain more of the fantastic tokens and markers that a DM needs to manage combats and track the status of a dungeon's denizens as they battle intrepid adventurers! Each set contains a new token, the Burst Origin, which can be used to note from where a burst area attack or spell originates. Also featured are more tokens denoting the combat conditions that affect heroes and the monsters they battle, including 24 scale-type tokens in the set as well as 5 more Bloodied tokens, handy for battles with many combatants. The unique shape of the scale tokens allows you to use them multiple ways in combat, with the curved top allowing the tokens to nest against the base of miniatures, or to be placed on corresponding character sheets and monster cards.Along with Burst Origin token, the Scales Expansion set contains 30 tokens in all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
