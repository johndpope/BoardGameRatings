							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Piquet: PKowboys</name>
									
			<description>Pkowboys is intended to represent skirmish combat between rival gangs (outlaws, lawmen, gunslingers, and townsfolk) in the American West between 1860 and 1900.  Players represent the leaders of different gangs, or in large battles a player may act as the leader of multiple gangs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pkowboys does not use the standard Piquet initiative system.  Instead, We have developed a fast an furious method to handle individual figure movement and action on the tabletop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are the principles behind the design of Pkowboys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Western combat was quick and decisive.    Gun battles lasted minutes or seconds. Any shot has the chance of being lethal. Many gunfighters lost their nerve and fled when under fire. Leadership was as important with gangs of outlaws or lawmen as it was in large battles. The Jesse James/Wild Bill Hickock Theory:  being unlucky is a bad thing no matter how good you are. Gunfight tactics in a nutshell:  move into a good position and shoot like mad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saddle up pardner and fire away!!!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Piquet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
