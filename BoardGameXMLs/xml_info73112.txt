			<description>&amp;quot;Azurik: Rise of Perathia is an action-adventure game developed by Adrenium Games and published by Microsoft Game Studios in 2001. Azurik was an early Xbox game, the first to support anti-aliasing, a relatively new rendering technique for consoles at the time, and featured a score by game composer Jeremy Soule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game centers around the main protagonist, Azurik, as he journeys through the vast world of Perathia gathering elemental disc fragments scattered across the many realms. Azurik is part of the order of the Lore Guardians along with Eldwyn, the grand master and leader, and Balthazar, a professional scholar and combatist. After Balthazar teams up with the guardian of death, they murder Eldwyn and destroy the balance of the elements by destroying the elemental discs, leaving Azurik alone. Now he must defeat Balthazar and bring back all of the disc fragments in order to restore balance, or else face the end of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Azurik can harness the basic elements of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. He can also mix and match powers to make more powers(Water and Air makes lightning and so on)&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Azurik:_Rise_of_Perathia,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
