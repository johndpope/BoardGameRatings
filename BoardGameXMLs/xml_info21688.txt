			<description>Dragon Lords is an exciting and very different type of board game. Gather together with friends to build a fantasy landscape to both explore and wage war upon, all the time trying to gather to you a mighty army of conquest. No warlord though, can hope to win, unless they first raise and train a host of might dragons to soar across the skies, doing battle for their overlord and master. Dragon are the key to victory, for a mighty army, one that has taken you several turns to build, can be crushed by one encounter with one of your foe's mighty dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon Lords uses a unique card based system to create the playing area, and so each game is both different from the next, and a challenge, for players will need to lay down a path that will gain them access to the many special location that will allow then to possibly draw more dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes, magic and many options to customize your dragons await you as does the challenge of defeating your opponents in battle after battle, until only one survive to be declared the Dragon Lord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with well over 350 2X2 inch cards, counters and a fully illustrated set of rule.  Enjoy a night of bloody mayhem and adventure and player Dragon Lords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon Lords can be found at Bad Baby Productions, or bought online at RPGNow, the Edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
