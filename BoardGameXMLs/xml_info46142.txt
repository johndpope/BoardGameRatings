			<description>Campaign Law, 1st Edition is an original Rolemaster core rulebook which is essentially a gamemaster's guide without detailed information about character development, magic, or weapons while the book Character Law is essentially a player's guide.  This book includes information about setting up and running a campaign and information about gods, plants, and animals.  The book also includes an encounter chart, a list of character secondary skills, an equipment list, a list of enchanted herbs, weather charts, a trading chart, and a sample adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This book was later combined with Character Law as Character Law &amp;amp; Campaign Law with some additional material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
