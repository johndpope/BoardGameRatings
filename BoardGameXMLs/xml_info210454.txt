							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heloise: The Thrice-Cursed Medusa</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One day Heloise was exploring an area of the vast swamp that was rumored to be the site of a long-lost city, formerly inhabited by worshippers of infernal creatures, but now buried beneath the marsh and lost to the ages. Heloise saw an odd gold coin resting in some mud, and she picked it up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A terrible creature then appeared to her, telling her that since she had freed it from its prison, it would grant her a wish. Worried that her mother would someday make her stop exploring and focus on running the family business instead, Heloise wished that she would never again have to deal with merchants and workers. In finest devilish fashion, the creature granted her wish by turning her into a medusa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Character Cache is a collection of characters designed to be used in tabletop RPG gaming, either as character concepts for players or as NPCs/villains by GMs. Artist Matt Morrow illustrates the character pieces, and Encoded Designs writes a system-neutral description, including how to incorporate this character into your campaign. These write-ups also include hooks for encounters and adventure inspiration, plus tags for quick reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the system-neutral write-up are stat blocks for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Fate Core&lt;br/&gt;    Savage Worlds&lt;br/&gt;    5e&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
