			<description>Hunter's Island is a last man standing card game. Each turn the players will search the Island for better cards, equip the cards they find or attack the other players. While the player searches the island animals are also there to attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you out hunt the other players?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2-4 players, this card game pits players on a lonely island against the island's dangers and also each other to the last Hunter standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting with the ability to escape and attack, players take turns searching the island to gather equipment or encounter animals and other dangers. Found cards are placed in the player's Storage, where they can be picked up rather than searching the Island or Attacking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must decide which of three areas to search, either safely by camp, the deep island, or crossing the ocean water to another dangerous island while the island's dangers whittle away their life points and equipment. Soon, the opportunity to be the lone Hunter will arise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
