			<description>Invictus &amp;ndash; Latin, meaning &amp;ldquo;unconquered&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 player abstract game played on the spaces of a 9x9 board.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 18 dice pieces, one set black the other white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;Place the 9x9 board between the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next, players turn 3 of their 18 dice pieces so that the top faces show all ones then 3-twos, 3-threes, 3-fours, 3-fives and 3-sixes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now Black sets his dice pieces onto any space of the second and third rows of the board that are closest to him, then White does the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object&lt;br/&gt;Player with the highest score at games end, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play&lt;br/&gt;The fifth row of the board is known as the Divide and divides the board into two territories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player plays black the other white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black moves first, then play alternates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you must take one of two actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.Move a die one space either forward, left, right or diagonally forward, never backwards onto an empty space.&lt;br/&gt;2.Capture a die one space diagonally forward, like a pawn in chess performing a capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When any friendly dice reach an opponent&amp;rsquo;s first row, they are removed from play and used in scoring at endgame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Captures&lt;br/&gt;A friendly die may only capture an opponent&amp;rsquo;s die of equal face value or less, the captured die is returned to your opponent if its face value is greater than one. On receiving the captured die from your opponent you must turn that die so that the face value of the die now reads one less, then place this die onto an empty space on your side of the Divide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any captured dice that have a face value of (1) are removed from play and kept for scoring at endgame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player moves all of his remaining dice onto his opponent&amp;rsquo;s first row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If any of your opponents dice are past the Divide and in your territory at endgame they will be added to your opponents score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Score &lt;br/&gt;Add up all of the top face values of your dice that reached you&amp;rsquo;re opponents first row, any captured dice and any of your dice that were within enemy territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highest score wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
