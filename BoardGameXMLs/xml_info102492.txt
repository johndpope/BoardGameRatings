			<description>Imagine Animal Doctor (known as Imagine: Pet Vet in PAL regions) is a video game by Ubisoft that allows young children to take the place of a vet, take care of animals, and diagnose illnesses. This game allows the player to take care of cats, dogs, rabbits, pigs, and horses. The player of the game starts with an introduction of what you will be doing, and how to get help. The main idea is to get very well known and heal as many animals as possible. Starting with cats you will examine the different types of animals listed above then heal and return them to their owners. In return you will gain money and proceed onto your next goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Imagine: Animal Doctor&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
