			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a lot more things going on than appear to be happening on Fletnern.  Entire organizations are actively working to dominate the entire world.  Though some of these organizations are known to exist, most have hidden their ulterior motives behind their public face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of these organizations works differently.  Some focus on economics, some on politics, and of course, some of them utilize powerful militaries.  So utilizing their individual talents and resources, how do they go about taking over the world?  How do they operate?  How do they keep their secrets?  How do they work with or against all those adventurers out there?  Whether you need examples or guidance on how to set them up yourself, it&amp;rsquo;s right here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Build Your Fantasy World in Small Bites, or Small Bites for short.  Our goal is to take a subject, whether an archetype, a monster class, or some other FRPG theme and bring you as much content about it as we can.  But this isn&amp;rsquo;t a simple one-shot supplement.  We want to get you involved in the process - giving us the themes you want most, the articles you like the best, and the feedback we need to make you happy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the &amp;ldquo;World Walker&amp;rdquo; edition.  The Game Master edition gives you even more, including ideas about campaigns, enemy characters, and world building.  We know that veteran and starting players and game masters are all going to find things they can use, and ideas to spark their characters, campaigns and game worlds!  Come on - You&amp;rsquo;ve got nothing to lose!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains 15 pages of content, compared to the full version which contains 45 pages.  With this many secrets to be kept, much of the information needs to be guarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
