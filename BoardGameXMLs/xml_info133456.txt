			<description>Players each select a colored marble and take turns advancing spaces based on the roll of the die.  Land on another player's marble and he or she must start all over at the bottom of the mountain.  When landing on a designated chance space, players pick up a card and follow the instructions.  Exact amount must be rolled to land on the top space.  First to land on the top space is the winner and, until the next game, reigns KING OF THE MOUNTAIN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
