			<description>crazy palace - Two &amp;quot;crazy&amp;quot; builders with one goal: build the highest palace without it tumbling down!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPONENTS: 21 wooden blocks, 1 die, 2 coloured little figures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INSTRUCTIONS:&lt;br/&gt;Distribute 10 blocks each and place the printed block on the game table, laying it with the word LARGE facing upwards: this will be the base of the building. Choose your pawn and decide who starts first by throwing the dice: the biggest size starts (S, M, and L).&lt;br/&gt; The one who starts throws the dice and, using only one hand, positions a block on any part of the building, placing it so that it rests with the face indicated by the dice (S, M, and L). Each time you position a block you must place the pawn on any part of the block you have just placed and then pass the turn to your rival.&lt;br/&gt; To position a new block you can move your pawn, taking it temporarily from the building. You can position a new block on one of your rival&amp;rsquo;s blocks, but without moving your pawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
