			<description>A Three-Round RPGA Network Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ropes that bind your hands mysteriously disappear, as does the dank smelling cloth that shrouds your eyes.  Dim light filters through the dirty stained glass windows of the chamber in which you stand, yet no shadows dance upon its huge stone walls and an eerie silence fills the massive chamber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the far end of the room rests a large wooden throne.  Seated upon the throne is a small, hooded figure.  From the folds of his black robes a hand emerges and beckons you forward.  Though you may wish to resist you find that your feet have a will of their own as you move towards the mysterious figure.  The echo of your footsteps grows strangely louder.  You turn your head and see that seven other figures also step forward and approach the throne.  Five of you are dressed in prison rags, while one stands garbed in the uniform of a Keeper of the Salek-Hari, the law-mages, one is a priestess of Egal, god of justice and one a sorceress.  These last three bear weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
