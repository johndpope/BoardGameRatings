			<description>HexiMeros TM finds its roots in Chess and various geo-political strategy games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The underlying goals were to produce a game that was:&lt;br/&gt;1. As elegant and direct as Chess. &lt;br/&gt;2. Included the intricacies and intrigue of governmental, business, military and geo-political relations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like Chess, HexiMerosTM consists of players alternately moving playing pieces with the object of winning.  Like the strategy games, HexiMerosTM provides opportunities for alliances, betrayals, making friends and enemies.  Unlike Chess, a Sovereign may be captured and removed from the board.  Unlike the strategy games, everything that happens around the play area and away from the play area is part of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game of HexiMerosTM is played between six opponents who move their pieces alternately on a hexagonal board.  The player with the Silver pieces commences the game. A player is said to &amp;quot;have the Move&amp;quot; when he is in possession of the Token.  The object of the game is to be the last Sovereign on the board.  The players do this by placing other opponents Sovereigns &amp;quot;under attack&amp;quot;, in such a way that the opponent Sovereign may be captured by himself or any other player.  This is repeated until there is only one Sovereign remaining on the board.  The player who achieves this goal is said to be the last Sovereign standing and to have won the game. Each player whose Sovereign has been captured has lost the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the position is such that neither of the last two Sovereigns can be captured, the game is drawn between these two players.  The other players have still lost the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
