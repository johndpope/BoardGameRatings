							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Intergalactic Cooking Challenge</name>
									
			<description>Extra-terrestrial aesthetes have no need for humanity. They have failed to offer anything of lasting artistic value to greater sentient civilization. However, a final hope remains: humanity's culinary prowess. However, it must first be tested in the most rigorous of crucibles&amp;mdash;cooking battles against the universe's best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take the role of chefs thrust into the most defining moments of their far-flung, futuristic lives. In addition to the cooking contests themselves, they may be required to gather rare ingredients, deal with unscrupulous foes, navigate through space intrigue, and heal the wounded hearts of those close to them with a blend of eye-opening flavors and fiery tenacity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics are easy to learn and crafted to promote humorous situations while emulating the cooking anime genre as well as live action cooking contests. Once the game's focus shifts to more personal cooking battles, the action stays hot for non-active players who are invited to take on alternate roles that continue to shape the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
