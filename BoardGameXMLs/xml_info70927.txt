							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crusaders of the Amber Coast</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the year 1206 AD. In the city of Riga, a Christian outpost in the pagan lands of the frozen North, Prince-Bishop Albert founds the Brotherhood of the Sword to subjugate the pagans and convert them to the True Faith. Twenty years later, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, the Stupor Mundi, decrees in his Golden Bull of Rimini that the lands conquered by the Teutonic Order in Prussia will belong to the warrior monks. Knights, friars and colonists from all over the Empire move towards the Baltic Sea to find forgiveness for their sins and commodities for their trade, as the Baltic coast is home to the strangest of the precious stones: Amber. The age of the Northern Crusades has begun.The path to virtue, glory and riches lies in front of your heroes, but countless enemies stand between them and their goals: the ruthless Lithuanians of Archduke Mindaugas, the Mongol raiders of Genhgis Khan's Golden Horde, and emerging Russian Princes like young Aleksandr Nevskij. And in the deep woods and dark marshes of the Baltic Coast, fantastic creatures and ancient deities await.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains all the information required to run your Northern Crusade game with the Basic Roleplaying game system, including magic rules for the Christian crusaders and the pagan druids and witches, as well as game statistics for creatures of the Baltic folklore. Create your own scenarios, with your heroes siding either with the Crusading invaders or with the Baltic natives, or play through the included campaign that spans over several years of game time and takes you through the most important events of the Baltic epic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
