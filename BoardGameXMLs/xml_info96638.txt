							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Agency</name>
									
			<description>Players are agents working for a counter terrorist organization.  They work with the other players to prevent disasters in the city.  They know where the terrorist targets are and must get themselves and other agents to those sites to diffuse the threat.  One player is a double agent working with the terrorists.  The other players must find a way to make the city safe in order to win.&lt;br/&gt;Cards are played on buildings in the city where threats are taking place. On their turns the players choose one action from 9 available to diffuse the threats.  If all threats in the city are eliminated, the players win, but if there are three disasters, the double agent and the terrorists win.  A threat becomes a disaster if threat card is drawn that is identical to a threat already in place.  Players can deploy other players to danger zones, they can move themselves, follow a tip, gather intelligence, or interrogate suspects.  They can confront and kill other agents if they suspect them to be the double agent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
