							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DCS: UH-1H Huey</name>
									
			<description>The UH-1 Iroquois, better known as the Huey, is one of the most iconic helicopters in the world. Indispensable in the Vietnam War, the Huey continues to serve in both military and civilian roles around the globe today. DCS: UH-1H features an updated model of the helicopter armed with rockets, gatling guns, and door gunner machine guns. The simulation offers both extreme realism in its flight and systems modeling as well as a variety of options to reduce the learning curve for new players, including an Easy flight mode. DCS: UH-1H provides multiple player positions, including pilot, co-pilot, and door gunners. A handcrafted storyline campaign is included as well as a number of single missions and a training course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
