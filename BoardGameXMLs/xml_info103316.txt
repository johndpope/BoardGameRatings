							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The World of Arannoch</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arannoch is a relatively dry world of vast scrublands, ancient, weathered mesas, and sandy deserts. Its seas are large, but often relatively shallow, though filled with an abundance of fish and other life, which perhaps compensates for the often-empty and seemingly desolate stretches of land that reach to the horizon. Arannoch is a land of endless roads, far-off cities, and forgotten ruins, all beneath a sky that is heated by the blazing sun by day, and yet chilled by the winds at night. It is a world of extremes, where only the hardy survive. And yet, despite the hostile environment, life flourishes on this world, though it is not dense or plentiful, but it is persistent and can be found in all but the most remote and sun-baked deserts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many centuries ago, it is said that Arannoch was a far more lush world, and it&amp;rsquo;s lands grew green and rains fell plentifully, and the world was like that of a tropical jungle. But then the Godswar came upon this remote world, as the gods of Good fought the final battle against Sarkophka, the Undead Lord of Plagues. It was here that the defeated god made his last stand, and it is on this world that his tomb lies buried in the wastes, nearly forgotten by all. Centuries past, the tales became myths, and even they gradually faded, crumbling like the mountains of this now-cursed world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After that war, the land is said to have changed&amp;hellip; perhaps the stories are only that, but the legends say that Arannoch soon lost its lush forests and verdant fields, only to have them replaced with brushland and deserts. Many scoff at these tales, saying that there is no way a world could change so drastically in such short order, and most pay no heed to the older men and women who whisper of the way things used to be or even of the Godswar itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, life on Arannoch is more difficult, yet still flourishing where it can. The desert can be merciless, and the rains never come as often one would hope, but those who are wily, cunning, and skillful can make a good life for themselves on this world. Trade flourishes, large wars are generally unknown (though border skirmishes and highway raiders are a matter of daily life), and science is beginning to rise amid a culture steeped in superstition. In all, life isn&amp;rsquo;t too bad on this little desert world &amp;ndash; legends of a greener age excluded, of course &amp;ndash; but far too few even recall the name of the horror that lies buried on their world&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
