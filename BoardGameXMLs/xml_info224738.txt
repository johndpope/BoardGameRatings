			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thirty years later, the galaxy is still trying to pull itself together. The minor powers have all aligned themselves with either the Solar Federation, who holds more developed systems, but fewer vessels and is rumoured to have no strangelet weapons left, or the Collective of Harania, who has fewer systems, but is rumoured to still have a sizable strangelet missile fleet left, originally intended to be targeted against the Solidarity of Breshket as a second strike, but never used. The number of devices may number in the high tens to low hundreds, but no matter the number, it is enough to sway many minor powers to the Collective&amp;rsquo;s side as the immense might of even one strangelet device is evident.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cold war is in progress, and espionage is rife on both sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This item presents campaign setting background and some details, as well as an introductory scenario presented in six episodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
