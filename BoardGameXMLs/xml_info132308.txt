			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boarsdraft is a game where you can gain a reputation as a know-it-all by failing to make a new friend or make a new friend by putting your popularity on the line. The only thing that is certain at Boarsdraft is that there is always someone willing to put the students in danger to get what they want. Are you willing to risk your friends and free time to keep evil at bay? I hope you are because at Boarsdraft, evil may be your newest teacher, your best friend, or some deep magic long hidden in the depths of the school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At its very core Boarsdraft is a roleplaying game about young witches and wizards learning magic and growing up at a school of&lt;br/&gt;magic. The core mechanics of the game are risk and reward, where players risk things they care about like friendships and popularity in the hopes of earning things like a good reputation or a clue to the mystery of what is really going on at the school. The amount that the players risk (and hope to gain) sets the difficulty which the players must overcome with their skills and traits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using their skills and traits helps the players advance so they can take on riskier tasks later on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
