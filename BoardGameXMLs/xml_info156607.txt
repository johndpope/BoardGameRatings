			<description>from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;An ancient race known as the Timemasters has begun a war with the fanatical cybernetic aliens known as the Dredlons that now threatens to tear apart very fabric of time and space across the known universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To prevent this, a renegade Timemaster without a name has broken away from his people and has recruited a small band of followers, the player characters, to help him stop the war, and maybe explore a bit of the universe along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What You Need to Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TWERPS Basic Rules, Space Cadets (Campaign Book 3), Rocket Rangers (Campaign Book 6) and Twerps Twek (Campaign Book 7). In a pinch, any TWERPS campaign book may provide useful material. You will also require two ten-sided Dice (d10), paper and some pencils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
