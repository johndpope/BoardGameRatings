							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City of Cherafir D5: Clothier</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Valeth the Robewright runs a small, exclusive clothier&amp;rsquo;s shop that specializes in custom-tailored vestments, gowns, robes, and other ecclesiastic wear. He and his journeymen produce garments featuring designs for the Laranian, Peonian, Halean, and Save-K&amp;rsquo;norian churches and fighting orders. His clientele are senior clerics and noble religious warriors who can afford his fine wares. Despite his upstanding reputation, there is more to Valeth than meets the eye.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This location expansion is intended for use with the City of Cherafir article (COL #5701). It describes the master clothier and his establishment. Full-color plans of the building are included, along with several adventure hooks the GM can use to bring the location into play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
