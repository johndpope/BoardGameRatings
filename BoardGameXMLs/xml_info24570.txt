							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jangala</name>
									
			<description>Jangala is played on a very small board (5x5) with very few playing pieces (3 per player).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start in one edge with your 3 pieces of different size and must try to reach the opposing edge first to become winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sounds very easy, but that's not true! The problem is that you are only allowed to move on empty fields or on fields with pieces not smaller than yours. Additionally, only the top pieces can move... so it's clear, that bringing your fattie on the other side of the board is really challenging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
