			<description>Vagadas is a mancala inspired game of wandering. After setup of the 18 modular land tiles and placement of goods on each tile, players take turns moving the tokens around the board to gain points based on the tokens they are moving and where those tokens end the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;81 tokens (9 each of cargo, fish, food, gold, love, people, stone, water, and wood.)&lt;br/&gt;1 bag&lt;br/&gt;18 Land Tiles&lt;br/&gt;5 Player tokens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup:&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the 18 land tiles and make a 6 x 3 pattern (You may vary this modular board as long as there are at least 2 rows of tiles). Draw 4 random tokens from the bag and place on each tile, following the rules of each if needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;Players will take turns going North/South or East/West depending on which side of their player token is face up. Players will take all the tokens on a tile, and moving in the desired direction, place one token on each tile until all the tokens in hand are exhausted. After all tokens are placed, scoring will happen depending on which tile the player ended placing tokens. Play repeats until there are no legal moves and the player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
