			<description>From the PDF Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;human(ish) is a game of modern supernatural horror, where the player characters are the monsters. They are the Vampires, Werewolves and Ghosts that give rise to modern and&amp;nbsp;ancient legends and haunt the darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game about confronting the monster and&amp;nbsp;the darkness inside everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are various supernatural types described in this book&amp;nbsp;that can be used as player characters, and a description of various ways that the game can&amp;nbsp;be played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Back of the Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the dark of the night, strange things lurk and howl. The supernatural are not just stories to frighten unruly children or provide a plot for a cheap movie, they are real!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And what is worse, not only are they supernatural, but they are also human. Well, human(ish) anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a roleplaying game about being those creatures. It is about reconciling what you were with what you are. It is about facing up to the monster inside. It is a game of action and interaction. It is whatever sort of game you want it to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This complete game contains rapid and uncomplicated character creation, fast action resolution and beyond human adventures, and is everything you need to play except some dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore the dark side...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
