			<description>Xeno is an abstract game of the &amp;quot;Laskers&amp;quot; (stacking pieces) family which is played on the surface of a sphere.  The game &amp;quot;board&amp;quot; is a plastic sphere with Velcro squares attached to it, and the pieces are also Velcro, so they stick to the squares and each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was apparently at times known as Obol, The Game of O, or O*, and was manufactured as early as 1988 though the last version was made in 1991. The standard game is on a 24-square sphere.  A 12-square sphere was also available, the rulebook advertises a 30-square sphere, and there are indications that at one point they had a 36-square sphere, though there is no confirmation any of the larger sizes were ever available for sale.  Also, a sphere with many more squares (120?) exists only in prototype form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook includes rules for other games, including a checkers variant and a (credited) version of Sid Sackson's Focus for the spherical board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        I can confirm that at least 5 copies of a 30-ball were sold at one game convention in Los Angeles (I got one of them). I can also confirm seeing a much, MUCH larger ball -- several feet in diameter -- with lots of spaces and a 4 (5?) person game in progress (same convention). ~~~~&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        I can also confirm having purchased one of those 30-balls. Sadly, it was lost in a move, and I want to replace it. ~~~~&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
