							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kinfolk: A Breed Apart (W20)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Born to Run&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Garou are born of two kinds: humans and wolves. These are their Kinfolk &amp;mdash; those &amp;ldquo;of the blood.&amp;rdquo; These special people &amp;mdash; whether of two legs or four &amp;mdash; carry in them the hope of the Garou: the promise of future generations. Although Garou are born to Kinfolk, nobody knows they&amp;rsquo;re different until they undergo their First Change. Until such a blessed (or cursed) time, they are just like their more mundane Kin. Most live as humans, suffering the foibles of humanity, all the while hoping they&amp;rsquo;re secretly special, that they harbor the wolf within. Even though that wolf will never howl for the majority of Kin, they&amp;rsquo;ve still got a vital role in the war, aiding the effort from behind the lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stuck in Second Gear&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book gives the Kinfolk the spotlight and shows how they live their lives as adjuncts to the Garou &amp;mdash; werewolves who could be their sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, even their parents. It explores the society of Kinfolk, both those &amp;ldquo;kenning&amp;rdquo; (in the know) and &amp;ldquo;callow&amp;rdquo; (ignorant of the Garou). Storytellers will find advice on running Kinfolk-oriented chronicles, while players can discover special Kinfolk Gifts and fetishes, as well as learn the many differences between Garou and Fera Kin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kinfolk: A Breed Apart contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Overview of the Kinfolk, both kenning and callow, including some of the Fellowships founded by Kinfolk to aid the Garou cause &amp;mdash; and to protect themselves from their cousins&amp;rsquo; Rage.&lt;br/&gt;    Character creation for playing Kinfolk, including new Skills, Backgrounds, Merits and Flaws, as well as special Kin rites, Gifts, and fetishes.&lt;br/&gt;    Guidelines for running Kinfolk chronicles, as well as in-depth information on the Kin-Fetches, the unique spirits used by Garou to watch over their distant cousins and warn the tribes if one of them should undergo the First Change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
