			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carmaux Zombie is a board game limited to Android platform with multiplayer offline/online, and there is not a concrete version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is similar to the popular board game with tiles designed by Klaus-J&amp;uuml;rgen Wrede, but allows the inclusion of zombies instead of peasants and monks with additional rule.&lt;br/&gt;It is based on the closure of towns and streets. Each player has 6 followers and 3 zombies. In each turn, the player can place a follower on a road or town to the north, east, south, west of the tile inserted. You can not directly insert a follower on a territory already conquered. You can put followers on towns and streets, but you can not put them on green areas.&lt;br/&gt;In subsequent turns the enclosed territory ascribe the score to the player who has the most number of followers placed on it.&lt;br/&gt;At the closure of a land the players regain their followers on it.&lt;br/&gt;POINTS FOR STREETS:&lt;br/&gt;1 point for each tile of the enclosed territory;&lt;br/&gt;1 point for the territories are not closed at the end of game;&lt;br/&gt;POINTS FOR TOWNS:&lt;br/&gt;1 point for each tile for enclosed territory represented on two tiles, in case of shields on the towns +1 point per shield;&lt;br/&gt;2 points for an enclosed territory represented on more than two tiles, in case of shields on the towns +2 points per shield;&lt;br/&gt;1 point for the territories are not closed at the end of game, in case of shields on the towns +1 point per shield;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rule about zombies give the possibility of inserting a zombie on a tile just placed infesting the territories it represents. A land infested of any kind, once complete granting the holder (also applies to the player who has inserted the zombie) 1 point for each tile that composes it. At the end of the game a zombie entitle the player who has placed it 3 points for each complete territory represented in part on the tile where the zombie has been put.
