			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AnimeniA uses the SPFX system, which is a modular roleplaying rules set, designed to allow users to create a game system that is as light or crunchy as they desire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is built around four standard gaming concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;From Publishers website:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters&lt;br/&gt;Characters are made of 3 major stats; Physical, Mental, and Presence all rated between 2 and 7. Each stat has substats  that can boost the number in certain situations up to +3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conflict &lt;br/&gt;Conflict is a roll off between two characters in the game. The roll is stat+skill+dice, with the higher roll winning. The stat can have one of the substats  applied if appropriate. The character can use their skill set if it is appropriate or expertise. If the character has neither then it is just the stat. situational modifiers can also be applied by the Architect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Props&lt;br/&gt;Props are equipment, weapons, vehicles, objects, and other stuff in the game. Each has a DAN representing how much damage it can take before breaking, or even how much protection it might provide in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat &lt;br/&gt;Combat is a conflict with a few extra rules added in. Characters will roll initiative (Physical +Speed +Dice) the higher number goes first. Each character takes turn performing actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;there is no publication year on the PDF &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
