			<description>In this tactical spatial two player game, played on a 3 x 3 field, each player has eight playing pieces: 2x2, 2x3, 2x4 and 2x6 movement points (printed on the top of the pieces). The goal is to be on top of two equally tall stacks of four or five pieces in height. &lt;br/&gt;Players start on their side of the field, bringing in their pieces, which move the number of movement points printed on them. A movement point can be spend horizontally or vertically, as when a piece climbs up on top of another piece (or a stack of them) or down. Only the pieces on top of a stack may move, everything below them is blocked. &lt;br/&gt;The first player to top two stacks of four or two of five pieces in height is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is named after two similar looking mountains in Namibia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
