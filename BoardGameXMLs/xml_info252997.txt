							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mapmaker: The Gerrymandering Game</name>
									
			<description>You are a mapmaker, which means you make maps&amp;hellip; and determine who wins elections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You belong to a political party: Red Elephants, Blue Donkeys, Yellow Porcupines, or Green Leaves. Your only job? Make sure your party wins the next election. You get to redraw the districts. But so do the other mapmakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone starts with the same number of voters, spread across counties. Players each place four district borders per turn. When a district gets closed off, whoever has the most voters inside claims it. At the end of the game, the entire board will be sectioned into districts. The party with the most districts wins. If there&amp;rsquo;s a tie, the party with the most swing counties wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must scramble to draw the best lines first. Can you crack and pack voters? Can you scheme and strategize? Can you create unfair, lopsided, strangely shaped districts that will guarantee your party&amp;rsquo;s victory? Mapmaker: The Gerrymandering Game is fast to learn and fast to play. It&amp;rsquo;s full of surprises, maneuvers, and outmaneuvers. It&amp;rsquo;s a hands-on way to try out gerrymandering yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
