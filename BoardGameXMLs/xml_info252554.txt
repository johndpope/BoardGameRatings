			<description>Not to be confused with Citadel Combat Cards (1992).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Citadel Combat Cards is a fast-paced game for 2 players, in which you pit your fighters &amp;ndash; each of which is represented by a card &amp;ndash; against your opponent&amp;rsquo;s fighters. Whoever wins the most battles wins the game! Each game lasts for 6 rounds, during each of which attacks are made &amp;ndash; ranged, melee and psychic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are 60 cards, split into 2 decks &amp;ndash; 30 for the Space Marines, and 30 for the sinister forces of Chaos &amp;ndash; each of which fulfils a battlefield role (HQ, Troops, Elites, Fast Attack and Heavy Support). Setting up your cards and deploying the right card at the right time is the key to victory &amp;ndash; special bonuses are applied when the right cards are supporting each other!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card features an image of a Citadel miniature, along with its name. 2 reference cards make it easy to determine special bonuses and victors for each battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
