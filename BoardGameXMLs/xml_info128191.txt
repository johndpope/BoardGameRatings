			<description>Aim of the game: The prince has been turned into a frog. Can you return him to his natural state by collecting kisses and the golden ball, and placing him on the right lily pad?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How it is played:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central piece of the game is a clear plastic cylinder that has a disk inside. The disk shows the prince on one side, and a frog on the other. It is turned over via a magnetic mechanism: If the cylinder is put on the castle tile, it shows the frog. If it is put on the correct lily pad, the tile is turned over again and the prince reappears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turn spinning a spinner. The spinner has three different areas: One shows one &amp;quot;kiss&amp;quot; symbol (a pair of lips), the second shows two kisses, and the third one the golden ball. If the spinner points toward one of the kiss symbols, the active player gets the corresponding number of kiss tokens. If it points toward the golden ball, the active player gets the ball token (there is only one ball token, and it constantly changes its owner according to the spinner's results). A player can try rescuing the prince as soon as he/she has collected 3 kisses and the golden ball. To rescue the prince, the cylinder has to be put on the correct lily pad. But only one of the lily pads will make the prince reappear. If the player chooses the wrong lily pad, he/she loses their kiss tokens and has to start collecting new ones. If it is correct and the frog turns into a prince, that player wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
