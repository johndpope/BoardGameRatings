			<description>So said Brigadier General Norman D Cota of the US 29th Infantry Division as he moved troops off the beach on that, the longest of June days. This supplement by Richard Clarke presents us with twenty-one scenarios for I Ain't Been Shot Mum from D-Day itself. Focussing on the US beaches (a Commonwealth version is to follow) it looks at both the amphibious forces and those airborne troops who held the line around St-Mere-Eglise. Some scenarios are linked, others are stand alone, but together they form a patchwork of actions that bring to life the heroism and desperation of that day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
