			<description>Based on a popular French series of comic books (&amp;quot;Le Joe Bar Team&amp;quot;), this motorcycle racing game consists of large paper tracks, colored pencils and a special racing ruler.&lt;br/&gt;The game is essentially based on a vector system and makes good use of the custom ruler (which was cleverly conceived).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The (very good) game was designed by the actual creator of the comic books, which is rather remarkable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
