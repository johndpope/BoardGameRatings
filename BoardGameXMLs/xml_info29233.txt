			<description>Darkness and Glory is a strategy card game of the underground world of the drow, also known as the dark elves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players represent the leaders of the great houses, large, extended families of dark elves bound by blood and ambition.  It is the goal of each house to rise in power by gaining the favor of the evil deity they worship.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;In Darkness and Glory, players compete for this favor in different crises by playing cards that represent military units, nobles and magical spells.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The game sets up and plays quickly, putting players directly into the action.  Fate cards provide color and immerse the player into the chaotic society of the drow.  No dice or random elements are in the game, allowing players to focus on the strategy and card play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     five-page rulebook&lt;br/&gt;     45 soldier cards&lt;br/&gt;     32 noble cards&lt;br/&gt;     27 spell cards&lt;br/&gt;     24 fate cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available from Brothers-in-Arms Games at biagamesonline.tripod.com - check out the site and check out the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
