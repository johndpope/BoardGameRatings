			<description>As in the family version of Password Card Game, teams of two compete to see who can guess the secret password first. What one-word clue could get your partner to respond with the password? But you've got to be clever when you communicate because players can give only one-word clues, your opponents can hear the clues, and the fewer clues given the higher the score. The Junior version uses simpler words. The team that guesses the most words with the fewest clues wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;originally seen in Endless Games 2008 catalog for which was never released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
