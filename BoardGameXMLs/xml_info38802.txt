			<description>Each player (from 2 to 4) has a special cup containing one single dice. The player in turn after shaking his special dice cup, secretly examine the result and announces it. This announcement can be or not in agreement with the actual result. The other players can distrust in the veracity of the affirmation and then control the dice result looking through the hole on the top of the device. If the suspicion was false, the player in turn moves his pawn the double dice result forwards. If the bluff really existed and was correctly pointed, the player in turn must move his pawn the double dice result backwards. If there is no suspicions, the player move his pawn the actual dice number obtained forwards. The winner is the first player to reach the final space on the board. Symbols on some fields change the position of the pawns when they land on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
