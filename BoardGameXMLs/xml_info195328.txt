			<description>INTRODUCTION: TRENCH SOLDIERS is a solitaire game of Combat and Survival in the muddy trenches in France or Belgium during World War I. The player assumes the role of an Infantry Soldier during the grueling and miserable tour in the Trenches. As a Soldier, you are a member of a Rifle Platoon responsible for securing your Sectors of Front by successfully taking enemy positions and defending yours with the least amount of casualties. As you survive and gain experience, your Soldier will improve his attributes and gain skills to help him further survive the horrors of War in the Trenches.&lt;br/&gt; GAME OBJECTIVE &lt;br/&gt;The objective of TRENCH SOLDIERS is to successfully survive a Tour in the trenches along the Western Front during World War I. A Tour consists of a number of Rotations in the Trenches. The Player can play a Short Tour (1 Rotation), an Average Tour (2 Rotations) or a Long Tour (3 Rotations). Each Rotation consists of making a Rotation Deck of 20 &amp;ldquo;Trench Life&amp;rdquo; Cards and once all Trench Life Cards have been drawn and resolved, the Rotation is over and the Player totals his Rotation VP and adds it to his Tour VP. Once all Rotations have been completed, the Player totals his Tour VP and then compares it to the Victory Determination Table to determine the level of success. Players can choose to play as the Germans, French, Commonwealth (British, Australian/New Zealanders or Canadians) or the Americans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME FEATURES: TRENCH SOLDIERS features plenty of colorful Game Counters and Game Mat. The Game provides plenty of grim themes associated with the War in the Trenches. Counters include Infantry Soldiers, HMGs, Flamethrowers, MK-IV Tanks, A7 Tanks, FT-17 Tanks, Pillboxes, Aircraft, Sub-Machineguns and Light Machineguns from the various Combatants. In addition to the standard Western Front Campaign Scenario there is, also, a Gallipoli/Palestine Campaign with supporting Terrain Markers and Counters for the Ottoman Turks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TRENCH SOLDIERS can be found at the following URL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.berserkergames.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.berserkergames.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
