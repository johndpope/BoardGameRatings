These vary and are linked so that each 6 missions complete an operation. There are a total of 5 operations in the game. &lt;br/&gt;As the MechCommander you job, in the missions, will be to best order your Mechs on the field so you can complete your objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The damage and captures done during missions are displayed on the Mech bay, in between mission. There you will do your field repairs, and increase your forces by buying new Mechs, MechWarriors, vehicles, and components for your Mechs (weapons and sensors). This is possible due to the resource points wich you gain by completing mission objectives, deploying forces below the maximum weight limit, selling captured Mechs or components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
