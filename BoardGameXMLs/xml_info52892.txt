			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interstellar war destroyed the navigation beams, leaving thousands of planets isolated and billions of wayfarers stranded in their last ports of call. Out here on the Medieval Rim of the galaxy, the locals don't even know what a spaceship is. For more than eleven years, the navbeam recievers have remained silent ... just tiny blue lights, blinking in the darkness: NO SIGNAL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They call this planet Vanth, and they call the starport &amp;quot;God City.&amp;quot; In the old days, space merchants played the &amp;quot;visitors from the godly realms&amp;quot; routine and the locals - accustomed to sorcery, like most medievals - ate it whole. That lie is a luxury no one can afford anymore, and God City is going native, becoming as much a fantasy metropolis as anything else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wizards and warriors of Vanth have accepted that the &amp;quot;sky gods&amp;quot; are here to stay. The star-soldiers and space-merchants wonder if there's anything left of the galaxy they remember. In a situation like this, there's only one reasonable course of action left: make friends, form a party, and go adventuring!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
