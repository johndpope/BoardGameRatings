			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Beacon fantasy role-playing&lt;br/&gt;system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beacon started out with my desire to build a fast and fun fantasy RPG that I could play with my kids and my friends. In the past I played my share of RPGs and had made my share of house rules, however on returning to the hobby I wanted to simplify things. Keep the game fast and fun like it was in the olden times. I latched onto Microlite d20 for its clean and simple rules, but also for its basic compatibility with the large amount of material published for d20 systems such as 3rd edition Dungeons and Dragons. Microlite was great&amp;hellip; but I wanted a little more under the hood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s different?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beacon has its origins in Microlite d20 and shares some features of that system, namely;&lt;br/&gt; Magic based on a hit point based system.&lt;br/&gt; Simple and fast combat system.&lt;br/&gt; Streamlined stats and character classes.&lt;br/&gt;A simple but effective skill system that allows the players and GM to base results on how a task is described.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition Beacon has its own spin on things such as:&lt;br/&gt; Simple but robust class advancement;&lt;br/&gt; Spells modified for point based casting;&lt;br/&gt; A simple phased combat system;&lt;br/&gt; A critical hit/fumble table for magic and combat;&lt;br/&gt; Streamlined monster statistics.&lt;br/&gt; A silver based money standard; and&lt;br/&gt; Druids are hedge magey magic users and not clerics!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
