							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City of Shiran</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shiran is H&amp;acirc;rn&amp;rsquo;s smallest city. Located on the north bank of the Thard River near Lake Benath, it is the second-largest settlement in the Thardic Republic and capital of Shiran Province, one of six in the Republic. Shiran is one of the Republic&amp;rsquo;s economic and cultural centers. The city has a reputation for corruption and hedonism and is known throughout H&amp;acirc;rn as the &amp;ldquo;City of Sins.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shiran offers game masters many opportunities as the site of urban intrigue and adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shiran article contains an overview of the city's history, economics, religion, government, and military forces. In addition to a full-page color player map, color GM maps are provided for each district of the city and more than 125 locations are described. Color floor plans and detailed descriptions are included for the Pamesani Arena, site of gladiatorial games and depraved spectacles; the Crimson Palace, H&amp;acirc;rn's most famous house of courtesans; and the Temple of Halea, the Empress of Opulence and Queen of Pleasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some material in this article was originally published in Cities of Hârn (1983) and Son of Cities (1987). The article has been greatly expanded and organized to allow for future expansion of new plans and sites within the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
