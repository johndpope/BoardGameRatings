							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">CyberMage: Darklight Awakening</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;CyberMage is a first-person shooter game with RPG elements designed by David W. Bradley. It was created by Origin and released by Electronic Arts in late 1995. Set in a cyberpunk reality, the game is characterized by a dark, heavy atmosphere. It wasn't particularly successful in sales, which is attributable to high system requirements and gameplay difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in the year 2044, the game features a world ruled by corporations and groups of anti-corporation rebels. The corporations, faced with the rebellion and competition among themselves, start working on implant products that lead to hybrid humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following this, the player wakes up in a bio-gen tube in a strange suit, with a gem implanted in his forehead. The gem is the Darklight; a stone of magical power. After hearing gunshots and explosions, the player crawls out of the tube to find the aftermath of the battle generated by those trying to find him. Amnesiac and disorientated, the player from this point on must try to understand what his true identity is.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cybermage&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
