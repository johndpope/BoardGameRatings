			<description>Sublimation is a card game that blends familiar elements found in game such as Uno or War and combines them into one entertainingly fun game. Players are dealt a specific number of cards and are placed in a specific arrangement. The first player to get rid of all their cards is the winner, however it's not that easy, players will have to play strategically by setting themselves up for advantageous plays or by setting up their opponents by causing them to pick up extra cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games always start off polite, but as soon as it looks like someone is going to win, the claws come out. Enjoy watching your opponents squirm as you force their hands, and relish in the victory when you triumphantly play your last card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
