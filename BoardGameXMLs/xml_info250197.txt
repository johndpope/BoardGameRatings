							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">50 Wasteland Caravan Haulers Set 4</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the days after the fall of civilization the highways, interstates, and primary roads are still active with the presence of drivers. Many of these travelers are post modern caravan haulers, daring the marauders, mutant beasts, and assorted hazards to deliver much sought after goods and supplies to survivor settlements. This random list provides 50 of such examples. Included in each entry is the driver name, the type of vehicle they are using, and the most important goods that they are carrying. The GM is free to add to or otherwise modify this list of hauled supplies as desired. Need a few supply laden victims for that crew of highway marauders? Use this chart! Want to add an adventure hook to the campaign centered around a settlement waiting on much needed cargo? Use this chart! Just need to fill up the highways? Use this chart!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
