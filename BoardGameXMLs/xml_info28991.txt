			<description>From the publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's award night and Tom Speed's latest film, The Vampire Detective, has just swept the board and garnered five Skellies - for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Screenplay. Sadly, Tom Speed's award for Best Actor was accepted posthumously by his wife, Zara Vicars, as Tom was killed in a driving accident late last night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite this note of sadness, celebrations are in full swing at the The Vampire Detective post-award party. Deals are being cut for future productions and everyone is having a good time enjoying the atmosphere and mingling with Hollywood's movers and shakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is there anything suspicious about Tom Speed's death? Who will win next year's Skellies? Find out at Halloween Lies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Halloween Lies lasts for about four hours and is suited to an evening. It is often played over a meal -- a finger buffet if possible to allow guests to circulate and talk in private.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.freeformgames.com/game_details.php?31&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.freeformgames.com/game_details.php?31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
