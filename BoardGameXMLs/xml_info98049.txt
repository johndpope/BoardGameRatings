			<description>My World, My Way, released in Japan as Sekai wa Atashi de Mawatteru is a role-playing game developed by Global A Entertainment and published by Atlus in North America on February 3, 2009. The game puts the player into the role of Princess Elise, a young, spoiled princess on a quest to impress a handsome adventurer into being her boyfriend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My World, My Way features two key game-play elements. One of which is Princess Elise's ability to pout, which prompts enemies and the game's landscape alike to change to her will through the usage of &amp;quot;pout points&amp;quot;. By expending Pout Points the player can do a number of things to make tasks in the game easier, including forcing enemies to drop more money or experience points, completing quests automatically and altering the game's current environment to fulfill in-game requests due to certain items and enemies only being in certain areas. Princess Elise has the ability to make an environment area barren, a grassland, a forest, an island, a fire pit, a graveyard, a desert and more. As the player advances in the game, Elise's selfishness is refined and she gains a variety of different commands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second element is Elise's pet &amp;quot;Mimic Slime&amp;quot;, which the player controls in battle along with Elise herself. Instead of leveling up via experience points, the Mimic Slime's abilities increase via mimicking the game's enemies. An example being that if it mimics an enemy with a high amount of hit points, its own hit points will increase, and if that enemy has the ability to equip a certain piece of equipment the Mimic Slime will gain that trait too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player traverses the game's world via an unconventional world map. Players choose a town area for the princess to visit, and once she enters, there will be a grid representing the surrounding landscape. One square has a town, one will have a gate, and the rest will be environment squares she can change. In order to unlock the gate, the princess has to fulfill requests from the town's mayor. Once she is in an area, the player can press the A button to search for items and monsters. After a period of time the area will run out of items or opponents; the player can then use the princess's Pout Points to refresh the area, drawing more enemies there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;My World, My Way (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
