			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some people are able to push themselves harder than others. They are able to tap into a reserve of strength and will and increase their strength and power. This however comes at a cost, leaving them weaker than before, but sometimes that is all you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These feats are called by many names such as Overdrive or Limit Breakers, but the common term is &amp;ldquo;Blood Feats&amp;rdquo;. They are a way of pushing the mind, body and spirit further than normal but at a cost to health or something else. You achieve greatness now, but at a greater cost later. Which may injure you, or worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the feats may be considered to be overpowered, so please think carefully before using them in your games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
