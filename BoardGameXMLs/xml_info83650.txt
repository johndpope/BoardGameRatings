			<description>Two groups of friends meet while vacationing on a tropical island.  While relaxing at the local tiki bar, they enter into a friendly wager.  They will take to the skies, and each team of friends will race through the tropical skies, plunging by parachute back to the island.  The last group back to the tiki bar buys a round for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paradise Plunge is a game of strategy for two players who must assemble their teams in the air and reach the island and the tiki bar before their opponents.  Players begin with their teams of parachuters spread across the tiles that make up the sky over the island.  Each turn, a player may move one of their parachuters, &amp;quot;play the wind&amp;quot; by rearranging the tiles in a row or column according to direction of the wind as marked on the tiles, or rotate one or two tiles so that the wind on those tiles points in a different direction.  Movement is complicated by the fact one player may push an adjacent player in the direction of the wind, but may not separate groups of three or four of the opponent's parachuters.  The winner is the player to move all four of their parachuters to adjacent tiles with one of those parachuters on or adjacent to the island tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
