			<description>As any Beekeeper worth their weight in wax, knows the queen is central to the health of the hive. In this fun new card game, you handle the hives as your swarm of drones and queens is flipped and rearranged. Create two colonies before your opponents do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the deck of cards. Each player draws 16 cards face down from the deck. Then, each player makes two piles of 8 cards face down (4x2 grids). These are their two hives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player&amp;rsquo;s turn they will choose any card (except for their first turn where each player must choose their queen) and replace a face down card with the chosen card face up. The player will look at the card they chose and put it in the corresponding numbered location in the hive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will continue to replace face down cards with each new card in their hand until you can no longer play any more cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the overturned card is a queen, move it over to the other hive and start working on both hives at the same time. Once a queen is placed into a hive, she cannot be moved out. However, the queen is a wild card and can be moved around within the hive&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player draws a card they can&amp;rsquo;t play, they discard it into the discard pile and then their turn is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first person to complete two hives. Each hive must have a queen and the rest of the numbers in order and all turned face up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
