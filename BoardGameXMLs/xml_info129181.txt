							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wizard&#039;s Castle</name>
									
			<description>Game Documentation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many cycles ago, in the kingdom of N'dic, the Gnomic wizard Zot forged his great *Orb of Power*. Soon after doing this, he vanished, leaving behind his vast subterranean castle filled with esurient monsters, fabulous treasures, and the incredible *Orb of Zot*. From that time hence, many a bold youth has ventured into the Wizard's Castle. As yet, *none* has ever emerged victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wizard's Castle is a computerized simulation of one of the most common and popular fantasy motifs - the lone adventurer's quest within an immense underground labyrinth. Each game is separate from all others, so the game is a challenge even after you have won several times. Each game will result in a win or a loss, depending on a player's skill and luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
