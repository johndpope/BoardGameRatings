							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Siege: Heart of Darkness</name>
									
			<description>Driven from Rokugan by the wrathful forces of the Emerald Champion, the Dark Naga and his enslaved minions have wound their way through the treacherous lands between the Empire and the Colonies and emerged, secretive, near the outskirts of the Second City. The humans will pay for their effrontery. This insult will not go unanswered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will yet be an empire of serpents that will bring to an end the tyranny of the mammals, and the Second City will be but the first to burn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Siege: Heart of Darkness is a new way to play multiplayer Legend of the Five Rings, pitting multiple players as defenders of the city against one assailant piloting the Siege deck. Face the dread Dark Naga forces with either the three decks included in this product (or with your own) and take part in the defense of the Second City for the glory of the Empire of Rokugan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
