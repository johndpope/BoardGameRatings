			<description>It's hard work being a Pacific salmon. In this game players start out with a population of 30,000 salmon eggs. By rolling the die and following the instructions on the cards, players &amp;quot;live&amp;quot; the journey of their salmon population as they develop in a stream, make their way along the Snake or Columbia rivers to the ocean, then return to the stream to mate before dying of sheer exhaustion. Along the way the salmon encounter many hazards such as predators and dams that diminish their numbers. The winner is the player who returns to the spawning site with the most adult salmon. Excellent life cycle teaching aid. Grades 7+.Developed by Steve Parker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
