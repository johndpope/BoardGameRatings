			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ancient times, oceans and mountain streams ran red with blood of brave Hawaiian warriors until king Kamehameha conquered and united the Islands. &lt;br/&gt;Though the Hawaiians were poetic and daily worshiped their gods, they took great pride in perfecting the art of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These muscular six- to seven-foot warriors in war helmets and loin cloths could trip, paralyze, strangle their enemy, dodge blows and strike with speed and force. &lt;br/&gt;They used spears, clubs daggers, rocks and could bring down the enemy two hundred feet away a single slingshot stone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Kauna Mauna, you will relive heroic adventures of the past when you command your warriors to encircle the island, battle the enemy and invade their villages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
