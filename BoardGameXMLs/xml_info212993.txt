			<description>A Modern-Day Mythos-Inspired Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Senator Frank Gold is in the fight of his life for his coveted Senate seat in the great state of Maryland.

Racquel has lit up the contest with a fiery base of support who want change - even if she does not have quite the same level of experience as Senator Gold. But Frank is struggling under the weight of scandals - improperly filed tax returns, questions of kickbacks, and mysterious health issues - all of which he denies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
