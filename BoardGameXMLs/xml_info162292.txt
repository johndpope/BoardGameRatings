							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Draugr</name>
									
			<description>The Draugr, reanimated dead imbued with magical powers, have come to the region of Tr&amp;oslash;ndelag seeking to corrupt the town of Stj&amp;oslash;rdal. Only you, a lone revenant hunter, can protect the town and slay they who walk again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armed with limited supply of holy water and iron spikes you enter the town square and prepare for the coming onslaught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Draugr is a solitaire game playing in about 20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Win:&lt;br/&gt;You must slay 4 of the 6 Draugr. If at anytime during Phase 1 all 7 Townspeople, or more than 7 of the cards (a combination of Townspeople and Locations) are corrupted you lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the Game: &lt;br/&gt;The game is played in rounds consisting of two phases: Corruption and Hunt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 1 - Corruption&lt;br/&gt;Roll the six-sided die once to see which Draugr will hold sway over Stj&amp;oslash;rdal for the round and will corrupt Locations and Townspeople in the row they are adjacent to, matching the die face to the image on a Draugr Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll the die a second time and look at the symbol in the upper left corner of the die. Place a Corruption Marker on each card in that Draugr&amp;rsquo;s row with the matching Corruption Sigil. (See the section on the Shepherdess for protection from this rule.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a Townsperson card has been turned over you do not need to place additional Corruption Markers on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 2 - The Hunt&lt;br/&gt;You must now move your player marker up to two adjacent cards in distance (The Nunnery and Foundry are the only two cards to supersede this rule). All movement is orthogonal (horizontally and vertically).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have finished moving you may choose a Special Action of that Townsperson or Location. Some cards have only 1 Special Action, some allow for a choice between 2 Special Actions. You do not have to choose a Special Action if you do not wish to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you land on a Townsperson card that has been turned over, no Special Action can be chosen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a Special Action allows you to place Holy Water or Iron Markers on a Draugr, take one from your supply on the Town Square card and place it on a Draugr of your choice. If you match the number of markers as indicated in the upper left of the Draugr card, that Draugr is slain and removed from the game. Return all Holy Water and Iron Markers on that Draugr to your supply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a Draugr is slain and their card removed, slide one of the adjacent Draugr cards up or down so that is partially spans either 2 rows (or if 2 Draugr have been slain, 3 rows). The Draugr now holds sway over 10 (or 15) cards for rolls during the Corruption Phase. If you slay all 3 Draugr on one side, no further Draugr are moved to replace those slain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game End:&lt;br/&gt;If you are able to slay 4 of the 6 Draugr you are successful and the other Draugr are forced to flee. If at anytime during Phase 1 all the Townspeople, or more than 7 of the cards (a combination of Townspeople and Locations) are corrupted you lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
