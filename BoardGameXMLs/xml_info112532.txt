			<description>Three old men and a small child all sit around a small duck pond, tossing breadcrumbs into the water. With each ripple from a crumb, ducks race toward the new treat. (They never actually get the snack, due to the wily fish just below the surface, but it doesn't dissuade them from trying!) Passersby watch the scene for a moment, then smile, charmed by these four people idling away their time. Little do they realize that these crafty individuals actually have a standing wager: Each has chosen a color of duck in the pond as his own, and whoever can gather his ducks into a group first gets to choose the adventure for the day!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feed the ducks is a board game for two to four players. Each game lasts about 20 minutes. Players drop breadcrumbs into the pond, in order to attract the ducks. There are ducks in 4 colors. The first player to coerce all the ducks of his color into a single group wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic set includes components for a 2-player game. In order to play 3- or 4-player games you need the additional ducks and counters (red and blue).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MATERIAL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is what you need in order to play Feed the ducks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A board depicting a pond with 61 hexagonal spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 12 white ducks, 12 black ducks (plus 8 red ducks and 6 blue ducks optionally).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A breadcrumb (not included)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- One white counter, one black counter (plus one red counter and one blue counter optionally).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A carrying case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
