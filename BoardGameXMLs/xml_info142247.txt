							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lair of the Dragon</name>
									
			<description>Catalog Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you thought the TRS-80 was dead, think again. Our Lair of the Dragon MegAdventure is unlike virtually any other interactive fiction adventure that you have ever played, for it will more than just paint its pictures upon the canvas of your imagination - it will slap the sweat right onto your forehead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you truly believe that discovery is one of the finest points in life, if you would like to test your ability, if you would like to take on the largest adventure ever written in the genre of interative fiction, and if you have the guts to face that which would make any other mortal elf cringe in fear, then Lair of the Dragon is your cup of poison; for reward is a hard-earned commodity here, not given easily to the timid and the faint-hearted. If you are an old hand at adventuring, then be prepared for a worthy opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MegAdventure rips the door to adventure right off its hinges!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
