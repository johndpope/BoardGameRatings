			<description>In this all luck cricket game the pitch is represented by a  6 by 6 grid on which the fielder places his nine men. The bowler uses a spinner to determine the outcome of the bowl. If it's a hit further spins determine which square the ball lands in. Should there be a fielder in that square the batsman is out, otherwise the lower of the two numbers on the spinner is the number of runs scored. After each over the fielder can reposition his men.&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until all eleven batsmen have been dismissed. Then the other team (player) have an innings. The winner is the player who scores most runs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
