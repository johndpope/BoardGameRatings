							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Demons: The 9th Circle of Hell UNLEASHED</name>
									
			<description>A card based, role playing, kingdom building, adventure game with dice. The best of everything all under one apocalyptic roof!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A high fantasy in-depth adventure for gamers and non-gamers alike. 1-8+ players best with 2-6. Playtime: Customizable -Standard game is 60-90 minutes otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;50+ unique instances to explore, all with their own story and game dynamics. A real adventure in a box! Your adventure will include, but is not limited to: Angry Yeti&amp;rsquo;s, Fire Breathing Spider Kites (see Jorogumo, the Yokai from Japanese mythology), and a whole plethora of horribly gruesome ways to die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Takes less than 5 minutes to set up and learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlimited re-play value! The starting keeps will change your opening play style, the random instances really mix up the middle, and the demon lord changes the end goal, story, and win conditions. A high fantasy adventure that will keep you coming back for more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also including some of the most horribly interesting traditional demons from history! There&amp;rsquo;s even one that comes in riding a crocodile carrying a hawk! ...sadly the crocodile does not have laser beams on its head.. Yet. Stay tuned for the next expansion! Agares 2.0&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Semi-competitive or Cooperative. Can be played semi-competitively (Kind of like Gimli and Legolas during the Battle for Helms Deep) Or full on co-operatively.. where if your teammate is not doing well.. you should probably help them or you&amp;rsquo;re all probably going to die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's customizable. You can make it harder or easier, longer or shorter, and expand it as you see fit and even change up the rules to give the game a different feel. So stay tuned for lots of great extras. I'm even currently working on a way to extend your campaign, so after you beat back the forces of hell and save the world.. you can push through the gate into the fiery underworld and bring the fight to them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
