			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is rules-light and would require substantive GM input prior to being a fully workable implementation or setting.  Characters have Statistics (Attributes), including:  Brawn, Constitution, Deftness, Intellect, Perception, Willpower, Presence, Aesthetics, Courage, and Visage.  Statistics have scores randomly generated by D20, with a D10 rolled for bonus points to be distributed by player fiat.  Characters have Skills that are based on a particular Statistic (the rules do not specify how individual Skills are gained).  Skills are assigned a rating of A+ to E with a system for determining resolution being proposed but not developed.  Wounding causes a status (Grazed, Stunned, Knocked-Out, etc.) and an additional wound is matrixed with existing condition to determine new condition.  Combat uses a system of defense and wounding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remainder of the rules include a country-by-country listing of regions (paralleling contemporary earth) and types of armed forces, plus a fairly length timeline of events (47 BC to 1888 AD).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
