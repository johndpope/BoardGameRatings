			<description>From the Press release:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VitiVini is a fun new card game that is based on wine and how to pair it with food. We have put an entire course on wine into a fun game that does not require you to know anything about wine to have fun playing it. The game is played with Question Cards that have three questions on three difficulty levels, Fact Cards in five different categories (Grapes, Regions, Wine Making, History, and Food Pairing), six types of Wild Cards (Challenge, Confiscate, Money, Return, Skip, and Reverse), and Coins. Players take turns answering questions to earn Fact Cards and Coins that they can use towards creating a winning hand. A die is also included for players who want to randomize question selection. The game is accompanied by a brochure containing an overview on wine, the wine regions, maps, and the rules to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
