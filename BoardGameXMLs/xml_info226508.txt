							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Drega Race Book</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The very definition of brutes, the drega are massive terrors, bloated manifestations of rage personified. Their great bulk serves them well on the battlefield, which is a good thing, since they seem to get confused anywhere else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are drega. No longer held in unholy thrall to the evil Emperor Malveesh, you must now find a your own way in the world. But you'll need help. You have difficulty figuring things out on your own, and sometimes you get angry. And if others are not willing to help you make sense of the world...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will crush them all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is part of a series of rules supplements for Dravakor, a fantasy role-playing game of heavy-metal intensity, using the popular Pathfinder rules system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Book Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Complete Rules for creating and playing Drega characters: living engines of destruction and terror.&lt;br/&gt;     New feats, especially tailored for these massive creatures. &lt;br/&gt;     New Magic Items.&lt;br/&gt;     New Equipment.&lt;br/&gt;     Pre-made drega NPCs to use in your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
