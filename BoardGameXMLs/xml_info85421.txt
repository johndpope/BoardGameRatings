							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Teeth of the Ur-Lich</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tales of ancient religions come and go, and the origins of few of them are remembered, the gods themselves having been long ago forgotten. But the priest-king of Mires Ford is remembered even by those who no longer remember where Mires Ford once stood, nor what ancient and strange gods were priest-king&amp;rsquo;s master. Tales make the priest-king to be the most potent servitor of the gods in the ancient world, when Mires Ford was a lush, tropical city, instead of the ancient necropolis of the Northlands that it is now. The ancient gods of those times granted the priest-king potent abilities unlike those seen in any other follower of the gods. He took the magics of the gods and rules Mires Ford and the lands around in their name, for century upon century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the world changed about him, the priest-king became more entrenched in his ways. As the ages passed, the people about him changed in their faith, and even the gods changed their ways. The Priest-King outlived his own gods as a lich, holding desperately to his seat of power and the divine energies invested in him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But no lordship is eternal and even the Priest-King, now the Ur-Lich, fell aside, and was nearly forgotten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the great powers invested in his form by the ancient deities are still here, a last remnant of lost gods that none would otherwise remember. In the very teeth of the priest-king those powers were embedded, and those who would take the power of the gods for themselves can take these teeth and place them in their own mouths to steal their powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
