			<description>Cerebronians are here! And they are invading Earth! Well... They are invading Braintown... but eventually...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Braintown is a game for 2 to 5 players who play as cerebronians: mind controlling alliens. The cerebronians want to start their invasion and they need to choose a good leader. The best cerebronians are selected to compete in a real invasion scenario: Braintown, a little town populated by normal and weird citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player uses his or her dice to control cards by getting high values and by throwing them in the correct place over the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will have an objective. Each objective consists in eliminating some inhabitants. The first player to achieve his or her objective, wins the game and becomes the leading cerebronian!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
