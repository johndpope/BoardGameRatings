			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Waham is a sleepy farming village far off the beaten path. The village is dominated by a single tall tower. The tower has been locked for as long as anyone can remember and no one has ever been inside though many wandering adventurers have tried they have all failed. The local farmers no longer pay the old tower much notice except as a very large sun dial. The townsfolk have laid out carved stones around the open space that separates the Town from the Tower. When the tower's shadow falls onto the stones they will let anyone know what time it is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a local legend surrounding the tower. It is said that it once was home to a powerful wizard who went off to fight some world shattering evil and never returned. Some in town say that the tower is full of arcane treasure while others contend that it is full of monsters and worse. Most townsfolk give the tower a wide berth out of superstition and fear.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Instant Towns pdfs provide GMs with interesting NPCs and locations to use with or against your player group. Instant Towns can be interesting stops along the road, temporary bases from which to loot nearby ruins or side quests in between major campaign events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pdf provides a brief description of each Town including tavern, meals and costs, patrons and some rumors, town goings on, any stores, brothels or other significant places of interest in town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
