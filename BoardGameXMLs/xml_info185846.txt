			<description>From the dedication:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspirations : D&amp;amp;D, Barbarians of Lemuria, the Burning Wheel, Ryuu Tama and my very own Fantasy Heartbreaker Tranchons &amp;amp; Traquons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have three Attributes (Brawn, Wits, and Soul) that have nine points divided among them.  One Attribute must have a score of five and the other Attributes must have a score of at least one.  Several races are detailed.  Characters select a Path (Warrior, Thief, or Wizard) which determines Secondary Attributes.  Characters also have one or more Past Careers which grant secondary skills.  Resolution of actions uses multiple d12 rolls with a curious mechanic involving multiples of the same number being handled as a special case.  This added complexity causes die rolls not to conform to a standard bell distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
