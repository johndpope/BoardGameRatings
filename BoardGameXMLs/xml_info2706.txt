							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Attack of the Mutants!</name>
									
			<description>A really campy 1950s B-movie horror board game, pitting the &amp;quot;heroes&amp;quot; against the campus membership, newly mutated by a horrible nuclear accident at the nearby power station (the Big Melt-Down of 1993).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kindly old professor Applegate, his toothsome daughter Penny, her heroic but dense love interest Buck and an assortment of other stereotypes (such as the prof's robots) fight to save the world from the awful mutant thingies. Frenzied dashes down polished corridors with howling mobs of beasties in hot pursuit. A kicking and screaming Penny being carried off. Again. A desperate battle for time as the Professor prattles inanely, &amp;quot;Maybe we can reason with them&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mutants come in three flavors: normal, radio-active and leader. Map and set-up are randomized for re-playability (there are movable Wall counters). The game is played in 10 turns; victory for either side hinges on control of the Tech Room (where a gate to an unpolluted Earth-like planet has been opened, hopefully allowing the &amp;quot;normies&amp;quot; to escape the muties). Optional rules allow for hidden movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes 5-page rulebook, 25&amp;quot; x 12&amp;quot; board, 133 counters, reference card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also the title of a simplified version having the same title. Yaquinto shipped this version free with any order. The mutants, invade the college represented by 25 rooms. If the mutants reach the control room in 10 turns they win. An 11&amp;quot; x 17&amp;quot; sheet of light cardboard includes map, rules and counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
