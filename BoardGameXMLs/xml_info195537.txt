			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game have four Stats (Attributes), including Fight, Brains, Perception, and Will.  The player assigns a d4, d6, d8, and d12 to the Stats at creation time.  Characters also have three general Skills (Brawling, Lore, Sneaking) and may select three other Skills from a list.  Skills are based on a Stat.  A few other narrative traits round out character creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a heavy focus on combat and fighting, and the mechanic uses modified dice rolls and &amp;quot;bennies&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;benefit tokens&amp;quot; that may be earned and played.  Characters may also lose sanity instead of just health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
