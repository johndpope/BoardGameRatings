			<description>&amp;quot;The Bootleggers&amp;quot; 1920's &amp;amp; 30's Rules for the Prohibition Era&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Bootleggers&amp;quot; is a 40 page adventure / skirmish game for use with Steve Barber's 25mm Prohibition Wars figures. This is a game for 2 or more players with 4 to 20 figures per player. It also includes historical character listings for use in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With these rules, it is possible to design scenarios ranging from the simple to extremely complicated. Examples are provided at the manufacturer's web site for a &amp;quot;St. Valentine's Day&amp;quot; game, as well as a night ambush of a liquor shipment. It would certainly be possible to make a free-for-all with quite a few players - this would be perfect for a convention game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ground scale appears to be about 10' to the inch; the time scale is a bit more nebulous. Turns are taken one figure at a time, with initiative order determined by the roll of a d-10. A figure's turn consists of one action, typically a move or a shooting attack, but many other actions are considered by the rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game also verges on to a role playing game, with detailed rules for character generation, expenses, costs of equipment, careers, etc. It is possible to play a John Dillinger-like character as well as a Federal Agent such as Melvin Purvis. A fairly comprehensive collection of historical personages are provided pre-made to ease one's task of starting the game up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
