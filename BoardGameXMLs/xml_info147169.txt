			<description>Ko-No-Ha (The Tree's Leaves) is a wooden dexterity game themed around a tree and its leaves. The game comes with a wooden tree stand, leaf-base and 30 wooden leaves of three different shapes (fan-shaped, diamond-shaped and spade-shaped) and three colours (red, green and yellow).  Players take turns rolling a pair of special dice.  One die has the three colours on it and each color appears twice.  The other die has the following numbers on it: 1,1,1,2,2,3.  After rolling both of these dice the player must combine the number and colour.  The player must then place the total number of correspondingly coloured leaves on the leaf-base. The player can place the leaves in any fashion, so long as they do not fall from the tree-base. Once finished the player pass the dice to the next player (clock-wise order) and that person repeats the aforementioned steps.  If during the leaf placement stage any of the leaves fall off the tree the player doing the placing loses the game. All players managing to complete all leaf placement stages successfully win the game. Alternatively, if all other players fail during the leaf placement stage, the remaining player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
