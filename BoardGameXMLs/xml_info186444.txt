			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Army of Judgement is a setting and game system that envisions a post-apocalyptic America rules by a despotic Overlord.  The Overlord is resisted by the fragments of the Army of Judgement.  Characters are members of the Army of Judgement with super powers created by biological experimentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is presented in numerous major HTML pages, including: Introductory Fiction, Introduction, Soldier Creation, Rules, Advancement, Kewl Powers, World Timeline, Life of a Soldier, Phoenix Arizona, Los Angeles California, GM Advice &amp;amp; Hints, Secrets, Mundane Characters, and various notes and minor graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have attributes with two statistics--a number and a type, indicating the number of dice rolled and the type of dice rolled for that attribute, skill, or power.  The setting is fairly well developed but has inconsistent coverage.  The game rules contain much brief fiction that adds flavor and establishes a dark, gritty tone.  Some of the campaign setting is delivered in first-person, narrative form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
