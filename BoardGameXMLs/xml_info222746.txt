			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Imagine a world where all of your deepest fears have come to life, a place where monsters, terrifying creatures and deviant criminals threaten your very existence and that of the entire planet.&lt;br/&gt;You and your friends are the only ones that can stop these terrible plans... Will you succeed or will you die trying?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Arkeo Obskura a handful of heroes (from the Modern or Victorian eras or even from the early 1900s) face incredible adventures populated by zombies, witches, mummies, ghosts, the forgotten, aliens... &lt;br/&gt;The game system is easy to lean and intuitive and you don&amp;rsquo;t need a Master.&lt;br/&gt;You can play solitaire or with friends in cooperative or competitive mode. &lt;br/&gt;You will see your characters grow, buying new characteristics and equipment from one game to the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arkeo Obskura is the first release in the Survival Hees series and presents a skirmish-level Horror setting that covers forgotten cults, urban legends, ancient mythological creatures and fantastic archetypes that are the backdrop for the adventures that our Heroes will face to save themselves and to save humanity!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
