			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two board game versions of Zombie in my Pocket, go to Zombie in my Pocket for the 1-8 player Cambridge Games Factory version, and Zombie in my Pocket for the solo Print and Play version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie in my Pocket is an iPhone port of the print-and-play game solo game (see the files section on that page to download and print the PnP version). The game is quick, fun, and the modular board combined with the development cards make it a different game every time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Zombie in my Pocket, you're searching for the secret of the evil temple where you can find the item to destroy the zombies rising from the dead. You can pick up items to bash zombies along the way; a machete, golf club, chain saw, or even your former uncle's grisly femur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find the zombie totem, then bury it in the backyard graveyard before midnight and you've saved the world. Otherwise, you're zombie food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
