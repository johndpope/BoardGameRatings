			<description>&amp;quot;A funny game of crazy animal chatter.  Fun for all ages.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is basically Celebrity Head, farmyard style.  All players use plastic headstraps that are secured on the forehead with elastic and which act as card holders.  Players begin the game with a predetermined number of cards, depending on the number of participants.  These cards, each depicting an animal, are placed in the headstraps. Each turn, players are allowed three attempts to identify the front card in their headstrap; if successful the card is removed.  THE NAME OF THE ANIMAL MUST NEVER BE SAID - players are only allowed to make renditions of animal sounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to empty their headstrap of cards by making the correct animal sounds is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
