			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fan-created mission for Orpheus.&lt;br/&gt; From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MISSION TYPE: Fumigation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LOCATION: Saint Marie's Home for Orphaned Children&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, several children residing at Saint Marie's Home for Orphaned Children have committed suicide. Supposedly happy children suddenly fell into a state of deep depression for several days, and then suddenly kill themselves. No one knows why the children have been stricken with these suicidal urges, and after a drawn out police investigation, the head master of the Orphanage (Sister Anita Madeline) was referred to Orpheus Group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two Orpheus Group investigators were sent to the Orphanage for a preliminary investigation, which revealed the existence of a Hostile Post Life Entity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soon after Orpheus Group was hired, Sister Madeline has begun hearing voices in her room after lights out, telling her things she deemed *too profane to ever repeat*.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
