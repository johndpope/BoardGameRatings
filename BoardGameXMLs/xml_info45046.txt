			<description>The Blueprints product line offers you old-fashioned blue printed maps for using in your adventures and campaigns. For each map you get a blueprint version and a standard black and white version. The maps are all vector-based so you will get maximum print resolution. Despite their old fashioned appearance each map offers you a degree of customization, using the pdf technology at its best. A button (which will not be printed) on each map allows you to turn on and off the grid, eliminate the room numbers, get the walls filled, don&amp;rsquo;t show doors and furniture and many other options, depending on the kind of map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each product features a classic fantasy adventure location: a dungeon, a keep, a temple complex, a thieves guild and so on. You can use these map as reference to build your own adventures or simply take them at hand in case your players go in an unexpected direction during the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hill of the Haunting Spectre presents a detailed, scary location you can easily insert in your own campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perched atop a low, rocky hill, sits a crumbling old mansion said to be haunted by a ravenous spectre.&lt;br/&gt;During the night, strange, flickering lights can be seen from the distance and the few men who dared to approach the scary place told a tale about cold whispers they heard in the foggy air surrounding the hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A path from the old Bones Road leads to the hilltop. On the left side of the path lies an old shepherd&amp;rsquo;s house. The house is almost destroyed but the old cattle fence is still up and seems to protect a spectral herd. Within the fence you can still see the old well and a giant stump said to be the meeting place of dark druids cabals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the hilltop the mansion seems almost destroyed. Most of the building collapsed due to an obscure event in the past. Part of the mansion is still up, and even a section of the second floor is currently accessible via a creaky wooden staircase. A broken fence surrounds the whole hilltop. A huge dead tree, called the hangman Tree overlooks all, even the old windmill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the fence you can find a well, a stable, a warehouse and a small burial ground. Hidden behind thorny bushes there is a shrine consecrated to unknown deities and somewhere on the hillside there is a hidden entrance to the dungeon under the hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product expands a location found in &amp;Oslash;one's Blueprints: The Ruined Town&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
