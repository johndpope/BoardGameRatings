			<description>The Bomb is Ticking!: Your knowledge can save the city.&lt;br/&gt;A self-published game created by Burkhardt and the senior class of Schubart-Realschule, Geislingen an der Steige, Germany.  It centers abound the city of Geislingen as threatened by a bomb.  Players need to know the answers to general and city-specific questions.  With each wrong answer a figure advances forward to detonate the bomb.  Conversely, if three questions are answered correctly, the players receive one of six puzzle pieces.  When completed, the pieces combine to make a pair of scissors that can cut the fuse in time and thus save all the players and their city.  This game may be the genesis of Burkhardt's DEUTSCHLAND - Finden Sie Minden (the map game for 3-5 players published by Kosmos).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
