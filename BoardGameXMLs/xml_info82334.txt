It is available for download on the iPhone, iPod touch and the iPad on the App Store or iTunes, and has attracted many users since its release in March 2010.

Within weeks of release, We Rule was estimated to have been downloaded millions of times, with approximately two million user sessions per day. Its gameplay is in part inspired by the Zynga  game FarmVille.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We Rule requires a Wi-Fi connection to play on the iPod touch.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;We Rule&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
