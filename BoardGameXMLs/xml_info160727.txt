			<description>Harbour Bridges is a light network connection game featuring a double sided board of Sydney and Auckland Harbours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the role of city planners and build bridges to connect cycle routes between harbourside suburbs and then race the other players to get their pawns on to their target suburbs quicker than anyone else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is by collecting numbered cards, and on movement turns players play down as many cards as they want as long as the cards are the same number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
