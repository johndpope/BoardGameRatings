			<description>In Curious George A B See Game, four cards playing cards are set in front of the players.  The cards are double sided and contain either: (1) different colored letters of the alphabet or (2) different colored objects (purple zebra, green triangle, etc.).  A color and letter card are simultaneously flipped over.  The players must quickly find either a letter that is in the correct color or an object in the correct color that begins with the chosen letter.  If you are the first to identify the combination, you get the letter card.  Any player that makes a misidentification loses a card already won.  After all 26 letters have been played, the winner is the player with the most cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
