			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's so depressing to work so hard and to earn so little, but after Ashley McKinley was exposed to a wide variety of chemical fumes during a burglary at the laboratory she worked at she developed the amazing ability to split into multiple copies of herself. While these &amp;quot;echoes&amp;quot; exist, she is endowed with superhuman strength and speed. Coupled with her natural martial arts talent, she now has the means to take what she deserves as ECHO!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Injustice for All!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your heroes' neverending battle they are bound to meet a myriad of villains! INJUSTICE FOR ALL is a series of super powered villains, teams, and organizations to make sure your campaign can always bring on the bad guys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
