							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ronnie Goes to Hollywood</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this tasteful and hilarious text adventure, you play the role of Ronald Reagan. Your ultimate goal is to keep your popularity rating up by acting very much along the same lines as the aforementioned President. You have to prepare for your speeches and do your planning. You must also visit not only Ireland, New York and Geneva for talks and negotiations, but also Hollywood, and then get back to the White House in one piece, all in the space of one week. Overall, a satirical game about the White House that will award you with lots of laughs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
