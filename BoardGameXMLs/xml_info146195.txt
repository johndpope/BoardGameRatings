			<description>Lohai is a trick-taking game for 3-5 (typically 4) players that combines the strategy of games games like Spades, Hearts, or Euchre, adding some additional mechanics and replacing Aces and 10s with special cards such as the Mover (moves a taken trick to a different player) or the Taker (automatically takes the current trick regardless of the other cards played). There are cards added and some removed to keep the size a standard 52-card deck. It is played with a special deck of cards, most of which are standard playing cards in the regular suits of hearts, spades, clubs and diamonds, but printed with some additional information such as point totals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The available points vary between 50 and 450 for each round, randomly determined as printed on a card turned up before each round. The player with the most tricks and the player with the fewest tricks at the end of a round score the available points. If there is a tie for most or fewest, then no one scores the points for that position. The standard game has nine-card hands, so at least one person will always score the points. A standard game is played to 1,500 points, but players can agree to raise or lower this total as they see fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
