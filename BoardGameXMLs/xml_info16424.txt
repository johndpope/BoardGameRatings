			<description>This game is presented by the Economist and sponsored by major companies that are represented in the game, like AT&amp;amp;T, UPS and Shangri-La Hotels. It is meant to give players a flavor of how a competitive market works, while familiarizing them with economic terms and concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player represents an &amp;quot;Enterpriser&amp;quot; who begins a small business and attempts to be the first to build a financial empire. Players have to decide how and when to invest, how much to borrow, how much inventory to maintain and when to take advantage of special opportunities that may come along through contacts with other companies; all this amidst changing economic times and unpredictable events (manifested through event cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
