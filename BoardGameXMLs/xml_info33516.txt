			<description>&amp;quot;The fishing game for young and old.&amp;quot; Created by a resident of Dowagiac, Michigan (home of the Heddon lures), Fish On! is a simple game that uses spinners and cards. Players spin Spinner #1 to see if a fish is caught. If caught, then the player spins Spinner #2 to see which species (five possible) and draws a card (from Stack #1) to determine how many pounds and points the fish is worth. Final results are determined by Spinner #3 (results include throwing the fish back, landing the fish, or drawing a card from Stack #2). The game includes a board (with the spinners, two decks of dedicated cards, and a pad of score sheets. Game production and distribution was generally limited to Dowagiac.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
