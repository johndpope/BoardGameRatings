							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Minotaur&#039;s Betrayal</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After completing a daunting run through the Minotaur arena, the party has managed to earn the trust and respect of the Minotaur and made a deal that a detachment of Minotaur warriors will accompany them back to the town where a warband of orcs sits on the horizon, waiting to strike. With the Minotaur in tow, the town militia should have enough force to repel the Orcs, but only if the party arrive with the allies in time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little do the heroes know, the orc horde they intend to fight have made partnered with Minotaur traitors. One sect of the Minotaur, led by the brutish Theron, has agreed to help the orcs. They plan to steal an ancient Orcish banner from the Minotaur settlement and hand it over to the orcs. In return, the orcs will assault the Minotaur settlement, kill the current leader, and place Theron as their ruler. Meanwhile, a smaller group of Orcs will run a distraction attack upon the town in order to blind-side the minotaur and the heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the minotaur leader dead, their society and leadership in ruins, and the sacred banner stolen, do the heroes have what it takes to infiltrate the orc war-camp, retrieve the banner and return it to the safety of the minotaur?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A difficult scenario for 4th level characters.  This scenario uses resources from Volo's Guide to Monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
