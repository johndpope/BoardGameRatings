							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Civ Quest</name>
									
			<description>A Civilization type game using dice, map, and record keeping for 2-7 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A map of the Mediterranean is divided up into multiple areas (about 20 per player).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a set of units of a unique colour. There are 2 types of units, Population Tokens(PT) and City Tokens(CT). Each player starts by placing 7 PT onto one empty area on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pad and pencil is used to keep track of Idea Points, Resource Points, Victory Points, and Advances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 8 Phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Leader Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Roll once on the Great Leader Table. Dependant on result a player will receive population tokens or points (Idea, Resource, Move or Victory)&lt;br/&gt;-   The old Leader dies and a new leader is rolled for each of your turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  City Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Roll once on the City Table for each City you control. Dependant on results a player will receive a population token or a point (Idea, Resource, Move or Victory)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  Advance Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Gain 1D6 Idea Points (IP). Idea points are saved from turn to turn. &lt;br/&gt;-   A player may turn in 5 IP to gain 1 random advance.  This is determined by rolling once on a Research Table. &lt;br/&gt;-   The second advance you buy in a turn costs 7 IP, the third 9 IP and so on. &lt;br/&gt;-   Maximum IP you can store is 15. Excess is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.  Growth Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Gain 1D6 Population Tokens (PT). These may be placed in any areas a player controls. &lt;br/&gt;-   Max PT a single area can maintain is 10 (plus 1 city). Excess is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5.  Build Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Gain 1D6 Resource Points (RP). A player may spend 5 RP and discard 5 PT to build a City in any area he controls. An area may contain only 1 city. &lt;br/&gt;-   A player may spend 10 RP to gain 1 Wonder of his choice. You cannot build more Wonders than you currently have Cities. &lt;br/&gt;-   Max RP you can store is 15. Excess is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6.  Disaster Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   A player rolls 1D6. On a roll of 5+ his culture experiences a disaster. &lt;br/&gt;-   Next a player rolls 1D6 to determine how many Population Tokens he loses. These are taken from any of his areas.  A city may be broken down into 5 PT to take losses. &lt;br/&gt;-   If you have an Advance that mitigates a disaster you get -2 to the casualty roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7.  Clash Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   For each other Civ a player is adjacent to, he may choose either trade or war. &lt;br/&gt;-   If he chooses trade roll on a Trade Table to determine results&lt;br/&gt;-   If he chooses War, attacker picks 2 adjacent areas, 1 controlled by each player.  Each player rolls 2D6 and adds bonuses from War advances. &lt;br/&gt;The higher War roll total wins (Defender wins ties). Loser loses all units in the area lost. The winner gains control of the opposing Area by placing 1 PT from off the board onto the newly conquered area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8.  Migration Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Roll 1D6 to get that many Move Points (MP). &lt;br/&gt;-   A player may use 1 MP to move 1 PT to an adjacent area. Sailing and road advances allow PT to move further. &lt;br/&gt;-   Move points are not saved from turn to turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game ends when any of the following happens: All areas containing land are occupied; all wonders are built; any one player has 7 or more cities or only 1 player is left (automatic winner).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At end of game add up Victory Points from advances and Iconic Leaders, city rolls + 1 per area you occupy + 5 per Wonder built.  The player with the highest VP score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
