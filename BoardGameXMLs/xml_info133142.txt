							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Savage Wars of Peace: Rules for Gaming in the Victorian Era</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Savage Wars of Peace is a set of rules for gaming the colonial wars of the Victorian Era. This rules set provides a quick playing yet historically accurate simulation for this exciting period. These rules are primarily intended to recreate the major battles at the height of the Colonial period, 1878-1901.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a set of skirmish rules. Units are battalions or their native equivalents. After becoming familiar with the rules, players should be able to recreate some of the great battles of colonial campaigns such as Ulundi, Abu Klea, Kandahar and the relief of Peking. With a little experience, each player should be able to comfortably handle a brigade sized unit of 3,000 scale men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are primarily intended for use with 15mm scale military miniatures. 20mm and 25mm figures use a slightly different figure scale and mounting arrangement, but the time and ground scales remain the same (1 turn = 5 minutes, and 1&amp;quot; = 20 yds). The game uses both average dice and 20 sided (percentile) dice to resolve morale and combat situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expanded edition includes information and data to play the campaigns in the following colonial wars:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Indian Mutiny&lt;br/&gt;    Second Afghan War&lt;br/&gt;    Zulu War&lt;br/&gt;    Egyptian Rebellion&lt;br/&gt;    French conquest of Tonkin&lt;br/&gt;    Mahdist Uprising&lt;br/&gt;    French campaign in Dahomey&lt;br/&gt;    Reconquest of the Sudan&lt;br/&gt;    Great Pathan Revolt&lt;br/&gt;    Boer Wars&lt;br/&gt;    Boxer Rebellion&lt;br/&gt;    French conquest of Morocco&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
