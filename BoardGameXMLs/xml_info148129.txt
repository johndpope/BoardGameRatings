			<description>Going Nutz is the first release for Wynners Circle Games and is a fun family style push your luck die rolling game for 2-8 players. Players take turns trying to rack up score by rolling squirrels to collect acorns that were rolled. The squirrels are trying to store up for winter so you have to also roll a tree for a higher score. Although there are pesky eagles that are looking for dinner themselves. Don't roll eagles or they will take your squirrels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two scoring modes in Going Nutz. The basic scoring is great for a younger player or a new gamer that is just joining the hobby. There is also an advanced scoring option to score HUGE points but is a lot more difficult to obtain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Help Nutty the Squirrel get acorns and evade the eagle to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
