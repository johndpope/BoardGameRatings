			<description>Quest A Family Home Evening Game is a religious trivia game designed for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. It is designed for family members to play on &amp;quot;Family Home Evenings&amp;quot; but is also appropriate for other church gatherings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin at Earth and follow a &amp;quot;Strait and Narrow Path&amp;quot; (a phrase from Mormon scripture) to the Celestial Kingdom. Players advance by answering up to four religious questions per turn. Odd numbered questions are about faith/religious knowledge and even numbered questions are about Good Works. Each questions answered increases the number of spaces the player can move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player answers a Faith question incorrectly, his or her turn is over. If he or she answers a Good Works question incorrectly, then the pawn is moved off the Strait and Narrow Path and onto a detour, which lengthens the route to heaven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first person to make it to the Celestial Kingdom is not the winner. Also, the rules encourage helping players that are falling behind. The game ends when all players arrive, thus emphasizing that Families should work together so that everyone makes it to heaven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
