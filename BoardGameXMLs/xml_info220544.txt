			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Beacon of Hope in a Shattered World&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seeking four mysterious gates that could be the key to returning to their own world, your heroes dive into the dangerous asteroid colonies of the Shattered Zone. The polluted mines and hurtling planetoids are deadly on their own, but the infighting of the Zone's fractious factions is even more so, from the sadistic Contraptors to the fanatical soldiers of Purity, where factions and their adherents rise and fall and morality runs from gray to black. The PCs must navigate a broken world of deceit, moral compromise, and necessary sacrifices amid a grimy cybernetic dystopia, and all the while an ancient horror reaches from beyond the fourfold gates, waiting for those with the touch of destiny to come and set it free. There are secrets of the Patrons at stake, and the rewards are great, but only if the heroes can survive the deadly intrigues of the Confederates of the Shattered Zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Confederates of the Shattered Zone is an adventure for 11th to 14th level characters using the 5th Edition rules for the world's most famous roleplaying game.
