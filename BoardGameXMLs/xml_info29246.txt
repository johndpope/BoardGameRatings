							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Junior Police Five Game</name>
									
			<description>The game is tied in to a popular children's TV programme of the era, in which presenter Shaw Taylor used to ask viewers to 'keep em peeled' on the watch for stolen goods and missing cars. The box cover carries the logos of London Weekend Television and ATV, and a picture from the show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The large map represents the roads of the West End of London around which players move according to dice-rolls, choosing to walk, bus or use the tube, each of which allows different styles of movement. Each player has a number of cards in his hand representing Police Notices of stolen goods or missing cars, and the corresponding items are on cards placed face down in various locations on the board. A player passing through such a location may examine the card and if he has a matching Police Notice may take it and place it in front of him. Players may pick up further police notices by visiting police stations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all the cards have been claimed, the player who has recovered the highest value wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
