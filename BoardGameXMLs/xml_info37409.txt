			<description>Serpentine ... a 2, 3, or 4-player abstract strategy family board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of streamers with missing intersections and played with 84 tokens, in 4 colours, that are 2-sided with a straight streamer on one side and a curved streamer on the reverse.&lt;br/&gt;In turn, players place their colour tokens on these spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to form the longest possible same-colour Serpentine streamer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has 3 levels of play:&lt;br/&gt;Level 1 &amp;ndash; in turn, players place one of their tokens on an empty space - and the turn is over. When the board is full or there are no more tokens to be placed, in order to form the longest possible streamer, on their next turn, players rotate or invert one of their own tokens in place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Level 2 &amp;ndash; players place one of their tokens on an empty space. During the same turn, a player may either:&lt;br/&gt;1) Rotate or invert an opponent&amp;rsquo;s token without breaking a continuous streamer.&lt;br/&gt;2) Move one of their own colour tokens to an empty space, thereby possibly breaking their own streamer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Level 2 &amp;ndash; players take these actions in the following order:&lt;br/&gt;1) Place one of their tokens on an empty space.&lt;br/&gt;2) Move any one of the opponent&amp;rsquo;s tokens to an adjacent empty space without rotating or inverting it.&lt;br/&gt;3) Move any one of their tokens to an empty space on the board without rotating or inverting it ~ or, rotate or invert one of their own tokens in place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the longest continuous Serpentine streamer is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
