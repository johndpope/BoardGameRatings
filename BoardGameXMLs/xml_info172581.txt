							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fog &amp; Friction WWII</name>
									
			<description>In the Summer of 1944 the Allied invasion of France began, the fate of Europe now lay in the hands of military commanders. As one of those commanders, you must take control of either an Allied or Axis combined arms force and lead them to victory. Will you use cunning and deception to out-think and out-manoeuver your enemy, or rely on tanks and guns to smash through their lines with brute force? You will have to manage your resources carefully, deciding when and how to commit your forces for best effect as you fight across multiple battlefields at once. But no plan survives contact with the enemy, do you have what it takes to overcome the unpredictable Fog &amp;amp; Friction of war and prove yourself as the greatest military commander?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fog &amp;amp; Friction WWII is a tactical card game that has elements of traditional CCG/LCG games with a deck building component, mixed with the psychology and bluff of games like poker, using hundreds of beautifully designed original cards. Select your deck from a diverse range of historical forces and fight across Western Europe in a war of wits, deception and combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
