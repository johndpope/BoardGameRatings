			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rhadamanthia District Map 9: Western Karak is the first in a series of maps that expand the original Wilderlands. This 13&amp;quot; x 19&amp;quot; map details the lands directly east of the Wilderlands proper, lands dominated by the Kingdom of Karak, an empire whose history stretches back millennia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The haunted, empty wilds of the Wilderlands contrast with the teeming cities of Western Karak. Politics and vendetta cross the land between Neupokrantil, the City of the Western Prince, and the fortress-city of Baholei Zhuzhai, City of the Viceroy. Wizards, priests, and strange races from a hundred lands meet in the rich and decadent Telanghan ports of Vimanagaar, Devnagaar, and Lalatenagaar. From the great merchant city of Tiaan, City of Spices in the east gold and magic flows along the Way of the King to distant Populva, the Gateway to the Wilderlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between the ancient and decadent cities lay hundreds of thousands of square miles of wilderness, a vast land of jungle-cloaked ruins and savage tribes. The waves of history have passed over these lands time and again, and under every stone stands a ruin, over every hill stands a lost city, and in most valleys can be discovered hidden kingdoms. From the cold northern steppes of the Horse-Born Karakhans to the steamy southern jungles and hills of the Nagas; between the Silver Sea and Mystic Mountains, there is room for countless adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
