							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Apocalyptia: Basic Training</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apocalyptia: Basic Training is a quickstart rules-lite version of the Apocalyptia core system designed to introduce new players to the key concepts of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic Training is meant for simple one-shot games. The fine details of Apocalyptia have been scaled back to a bare minimum in order to get people playing as quickly as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After playing a session or two, gaming groups can make an instant transition with their Basic Training characters into the full rules set or they can incorporate the rules they need and ignore the rest as they wish. This makes Basic Training an ideal way to start a game with players who have no idea what awaits them out in the Wasteland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
