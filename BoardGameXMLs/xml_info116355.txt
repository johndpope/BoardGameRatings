			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Rules are, in the end, the tool we use to herd our less interesting brethren, and need not apply to men of action and cunning.&amp;quot; - Hank Riley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since its debut in 1979, Encounter Critical has become a beloved classic of science fiction fantasy roleplay. It may be the original universal system, allowing you to play any type of story simply by leaving out all of the other stuff you don&amp;rsquo;t want. Unfortunately, many players today do not appreciate the timeless qualities of the game system and refer to it as &amp;quot;dated&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;retro&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;is this is joke?&amp;quot;. To help expose those players to the wonderment that is the world of Vanth I have embarked upon a mission to bring the joy of Encounter Critical to a modern-day universal roleplay system Savage Worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motto of Savage Worlds is Fast! Furious! Fun! That is very applicable to Encounter Critical. What is presented in what I am calling Encounter Savage! is not intended to be a direct conversion between the two systems. You cannot convert your Klengon Half-Frankenstein PsiWitch directly into Savage Worlds, you will need to recreate that character from scratch. These rules will help you do that. However I have worked hard to apply the principles of Hank Riley and Jim Ireland's True Scientific Realism so that Encounter Savage! characters will be as much like Encounter Critical characters as possible. In some cases more so!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A copy of Encounter Critical and the Savage Worlds Explorer's Edition are required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
