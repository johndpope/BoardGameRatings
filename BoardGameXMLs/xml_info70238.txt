			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game about spending time with people you like, as well as people you are supposed to like, but do not. Four couples at sitting together at a social event, pretending everything is fine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ditch'd can be played either as a traditional larp, as a jeepform game, or - preferably - both. It was originally designed as a way to explore the strengths and weaknesses, the similarities and the differences, between the two playing styles. As a larp, it runs on the small, disturbing undercurrents of keeping up appearances, as a jeepform it plays on showing all the problems that really are present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        8 players (can be run with 7 with &amp;quot;L&amp;quot; being away)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing time:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        2x45 minutes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capsule summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        A game of conversations, with a feeling of lost opportunities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Premiered:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        RopeCon, 2009&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
