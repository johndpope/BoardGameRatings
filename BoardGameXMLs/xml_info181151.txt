			<description>Karma Crystals - Block Master - (KC01)&lt;br/&gt;Dice-To-Card Matches Get You Through Your Karma Travels!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can travel through life with good deeds or bad deeds, but karma will follow you either way. In Block Master, your best tactic is to collect that bad karma now and give it to your opponents to get the win. Use your Karma Crystal to block other players from moving through the positive karma path and win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 1st entry into the Karma Crystals game collection introduces many of the mechanics we use in all our games, including the Roll Off, Karma Crystals to share bad karma, monster elemental cards and dice matching, game end triggers and completion of the round prior to determining a win, playoffs using game win shards, and auto players. This game features the use of karma move and Block Trophy shards and FOUR monster elemental cards to start your collector&amp;rsquo;s deck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll dice to work with the various monster elemental cards - monsters are the good guys and help you win! Determine how many karma moves you score per roll and collect your karma move shards, or pass on your no-match karma to another player by attempting to block one of three possible move scores to get a blocking trophy! If you get 11 or more karma moves, that triggers the end the game and a winner is determined at the end of that round!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the unique dice matching game mechanic, a unique auto player system is also used to facilitate up to EIGHT total players per game. The game also provides an easy way to track multiple game wins for playoffs in case you have more than 15 to 20 minutes to play. No paper score cards and pencil needed - just move and block trophy shards to track and build your scores, and of course, Karma Crystal to track your block attempts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
