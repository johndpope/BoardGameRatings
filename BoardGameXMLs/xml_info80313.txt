			<description>Super R. C. Pro-Am is a video game developed by Rare and released for the Game Boy as a sequel to R.C. Pro-Am for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is a racing game involving remote control cars and utilizes an out-of-vehicle perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of the game is to win the Nintendo Championship cup. This is accomplished by spelling the word NINTENDO three times. Along the way, the player can pick up weapons and power-up items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;NINTENDO&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each track has a letter the player must drive over to receive, which is always the next letter needed of NINTENDO. For instance, if a player didn't pick up the letter &amp;quot;N&amp;quot; in Track One, the letter &amp;quot;N&amp;quot; would be on Track Two. A player is expected, although not required, to pick up a letter in each track. The first two times NINTENDO is spelled, the player is awarded a faster and better car. The third time NINTENDO is spelled, the player beats the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vehicles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three vehicles in the game that the player receives as he or she progresses through the game. Each successive vehicle has better acceleration and handling than the previous one. The player cannot choose which car to use. The AI vehicles are always the same as the player's, progressing along with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upgrades&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vehicle has three parts that can be upgraded. The battery boosts acceleration; the motor boosts speed; and the tires improve handling. Upgrades are received by driving over one of the parts on the track, and each track has a part to capture. The upgrades become active when the player starts the next race, and they do not carry over when the player receives a new vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A view of your vehicle detailing the level of part upgrades precedes every race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weapons&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have a choice of two weapons to use on the track. Bombs eject from the back of the car, while missiles shoot from the front in a straight line. The player cannot have both items at the same time and can switch by picking up their respective items on the track. Weapons can only be fired when the player has ammo, which are star-shaped items on the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Track items&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The track also consists of multiple hazards. Hazards include oil slicks, sand pits, and traffic cones. Players can also pick up roll cages, which makes the driver invulnerable to crashes and other hazards. Zippers give the car a temporary boost in speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super R.C.
